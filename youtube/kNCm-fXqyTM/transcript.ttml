<p begin="00:00:06.240" end="00:00:10.080" style="s2">and dialogue about what matters most at</p>

<p begin="00:00:10.080" end="00:00:17.920" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening now</p>

<p begin="00:00:26.560" end="00:00:30.080" style="s2">for the uninitiated these events tend to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.800" end="00:00:33.600" style="s2">deal with</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.080" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">slightly more challenging subject matter</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.600" end="00:00:38.239" style="s2">sometimes they prompt existential horror</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.079" style="s2">and sometimes they blow your mind a</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.239" end="00:00:44.160" style="s2">little bit and they make you think</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.079" end="00:00:46.000" style="s2">so consider yourself warned</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.160" end="00:00:47.600" style="s2">the structure for tonight is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.000" end="00:00:48.320" style="s2">simple in a moment i&#39;m going to hand it</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.920" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">and throughout this presentation i</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.280" end="00:00:58.399" style="s2">encourage everybody to write down any</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:00.000" style="s2">questions that come up any ways that you</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.600" end="00:01:25.360" style="s2">the last string of episodes have been</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.560" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">fairly</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.360" end="00:01:31.759" style="s2">oh first is my volume okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:34.799" style="s2">okay great um first a couple</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.759" end="00:01:35.119" style="s2">s episodes of this have been kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.799" end="00:01:37.119" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.119" end="00:01:39.360" style="s2">uh uh this one i&#39;m going to pump the</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.119" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">brakes a bit um because i&#39;m sure if</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.360" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve been following along you might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">asking yourself the question does he</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">have any morality at all</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:49.600" style="s2">um the answer is going to be answered uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:51.520" style="s2">with this presentation which is called</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.600" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">the morality machine</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.520" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">belief as a technology so the word</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">belief is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.439" style="s2">loaded everyone has their own personal</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:01.280" style="s2">definition of it and i&#39;m going to do my</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.439" end="00:02:02.000" style="s2">best to fight each and every one of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.280" end="00:02:04.560" style="s2">on it</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.079" style="s2">and uh so bear with me as i go along i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.560" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">going to attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.079" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">explain how</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">how neural networks actually work</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">without ever getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">technicality of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:19.120" style="s2">because they&#39;re pretty complicated by</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">themselves in principle they&#39;re simple</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.120" end="00:02:23.360" style="s2">but if you&#39;re not initiated to that kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">of thing is pretty daunting</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.360" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">they make a lot of assumptions and</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:29.120" style="s2">unfortunately neural networks themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">aren&#39;t following any type of</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.120" end="00:02:33.680" style="s2">systematized logical approach</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:34.800" style="s2">it&#39;s all very haphazardly discovered as</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.680" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">we go along</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.800" end="00:02:39.680" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to do my best to frame how</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:42.480" style="s2">a neural network works exclusively in</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.680" end="00:02:44.720" style="s2">philosophical terms and that should</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.480" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">hopefully be a useful bridge</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.720" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">to then explore some of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">hair trigger inclinations when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.959" style="s2">to questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:58.400" style="s2">of moral decision making</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.959" end="00:03:00.400" style="s2">um and</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.400" end="00:03:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s as best of a summary as i can</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.400" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">come up with let me share the screen and</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.000" end="00:03:07.920" style="s2">let&#39;s get started</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">oh no you have to enable screen sharing</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.920" end="00:03:10.239" style="s2">sir</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.400" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">excellent let us begin</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">cool let me get all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">situated</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.360" end="00:03:33.840" style="s2">oh that&#39;s wrong go back there we go</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.480" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">okay uh i think we&#39;re good here</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.840" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">okay uh morality machine if anybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">played chrono trigger</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:40.640" style="s2">one of my favorite games this scene blew</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">my mind when i was a kid</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.640" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">uh also i&#39;m still experimenting with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.400" style="s2">vpn sponsorship so if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:49.440" style="s2">have a crack at beating some quantum</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.400" end="00:03:50.799" style="s2">computers</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.440" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">wild apparently that&#39;s going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">thing um try these guys out you can qr</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">code this</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:04:00.720" style="s2">or there&#39;s a url here okay so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">moving on</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.720" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.239" end="00:04:08.080" style="s2">we&#39;re going to talk about categorical</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:09.280" style="s2">correspondence which is a fancy way of</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.080" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.280" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">um does this category correspond to this</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:15.439" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:17.440" style="s2">now it doesn&#39;t have to be a tight</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.439" end="00:04:20.079" style="s2">category if i was to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.440" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">shapes correspond to triangles that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.079" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">if i was to say</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">mugs of coffee correspond to cats i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:30.720" style="s2">have to work a little bit harder to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:33.360" style="s2">the correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:34.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m basically i&#39;m this is about</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.360" end="00:04:37.040" style="s2">making</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.720" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">taking a concept and figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.040" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">category that concept belongs</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.280" style="s2">in is what we&#39;re kind of always doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">with logic and trying to determine these</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.280" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">now you can do hard categorization say</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:48.400" style="s2">this thing is absolutely in this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.400" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">or you can do kind of a gaussian</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">categorization where you say this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:54.840" style="s2">about 40</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">in this category and 30 in this other</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.840" end="00:04:58.240" style="s2">category</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">and this is the kind of rash now we use</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.240" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">evaluating moral systems to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:06.160" style="s2">we always start in this typing</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">categorical process</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.160" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s made more relevant especially</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:11.520" style="s2">in a time</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:13.840" style="s2">when we have surrounded ourselves in so</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.520" end="00:05:16.240" style="s2">much technology that is all just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.840" end="00:05:19.440" style="s2">direct extension of set theory anyways</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.240" end="00:05:21.199" style="s2">so from sit you get type category and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.440" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">forth and so on</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.199" end="00:05:25.840" style="s2">so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.919" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">we have put ourselves in this position</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.320" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:35.600" style="s2">our morality is now being shaped</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.320" end="00:05:38.240" style="s2">not only by us but by our desire to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">our morality representable within</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.240" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">machines</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">we&#39;re able to do that because we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:45.120" style="s2">the internet the internet is a way where</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">we can reach out and poke one another</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.120" end="00:05:47.680" style="s2">and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:50.000" style="s2">did i poke you and get the behavior i</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.680" end="00:05:51.360" style="s2">want if the answer is no then the poking</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.000" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">will continue</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.360" end="00:05:55.680" style="s2">and as a result we just keep iterating</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">and coming up with these new ways to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.680" end="00:05:59.360" style="s2">jam our morality in these machines and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:03.520" style="s2">the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.360" end="00:06:05.440" style="s2">we&#39;re doing that right now as of 2020</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.520" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">is through neural networks so i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.440" end="00:06:10.400" style="s2">to walk you through it real quick</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:12.160" style="s2">and if you know how this stuff works</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.400" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">please bear with me i&#39;m doing my best to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.160" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">bridge it in philosophical terms</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:18.639" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say i have a brightness</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:21.680" style="s2">sensor</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.639" end="00:06:24.639" style="s2">it&#39;s uh you&#39;ve all seen these things</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.680" end="00:06:26.160" style="s2">they you you walk near a garage and it</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.639" end="00:06:26.800" style="s2">kicks on a light because of a motion</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.160" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">sensor</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.800" end="00:06:30.160" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of a brightness</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:31.360" style="s2">sensor or an ir sensor or anything along</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.160" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">those lines so there&#39;s something out</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.360" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:37.199" style="s2">reading light or heat or something and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">as it&#39;s exposed to that heat it then</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.199" end="00:06:40.639" style="s2">represents the intensity in a numeric</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:44.000" style="s2">form it could say</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.639" end="00:06:45.280" style="s2">uh well it&#39;s about let&#39;s say that 256 is</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.000" end="00:06:47.520" style="s2">as bright as it can handle</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.280" end="00:06:48.319" style="s2">and zero is as dark as i can right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.520" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">everything in between</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.319" end="00:06:53.440" style="s2">is a gradient of brightness right from</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">zero which is absolute dark to 256 which</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.440" end="00:06:58.160" style="s2">is absolute brightness right</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:58.880" style="s2">so in this case i have a set of these</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.160" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.880" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">this is the brightness that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:02.639" style="s2">brightness sensor just happened to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.400" style="s2">in some</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.639" end="00:07:06.880" style="s2">random sample of time that i just picked</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.400" end="00:07:10.000" style="s2">for convenience okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.880" end="00:07:11.120" style="s2">so what i&#39;m doing is each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.000" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">lines</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.120" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">will carry what&#39;s called a weight</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">meaning i&#39;m going to say hey 256 to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:22.400" style="s2">dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">quite for um for the assessment of how</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.400" end="00:07:26.319" style="s2">dark 256 is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.120" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a weight here that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.319" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">explains</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.120" end="00:07:31.759" style="s2">exactly what that means so 256 remember</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">that&#39;s as bright as it gets</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.759" end="00:07:35.680" style="s2">to the dark categorizer it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:38.160" style="s2">say that&#39;s zero dark</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.680" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">because this is braze against now if i</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.160" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">if i sent</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">0 to the dark categorizer that would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">100</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.560" style="s2">dark right so each one of these lines</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">carries the bias</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.560" end="00:07:50.240" style="s2">that the categorizer uses to make the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">evaluation</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.240" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">so if i sent it uh 128 which is half of</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">256 i send it to the bright categorizer</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">it says that&#39;s 50 bright and if i send</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">it to dark it&#39;s also going to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:03.360" style="s2">50</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.479" style="s2">dark so that&#39;s pretty straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.360" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">right so i say</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.479" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">64 in this case i send it to bright that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">should be around if i can do my math</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">right that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:15.919" style="s2">75 no it&#39;s 25 bright and 75</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:18.720" style="s2">dark right so it&#39;s pretty simple it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.919" end="00:08:21.039" style="s2">just a formal way of representing</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.720" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">um the weight and what comes out of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.039" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">so what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">these events these brightness events and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:30.160" style="s2">we&#39;re encoding the value</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:32.159" style="s2">wow that&#39;s a terrible place to put that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.160" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">uh we&#39;re encoding the value</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.159" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">as a category basically that&#39;s all we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:36.800" style="s2">doing here right so if you see these</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:38.000" style="s2">graphs</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.800" end="00:08:40.560" style="s2">you now know what these graphs are</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.000" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">actually now i&#39;m not going to get into</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.560" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">hidden layers because i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">chase anyone out in fact i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">save that for last so just</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">pump your brakes a bit right so just to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">walk us through um</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">this is my training i&#39;m training my</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">categorizers to understand this stuff so</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">that when</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:59.200" style="s2">i hit it with a value it&#39;s never seen</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">before in this case 76 because i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.200" end="00:09:01.920" style="s2">start with 76.</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:03.360" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen is i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.920" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">run it through this network and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.360" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">tell me that it&#39;s 29 bright the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:10.160" style="s2">categorizer will tell me that in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:13.360" style="s2">dark it&#39;ll tell me the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">so pretty straightforward kind of as</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.360" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">best as i can put it so we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">categorical assessment of a new event</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">this new</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">76 is a new event that&#39;s a new</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">brightness hasn&#39;t been there before</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">the machine uh the categorizers are able</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s this bright or it&#39;s this dark right</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:32.959" style="s2">pretty straightforward so let&#39;s switch</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:35.519" style="s2">it up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.959" end="00:09:38.240" style="s2">let&#39;s make it about morality instead of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.519" end="00:09:40.160" style="s2">light and dark let&#39;s do good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.240" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">now we&#39;re going to open up all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.160" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">problems because i just said the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">magic words that make this a big problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:48.000" style="s2">what is evil what is good well that</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">depends upon what behavior are you</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.000" end="00:09:51.600" style="s2">are you quantifying as morality you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s the value here are you</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.600" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">256 what 256 dollars you donated</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:10:00.240" style="s2">is it 256 times you hugged your kid what</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">what is this value representing here</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.240" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">so we can have infinite questions about</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">what these numbers should be these</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:08.320" style="s2">things will work</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt about that if i if</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.320" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">these things will absolutely categorize</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:12.320" style="s2">whatever the hell i</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">train it so now we got to step back and</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.320" end="00:10:15.279" style="s2">say what are we what are you</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:18.079" style="s2">categorizing here really</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.279" end="00:10:18.480" style="s2">i mean is can you even do this type of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.079" end="00:10:20.959" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.480" end="00:10:21.760" style="s2">so that&#39;s like red flag number one</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.959" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.760" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">behavior as quantified morality who</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:28.480" style="s2">who&#39;s labeling these values right who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.480" style="s2">coming up with these numbers</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.480" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">and who&#39;s actually able to like agree to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.480" end="00:10:36.240" style="s2">those numbers and comport to them right</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">so the problems are starting to amass</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.240" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">from the junk</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.480" style="s2">if i give it 76 using the same exact</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">model from the previous slide</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.480" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">then 76 is 29 good</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">so whatever people say well it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">about good and evil it&#39;s the gray area</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:51.519" style="s2">in between</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">congratulations i&#39;ve given that gray</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.519" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">area a number</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s now 29 you are 29 good i can now</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:11:02.079" style="s2">measure your greatness right</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:03.440" style="s2">so now our morality is starting to um</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.079" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">it&#39;s starting to turn into an</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.440" end="00:11:06.399" style="s2">interesting thought experiment before</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">morality was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.399" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">measure of man&#39;s inaction or man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:13.200" style="s2">action with</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">itself and other people and the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.200" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">and the universe and being in reason and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">trying to formulate all that stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">i&#39;m this is how machines seem this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:23.200" style="s2">how ai will</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:24.640" style="s2">take these deep problems that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.200" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">enamored ourselves with</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.640" end="00:11:27.680" style="s2">and it will spit it out into these</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:29.279" style="s2">distributions these percentage</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">distributions</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.279" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it&#39;s currently doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">right now regarding how</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">how much hate speech exists in a in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:40.240" style="s2">post</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:43.680" style="s2">how much uh how offensive a meme is</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">piece of web content uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.959" end="00:11:51.120" style="s2">uh of um you know the basic stuff uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">offensive and stuff like that right</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.120" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">so that may sound good and that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">they sell it they&#39;re eliminating h</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:00.079" style="s2">speech and that kind of thing but</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">this is what it looks like i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.079" end="00:12:03.279" style="s2">is what it actually looks like at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">mathematical scale</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.279" end="00:12:06.320" style="s2">which is again we know the problems of</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:09.360" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.320" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">quantify morality as behavior values if</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.360" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">the problems don&#39;t go away</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">when we extend and we we go further it</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:17.200" style="s2">gets worse</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">in fact um so</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.200" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">what i&#39;ve tapped into is this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">unending holy war about</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:26.800" style="s2">not only the quantification of of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">moral behavior you&#39;re trying to measure</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.800" end="00:12:31.360" style="s2">now we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">categorization errors that 76 is 29</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.360" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">good well turns out the fan club of 76</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:38.959" style="s2">they&#39;re really pissed about that rating</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:40.320" style="s2">they know that they&#39;re better than 29</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.959" end="00:12:42.320" style="s2">in fact they have the historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.320" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">evidence they can say god damn it we are</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.320" end="00:12:45.760" style="s2">not 29</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">good we are at least 80 so now you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.760" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">these holy wars about the outcomes of</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:51.360" style="s2">these things to begin with because your</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">priors were all wrong your values were</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.360" end="00:12:55.600" style="s2">then here they come oh i got a million</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">litany of reasons as to why this value</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.600" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">is bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna yell at you all day</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:01.360" style="s2">and oh by the way they also have</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:03.200" style="s2">unaccountable influence in silicon</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.360" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">valley so they can ban you from paypal</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.200" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">and stripe and</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:10.160" style="s2">your life basically so</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">these people are very upset and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.160" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">the stereotype i&#39;m throwing her out</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:13.920" style="s2">there because the internet&#39;s a lovely</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">place</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.920" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">um they&#39;re very upset about this it&#39;s 29</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">right this is bad</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:21.200" style="s2">they they are not happy with that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">numbers in fact it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.200" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">there&#39;s systemic reasons and</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:27.200" style="s2">socioeconomic conditions and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">they just keep throwing just books and</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.200" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">books of</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:31.600" style="s2">perverted sociology at you until you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">just say fine i&#39;ll change a</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.600" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">number right</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">so how do i change a number i have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">calculate the loss</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:40.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a math term and i apologize but i</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:43.360" style="s2">have to calculate the loss</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.800" end="00:13:45.279" style="s2">or more correctly in philosophical terms</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:47.519" style="s2">the categorization error</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.279" end="00:13:48.720" style="s2">meaning that 20 that 76 was not supposed</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.519" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">to be 29</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.720" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">because this person&#39;s real pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">and they put a gun to my head so i</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">better make it 80</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.800" style="s2">so how do i do that well i got to take</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:58.000" style="s2">the 29 percent that is that it&#39;s done i</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:13:59.440" style="s2">got to run this creature through it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.000" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">then i can calculate my loss</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">so i got my loss and now i have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">reapply it back</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">to my categorization methodology</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:11.120" style="s2">so that looks like this i take my loss</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:12.639" style="s2">and i start affecting my weights</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.120" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">remember these are the weights these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.639" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">the things that inform the</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">categorization</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">they say yes okay 256 means this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">and evil in 256 means this and good but</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.639" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">the person who put the gun to our heads</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:28.160" style="s2">says uh that&#39;s that&#39;s mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:31.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re calling these things racist</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">and these things aren&#39;t racist</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.360" end="00:14:35.360" style="s2">this this is the problem right here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">not these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.360" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">these things are just doing whatever you</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">train them to do it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:41.360" style="s2">calculating the losses the problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:42.720" style="s2">not even the weights or the biases that</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.360" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">are the problem it&#39;s actually this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.720" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">insane idea that you can quantify</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">morality</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:49.040" style="s2">that&#39;s where the problem is but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">care we don&#39;t want to do that we suck</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.040" end="00:14:52.000" style="s2">way too many billions of dollars in</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:53.360" style="s2">these machines and god damn it i want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.000" end="00:14:55.760" style="s2">return on investment so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.360" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">tweak the loss instead</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.760" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to take that loss and</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:00.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to apply it to all of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">weights</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.240" end="00:15:06.000" style="s2">and now suddenly 76 is 80 good but we</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.199" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">did we did it we hacked the numbers</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.000" end="00:15:09.360" style="s2">right right we uh we represented the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">exception</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.360" end="00:15:12.959" style="s2">in our moral framework and we&#39;ve baked</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">it in the machine so when the machine</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.959" end="00:15:17.040" style="s2">sees the 76 again it will make the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:18.560" style="s2">appropriate categorization which means</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.040" end="00:15:20.480" style="s2">the gun that&#39;s against our head</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.560" end="00:15:22.320" style="s2">will back off slowly right so we did it</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:24.000" style="s2">right we&#39;re not making moral assessments</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.320" end="00:15:25.440" style="s2">anymore we&#39;re compensating for people</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.000" end="00:15:26.800" style="s2">with power</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.440" end="00:15:29.199" style="s2">well now we&#39;re no longer talking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.800" end="00:15:31.120" style="s2">morality we did it right we have now</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.199" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">jumped the shark we don&#39;t want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.120" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">we we don&#39;t want to catch ourselves jump</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">in the shark because that gun can come</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:36.240" style="s2">back any time you know you can come in</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:38.839" style="s2">your birthday</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.240" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">tuesday you don&#39;t want that right</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.839" end="00:15:43.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:46.480" style="s2">ah damn it it&#39;s not good enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.600" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">eighty percent wasn&#39;t good enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.480" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">she puts it higher she was at ninety</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:50.320" style="s2">percent it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:52.480" style="s2">she has a million more reasons now why</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.320" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">that&#39;s like oh god now we gotta do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.480" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:56.720" style="s2">oh okay fine all right we&#39;ll just apply</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">the laws again all right we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.720" end="00:15:58.800" style="s2">do this</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">it&#39;s not the end of the world we know</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.800" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">how to do this we&#39;re going to do it</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re going to take the law</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:04.399" style="s2">since something&#39;s interfering with</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:07.199" style="s2">humanist progress and it&#39;s up to us</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">this is our holy crusade to do this we</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.199" end="00:16:09.279" style="s2">got this people we got this we know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">to do this</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.279" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">so we take the loss because we know how</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">to take the loss and we know how to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">apply it</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:17.040" style="s2">to the next iteration each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.079" style="s2">is it&#39;s like an iteration of every time</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.040" end="00:16:20.160" style="s2">i apply the loss</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.079" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">i&#39;m applying the loss to change weights</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.160" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">so the categories are better</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:25.440" style="s2">so let&#39;s do it again and we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">keep on doing it we&#39;re going to keep on</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.440" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">doing it so we get that number we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:29.759" style="s2">looking for we&#39;re going to just</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:30.720" style="s2">we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to hack this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.759" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">damn thing we&#39;re going to get that</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:34.720" style="s2">number</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:36.959" style="s2">and we got this we we got this we know</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.720" end="00:16:38.560" style="s2">we got this</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.959" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">wait hold on what do you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.560" end="00:16:42.720" style="s2">percentage change zero</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:44.480" style="s2">zero zero one hold up whoa whoa whoa</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.720" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">whoa oh gosh she&#39;s back</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.480" end="00:16:48.560" style="s2">oh no like what are we going to do about</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">this i i changed the numbers i did the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.560" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:53.279" style="s2">i did the thing i i made the loss like</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.120" style="s2">what the hell what did i do wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.279" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">what is going on here well now in</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.120" end="00:16:57.680" style="s2">addition to compensating for someone</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:16:59.279" style="s2">with a gun</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.680" end="00:17:00.720" style="s2">uh we are now fighting the machine</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.279" end="00:17:02.160" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.720" end="00:17:04.160" style="s2">so now we&#39;re not even talking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.160" end="00:17:04.880" style="s2">morality anymore that&#39;s just how we gave</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.160" end="00:17:06.480" style="s2">that up</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.880" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">like two slides ago right now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.480" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">talking about now we gotta fight the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">okay so now i promise to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:14.400" style="s2">technical away</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:16.160" style="s2">i have to delve into this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.400" end="00:17:17.679" style="s2">uh just</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.160" end="00:17:19.919" style="s2">this is the time to write questions if</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.679" end="00:17:21.600" style="s2">you have them so</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.919" end="00:17:23.760" style="s2">what&#39;s going on here well i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.600" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">showing you the categorizers as like the</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.760" end="00:17:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s like the end of the neural</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:30.000" style="s2">network there&#39;s actually these things</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.000" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">called hidden layers in between them</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.000" end="00:17:33.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t want to get into them because i</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:34.320" style="s2">think the name itself is confusing for</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.120" end="00:17:35.360" style="s2">people who don&#39;t know it so what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.320" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">going to do is i&#39;m going to represent</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.360" end="00:17:40.320" style="s2">those hidden layers as</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">feature detectors so um think of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.320" end="00:17:43.120" style="s2">feature as</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.679" end="00:17:47.840" style="s2">uh think of a feature as</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.000" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">if there if there are categories for</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.679" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">good and evil then a feature would be a</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">subset of properties</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.360" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">for what is good and what is bad and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:59.039" style="s2">that&#39;s just that&#39;s just the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.799" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">definition that&#39;s the best i got right</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.039" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">um okay so we&#39;re going to go through</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">these features</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">about the the categorical the means in</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">which the categorical</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">the categorical correspondence is</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">evaluated that&#39;s what these futures are</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:12.480" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:13.919" style="s2">so for example we&#39;re going to pump our</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.480" end="00:18:14.720" style="s2">numbers in and the neural network has</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.919" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">come up with</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.720" end="00:18:19.039" style="s2">four a layer made of four nodes and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:22.240" style="s2">just turns out</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.039" end="00:18:24.720" style="s2">that they happen to represent</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.240" end="00:18:26.559" style="s2">these kind of things i&#39;m just throwing</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.720" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">names on there just for now just for</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.559" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">labeling and comprehension reasons</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:31.679" style="s2">you&#39;ll never get labels in an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:34.240" style="s2">network by the way you can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.679" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">examine this stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.240" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">so like maybe maybe nervousness is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">part of morality or emotional sentiment</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:42.039" style="s2">averaging or</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">some weird pattern some some</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.039" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">correlation mechanism right and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">that passes to the next layer</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:52.320" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to say you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:54.400" style="s2">this layer is looking for these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.320" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">and then it passes to the next layer and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.400" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s looking for these things and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:18:58.799" style="s2">when it goes through this whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">that&#39;s how it makes its actual</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">categorization</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:04.559" style="s2">so you start with your 256 it&#39;s jump in</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:06.880" style="s2">here it&#39;s it&#39;s giving you the it</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.559" end="00:19:08.400" style="s2">jumps here does the product to here the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.880" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">product to here and then</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.400" end="00:19:11.760" style="s2">you get your evaluations and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:13.280" style="s2">like i said these are just placeholders</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.760" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">to convey a concept</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.280" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">uh if you want to look into how hidden</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">layers actually work feel free</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:22.720" style="s2">there are way better resources out there</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">than i&#39;m currently providing but this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.720" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">just to demonstrate again our problem is</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">that the person has the gun to our head</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">and we weren&#39;t able to change percentage</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">and we got to change the percentage or</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:31.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to shoot us</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">so what the hell right so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.840" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:37.120" style="s2">oh now she&#39;s back and now she&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:39.039" style="s2">in the layers and she&#39;s saying well this</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.120" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t represent all of reality</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.039" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t represent all the moral</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:43.039" style="s2">things that we could have infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2">more layers</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.039" end="00:19:46.640" style="s2">we could have layers for i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:48.400" style="s2">how many giraffes did you lick</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.640" end="00:19:49.520" style="s2">last week like that&#39;s a moral thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.400" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">right we could throw that in there i</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.520" end="00:19:53.200" style="s2">mean we may have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.080" style="s2">she has a gun what are we going to do so</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.200" end="00:19:55.919" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.080" end="00:19:57.600" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to the problem i try to tell</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.919" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">her i say we can&#39;t add more layers</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.600" end="00:20:01.039" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually the problem it</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.960" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">won&#39;t do anything she doesn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.039" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t understand it she just wants</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">the moral victory she wants the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">political victory right</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:09.919" style="s2">so the reason why adding more layers</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.919" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">it&#39;s because a thing called vanishing</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:16.880" style="s2">gradients vanishing gradients are a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:18.880" style="s2">if you remember the last talk where i</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.880" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">focused on infinitesimals</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.880" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">infinitesimals are back and they are</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:25.039" style="s2">causing problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">so we calculate our laws</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.039" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">uh which we&#39;ve done uh just just as we</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:31.840" style="s2">do because we&#39;re trying to correct</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">and then what happens is the losses say</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.840" end="00:20:34.159" style="s2">losses happen to be like 0.1 for</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.159" end="00:20:38.400" style="s2">so we apply it backwards we propagate it</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">backwards into these weights</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.400" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">to change it so that when this spits out</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">values we say</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.919" style="s2">well your values need to be modified a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">bit and so we can get better results</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.919" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">here but in the process of doing so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:54.559" style="s2">it may then apply</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">a little bit less to the layer behind it</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.559" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">and now</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">this one spits out evaluations we modify</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.360" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">that and it puts it in here</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">then this modification might happen the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:06.159" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:10.080" style="s2">this happens you&#39;re you&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.159" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s over because this change is so tiny</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.080" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">it&#39;s so infinitesimally vanishing</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">that any change here or here or here or</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:20.880" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:22.799" style="s2">because the change here is so small</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.880" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">when it propagates through you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.799" end="00:21:26.000" style="s2">to be stuck with the same value over and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">over again</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.000" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">because you have to do heavy changes</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:31.360" style="s2">here in order to get this network to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">its categorization properly</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.360" end="00:21:36.000" style="s2">if the if the if the loss compensation</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">goes here and it&#39;s so tiny</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:40.000" style="s2">then nothing you do can ever matter no</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:41.760" style="s2">amount of layers you add no amount of</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.000" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">nodes you add could ever change the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.760" end="00:21:45.679" style="s2">outcome of your good evil analysis</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:47.600" style="s2">so this is what i said this is what i</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.679" end="00:21:49.120" style="s2">mean when you&#39;re fighting the machine</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.600" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">you&#39;re fighting just the way that this</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.120" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">whole thing is structured</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">um and if this happens you get the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">vanishing gradient</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s why she&#39;s mad she&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:21:59.520" style="s2">upset she doesn&#39;t understand the vanish</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.240" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">ingredient she just wants some moral</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.520" end="00:22:02.320" style="s2">victory so i try to sit her down and say</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.039" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">hey to vanishing gradient</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.320" end="00:22:05.360" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t care she puts two guns in my</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">head because goddammit now she really</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.360" end="00:22:07.600" style="s2">needs the answer</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:08.880" style="s2">i was like okay all right i&#39;m fine fine</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.600" end="00:22:09.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll hack it i will come up with some</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.880" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">crazy hack</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.520" end="00:22:12.720" style="s2">we can make this work we&#39;ll make this</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.600" end="00:22:15.200" style="s2">work i swear to god just</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.720" end="00:22:16.720" style="s2">just i i give it one more time i say</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.200" end="00:22:18.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.720" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">i&#39;m just saying it became prematurely</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.159" end="00:22:20.960" style="s2">incandescent you change the weights</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:22.640" style="s2">between the wear</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.960" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">the the layers and it has no effect so</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">adding more like i tell her all this</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:28.400" style="s2">fine it i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll just hack it</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:29.919" style="s2">right i&#39;ll come up with a deep belief</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.400" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">network right so i&#39;m going to use a deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.919" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">belief network to solve this problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:35.600" style="s2">because i just i just get the guns out</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">of here</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.600" end="00:22:38.640" style="s2">so the same setup but instead what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.640" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">instead of calculating the loss and</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">applying it in individually in sequence</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">backwards</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">what i&#39;m going to do is i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:49.120" style="s2">okay well let me let me change how these</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">are processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.120" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">these are called restricted boltzmann</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">machines</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">and what that&#39;s a fancy way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">the inputs here lead to a certain output</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">here but it can also reconstruct the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:05.200" style="s2">output to regenerate the input</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">so what this means is instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.200" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">doubly passing things along</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:10.559" style="s2">what this will do is it will come it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">will basically</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.559" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">process the inputs in a way</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:19.280" style="s2">that is locally relevant to itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:20.080" style="s2">so it&#39;s not sitting here waiting for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.280" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.080" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">activity it&#39;s able to come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:27.760" style="s2">equilibrium within itself and this is</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">true for each layer and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.760" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:32.240" style="s2">is because when we calculate our loss we</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.360" end="00:23:35.200" style="s2">then do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.240" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">fine-tune it everywhere at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.200" end="00:23:38.080" style="s2">not backwards in the sense where it hits</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">here then it hits here and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.080" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">here we can actually fine tune the loss</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:44.400" style="s2">completely differently and so by doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">it this way</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.400" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">you end up in a very unique position</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">where you can add more layers freely</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:52.640" style="s2">and you don&#39;t ever hit that problem with</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">the vanishing gradient</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.640" end="00:23:56.400" style="s2">just completely eliminated so you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">fine-tune each one of these layers who</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.400" end="00:23:58.000" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:00.720" style="s2">taking the responsibility of</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:03.279" style="s2">categorizing the inputs themselves</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.720" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">now this solution is useful but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.279" end="00:24:08.080" style="s2">also incredibly difficult to train</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">even in this example you&#39;ll see the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.080" end="00:24:13.279" style="s2">problems you&#39;ll say well</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:14.400" style="s2">um this is probably a good tribal way of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.279" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">looking at the problem and then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.400" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">religious people over here have a way</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">and then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">humanists have a way and how do i</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:21.279" style="s2">synchronize all these people</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">well that&#39;s exactly the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.279" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">you&#39;ll have here if you try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:26.720" style="s2">if you think of this in a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:29.520" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.720" end="00:24:30.960" style="s2">um so it&#39;s it&#39;s this is a solution to</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.520" end="00:24:32.320" style="s2">the vanishing gradient but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.960" end="00:24:34.240" style="s2">incredibly difficult to implement</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.320" end="00:24:37.279" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.240" end="00:24:39.039" style="s2">um yeah so to escape the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.279" end="00:24:40.559" style="s2">the decimals first layers oh and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.039" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">there&#39;s the other trick where</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.559" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">you uh you have known weights to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:46.000" style="s2">works so at the very first layer you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:47.600" style="s2">taking a successful model that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.000" end="00:24:49.200" style="s2">was that was processed somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.600" end="00:24:50.880" style="s2">and bolting on right at the beginning as</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.200" end="00:24:53.279" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.880" end="00:24:55.279" style="s2">so you might remember we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.279" end="00:24:56.960" style="s2">about morality at some point</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.279" end="00:24:58.720" style="s2">and now we&#39;re not now we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.960" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">about hacking a machine to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.720" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">get more i mean we we&#39;ve we&#39;re off the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:04.080" style="s2">reservation at this point</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:06.720" style="s2">but we&#39;re not going to stop because</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.080" end="00:25:08.000" style="s2">there&#39;s too much money in it god damn it</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.720" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">and you&#39;re probably confused right you</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.000" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">started out with i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">calculate moral behavior right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">all i want to do that can&#39;t be that damn</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">hard well it turns out it is um</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">because now you&#39;re fighting the limits</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:18.080" style="s2">of the machine so calculating morality</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:20.960" style="s2">is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.080" end="00:25:22.640" style="s2">remarkably difficult task and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.960" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">still hell-bent on doing it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.640" end="00:25:27.039" style="s2">of course well she knows the answer of</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">course we&#39;ll just add more layers</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.039" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">put her in charge and they&#39;ll just tweak</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:33.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:35.039" style="s2">the the biases all day long and just</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.120" end="00:25:36.960" style="s2">don&#39;t question anything it&#39;ll be fine</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.039" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">obviously duh they&#39;re all conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.960" end="00:25:43.360" style="s2">theorists if you disagree</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">um but that&#39;s just not it this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.360" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">you&#39;re up against problems that involve</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.679" end="00:25:48.960" style="s2">energy economics that&#39;s really what</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:51.679" style="s2">you&#39;re fighting against</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.960" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">because even if you add more layers it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.679" end="00:25:53.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean more</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:55.440" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.840" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">and adding more data doesn&#39;t mean better</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.440" end="00:26:00.240" style="s2">results either because</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:02.480" style="s2">each one of these is a calculation</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.240" end="00:26:03.279" style="s2">it takes energy to calculate these</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.480" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.279" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">this is expensive stuff i mean you may</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:11.440" style="s2">have seen the uh the video</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.080" style="s2">mario to go through the first level of</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.480" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">mario brothers right</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.080" end="00:26:26.720" style="s2">that cost ten thousand dollars to train</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">yeah yeah ten thousand right i can sit</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.720" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">my like a child in front of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">and feed it like a two dollar sandwich</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">and that child&#39;s gonna beat mario</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">brothers right</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a the nerds have said ten</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">thousand dollars is an acceptable cost</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">to do this and we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">question our a priori</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:46.960" style="s2">uh uh concepts we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">question our approach to this thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.960" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">we&#39;re just going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">bolt on more layers man we&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:52.640" style="s2">we&#39;re just going to keep doing it we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:55.279" style="s2">going to scale horizontally and just</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.640" end="00:26:58.480" style="s2">make more gpus everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.279" end="00:27:00.480" style="s2">and you can&#39;t that doesn&#39;t make things</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.480" end="00:27:02.480" style="s2">more intelligent we&#39;ve seen how</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.480" end="00:27:06.640" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen how it doesn&#39;t work right we</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.480" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">look at this right that&#39;s a mess</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.640" end="00:27:12.400" style="s2">so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:13.919" style="s2">taking this naive approach maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.400" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">important to take the person with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:17.600" style="s2">gun and get them out of the equation</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:19.120" style="s2">let&#39;s get that person out of there right</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.600" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">because that person is</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.120" end="00:27:22.720" style="s2">skewing the results they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:25.679" style="s2">selecting for</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.720" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">criteria that is incorrect um they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.679" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">biasing the research</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.880" end="00:27:30.399" style="s2">tremendously in their moral crusade just</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:31.919" style="s2">get them out of here</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.399" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">just get rid of them because</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.919" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">they&#39;re interfering with actual progress</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:39.200" style="s2">at this point um and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">that that balance line right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.200" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">dollar sign that&#39;s that&#39;s the hard limit</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.559" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">we&#39;re up against</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:46.799" style="s2">so there is one technique and this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">actually patented by google</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.799" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">so they actually did one thing right for</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:54.000" style="s2">once this is called dropout</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:55.200" style="s2">and dropout is a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.000" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">technique</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.200" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">because they&#39;ve accidentally made</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">a neural network perform the equivalence</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.799" style="s2">of belief</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.799" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know it yet so</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.799" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">what is dropout well we&#39;ve seen how all</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:13.840" style="s2">this stuff works how each one of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:15.279" style="s2">lines is a weight and a bias</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.840" end="00:28:17.120" style="s2">and that determines how this thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.279" end="00:28:19.039" style="s2">categorizes which then is a weight and a</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.120" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">bias and categorizes and we end up with</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.039" end="00:28:24.559" style="s2">our good evil</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">distribution percentage um</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.559" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">what if i knock one out</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:34.799" style="s2">what if i knock two out what if i knock</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">that one out</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.799" end="00:28:38.640" style="s2">so knockout is uh there there are</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:39.120" style="s2">different rhythms to knock out you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.640" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">either</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.120" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">uh remove the node at random or at set</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">intervals or under different conditions</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">or whichever</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:50.480" style="s2">so what this does this actually defeats</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:51.520" style="s2">a very serious problem in your moral</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.480" end="00:28:54.720" style="s2">assessments</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.520" end="00:28:56.399" style="s2">where you may say well 256</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.720" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">has a pretty good non-violence rating</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.399" end="00:28:59.760" style="s2">but according to hindus it does this</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.440" style="s2">thing in population</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.760" end="00:29:03.600" style="s2">if you go back a couple steps before the</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.440" end="00:29:05.919" style="s2">knockouts and you say okay well</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.600" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">it turns out that these two things end</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.919" end="00:29:11.039" style="s2">up being related somehow</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">so the inc so it is very feasible you</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.039" end="00:29:14.159" style="s2">end up in a scenario where</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">the christian ranking and the islamic</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.159" end="00:29:18.399" style="s2">ranking end up directly influencing one</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:20.000" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.399" end="00:29:21.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a result you won because</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.000" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">now you&#39;re not getting a</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.600" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2">good representation of either one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">these things you actually want these</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.520" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">two things to operate independently so</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">that you can get a proper assessment of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:34.000" style="s2">but if they end up in a scenario just</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">because of how the training worked or</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.000" end="00:29:37.440" style="s2">the value that dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:39.039" style="s2">they will end up sometimes in a scenario</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.440" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">where one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.039" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">ability to process will have an</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:44.000" style="s2">interlocking</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.399" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">ability to interfere with this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.000" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">processing as well so what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:49.520" style="s2">knock them out</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:51.600" style="s2">by knocking them out the neural network</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.520" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">or the categorizational process i should</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.600" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">uh what it will do is it will find</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:59.520" style="s2">paths around to actually go through and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:00.480" style="s2">say okay well i don&#39;t need that</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.520" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">dependency i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.480" end="00:30:04.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll redo it this way and so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">able to do is you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.000" end="00:30:07.679" style="s2">curate these these hidden layers in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.679" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">to where it is your um you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">eliminating path dependency which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">another way of saying um</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:20.480" style="s2">uh um</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:22.000" style="s2">correlating correlating values which i</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.480" end="00:30:25.440" style="s2">don&#39;t think is the right word i&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">um so in doing this</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.440" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually doing is more</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:31.120" style="s2">similar to what the brain</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">is doing as opposed to anything else</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.120" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">that we looked at there&#39;s an entire army</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">of uh ai scientists who are convinced</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:40.320" style="s2">the brain does back propagation</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">and back propagation is that that</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.320" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">vanishing gradient thing there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:44.399" style="s2">entire army</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">of people who are convinced that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.399" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">our brain is doing and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">absolutely no evidence</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:50.399" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s all a hoax it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:52.159" style="s2">um this</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.399" end="00:30:53.919" style="s2">is more close to what the brain is doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.159" end="00:30:55.279" style="s2">than anything else that i&#39;ve seen in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.919" end="00:30:58.320" style="s2">ai space</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.279" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">now why is that um because one</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.320" end="00:31:03.279" style="s2">you&#39;re forcing the ais you&#39;re forcing a</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">categorizational process</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:08.480" style="s2">to do more with less connections</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.559" end="00:31:11.440" style="s2">so you&#39;re forcing it to be energy</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">efficient so instead of solving the</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:14.320" style="s2">problem the way you want to solve it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:16.000" style="s2">because you&#39;re a moral</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.320" end="00:31:18.000" style="s2">paragon and you never make mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.000" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">right instead of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.000" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">you say well let this thing solve it</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:27.200" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t solve the morality it</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.760" end="00:31:29.440" style="s2">just solves the energy efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.200" end="00:31:31.200" style="s2">which sounds a little weird you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.440" end="00:31:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like deferring morality to</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.200" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">like an accountant</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.559" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">which can go wrong pretty bad pretty</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">but it turns out well each neuron is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">accountant too</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:43.919" style="s2">it has its inputs of energy and it has</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:45.440" style="s2">its outputs and it has its waste</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.919" end="00:31:47.120" style="s2">so there&#39;s an accounting process in</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.440" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">every part of cognition</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:51.840" style="s2">dropout allows us to say oh now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:53.279" style="s2">an accounting process here too</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.840" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">and so now we&#39;re getting more in sync</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.279" end="00:31:58.559" style="s2">with how cognition actually works</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:59.840" style="s2">through a drop-out process and</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.559" end="00:32:01.279" style="s2">only and the only reason we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.840" end="00:32:02.960" style="s2">close to that cognitive model is because</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.279" end="00:32:04.880" style="s2">we&#39;re solving energy efficiency problems</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.960" end="00:32:07.039" style="s2">we&#39;re not actually solving for morality</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.880" end="00:32:08.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not fighting the network anymore</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.039" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">we&#39;re letting the network resolve energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.720" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">efficiency problems and that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:13.519" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:14.799" style="s2">much better answers well this</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.519" end="00:32:16.240" style="s2">discrimination because i</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.799" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">got damaged in his back because now i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.240" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">knocking out hinduism and i can&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:20.960" style="s2">that knockout because i gotta represent</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:22.480" style="s2">all the morality</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.960" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">i have to represent all of it at all</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.480" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">times but i get the vanishing gradient</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">but then i can&#39;t solve it get these</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.760" style="s2">people out of here</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">right they don&#39;t have the spinal</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.760" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">fortitude to handle</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:38.159" style="s2">what has to be done so here&#39;s an example</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.159" end="00:32:42.399" style="s2">of belief management is energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">effectiveness right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.399" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">imagine a world where we do what</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:51.039" style="s2">um these moral police say and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">represent every moral conundrum possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.039" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">in our in our</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">categorizational process in order to</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">make any assessment whatsoever um</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">do you think our brain adds more neurons</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">on demand when we solve a problem</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:06.720" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;d be ludicrous in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:09.120" style="s2">neuron itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.720" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">has uh has all the capacity to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.120" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">through mitosis it&#39;s all there the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:14.480" style="s2">dna is functioning nucleus is air it</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">just just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.480" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t cook at mitosis but imagine</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.600" style="s2">if it did right you might think ah</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">well the neuron went through mitosis</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.600" end="00:33:22.840" style="s2">we&#39;d be super smart well</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">i just walked you through why it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.840" end="00:33:27.039" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t we just went through why that</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:30.559" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be the case</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.039" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">so it turns out the brain is dealing</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.559" end="00:33:38.320" style="s2">with uh a non-scalable</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:40.559" style="s2">machine in order to solve its problems</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.320" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">and let me give you a demonstration this</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.559" end="00:33:43.360" style="s2">ball is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">whole bunch of photons bouncing off at a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.360" end="00:33:46.559" style="s2">brazilian events per second</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s just being dumped in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.559" end="00:33:50.399" style="s2">which is heavy dump in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">now meanwhile the poor brain is like</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.399" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">okay it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.880" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">but that&#39;s a lot of events per second</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.559" end="00:34:00.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a brazilian i mean that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:00.799" style="s2">number right it&#39;s so big it&#39;s not even a</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.000" end="00:34:03.600" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.799" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s nuts um and the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.600" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">already consuming 25</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">of the oxygen sweating it poor brain</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:09.919" style="s2">right give it a break it doesn&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">all that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.919" end="00:34:13.119" style="s2">geez work so hard for you you don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.159" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">to do this to it</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.119" end="00:34:17.200" style="s2">instead what if it turns out you only</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">needed that many</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.200" end="00:34:21.679" style="s2">right what if you only needed that many</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:23.520" style="s2">photons to get the exact same ball</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.679" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">well that&#39;s what the brain&#39;s done we</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.520" end="00:34:26.399" style="s2">only get this many photons anyway from</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.560" style="s2">our eyes</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.399" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">so we don&#39;t need all of the data we</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.560" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">don&#39;t need to represent the entirety of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.919" style="s2">reality to navigate reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s okay because it&#39;s what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.919" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">been doing the whole time joke&#39;s on us</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">so what&#39;s happening here is neural</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">evolution is actually relying on dropout</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.200" end="00:34:45.040" style="s2">techniques</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.720" end="00:34:46.159" style="s2">it&#39;s saying you don&#39;t need more neurons</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.040" end="00:34:46.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t need to be connected</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.159" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.960" end="00:34:50.240" style="s2">we&#39;ll just route somewhere else we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">connect to something else</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.240" end="00:34:53.599" style="s2">we&#39;re going to give you or the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:55.359" style="s2">neurons are</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.599" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">solving energy efficiency problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">they&#39;re not solving cognitive problems</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:03.040" style="s2">they&#39;re not solving um logical problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:05.760" style="s2">or speech problems or social problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.040" end="00:35:06.480" style="s2">it is only solving energy efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.760" end="00:35:09.920" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.480" end="00:35:10.800" style="s2">that&#39;s all it&#39;s doing and just give an</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.920" end="00:35:13.200" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.800" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">good brain it&#39;s not sweating anymore you</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.200" end="00:35:16.400" style="s2">can keep it you don&#39;t have to breathe</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">heavier because you saw a harder math</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.400" end="00:35:20.240" style="s2">that&#39;d be a weird relationship a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">of math kids just dying randomly during</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.240" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">tests that doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">uh so</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.000" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">let&#39;s look at it as belief as technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.119" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">so what i&#39;m going to declare is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">belief is actually path efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">because you&#39;re knocking out stuff you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:38.880" style="s2">not adding more information you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:41.200" style="s2">taking information away</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.880" end="00:35:42.560" style="s2">that is the origin of a belief if i if</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.200" end="00:35:43.839" style="s2">you had all the information there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.560" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">nothing to believe it&#39;s right there but</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.839" end="00:35:47.040" style="s2">if i start stripping information out now</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">you have to make beliefs about it right</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.040" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s a path of what we what</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">we&#39;re calling belief this whole time is</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:54.720" style="s2">actually a path efficiency mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">so if we assume that these are you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.720" end="00:35:56.720" style="s2">the nodes of the brain just for the sake</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.720" end="00:36:00.720" style="s2">you know visualization um the symbols we</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">use the reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.720" end="00:36:04.720" style="s2">they&#39;re not actually there&#39;s not some</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:07.760" style="s2">homogenous sitting in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.720" end="00:36:08.640" style="s2">like driving us right um each symbol is</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.760" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">a path</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.640" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">through the knocked out limitations</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:15.200" style="s2">so every symbol you see in reality is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">actually a</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.200" end="00:36:20.079" style="s2">path that is carved from the belief</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:21.599" style="s2">energy efficiency saving mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.079" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">even even the image you&#39;re looking at me</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.599" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">right now it takes 200 milliseconds</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:27.760" style="s2">for you know this thing to move and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.119" style="s2">it registers in your eyes it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.760" end="00:36:30.560" style="s2">through a lot of things it&#39;s not hitting</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.119" end="00:36:33.680" style="s2">all your neurons it&#39;s hitting</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.560" end="00:36:35.200" style="s2">a path of neurons and then it&#39;s changing</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.680" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">its direction it&#39;s changing it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.200" end="00:36:38.839" style="s2">solving for the efficiency as it goes</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">through each one of those cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.839" end="00:36:43.680" style="s2">subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:45.520" style="s2">and uh we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.680" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">slowly getting there right now with our</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.520" end="00:36:48.960" style="s2">ai because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:50.800" style="s2">finally played around with the knockout</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.960" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">process and this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.800" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">forcing this is indirectly creating</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">belief</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">as a technology um so instead of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.320" style="s2">coding belief</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:01.680" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is we&#39;re emulating it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.320" end="00:37:04.000" style="s2">um</p>

<p begin="00:37:22.400" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s my talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.400" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">wow amazing all right everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:36.800" style="s2">this will be a good opportunity to start</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:38.720" style="s2">preparing your questions and throw them</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.800" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">into the chat</p>

<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:43.359" style="s2">but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.000" end="00:37:46.480" style="s2">kind of buried so feel free to write</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.359" end="00:37:48.400" style="s2">them again if you still want to ask them</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.480" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">in the meantime i will get pat warmed up</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:56.000" style="s2">so pat one thing that came up which</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.359" end="00:37:59.200" style="s2">seems to be something of a theme</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:38:00.160" style="s2">across all of your talks is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.200" end="00:38:02.480" style="s2">pointing to this</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.160" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">idea that human beings want to but</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.480" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">ultimately can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:08.079" style="s2">quantize reality um can you say more</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:09.680" style="s2">about this like</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.079" end="00:38:11.839" style="s2">where does this desire come from why is</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.680" end="00:38:14.000" style="s2">it fundamentally flawed</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.839" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">uh what are the deeper motivations here</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.000" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.200" end="00:38:21.359" style="s2">playing the game of this is 25 good this</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">is 70</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.359" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">bad has</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.200" end="00:38:28.320" style="s2">it&#39;s ludicrous when you see that game</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.040" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">played out</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.320" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">and the reason is ludicrous is because</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.560" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">i said well welcome to whose line is it</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.560" end="00:38:38.720" style="s2">anyway or all the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:39.680" style="s2">where the rules are made up and the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.720" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">score doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.680" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">you know kind of like that um</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">it&#39;s ludicrous because</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.359" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">if i got into interactions with you i</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.839" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:58.880" style="s2">where the line is just between you and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:00.800" style="s2">and anyone else if it was just me and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.880" end="00:39:01.359" style="s2">you were chatting and doing the human</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.800" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.359" end="00:39:05.760" style="s2">i know where the line is i mean i have</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:07.119" style="s2">my autism moments but i know damn well</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.760" end="00:39:08.320" style="s2">where the line is and you know damn well</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.119" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">where the line is too</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.320" end="00:39:11.680" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to sit there and formulate</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">it and draw it out and have a contract</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.680" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">and write it down</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">really need to do that thing if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:18.320" style="s2">going to walk away from each other</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">so if it&#39;s just you and i and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.320" end="00:39:21.760" style="s2">here we can we can hash this out and</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">figure it out but if i got to go over</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.760" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">there then i got to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">represent this line that we already</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.800" end="00:39:27.760" style="s2">established with one another and then i</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">got to enforce it and then i gotta build</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.760" end="00:39:30.880" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">legal system on top of it and i gotta it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.880" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen what happens it results in</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">these</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">tremendous moments of gain a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">centralization</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.839" end="00:39:40.079" style="s2">that&#39;s the most efficient way of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:42.000" style="s2">enforcing that type of mole</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.079" end="00:39:43.119" style="s2">you know that moral emulation that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.000" end="00:39:45.040" style="s2">call law or</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.119" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">the moral emulation that we find often</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.040" end="00:39:48.400" style="s2">in theology</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">um and people are tilting at the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.400" end="00:39:50.880" style="s2">windmill when they say oh religion</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:53.680" style="s2">causes this and all</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">uh authority causes this that&#39;s not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.680" end="00:39:56.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not it we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to recreate the line that</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.720" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">that human beings naturally</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">have uh we&#39;re trying to recreate that in</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:03.839" style="s2">abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s messy it gets ugly it gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.839" end="00:40:06.720" style="s2">weird we start fighting the machine</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:08.880" style="s2">right we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.720" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">instead of trying to represent the moral</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.880" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">equilibrium that we had with one another</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">during that very organic exchange</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">now we&#39;re no longer solving for that</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">we&#39;re fighting the machine just as we do</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">with vanishing gradient um so i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">i i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">i mean my brother&#39;s in jail that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">helping</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">i certainly have some beef on that um</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">and i can explain all the socioeconomic</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:38.640" style="s2">factors on that one too</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:39.839" style="s2">um but but independent of my own</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.640" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">personal experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.839" end="00:40:43.119" style="s2">i think what we&#39;re what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">we have this instinct to quantize</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.520" end="00:40:48.000" style="s2">morality and put a little box around</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:49.839" style="s2">each action</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.000" end="00:40:51.760" style="s2">and give it a wait about what&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.839" end="00:40:53.359" style="s2">bad and then someone comes along and</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.760" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">says well kick that dictator out now</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:56.079" style="s2">it&#39;s my turn to label the weights and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">then everybody wants to label the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.079" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">weights now you end up with never-ending</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:03.599" style="s2"> posting on the internet and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:06.640" style="s2">it&#39;s 2020 and you can&#39;t leave your house</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.599" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">and you have problems um</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:11.440" style="s2">a common theme that comes up in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.440" end="00:41:13.280" style="s2">the sessions at the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.440" end="00:41:16.079" style="s2">is this idea of the different types of</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.280" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">knowing and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.079" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">there&#39;s uh there&#39;s basically the sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:22.720" style="s2">that we&#39;re over</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:23.839" style="s2">indexing on propositional knowing um</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.720" end="00:41:26.160" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.839" end="00:41:26.920" style="s2">painting reality in terms of highly</p>

<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:33.680" style="s2">uh but i think there&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.680" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">here that have an intuition and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.680" end="00:41:35.839" style="s2">key word</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">that that is missing something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.839" end="00:41:38.480" style="s2">missing a huge piece and what you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">said there is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.480" end="00:41:42.640" style="s2">two people can kind of intuitively even</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:44.640" style="s2">say intuitive but</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.640" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">we know where the line is can you speak</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.640" end="00:41:48.400" style="s2">a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">where does that line that intuition is</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.400" end="00:41:52.000" style="s2">my word but that intuition of that moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">equilibrium come from</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.000" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">and why do humans have that ability</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">yeah we&#39;re social animals so as a result</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.880" style="s2">you know emotions evolved probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">exclusively like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.880" end="00:42:06.560" style="s2">roll back the clock 50 000 years and</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:08.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.560" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">sitting somewhere fighting nature and</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.720" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">each other to a degree</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">and we have maybe 200 words maybe tops</p>

<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">you know i&#39;m going to have the physical</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.599" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">behavior about my being and you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">to be able to read that and see that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:43.200" style="s2">go oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">okay we&#39;ll take the heavy load off that</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.200" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">person put on that person now we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:47.680" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:50.400" style="s2">the tribal problem because the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.680" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">individual was honestly conveying</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.400" end="00:42:55.200" style="s2">the emotional social data that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">needed to make the tribal assessment</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.200" end="00:42:58.319" style="s2">and and we see this in animals in terms</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:00.480" style="s2">of how</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.319" end="00:43:01.760" style="s2">group animals also operate in the same</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.480" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.760" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">you see in schools of fish one fish</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">turns they all turn right so</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:08.480" style="s2">we&#39;re conveying the behavior between one</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:09.520" style="s2">another at all times and emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.480" end="00:43:12.560" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.520" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">one way in which that&#39;s uh that whole</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.560" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">decoding encoding process works but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:18.400" style="s2">there&#39;s other ways to convey it we found</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:19.599" style="s2">a way to convey it with writing or we</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.400" end="00:43:20.960" style="s2">convey it with all these other</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.599" end="00:43:23.839" style="s2">abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.960" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">um the older i get the more i hate</p>

<p begin="00:43:27.760" end="00:43:30.079" style="s2">i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.319" end="00:43:31.599" style="s2">be a post-modernist i&#39;m going to say</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.079" end="00:43:32.960" style="s2">deconstruct all language i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.599" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.960" end="00:43:40.319" style="s2">um but i think it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.319" end="00:43:43.839" style="s2">the conveyance of knowing what knowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:45.040" style="s2">where the line is is a byproduct that</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.839" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">that moral equilibrium</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.040" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">is naturally derived to um as we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:52.640" style="s2">engaging the encoding decoding</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.599" style="s2">of emotional behavior and if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.640" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">removed</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.599" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">then you when you learn to live without</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">it or</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">uh you emulate it you come up with these</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:02.800" style="s2">proxies for it</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:04.000" style="s2">and now we&#39;re on zoom right this is all</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.800" end="00:44:05.680" style="s2">a proxy for</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.000" end="00:44:07.839" style="s2">emotional conveyance is what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.680" end="00:44:09.680" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">is it good enough is it the real thing i</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.680" end="00:44:14.800" style="s2">mean it&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:16.560" style="s2">but it&#39;s not the real thing so</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.800" end="00:44:18.319" style="s2">we have approximations it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.560" end="00:44:20.400" style="s2">approximations all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.319" end="00:44:22.079" style="s2">which sucks because all we want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.400" end="00:44:23.520" style="s2">just be in the same room and drink</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.079" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">around a fire</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">i think that&#39;s it yeah that&#39;s uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">very accurate</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">very much how i&#39;m feeling right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:34.079" style="s2">okay last question for me kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">segways from that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.079" end="00:44:37.599" style="s2">with your model how do you think uh how</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">would you say</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.599" end="00:44:41.760" style="s2">psychedelics like psilocybin influence</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:43.839" style="s2">the dropout techniques</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.760" end="00:44:45.680" style="s2">that you are suggesting that the human</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.839" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">mind is continually doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.680" end="00:44:50.720" style="s2">the only mind-altering chemical i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:54.079" style="s2">ever taken is alcohol</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.720" end="00:44:56.160" style="s2">i have never done drugs never um</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.079" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know i can&#39;t speak from an</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.160" end="00:44:59.200" style="s2">experience point</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">so i have to defer to people who have</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.200" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">researched that</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:07.839" style="s2">and there&#39;s there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.839" end="00:45:09.599" style="s2">qualities of research on that point</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.839" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.599" end="00:45:15.920" style="s2">the experimental anecdotal stuff um</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">but unfortunately that&#39;s all tied into</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.920" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">the moral machine work too because of</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:20.640" style="s2">drug trade</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">and drug flow and drug regulation so as</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.640" end="00:45:23.680" style="s2">a result people end up lying about their</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.680" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">you don&#39;t get honest insights people are</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:31.760" style="s2">people enjoy the high but they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:33.040" style="s2">forced to rationalize it even if it</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.760" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2"> their life up</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.040" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">um so it&#39;s a bit of a it&#39;s hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">true readings on there so then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:41.440" style="s2">forced to look at other types of</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">research maybe big pharma research or</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.440" end="00:45:46.400" style="s2">government research or black budget</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">jeffrey epstein style stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.400" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">and you end up in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">experiments to drop out stuff we do it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">with mice for example when you start</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:55.440" style="s2">knocking out parts of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">uh at the genetic level you actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.440" end="00:45:58.160" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:59.040" style="s2">deny the dna from ever growing that part</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.160" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">of the brain so</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.040" end="00:46:02.640" style="s2">we do knock out experiments there too</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">regarding drugs that do it lsd was</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">supposed to be this wonder drug it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:14.480" style="s2">supposed to make superhumans because</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:15.760" style="s2">this is all derivative of humanist</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.480" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">garbage where</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.760" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">they think that the mind is infinitely</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">plastic and if you make it</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:23.440" style="s2">more plastic then you get more</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:26.079" style="s2">intelligence but</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.440" end="00:46:27.599" style="s2">that&#39;s not it either you don&#39;t get more</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.079" end="00:46:28.640" style="s2">intelligence from more plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.599" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.640" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">it&#39;s an energy efficiency problem still</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">that&#39;s all it is so</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.480" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen what these guys have done i</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.560" end="00:46:42.240" style="s2">mean there&#39;s stuff like mkultra</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:43.920" style="s2">where they oh we can change the</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">plasticity we can change how things are</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.920" end="00:46:46.720" style="s2">connected and we can do it through</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.720" style="s2">trauma-based training or we can do it by</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.720" end="00:46:52.319" style="s2">slipping lsd and every single cia</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.720" end="00:46:55.680" style="s2">agent&#39;s coffee just wouldn&#39;t last</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">it gets it gets ludicrous um</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.680" end="00:46:58.880" style="s2">you do find things about human nature</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">though it&#39;s not it&#39;s not that all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.880" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">research was terrible</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:06.400" style="s2">um most of it was but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:08.240" style="s2">uh what you do get from is an</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.400" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">understanding of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.240" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">turn a human being&#39;s mind into a machine</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">which is the purpose of that research to</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:16.480" style="s2">begin with</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:18.100" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea of like trying to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.480" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.100" end="00:47:21.680" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">uh get the mind in a suggestible state</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.680" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">to then retrain the pavlovian responses</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:28.800" style="s2">to then respond to</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">an input an encoded input a associative</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.800" end="00:47:32.319" style="s2">input and then have the behavior out in</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:34.000" style="s2">the desired manner</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.319" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">so that&#39;s ultimately where that level of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.000" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">research goes and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">that&#39;s even just as skewed as the drug</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">law research</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">so behind each and every one of it is</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:45.040" style="s2">still the agenda of power seeking</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s really the</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.000" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2">like i&#39;m an advocate of like abstract</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.319" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">math from the 1800s where the</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:53.280" style="s2">mathematicians just studied math for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">sake of studying math</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.280" end="00:47:56.400" style="s2">uh there was no application for their</p>

<p begin="00:50:03.599" end="00:50:06.720" style="s2">because people could interact in a way</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.359" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">that was pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.720" end="00:50:10.160" style="s2">high resolution replication of human</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s the missing dimension that a</p>

<p begin="00:51:23.920" end="00:51:27.280" style="s2">naturally because of the body language</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">not because of linguistics or because</p>

<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">everybody else was talking and getting</p>

<p begin="00:54:18.640" end="00:54:25.359" style="s2">a good that&#39;s a good way of putting that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.400" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">i think knockout because you can&#39;t keep</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.359" end="00:54:28.559" style="s2">track of everything</p>

<p begin="00:54:31.359" end="00:54:34.800" style="s2">biology does a fantastic job in</p>

<p begin="00:54:34.800" end="00:54:38.880" style="s2">it should be looking for and you</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.119" end="00:54:41.920" style="s2">probably want to check up hoffman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.880" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">um ted talk about that regarding</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.920" end="00:54:45.280" style="s2">uh why we don&#39;t see reality and what</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:47.359" style="s2">we&#39;re actually filtering from it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.280" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">primarily mating signals</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.359" end="00:54:51.440" style="s2">because the moment any simulated life</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">started seeing reality it was dead in</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.440" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">three generations</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:56.240" style="s2">because it wasn&#39;t looking for any it</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:58.799" style="s2">wasn&#39;t looking to reproduce it was too</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.240" end="00:55:00.480" style="s2">busy looking at the atoms</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.799" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">so it wasn&#39;t able to find mating signals</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.480" end="00:55:05.839" style="s2">and keep going</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">so i think um by the very nature of</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.839" end="00:55:10.240" style="s2">cognitive evolution itself here</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:11.440" style="s2">it&#39;s all knockout uh in terms of data</p>

<p begin="00:55:11.440" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">um you just don&#39;t have access to</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.040" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">will that will change</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:20.960" style="s2">i mean what you see is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">exposed to as an influence and stuff and</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.760" end="00:55:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a hard question because i i live</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.480" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">so i don&#39;t know that answer that</p>

<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">and ultimately it&#39;s about coordination</p>

<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:55:59.760" style="s2">a wisdom is maybe can be defined in some</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:01.359" style="s2">way as</p>

<p begin="00:56:13.119" end="00:56:19.440" style="s2">is that sufficient is it sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">enough to leave is it sufficient enough</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.440" end="00:56:24.559" style="s2">to do your own knockouts</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:26.000" style="s2">meaning remove that yeah it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.559" end="00:56:26.960" style="s2">practice to conduct your own self</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.000" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">knockouts</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.960" end="00:56:32.319" style="s2">um it&#39;s very good practice in fact to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:33.599" style="s2">say okay i know how this model works now</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.319" end="00:56:35.280" style="s2">i have to take everything i know about</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.599" end="00:56:36.960" style="s2">that model and get rid of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.280" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">start from scratch because i may have</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.960" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">missed something</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.760" end="00:56:45.760" style="s2">if you get too complacent on a subject</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.359" end="00:56:47.119" style="s2">you may miss developments on it that</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.760" end="00:56:50.079" style="s2">could be a good definition</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.119" end="00:56:51.839" style="s2">i think you&#39;ll work with that cool</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.079" end="00:56:54.640" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.839" end="00:56:56.000" style="s2">so we are approaching 9 30 but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.640" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">still a couple more questions in the</p>

<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:02.000" style="s2">uh normally we do go over this mark um</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">because of the energy and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.000" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">conversation pat are you still get to</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">stay on for</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:10.319" style="s2">the 10 15 minutes okay great um</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">okay uh julian would you like to share</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.319" end="00:57:16.480" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:19.520" style="s2">uh sure um let me just read it easier</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s pretty similar to alexander&#39;s i</p>

<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">um so i&#39;ll read it out i said are you</p>

<p begin="00:58:02.240" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">quite yet you have to really tune and</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">get everything so there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:09.760" style="s2">differentials out there</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:12.160" style="s2">but they&#39;re all tailored to the specific</p>

<p begin="00:58:12.160" end="00:58:19.280" style="s2">so you won&#39;t be able to scale that up to</p>

<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:20.720" style="s2">but if that is that scale invariant the</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.000" end="00:59:22.640" style="s2">answer is no</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.720" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">it&#39;s not it can&#39;t be because it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.640" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">if i&#39;m taking my brain and literally</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">pulling it out and then thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:28.079" style="s2">stuff and putting i can&#39;t i can&#39;t knock</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:31.440" style="s2">out entire</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.079" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">regions of my brain uh safely at least</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.440" end="00:59:35.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">like i suppose alcohol does its best but</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.680" end="00:59:38.720" style="s2">for the most part i don&#39;t i i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:41.119" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.720" end="00:59:46.079" style="s2">knockout at a systemic level it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.119" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">primarily local</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.079" end="00:59:53.359" style="s2">okay thank you i i&#39;m wondering pat</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">if this idea that knockouts</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.359" end="00:59:57.119" style="s2">and beliefs are more than just analogous</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.119" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">something deeper behind it are we taking</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">steps towards</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">building machines with belief systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.359" end="01:00:11.040" style="s2">we are not consciously doing that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.119" end="01:00:15.440" style="s2">i am of the opinion that the machines</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">control so much of our economy</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:19.599" style="s2">that they&#39;re doing it for us that sounds</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.839" end="01:00:21.200" style="s2">ludicrous i&#39;m out here saying that oh my</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.599" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">god these machines will never</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:24.480" style="s2">reach human consciousness yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">true um</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.480" end="01:00:28.079" style="s2">but again we&#39;re solving for energy</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:32.079" style="s2">efficiency that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.079" end="01:00:35.040" style="s2">all that&#39;s ever being solved for so</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.079" end="01:00:36.799" style="s2">when we defer our stock market to high</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.040" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">frequency trading algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.799" end="01:00:39.760" style="s2">we say here keep our numbers up</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:40.960" style="s2">regardless of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.760" end="01:00:43.119" style="s2">regardless of our actual</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.960" end="01:00:44.160" style="s2">productivity we just need to keep the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.119" end="01:00:46.160" style="s2">numbers up because</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.160" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">god damn it all those 401ks you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.160" end="01:00:50.240" style="s2">want them sinking or it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">bloodbath everywhere so now we said here</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.240" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">ai solved this for us now we go to</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.920" end="01:00:55.040" style="s2">google and</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:56.400" style="s2">say hey solve our morality for us</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.040" end="01:00:57.680" style="s2">because this is too messy and we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.400" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">want to be liable</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.680" end="01:01:00.400" style="s2">we have all these political ambitions</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:01.200" style="s2">but we just don&#39;t want to be caught</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.400" end="01:01:03.200" style="s2">doing it</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.200" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">so can we just defer this to uh the</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.200" end="01:01:08.000" style="s2">machine and then they can do it for us</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:09.760" style="s2">so now we&#39;re deferring that right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.000" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">then we go to politics and we say well</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.760" end="01:01:13.359" style="s2">we know what cambridge analytica can do</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:14.640" style="s2">it can alter the reality tunnel of</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.359" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">individual people</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.640" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">uh ideally a small competition space</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:20.880" style="s2">such as a</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:23.040" style="s2">uh an electoral college which is only 5</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.880" end="01:01:25.280" style="s2">000 people that&#39;s very easy to target</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.040" end="01:01:27.280" style="s2">so now you defer your your influence</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.280" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">operations to ai as well which then</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.280" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">extends naturally to marketing</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:34.319" style="s2">so before you know it your entire</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">civilizational infrastructure is at</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.319" end="01:01:37.599" style="s2">has been influenced in one capacity or</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:39.760" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.599" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">by these machines which aren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.760" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">cognizant</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">now you might say well we still control</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:45.680" style="s2">the machines i don&#39;t think so</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:48.160" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we control the</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.680" end="01:01:48.799" style="s2"> anymore i think they have</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.160" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">steered</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.799" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">so many prime parts of our economy and</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">our civilization</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:55.359" style="s2">that they are now running the show</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:56.880" style="s2">effectively now they&#39;re not consciously</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.359" end="01:01:58.559" style="s2">doing it it&#39;s not a conspiracy it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.880" end="01:01:59.520" style="s2">like they show up in the smoky back room</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.559" end="01:02:01.920" style="s2">of some</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.520" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t know dark web website and go ha</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.920" end="01:02:04.799" style="s2">ha how do we make the humans go it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:08.480" style="s2">like that at all</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.799" end="01:02:11.920" style="s2">it&#39;s more like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s flip</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.480" end="01:02:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s past the inflection point where</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.920" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">our behavior has been so systematized</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.680" end="01:02:19.920" style="s2">into certain activities where you wake</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">up you go to work you make your money</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.920" end="01:02:22.160" style="s2">you have your fund</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">you consume you go to sleep right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.160" end="01:02:26.319" style="s2">basically the cycle</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:28.400" style="s2">of of being a member of an</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.319" end="01:02:30.319" style="s2">industrialized civilization</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.400" end="01:02:32.000" style="s2">you have to produce you have to consume</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.319" end="01:02:33.920" style="s2">some people get to be over consumers</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.000" end="01:02:35.920" style="s2">some people get to be overproducers but</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.920" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">the distribution</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.920" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">you know you can argue the distribution</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:42.559" style="s2">all day long but that&#39;s roughly it</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:44.079" style="s2">if you reduce human potential down to</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.559" end="01:02:46.400" style="s2">just that vector</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.079" end="01:02:47.760" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy for these machines to say</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.400" end="01:02:49.520" style="s2">if i control this point</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.760" end="01:02:52.240" style="s2">then the humans will then channel</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.520" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">resources into me</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.240" end="01:02:55.599" style="s2">so now the question is which one of</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:58.640" style="s2">these ais</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.599" end="01:03:00.559" style="s2">wins is really what i&#39;m asking because</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.640" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">is it going to be the financial ai&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.559" end="01:03:04.160" style="s2">are they able to steer human behavior</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:06.079" style="s2">into dumping resources into it</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.160" end="01:03:08.400" style="s2">will it be the influence ais will be the</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.079" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">political ais</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.400" end="01:03:12.000" style="s2">what happens when religion gets involved</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.400" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2">it&#39;s coming it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.680" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2"> weird but it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.880" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">uh memetic caper can you ask your</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.440" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">hi uh what happens uh when there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">much energy efficiency</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">in a neural net does the ring the range</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.039" end="01:03:42.960" style="s2">of inputs</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">that don&#39;t gener generate category</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.960" end="01:03:46.640" style="s2">errors that shrinks</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:48.559" style="s2">like you get to uh you sort of get a</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.640" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">tunnel vision in your</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:52.400" style="s2">um algorithm yep that&#39;s called over</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:54.559" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.400" end="01:03:55.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s overfitting that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.559" end="01:03:58.799" style="s2">the term for it</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.599" end="01:03:59.440" style="s2">that&#39;s where you are you are correcting</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.799" end="01:04:02.480" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.440" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">such a narrow problem that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.480" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">easier to write</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:06.720" style="s2">an algorithm to do it instead</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.760" end="01:04:10.880" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s like once you get over</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">fitting</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.880" end="01:04:14.240" style="s2">you should just stop using machine</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">learning is what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.240" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">basically yes the cost benefit analysis</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:20.160" style="s2">has to be made whether do we just keep</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">tuning this model or is our problem</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.160" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">actually as small as we think it is or</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">have we looked at our training sets</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">incorrectly you start asking a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:28.799" style="s2">questions about again solving your own</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">energy efficiency in the form of</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.799" end="01:04:31.760" style="s2">allocating resources</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.640" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">okay all right thank you</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.200" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">all right marshall do you want to ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.640" end="01:04:43.920" style="s2">about the machine elves</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.839" end="01:04:50.319" style="s2">uh sure um well actually you know what i</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.599" end="01:04:53.039" style="s2">think that uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.319" end="01:04:54.640" style="s2">david swedlow had some good questions</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.039" end="01:04:56.079" style="s2">and i think that he should totally ask</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.640" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">because mine was kind of posting</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.079" end="01:05:01.119" style="s2">out loud so</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:03.359" style="s2">let&#39;s let him do it i appreciate that</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:05.440" style="s2">uh david feel free to unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.359" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">and ask a question</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.440" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">it&#39;s almost i&#39;m almost scared of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:10.240" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.480" end="01:05:14.240" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to ask this this is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:18.079" style="s2">a this is a thought experiment</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.240" end="01:05:19.520" style="s2">and as a question um if i think of what</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.079" end="01:05:21.440" style="s2">a neuron is doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.520" end="01:05:22.799" style="s2">individual neuron and this is based</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.440" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">partly on on reading</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.799" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">um sapolsky and behave</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a kind of a model of of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:31.760" style="s2">plato&#39;s cave</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">it&#39;s trying to make sense of the shadows</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">on the wall and effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:38.079" style="s2">the firing of the neuron is when it can</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:39.520" style="s2">no longer effectively model the outside</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.079" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">world and it must actually go out into</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.520" end="01:05:44.079" style="s2">the world and see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:45.440" style="s2">and update its map of the wall and i</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.079" end="01:05:46.480" style="s2">think that human beings are doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.440" end="01:05:48.720" style="s2">something similar</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.480" end="01:05:50.799" style="s2">we live in our little cave until we</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.720" end="01:05:52.640" style="s2">can&#39;t stand it till the noise is so much</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.799" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">that we&#39;re effectively where</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.640" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">where and that what um boulder yard</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:05:58.799" style="s2">talks about with</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:06:00.960" style="s2">the desert of the reel our our systems</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.799" end="01:06:03.599" style="s2">can no longer make sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.960" end="01:06:04.960" style="s2">that this the algorithms are so poorly</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.599" end="01:06:07.119" style="s2">modeling our reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.960" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">based on overfittedness that we have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.119" end="01:06:09.920" style="s2">come out of our caves</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:11.440" style="s2">and effectively i think that&#39;s where we</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.920" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">are right now so something like</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:15.839" style="s2">wisdom cultivation feels like this kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:17.920" style="s2">of fractal</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.839" end="01:06:19.119" style="s2">updating of my internal maps of the cave</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.920" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">on the wall and coming out and actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.119" end="01:06:21.680" style="s2">saying okay what the is really</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:24.319" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.680" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah it does make sense in</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.319" end="01:06:26.960" style="s2">fact uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:28.240" style="s2">that goes back to the calculating your</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.960" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">loss um</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:33.039" style="s2">where your your categorization error has</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">hit your threshold</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.039" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">and saying this is no longer acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.720" end="01:06:38.160" style="s2">i need to do something</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:40.079" style="s2">to either my experiences but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.160" end="01:06:41.280" style="s2">always we&#39;re always modifying our brains</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.079" end="01:06:43.039" style="s2">we just don&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.280" end="01:06:44.720" style="s2">um you have an experience you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.039" end="01:06:46.000" style="s2">modifying your brain it&#39;s not like your</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.720" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">brain is this box and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">immutable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s rewiring itself as it</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.440" end="01:06:54.559" style="s2">goes so</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:56.880" style="s2">um the models that we use come from</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.559" end="01:06:57.839" style="s2">our symbol efficiency tricks so when i</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.880" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">look at that ball</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.839" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">that&#39;s in the slide a couple a couple 10</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:03.839" style="s2">10 20 minutes ago</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.839" end="01:07:05.039" style="s2">um that ball is there in its own space</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.839" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">but now it&#39;s in my mind</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.039" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">as a path efficiency it&#39;s there it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:10.319" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">baked in and now i can go down the path</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.319" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">i can reconstruct the memory of the ball</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">so i have the model of the ball</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:17.119" style="s2">available but if the ball disappears</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.400" style="s2">my model needs to be updated so my</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.119" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">categorization</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.400" end="01:07:22.240" style="s2">where the ball is is now wrong so i</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:24.720" style="s2">gotta modify either</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.240" end="01:07:26.319" style="s2">my biases i can&#39;t do self surgery on</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.720" end="01:07:28.640" style="s2">individual neurons so what i do is i</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.319" end="01:07:30.799" style="s2">just steer my body to go find the ball</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.640" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna go find it right so there are</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.799" end="01:07:34.720" style="s2">thresholds in which the models do go out</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">of whack and we have a whole range of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.720" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">corrective behavior to engage</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.640" end="01:07:55.359" style="s2">just just a quick update on that in some</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:57.839" style="s2">sense when i think about that</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.359" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">what each neuron actually is doing is</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.839" end="01:08:01.119" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.319" style="s2">more complex than what brain scientists</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.119" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">tend to think that they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.319" end="01:08:04.880" style="s2">you know they&#39;re just now starting to</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">say wait a minute it looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.880" end="01:08:07.119" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.200" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">not only is a brain on a neuron cell</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.839" end="01:08:14.799" style="s2">isn&#39;t just a neural network</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">node it&#39;s it&#39;s doing exclusive or</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.799" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">in the dendrites so it&#39;s doing something</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:22.719" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:22.719" style="s2">more complicated than a single bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.960" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">that that energy efficiency is going to</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.960" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">compound into its structure itself</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:31.600" style="s2">yeah absolutely i would agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.560" end="01:08:37.759" style="s2">all right this might be our last</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.640" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.759" end="01:08:41.520" style="s2">unless somebody has something really</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:44.719" style="s2">someone really eager has something else</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.520" end="01:08:47.199" style="s2">next arya can you unmute yourself and</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.719" end="01:08:49.199" style="s2">ask your question</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.199" end="01:08:50.319" style="s2">hey pat thanks for the talk it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.199" end="01:08:52.319" style="s2">cool</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.319" end="01:08:53.440" style="s2">um i had a question about how you would</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.319" end="01:08:55.440" style="s2">factor an intent</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.440" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">into the moral machines uh would you</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.440" end="01:08:58.400" style="s2">think something like an adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">approach could work</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.400" end="01:09:02.719" style="s2">where instead of having an adversarial</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:04.960" style="s2">machine you had an adversarial human</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.719" end="01:09:06.560" style="s2">and their job was to try and fool the</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.960" end="01:09:08.400" style="s2">machine of its intent</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.560" end="01:09:10.400" style="s2">and then this like fullness intent</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.400" end="01:09:11.279" style="s2">fullness factor was added into the lost</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.400" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">function and</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.279" end="01:09:14.799" style="s2">the game continued from there what</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:15.679" style="s2">problems do you see you are skipping</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.799" end="01:09:18.159" style="s2">ahead to the end</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.679" end="01:09:19.040" style="s2">sir you should not be listening further</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.159" end="01:09:20.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.040" end="01:09:22.640" style="s2">what you are describing is my butterfly</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.960" end="01:09:25.279" style="s2">war effectively</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.640" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">my butterfly war was the ability to make</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.279" end="01:09:30.640" style="s2">these moral machines</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:32.400" style="s2">make mistakes uh the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.640" end="01:09:34.560" style="s2">they were out there chasing certain</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.400" end="01:09:36.960" style="s2">moral causes um</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.560" end="01:09:39.759" style="s2">in this case the the material the</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.960" end="01:09:42.799" style="s2">western material humanist cause of</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:44.640" style="s2">of i can even call it liberal democracy</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.799" end="01:09:48.960" style="s2">it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.640" end="01:09:51.520" style="s2">um never-ending extensions of</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.960" end="01:09:53.199" style="s2">middle-class 1960s as a moral framework</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.520" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">whatever word that is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.199" end="01:09:58.239" style="s2">um uh and what i said was if you target</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.560" end="01:10:01.360" style="s2">certain data sets</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.239" end="01:10:02.960" style="s2">then you can confuse the ai into</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.360" end="01:10:04.000" style="s2">actually targeting the things it wants</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.960" end="01:10:06.239" style="s2">to protect</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.000" end="01:10:07.840" style="s2">using exclusively moral machine analysis</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.239" end="01:10:10.719" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.840" end="01:10:12.719" style="s2">uh this put me on a bunch of radars boy</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.719" end="01:10:15.040" style="s2">did my life change</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:17.760" style="s2">because that wasn&#39;t supposed to happen</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.040" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">but apparently it did</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.760" end="01:10:20.239" style="s2">and so what happens what what happens</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:21.520" style="s2">when you play that game where you have</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.239" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">an absolute human</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.520" end="01:10:27.040" style="s2">in the space and they are now steering</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:28.400" style="s2">the machine indirectly and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.040" end="01:10:32.000" style="s2">nothing you can do</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.400" end="01:10:34.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t program it to not do that um</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.000" end="01:10:36.719" style="s2">because if you do so then let&#39;s take my</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.960" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">example where i say well</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.719" end="01:10:40.960" style="s2">uh certain morality actions are being</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:41.440" style="s2">punished and certain morality behaviors</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.960" end="01:10:42.960" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">so therefore if the people are being</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.960" end="01:10:47.600" style="s2">punished can demonstrate the veneer of</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.600" end="01:10:50.080" style="s2">well then there you go that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.800" end="01:10:51.440" style="s2">protection that&#39;s way better than the</p>

<p begin="01:10:51.440" end="01:10:54.960" style="s2">that&#39;s way better than a vpn now you can</p>

<p begin="01:10:56.480" end="01:11:00.480" style="s2">that the ai then let&#39;s pass because well</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:03.600" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.480" end="01:11:05.600" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to solve my moral causes and</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.600" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">do my moral things and as a result they</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.600" end="01:11:08.719" style="s2">would then have to attack actual people</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.280" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">demonstrating that veneer who they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.719" end="01:11:10.320" style="s2">actually trying to protect but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:12.480" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.320" end="01:11:14.640" style="s2">with their moral engine so the whole</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">thing just goes belly up as a result</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.640" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">um but if you step if you</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">apply that to what i said about the ais</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.040" style="s2">are already in control</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">and they&#39;re competing to get resources</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.040" end="01:11:27.360" style="s2">and using us to get those resources</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:30.800" style="s2">the one i&#39;m talking about here is</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.360" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">effectively a eugenic multiplier</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:33.760" style="s2">between the ai&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.040" end="01:11:39.280" style="s2">so remember these ais certain ones live</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.280" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">and certain ones die which ones die</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.280" end="01:11:42.719" style="s2">well the ones that are underfunded ones</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:45.840" style="s2">that are built on a bad business model</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.719" end="01:11:48.080" style="s2">the ones that are um</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.840" end="01:11:50.000" style="s2">incapable of channeling human energy</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.080" end="01:11:52.320" style="s2">into the resources to keep it alive</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.000" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">ais die all the time they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.320" end="01:11:56.000" style="s2">funding they</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:56.640" style="s2">lose a cloud connection their team goes</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.000" end="01:11:59.199" style="s2">belly up</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.640" end="01:12:00.400" style="s2">happens all the time so certain ones</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.199" end="01:12:02.159" style="s2">naturally select</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.400" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">and certain ones don&#39;t so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.159" end="01:12:05.840" style="s2">playing the the darwinian game there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:06.640" style="s2">natural selection element going on in ai</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.840" end="01:12:08.480" style="s2">survival</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.640" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">and what butterfly does is it acts as</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.480" end="01:12:13.280" style="s2">eugenic multiplier</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:14.960" style="s2">the same way that camouflage</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.280" end="01:12:16.719" style="s2">but why i picked the butterfly the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.960" end="01:12:18.320" style="s2">way that butterfly acts as a eugenic</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.719" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">multiplier as well</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.320" end="01:12:21.360" style="s2">you&#39;ll see that the butterfly when it</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:22.880" style="s2">takes its wing patterns</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.360" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">uh it&#39;s doing that to fool the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.880" end="01:12:26.080" style="s2">predator&#39;s tongue</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:27.280" style="s2">we didn&#39;t learn that until like way</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.080" end="01:12:28.800" style="s2">someone actually ate a butterfly and</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.280" end="01:12:30.640" style="s2">said this is rather sour</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.800" end="01:12:32.000" style="s2">um it turns out that when the predator</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.640" end="01:12:33.120" style="s2">eats the butterfly it comes to the same</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.000" end="01:12:34.800" style="s2">conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.120" end="01:12:35.920" style="s2">he says wow this thing tastes like crap</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:37.520" style="s2">but because there&#39;s so many bright</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.920" end="01:12:39.280" style="s2">colors associated with it the last thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.520" end="01:12:40.880" style="s2">it sees are those bright colors before</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.280" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">it closes its mouth</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.880" end="01:12:44.159" style="s2">so then it associates those bright</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:45.760" style="s2">colors with the toxic taste</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.159" end="01:12:47.360" style="s2">and so it ignores the bright colors and</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.760" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">then other species that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.360" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">butterflies start</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">generating those colors by the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:56.159" style="s2">mammals lizards flowers they start</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">generating that color because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.159" end="01:12:59.199" style="s2">selecting in a way that well the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:00.719" style="s2">predator doesn&#39;t eat that color</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.199" end="01:13:02.320" style="s2">then i&#39;m making the decision obviously</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.719" end="01:13:04.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not how natural selection works</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.320" end="01:13:07.360" style="s2">but it is a eugenics multiplier things</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.560" end="01:13:10.000" style="s2">get to survive that otherwise should not</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.360" end="01:13:11.679" style="s2">because this one thing tasted bad the</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.000" end="01:13:14.560" style="s2">predator has been sold</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.679" end="01:13:15.520" style="s2">so the answer to your question is</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.560" end="01:13:17.199" style="s2">natural selection</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.520" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">eugenics in the game of camouflage</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.199" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">that&#39;s where it ends</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.000" end="01:13:24.239" style="s2">if you try to impose an intent in these</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.080" end="01:13:26.960" style="s2">moral machines what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.239" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">yeah do you think if enough of us uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:30.239" style="s2">started playing the game of fooling</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">intent we would just engage in this like</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.239" end="01:13:35.760" style="s2">infinite game with the machines</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:38.000" style="s2">yes correct cool</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.760" end="01:13:38.000" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:46.480" style="s2">all right hannah take us home ask us the</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.679" end="01:13:51.280" style="s2">last question</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.480" end="01:13:54.320" style="s2">um so my understanding of thought is</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.280" end="01:13:56.880" style="s2">i roughly call it a pavlovian model</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.320" end="01:13:58.719" style="s2">and my understanding is something like</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.880" end="01:14:01.760" style="s2">each neural pathway becomes</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.719" end="01:14:04.000" style="s2">the more probable pathway for thought</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.760" end="01:14:06.320" style="s2">every time you take it sort of like</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.000" end="01:14:08.560" style="s2">wearing in a hiking trail</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.320" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">and so i&#39;m sort of curious on your</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:14.000" style="s2">thoughts on this model and how it</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:17.199" style="s2">corresponds to what you&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:21.120" style="s2">about today yeah the um the</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.199" end="01:14:25.360" style="s2">pavlovian training repetition exposure</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.120" end="01:14:26.320" style="s2">um again it&#39;s a path efficiency what</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.360" end="01:14:28.800" style="s2">you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.320" end="01:14:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not that the path is being selected</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.800" end="01:14:33.679" style="s2">intentionally in this case you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.960" end="01:14:36.159" style="s2">overriding the efficiencies and forcing</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.679" end="01:14:37.920" style="s2">one into play</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.159" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">so instead of letting the brain come up</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.920" end="01:14:40.080" style="s2">with these conclusions of what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:42.480" style="s2">around it</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.080" end="01:14:45.040" style="s2">that would be a way of imposing intent</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.480" end="01:14:48.400" style="s2">uh into the moral machine of the brain</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.040" end="01:14:51.679" style="s2">the same way if you try to force</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.400" end="01:14:53.679" style="s2">uh weights and biases into</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.679" end="01:14:55.679" style="s2">a neural network you get things you have</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.679" end="01:14:58.159" style="s2">to come up with this very complicated</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.679" end="01:14:58.800" style="s2">effectively therapy to fix the the moral</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.159" end="01:15:00.239" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.800" end="01:15:02.480" style="s2">and the same is true about pavlovian</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.239" end="01:15:03.440" style="s2">responses if you if you train someone</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.480" end="01:15:07.040" style="s2">through repetition</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.440" end="01:15:08.800" style="s2">on these on certain domains um</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.040" end="01:15:10.480" style="s2">there are costs that are seen in their</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.800" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">behavior and you have to engage in</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.480" end="01:15:13.760" style="s2">serious therapy don&#39;t do it</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.360" end="01:15:17.760" style="s2">thank you</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.640" end="01:15:22.560" style="s2">all right thank you so much everyone for</p>
