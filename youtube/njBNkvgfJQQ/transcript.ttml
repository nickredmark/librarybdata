<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:56.399" style="s2">started in London with cake is is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.500" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">opportunity to anchor it in an</p>

<p begin="00:00:59.550" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">indigenous linking this dis donut that</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:07.650" style="s2">has been going around just recently that</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.920" end="00:01:18.930" style="s2">who someone started to pick up on on</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.040" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">looking at the donor Indian Caidic she</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.930" end="00:01:23.880" style="s2">shed some of the conceptual things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">I&#39;ve given here last year in London and</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.880" end="00:01:29.579" style="s2">and and offsets connected with him but</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">their group and and it just so happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.579" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">that one of the Maori navigators was</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">also a close relation of mine through my</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:43.890" style="s2">mum&#39;s tribal people and but we had admit</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:46.680" style="s2">physically or until there that piece of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.890" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">work brought us together and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.680" end="00:01:51.750" style="s2">and just we sort of see it all where</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">ancestors must be guarding us because a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.750" end="00:01:55.530" style="s2">third person who&#39;s come into the circle</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:59.219" style="s2">over the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.530" end="00:02:01.590" style="s2">there&#39;s also another tribes cristinaw</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.219" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">hours from where my mother comes from so</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.590" end="00:02:06.710" style="s2">the three of us on the same tribe</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:12.180" style="s2">they&#39;re found different pathways to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.710" end="00:02:13.680" style="s2">circular conversation in in so a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.180" end="00:02:16.069" style="s2">the underpinning</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.680" end="00:02:22.099" style="s2">thinking in values all aligned in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.069" end="00:02:25.109" style="s2">certainly that iteration that came out</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.099" end="00:02:28.109" style="s2">would be what we call a Mari</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.109" end="00:02:30.150" style="s2">interpretation of the donut because they</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.109" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">translated a lot of the existing terms</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.150" end="00:02:37.230" style="s2">into Mari language but but and and where</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:41.569" style="s2">I was sort of starting was a complete</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.230" end="00:02:45.780" style="s2">different sort of view because it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.569" end="00:02:50.310" style="s2">what what the victim Lee what the donut</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.780" end="00:02:53.760" style="s2">picture represented was which is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.310" end="00:02:56.849" style="s2">like I guess and for me I saw a seat I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.760" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">feared of looking for how do you connect</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.849" end="00:03:01.650" style="s2">the dots so to speak yeah I always look</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:03.090" style="s2">at the spacing between the dots and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.650" end="00:03:06.150" style="s2">actually everything&#39;s really connected</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.090" end="00:03:09.269" style="s2">so so what drew me into the doughnut was</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.150" end="00:03:11.549" style="s2">actually the space in the sort of inner</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.269" end="00:03:13.169" style="s2">circle for me represented the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.549" end="00:03:16.319" style="s2">earth-mother in the outer circle</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.169" end="00:03:19.919" style="s2">represented the sky father and and and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.319" end="00:03:22.440" style="s2">and often you need to sort of appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.919" end="00:03:25.409" style="s2">the the total view of that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.440" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">from the moon in so often that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.409" end="00:03:32.010" style="s2">you locate yourself in order to really</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:33.689" style="s2">appreciate the fullness of those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.010" end="00:03:38.459" style="s2">symbiotic relationship between the two</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.689" end="00:03:40.379" style="s2">sequels and so and because in a what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.459" end="00:03:45.109" style="s2">call a fuckup upper or genealogical</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.379" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">centered approach is they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.109" end="00:03:52.109" style="s2">children of the earth mother and if</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:54.060" style="s2">asked why father they become guardians</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.109" end="00:03:57.389" style="s2">of certain domains of nature including</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.060" end="00:03:59.819" style="s2">humility and so the framing would be</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.389" end="00:04:03.329" style="s2">what I&#39;d call a fucker Papa centered or</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.819" end="00:04:05.669" style="s2">a genealogical centered view as opposed</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.329" end="00:04:08.669" style="s2">to a human sort of seem to be which was</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.669" end="00:04:11.000" style="s2">sort of more about when you said you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.669" end="00:04:14.009" style="s2">know look genealogical the the way I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.000" end="00:04:16.549" style="s2">understand and I&#39;m really so new to I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.009" end="00:04:21.570" style="s2">don&#39;t even want to talk about it but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.549" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">concept in or worldview is the worldview</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.570" end="00:04:26.950" style="s2">of life as a planetary process and us</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:30.390" style="s2">fully part of it so</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.950" end="00:04:33.160" style="s2">it&#39;s really in North American native</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.390" end="00:04:38.470" style="s2">indigenous and systematic way oh yes and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.160" end="00:04:42.150" style="s2">all my relatives yes Oh whole living</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.470" end="00:04:43.780" style="s2">system interconnected by these</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.900" end="00:04:53.680" style="s2">beans are what we call fucka Papa and in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.810" end="00:04:58.260" style="s2">in the connections I&#39;m not and this we a</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.680" end="00:05:01.330" style="s2">genealogy doesn&#39;t fully reflect because</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.260" end="00:05:05.100" style="s2">what&#39;s transmitted through those fucker</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.330" end="00:05:11.590" style="s2">Papa relationships his knowledge is his</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.550" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking in framing really</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.280" end="00:05:45.700" style="s2">resonates with me in that sense because</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re bringing a real circular</p>

<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:57.040" style="s2">indigenous will views are circular as</p>

<p begin="00:08:02.660" end="00:08:08.630" style="s2">where we talked about this notion of and</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.860" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">I would love to hear you a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.630" end="00:08:14.630" style="s2">on this notion of Rhian digitization</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:16.760" style="s2">whether you find that quite of putting</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.630" end="00:08:21.370" style="s2">or whether in any way resonates with you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.760" end="00:08:24.860" style="s2">because I in my current thinking I&#39;m I</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.370" end="00:08:30.890" style="s2">sense more and more that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.860" end="00:08:34.190" style="s2">original mistakes is to in any way</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.890" end="00:08:37.310" style="s2">assume that land can belong to us rather</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.190" end="00:08:39.110" style="s2">than that we are the land we were</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.310" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">expressions of the land we come come</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.110" end="00:08:44.200" style="s2">from it and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:46.540" style="s2">this is so fundamental and the same we</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.200" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">talked about this in London at meeting</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.540" end="00:08:52.149" style="s2">at the Commonwealth for a bit is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:55.329" style="s2">notion of time how that traps us that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.149" end="00:08:59.370" style="s2">the Western notion of time and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.329" end="00:09:02.740" style="s2">beginning like I love the way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.370" end="00:09:05.260" style="s2">you&#39;re so willing to build that bridge</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.740" end="00:09:10.120" style="s2">of that binocular overlapping circles of</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.260" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">and see and I&#39;m also wondering how are</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.120" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">we all somehow colonial eyes in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:18.550" style="s2">with certain patterns that will make it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:22.779" style="s2">really hard for us to even fully get</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.550" end="00:09:25.870" style="s2">back to this dynamic flow participation</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.779" end="00:09:28.510" style="s2">thinking because we don&#39;t even i</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.870" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">certainly the Western culture that</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.510" end="00:09:33.390" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even realize how much just these</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:36.940" style="s2">these thought forms already trap us in</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.390" end="00:09:42.190" style="s2">kind of misperception yeah oh look I</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.940" end="00:09:44.470" style="s2">think there and I&#39;d use this term the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.190" end="00:09:48.730" style="s2">recirculation of humanity is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.470" end="00:09:51.040" style="s2">critical so so how old people are elders</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.730" end="00:09:55.120" style="s2">are really taking on this term RiRi</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.040" end="00:09:56.680" style="s2">circle ization and cause little you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.120" end="00:09:58.750" style="s2">for me language is really important I</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.680" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2">think underneath that the reality is</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.750" end="00:10:03.579" style="s2">about the reinterred in ization of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.430" end="00:10:05.589" style="s2">humanity and and literally in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.579" end="00:10:08.500" style="s2">and this is sort of what our elders talk</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.589" end="00:10:14.380" style="s2">about and so my day to day work I work</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.500" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">for a state our state ministry who are</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.380" end="00:10:19.420" style="s2">ministry for children so we take</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:23.019" style="s2">children and stake here if we break down</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.420" end="00:10:27.670" style="s2">to a family family violence and Maori</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.019" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">children 80% of our population of stake</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.670" end="00:10:32.019" style="s2">here and that and that&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">reflection of the impact of square</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.019" end="00:10:38.380" style="s2">systems impact on family this location</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:43.440" style="s2">disconnection and so our elders sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.380" end="00:10:45.410" style="s2">talked about there in order to generate</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.440" end="00:10:48.139" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.410" end="00:10:50.269" style="s2">for families in for children there</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.139" end="00:10:52.519" style="s2">because we use this mirror for within</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.269" end="00:10:55.639" style="s2">the Ministry of so we have this neither</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.519" end="00:10:57.139" style="s2">flex bush in the way so the younger</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.639" end="00:10:58.220" style="s2">shoot grows in the middle and then you</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.139" end="00:10:59.779" style="s2">have the parent leaves and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.220" end="00:11:03.790" style="s2">grandparent leave so crows sort of out</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.779" end="00:11:06.980" style="s2">and so these are smiley saying about um</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.790" end="00:11:08.810" style="s2">if you pluck out the young shoot of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.980" end="00:11:12.920" style="s2">flex bush</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.810" end="00:11:15.800" style="s2">we will ambough boot go and sing and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.920" end="00:11:17.600" style="s2">and so the most important thing are</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.800" end="00:11:20.660" style="s2">people people people so their flex</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.600" end="00:11:23.000" style="s2">bushes as a metaphor for family and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.660" end="00:11:25.850" style="s2">well there is a need to keep children</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.000" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">safe but our practice actually strips</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.850" end="00:11:31.759" style="s2">the young shoot out of the family and</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:35.750" style="s2">and and you know indigenous sense we</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.759" end="00:11:37.759" style="s2">take it out of an indigenous plant and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.750" end="00:11:40.610" style="s2">going put it in an exotic plant in terms</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.759" end="00:11:42.620" style="s2">of Kia and none can keep us the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.610" end="00:11:44.360" style="s2">appearance and all that sort thing what</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.620" end="00:11:46.490" style="s2">what our elders have talked about is we</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.360" end="00:11:50.389" style="s2">actually mean to uplift them transplant</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.490" end="00:11:52.160" style="s2">by whole bush into a better garden in</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.389" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">order you know because it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.160" end="00:11:55.519" style="s2">conditions of poverty disconnection all</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:57.980" style="s2">those sort of things so they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.519" end="00:12:01.459" style="s2">the garden and so in their process of</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.980" end="00:12:04.639" style="s2">realization or rien digitization we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.459" end="00:12:08.300" style="s2">literally need to replant ourselves back</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.639" end="00:12:10.100" style="s2">into mother earth and allow those</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.300" end="00:12:11.899" style="s2">systems the sort of healing ourselves as</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.100" end="00:12:14.990" style="s2">well as part of their process in so</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.899" end="00:12:17.480" style="s2">because we know in our fucker Papa in</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.990" end="00:12:22.009" style="s2">our history there we are all indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.480" end="00:12:24.079" style="s2">at one point and and and it&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.009" end="00:12:26.839" style="s2">biggest impact Maeby&#39;s been in the last</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.079" end="00:12:29.480" style="s2">five hundred years or so you know from</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.839" end="00:12:31.970" style="s2">Industrial Revolution chefs of you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.480" end="00:12:34.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s in that time that we went from</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.970" end="00:12:36.470" style="s2">we to me so from the value of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.880" end="00:12:37.880" style="s2">clicked of in family to the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.470" end="00:12:40.519" style="s2">jaw and property rights and all that</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.880" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">sort of stuff and actually it requires</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.519" end="00:12:49.160" style="s2">us to return to the weak and and in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:51.040" style="s2">ways covert nineteen has presented that</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.160" end="00:12:54.559" style="s2">opportunity to start rethinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.040" end="00:12:58.640" style="s2">resetting reimagining and so I think I</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.559" end="00:13:01.970" style="s2">think the rien degeneration</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.640" end="00:13:08.120" style="s2">or recycle ization as really critical we</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.970" end="00:13:11.840" style="s2">did the conversation with wood job back</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.120" end="00:13:15.530" style="s2">then Joe also pointed out that he told</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.840" end="00:13:17.720" style="s2">the story of how if you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.530" end="00:13:22.340" style="s2">colonizers that colonized North America</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.720" end="00:13:24.920" style="s2">and most of them were indentured people</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.340" end="00:13:26.060" style="s2">were people who in order to get the</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.920" end="00:13:27.530" style="s2">money because they were starving in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.060" end="00:13:30.050" style="s2">Europe in order carried their money to</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.530" end="00:13:33.920" style="s2">get into the new world which was being</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.050" end="00:13:36.650" style="s2">stolen from other people and they had to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.920" end="00:13:39.560" style="s2">commit seven years or longer of their</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.650" end="00:13:42.260" style="s2">life to work for the person who paid for</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.560" end="00:13:45.620" style="s2">their passage so and and in similar ways</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.260" end="00:13:50.300" style="s2">the feudal system of Europe was also a</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.620" end="00:13:52.550" style="s2">system where the indigenous people of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.300" end="00:13:57.980" style="s2">Europe were actually somewhat colonial</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.550" end="00:14:00.920" style="s2">eyes door in enslaved by by the holders</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.980" end="00:14:02.990" style="s2">of the land so in some some extent is</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.920" end="00:14:05.300" style="s2">this disconnection and this</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.990" end="00:14:10.150" style="s2">colonialization of the mind has been</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.300" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">going on for all of us every em yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.150" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">it&#39;s this how do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.320" end="00:14:22.240" style="s2">enable people to like I what you just</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.800" end="00:14:24.760" style="s2">expressed for me in in kind of more</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.240" end="00:14:27.459" style="s2">Western design language I call it we did</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.760" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">our job now is to redesign the human</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.459" end="00:14:31.180" style="s2">presence on earth within the lifetime of</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:33.540" style="s2">the people there that&#39;s transplanting</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.180" end="00:14:36.670" style="s2">the bush that&#39;s planting us back into</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.540" end="00:14:39.130" style="s2">into the living cycles of a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.670" end="00:14:41.440" style="s2">system that keeps evolving that is never</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.130" end="00:14:43.209" style="s2">static this is how we&#39;re gonna do it and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.440" end="00:14:45.490" style="s2">this is the design your master plan</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.209" end="00:14:47.980" style="s2">because now we figure that out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.490" end="00:14:51.100" style="s2">always a process of learning of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.980" end="00:14:53.200" style="s2">community of how to be and fit in in</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.100" end="00:14:55.420" style="s2">relationship with each other and with</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.200" end="00:14:58.540" style="s2">the wider community of life in that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.420" end="00:15:00.820" style="s2">place and what I&#39;ve realized is that so</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.540" end="00:15:02.950" style="s2">much of that has actually to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.820" end="00:15:04.810" style="s2">the governance structures that enable</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.950" end="00:15:07.000" style="s2">and this is because we had a long</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.810" end="00:15:08.740" style="s2">conversation about land rights and your</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.000" end="00:15:11.200" style="s2">people who claiming back their rights</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.740" end="00:15:12.970" style="s2">for that that territories and and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.200" end="00:15:19.510" style="s2">whole process in new zealand around that</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.970" end="00:15:21.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s all of us if we don&#39;t enable</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.510" end="00:15:23.860" style="s2">through some kind of change of</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.550" end="00:15:27.610" style="s2">governance system true subsidiarity</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.860" end="00:15:29.680" style="s2">where people in place have the rights</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.610" end="00:15:32.770" style="s2">and responsibilities to make the wise</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.680" end="00:15:34.209" style="s2">decisions about what matters to them in</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.770" end="00:15:37.450" style="s2">their place and what matters to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.209" end="00:15:39.940" style="s2">place but in full responsibility of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.450" end="00:15:42.610" style="s2">global family and the fogger Papa</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.940" end="00:15:44.589" style="s2">lineage of the meme yeah the one thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.610" end="00:15:46.360" style="s2">we might all disagree on a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.589" end="00:15:48.190" style="s2">but the one thing we need to agree on is</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.360" end="00:15:50.200" style="s2">we are life and we have to create</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.190" end="00:15:54.520" style="s2">conditions conducive to life in diverse</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.200" end="00:15:58.690" style="s2">ways in each place but yes and so how do</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.520" end="00:16:00.490" style="s2">how do we in this current system I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.690" end="00:16:02.680" style="s2">resilient is very hopeful at least from</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.490" end="00:16:05.410" style="s2">the outside view like you&#39;ve got got a</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.680" end="00:16:08.470" style="s2">pretty inspired leader you&#39;ve got not so</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.410" end="00:16:11.290" style="s2">many people and you you seem to be a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.470" end="00:16:16.839" style="s2">lot further along on the healing between</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.290" end="00:16:19.300" style="s2">the the first people and and the the who</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.839" end="00:16:21.430" style="s2">people who arrived later and and</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.300" end="00:16:24.610" style="s2">beginning to like even but I noticed</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.430" end="00:16:27.160" style="s2">with a lot of em kind of English roots</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.610" end="00:16:28.030" style="s2">New Zealanders that I know I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.160" end="00:16:30.400" style="s2">impressed</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.030" end="00:16:33.850" style="s2">how learning the language for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.400" end="00:16:37.540" style="s2">has just become fully something there</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.850" end="00:16:40.390" style="s2">that one one does but how do you see how</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.540" end="00:16:43.330" style="s2">how do we heal systemically everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.390" end="00:16:45.460" style="s2">how do we enable people to come back</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.330" end="00:16:49.200" style="s2">into community and ask those questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.460" end="00:16:53.740" style="s2">that your community is asking but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.200" end="00:16:58.140" style="s2">you know I think I think certainly what</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.740" end="00:17:02.500" style="s2">we&#39;re working towards an L space is</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.140" end="00:17:05.910" style="s2">shifting the whole operating system and</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.500" end="00:17:12.610" style="s2">and so so in the work we&#39;re doing those</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.910" end="00:17:15.940" style="s2">so so I&#39;m involved in an hour working on</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.610" end="00:17:17.620" style="s2">a regenerative program which will</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.940" end="00:17:22.180" style="s2">probably end up being a 50-year piece of</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.620" end="00:17:26.980" style="s2">work around regeneration of a stream</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.180" end="00:17:28.750" style="s2">catchment in in the southern part of our</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.980" end="00:17:33.430" style="s2">city in Oakland which also happens to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.750" end="00:17:38.920" style="s2">one of the socio-economic lis DePriest</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.430" end="00:17:41.800" style="s2">places and so so in our logic that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.920" end="00:17:43.660" style="s2">state of the stream reflects the state</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.800" end="00:17:48.070" style="s2">of the people which is another good</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.660" end="00:17:50.950" style="s2">state and and and so by so what what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.070" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">working with council what they&#39;ve agreed</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.950" end="00:17:55.480" style="s2">to is to allow the whole operating</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:57.940" style="s2">system be anchored and indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.480" end="00:17:59.350" style="s2">systems thinking because they see it oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.940" end="00:18:01.390" style="s2">why do we have to step into their</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.350" end="00:18:04.990" style="s2">binocular lens why can&#39;t we go straight</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.390" end="00:18:06.820" style="s2">to one lens and let it be yours and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.990" end="00:18:09.730" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty powerful because that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.820" end="00:18:14.820" style="s2">means that we help set the conditions of</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.730" end="00:18:18.010" style="s2">the garden and and so part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.820" end="00:18:20.920" style="s2">using the garden analogy is you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.010" end="00:18:23.800" style="s2">we&#39;re helping prepare the garden and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.920" end="00:18:27.400" style="s2">won&#39;t be around for the harvest in that</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.800" end="00:18:29.590" style="s2">scene so so what what so so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.400" end="00:18:32.980" style="s2">focusing on was what would I fuck up up</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.590" end="00:18:35.050" style="s2">I seem to approach me in in regenerating</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.980" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">those fucker proper connections to place</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.050" end="00:18:41.560" style="s2">to nature in people and that we as the</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:43.630" style="s2">indigenous community</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.560" end="00:18:45.640" style="s2">because we see ourselves as part of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.630" end="00:18:49.120" style="s2">nature as part of the lane that we just</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.640" end="00:18:54.130" style="s2">help provide the underpinning in order</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.120" end="00:18:59.020" style="s2">for those generations to in grow beyond</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.130" end="00:19:01.900" style="s2">it and and so um so one of those um I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.020" end="00:19:04.900" style="s2">so in the sense of New Zealand over time</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.900" end="00:19:07.500" style="s2">it&#39;s a rien de Jennison or in digitizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.900" end="00:19:10.090" style="s2">our systems here because in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.500" end="00:19:12.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve had an indigenous system Indian we</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.090" end="00:19:17.680" style="s2">figure we had a Wisma stir system arrive</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.720" end="00:19:19.600" style="s2">and I think over time and of and this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.680" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">about that contra being conscious about</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.600" end="00:19:23.860" style="s2">how we navigate the space is there</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:26.410" style="s2">there&#39;ll be come a time where we</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.860" end="00:19:30.550" style="s2">actually get to to re-envision eyes the</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.410" end="00:19:32.650" style="s2">system so so we take the elements of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.550" end="00:19:34.900" style="s2">we semester system the elements of</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.650" end="00:19:36.550" style="s2">indigenous system and then we actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.900" end="00:19:38.620" style="s2">create this food space which will be end</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.550" end="00:19:41.710" style="s2">up being a Kiwi system which is anchored</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.620" end="00:19:44.230" style="s2">in the lane anchored in nature in people</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.710" end="00:19:46.240" style="s2">in and and we&#39;re seeing glimmers of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.230" end="00:19:49.390" style="s2">through the covert 19 response in</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.240" end="00:19:52.830" style="s2">Auckland in New Zealand what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.390" end="00:19:55.540" style="s2">interesting is there now it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.830" end="00:19:59.350" style="s2">we&#39;ve not only flattened the curve but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.540" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">think it&#39;s our limit of 12th day in a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.350" end="00:20:06.610" style="s2">row where we&#39;ve had no covered 19</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">positive teeth and so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.610" end="00:20:11.920" style="s2">about maybe the government decided next</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:13.630" style="s2">Monday on going to level one which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.920" end="00:20:17.560" style="s2">sort of going back to normal but just</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.630" end="00:20:19.720" style="s2">closed borders and and so they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.560" end="00:20:24.420" style="s2">dissipating that we would be there in 28</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.720" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">days just allow for those cycles of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.420" end="00:20:32.230" style="s2">virus to reappear and so we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:33.580" style="s2">ahead well ahead of the models but</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.230" end="00:20:37.090" style="s2">what&#39;s really interesting there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.580" end="00:20:40.350" style="s2">tension that it&#39;s come through and what</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.090" end="00:20:43.330" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen is this the strain between</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.350" end="00:20:45.100" style="s2">the opportunity of what a postcode bird</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.330" end="00:20:47.770" style="s2">19 New Zealand would look like in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.100" end="00:20:50.680" style="s2">circular way versus the tensions of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.770" end="00:20:54.440" style="s2">old system still holding on trying to</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.680" end="00:20:59.809" style="s2">hold on and and say you&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.440" end="00:21:01.460" style="s2">sort of those typical focus on art about</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.809" end="00:21:02.929" style="s2">the economic impacts and we got to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.460" end="00:21:04.220" style="s2">back to work and recover and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.929" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">about growth and all those sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.220" end="00:21:10.850" style="s2">things and this is over so there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:12.769" style="s2">a failure if you like in some ways to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.850" end="00:21:15.740" style="s2">recognize the window of opportunity that</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.769" end="00:21:18.669" style="s2">has been presented and and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.740" end="00:21:22.070" style="s2">that&#39;s part of that power of observation</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.669" end="00:21:24.860" style="s2">of sort of seeing the regeneration of</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.070" end="00:21:28.009" style="s2">natural systems to sort of see the</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.860" end="00:21:30.769" style="s2">resilience of our community in a way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.009" end="00:21:34.570" style="s2">looking up to each other in and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.769" end="00:21:38.330" style="s2">responding I mean one of the great and</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.570" end="00:21:40.580" style="s2">changes that that will stay no matter</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.330" end="00:21:44.509" style="s2">how quickly they try to bounce back is</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.580" end="00:21:48.350" style="s2">that so much that prior to this</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.509" end="00:21:50.149" style="s2">situation was sort of trying to invite</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.350" end="00:21:51.799" style="s2">people into don&#39;t you understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.149" end="00:21:54.379" style="s2">all interconnects and how quickly things</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.799" end="00:21:56.149" style="s2">controllably and how rapidly things can</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.379" end="00:21:58.370" style="s2">change and people saying oh yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.149" end="00:22:01.639" style="s2">sounds very or your systems theorist</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.370" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">your futurists you academic telling me</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.639" end="00:22:08.029" style="s2">these things but now you can always</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:10.519" style="s2">refer back to a embodied real experience</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.029" end="00:22:13.100" style="s2">that has touched people on the planet</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.519" end="00:22:15.710" style="s2">and I think that that will already help</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.100" end="00:22:18.799" style="s2">us to at least speak about interbeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.710" end="00:22:21.110" style="s2">and interconnectedness in a different</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.799" end="00:22:24.470" style="s2">way and similarly in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.110" end="00:22:27.350" style="s2">response all this well that sounds too</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.470" end="00:22:29.629" style="s2">grandiose and ideal idealistic of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.350" end="00:22:31.879" style="s2">response you will never get everybody to</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.629" end="00:22:34.519" style="s2">do this in that time change takes</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.879" end="00:22:37.610" style="s2">generations now you can say well we did</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.519" end="00:22:40.279" style="s2">undercover in six weeks more change than</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.610" end="00:22:43.669" style="s2">we did for many years before that but</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.279" end="00:22:47.419" style="s2">but I I just wanted to come back to this</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.669" end="00:22:49.370" style="s2">in in this what I&#39;m sitting with so much</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.419" end="00:22:51.049" style="s2">is how you know that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.370" end="00:22:53.509" style="s2">Buckminster Fuller said this wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.049" end="00:22:55.700" style="s2">thing M if you want to change the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.509" end="00:22:59.029" style="s2">people think don&#39;t tell them what to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.700" end="00:23:01.460" style="s2">think give them a tool the use of which</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.029" end="00:23:05.059" style="s2">will change the way they think yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.460" end="00:23:07.040" style="s2">if you if you think that through then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.059" end="00:23:11.090" style="s2">sort of invites the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.040" end="00:23:14.090" style="s2">for example how to what extent is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.090" end="00:23:17.360" style="s2">use of money in the way that it works</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.090" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">right now the tool that conditions how I</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.360" end="00:23:22.340" style="s2">think about life and about relationships</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:28.250" style="s2">and about everything that that whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.340" end="00:23:30.290" style="s2">I&#39;m still connected tribal indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.250" end="00:23:34.280" style="s2">origin or where I am just an earth</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.290" end="00:23:34.850" style="s2">earthling of being indigenous to this</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.380" end="00:24:13.340" style="s2">careful with just taking like continuing</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.180" end="00:24:15.080" style="s2">because the square system has</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.340" end="00:24:18.200" style="s2">established it it works globally</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.080" end="00:24:20.060" style="s2">everybody recognizes it for a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.200" end="00:24:22.100" style="s2">generations we all grew up with these</p>

<p begin="00:24:22.100" end="00:24:25.850" style="s2">structures and therefore they they run</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.590" end="00:24:28.490" style="s2">in the background without being</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.810" end="00:24:56.930" style="s2">know it&#39;s that type of things so so part</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.300" end="00:24:59.030" style="s2">of the old sort of little mentor is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.930" end="00:25:01.040" style="s2">sort of two things is you need to become</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.030" end="00:25:03.770" style="s2">a way of the square in order to be able</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.040" end="00:25:05.510" style="s2">to recognize the sickle and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.770" end="00:25:07.730" style="s2">like your point earlier about not</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.510" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">telling people how to think but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.730" end="00:25:16.700" style="s2">just that to help reveal things and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:19.160" style="s2">and and and and our young people and our</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.700" end="00:25:20.950" style="s2">elders are the ones that really switch</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.160" end="00:25:26.090" style="s2">onto that because I know see</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:30.530" style="s2">is this purity of thought and clarity in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.090" end="00:25:32.690" style="s2">how they see complexity and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.530" end="00:25:36.260" style="s2">and they and epic and they they become</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.690" end="00:25:39.260" style="s2">almost my piece to what I call the</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.260" end="00:25:41.090" style="s2">stuck-up upper centered logic hmm if it</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.260" end="00:25:42.830" style="s2">makes sense to our elders and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.090" end="00:25:48.200" style="s2">sense to our young people there we&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.830" end="00:25:49.880" style="s2">the one you know because but it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.200" end="00:25:51.500" style="s2">sometimes you might have to frame it</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.880" end="00:25:55.310" style="s2">slightly differently for each audience</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.500" end="00:25:56.930" style="s2">but once they actually switch into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.310" end="00:25:59.060" style="s2">thinking and that way they get it and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.930" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">then it&#39;s like this revolution so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.060" end="00:26:02.600" style="s2">got your elders talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:04.760" style="s2">recirculation we&#39;ve got our young people</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.600" end="00:26:07.510" style="s2">talking about recirculation because and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.760" end="00:26:10.130" style="s2">and what we&#39;re talking about is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.510" end="00:26:12.380" style="s2">there because what they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.130" end="00:26:14.390" style="s2">recognizing is using this lens of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.380" end="00:26:18.430" style="s2">queer thinking what circular thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.390" end="00:26:21.350" style="s2">and and and I and you know and what l.l</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.430" end="00:26:23.750" style="s2">elders get because some of your elders</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.350" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">grew up in the time of literal apartheid</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.750" end="00:26:28.760" style="s2">we&#39;re and some of our towns in New</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:29.930" style="s2">Zealand there were signs we are only</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.760" end="00:26:32.150" style="s2">whites only</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.930" end="00:26:33.590" style="s2">no Marty allowed that type of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.150" end="00:26:37.130" style="s2">so they that&#39;s part of their living</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.590" end="00:26:39.110" style="s2">experience what what they&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.130" end="00:26:41.510" style="s2">recognize is their beckon that they it</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.110" end="00:26:45.350" style="s2">was the square and circle was as clear</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.510" end="00:26:49.340" style="s2">and simple as Marty and non Marty what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.350" end="00:26:51.020" style="s2">happened generations later is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.340" end="00:26:54.170" style="s2">there&#39;s no ethnic distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.020" end="00:26:58.780" style="s2">square and circle thinking and and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.170" end="00:27:00.680" style="s2">one of the challenges is they&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.780" end="00:27:03.830" style="s2">sort of post-colonial</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.680" end="00:27:07.340" style="s2">age is the tribes in the government we</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.830" end="00:27:09.170" style="s2">can solve past issues and do these sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.340" end="00:27:11.570" style="s2">of treaty settlements compensation</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.170" end="00:27:13.130" style="s2">reparation type things is that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.570" end="00:27:14.120" style="s2">structures they have to create and goes</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.130" end="00:27:15.620" style="s2">back to your point earlier around</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.120" end="00:27:19.430" style="s2">governance around leadership</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.620" end="00:27:20.660" style="s2">decision-making pipe platforms as they</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.430" end="00:27:22.700" style="s2">have to create a square system</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.660" end="00:27:26.630" style="s2">governance system to manage those things</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.700" end="00:27:28.100" style="s2">and then it shifts the whole way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.630" end="00:27:31.460" style="s2">thinking and being from a circular</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.100" end="00:27:33.890" style="s2">system to a square and and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.460" end="00:27:34.909" style="s2">becoming really awesome about driving</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.890" end="00:27:36.799" style="s2">our own square</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.909" end="00:27:41.149" style="s2">within their own indigenous communities</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.799" end="00:27:43.220" style="s2">and and so by being able to become aware</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.149" end="00:27:46.489" style="s2">of the square and recognize the circle</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.220" end="00:27:49.669" style="s2">because what what and and I think over</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.489" end="00:27:51.379" style="s2">nineteen climate change it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.669" end="00:27:55.539" style="s2">certainly in our context for the last</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.379" end="00:27:58.129" style="s2">200 years we&#39;ve had this Eclipse occur</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.539" end="00:28:00.259" style="s2">where what we thought where our circle</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.129" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">systems-thinking in knowledge has been</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.259" end="00:28:05.029" style="s2">sort of replaced by these square systems</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:06.950" style="s2">but what&#39;s really exciting is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.029" end="00:28:08.960" style="s2">eclipses are starting to continue its</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.950" end="00:28:11.269" style="s2">movement and we&#39;re starting to see the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.960" end="00:28:12.830" style="s2">circle reveal itself so so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.269" end="00:28:15.080" style="s2">thing is the circle will always reveal</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.830" end="00:28:15.679" style="s2">itself because the circle is nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.080" end="00:28:17.659" style="s2">always there</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.679" end="00:28:21.139" style="s2">there&#39;s just the squares districted us</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.659" end="00:28:23.090" style="s2">and to the point it&#39;s become so</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.139" end="00:28:25.099" style="s2">subconscious and so locked then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.090" end="00:28:26.599" style="s2">not aware of it it&#39;s like um sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.099" end="00:28:28.070" style="s2">you drive to a place and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.599" end="00:28:30.409" style="s2">remember actually the route or how you</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.070" end="00:28:32.210" style="s2">got there but it&#39;s so engrained you</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.409" end="00:28:33.590" style="s2">driving you know because these some</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.210" end="00:28:34.879" style="s2">things we don&#39;t think we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.590" end="00:28:37.369" style="s2">about driving we don&#39;t think you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.879" end="00:28:39.529" style="s2">but we just get to you places so so</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.369" end="00:28:42.649" style="s2">that&#39;s because and a lot of ways we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.529" end="00:28:44.749" style="s2">lost the ability to observe to see no</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.649" end="00:28:48.830" style="s2">signs for you later as you were just</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.749" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">describing this I had this this visual</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.830" end="00:28:55.070" style="s2">image of in in the English language</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:28:57.649" style="s2">there&#39;s this thing about I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.070" end="00:29:01.729" style="s2">put a square peg into a round hole and</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.649" end="00:29:03.859" style="s2">and and if you imagine the round hole in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.729" end="00:29:05.509" style="s2">the square peg the reason why it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.859" end="00:29:09.919" style="s2">fit in is that they&#39;re little corners</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.509" end="00:29:12.169" style="s2">then that stand over the circle and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.919" end="00:29:13.549" style="s2">need to be shaved off to put up again</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.169" end="00:29:15.559" style="s2">and then if you did that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.549" end="00:29:18.590" style="s2">there&#39;s also bits of the circle that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.559" end="00:29:21.249" style="s2">free that weren&#39;t in the square and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.590" end="00:29:25.849" style="s2">is an it is a two things coming together</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.249" end="00:29:27.440" style="s2">but I&#39;m so so deeply interested in and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.849" end="00:29:30.799" style="s2">think this is the exploration you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.440" end="00:29:34.099" style="s2">know have with you people saying where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.799" end="00:29:35.659" style="s2">the square thinking within us is to find</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.099" end="00:29:39.580" style="s2">out what are the bits that stand over</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.659" end="00:29:44.059" style="s2">the corner that will actually then</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.580" end="00:29:46.039" style="s2">continue to impede our refitting into</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.059" end="00:29:48.169" style="s2">re-envisioned ization like they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.039" end="00:29:50.929" style="s2">bio regionalist called it re inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.169" end="00:29:53.419" style="s2">patient yeah we inhabiting the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.929" end="00:29:55.909" style="s2">and I think all these notions are very</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.419" end="00:30:00.470" style="s2">very very similar it&#39;s a coming home</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.909" end="00:30:02.950" style="s2">it&#39;s a um it&#39;s but it&#39;s not from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.470" end="00:30:06.350" style="s2">outsider coming home from the inside</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.950" end="00:30:11.600" style="s2">native to the earth again and that said</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.350" end="00:30:14.029" style="s2">the resonance of that sense of belonging</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.600" end="00:30:16.299" style="s2">that seems of place that you feel in a</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.029" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">depth of your soul you know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.299" end="00:30:24.470" style="s2">and and I think to like you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:26.659" style="s2">recognize there in a lot of times where</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.470" end="00:30:29.269" style="s2">your soul takes you and where you end up</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.659" end="00:30:32.119" style="s2">being the place where you live in put</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.269" end="00:30:33.769" style="s2">roots through as they&#39;re often it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.119" end="00:30:36.710" style="s2">odd memory that&#39;s drawing you home in</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.769" end="00:30:39.019" style="s2">the first place in some ways you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.710" end="00:30:43.549" style="s2">and and so I think I think one of those</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.019" end="00:30:48.759" style="s2">key things being around there reinker in</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.549" end="00:30:52.009" style="s2">that re su closing in that way is about</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.759" end="00:30:54.230" style="s2">recalibrating our sense of time and and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.009" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">we talked about bit so so these things</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.230" end="00:31:04.609" style="s2">like systems we use so we so we we very</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:07.249" style="s2">much hit a lunar stellar calendar that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.609" end="00:31:09.859" style="s2">we use up and time up until the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.249" end="00:31:12.529" style="s2">Gregorian calendar arrived in that teens</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.859" end="00:31:16.549" style="s2">the lock everything fixed everything and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.529" end="00:31:18.169" style="s2">as you said nature&#39;s dynamic its</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.549" end="00:31:19.700" style="s2">movement that&#39;s all about movement and</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.169" end="00:31:22.489" style="s2">there you actually got to move with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.700" end="00:31:28.119" style="s2">season as opposed to regardless of what</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.489" end="00:31:30.830" style="s2">the calendar says you know and and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.119" end="00:31:33.470" style="s2">using those sort of tools what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.830" end="00:31:37.700" style="s2">found is there especially with our work</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.470" end="00:31:40.369" style="s2">with in urban communities is that we</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.700" end="00:31:43.999" style="s2">what we call Mara Mitaka which is lmarti</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.369" end="00:31:45.980" style="s2">Luna Stella calendar it&#39;s about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.999" end="00:31:47.809" style="s2">unique to place so there&#39;s no you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.980" end="00:31:49.639" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t have like a universal</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.809" end="00:31:51.830" style="s2">the lunar calendar for New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.639" end="00:31:54.289" style="s2">that&#39;s actually localized place-based</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.830" end="00:31:56.989" style="s2">because that&#39;s those local ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.289" end="00:32:00.650" style="s2">those local cycles they&#39;re in even your</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.989" end="00:32:03.730" style="s2">location in terms of we are New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.650" end="00:32:07.640" style="s2">we&#39;ll determine the the slight little</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.730" end="00:32:09.520" style="s2">times and things movements in one Bay</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.640" end="00:32:13.580" style="s2">next to the other Bay will have its own</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.520" end="00:32:15.740" style="s2">calibration you know so so being able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.580" end="00:32:18.140" style="s2">attune ourselves recalibrate our</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.740" end="00:32:20.630" style="s2">relationship to time and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.140" end="00:32:23.270" style="s2">one thing that covered nineteen forced</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.630" end="00:32:25.940" style="s2">it forced actually slowing down of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.270" end="00:32:29.030" style="s2">chronological time mmm and you actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.940" end="00:32:32.290" style="s2">hit the be in the moment and you had to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.030" end="00:32:35.090" style="s2">be in the state of where to fully</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.290" end="00:32:37.730" style="s2">receive have that time or family all</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.090" end="00:32:39.590" style="s2">those things because I&#39;m all those other</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.730" end="00:32:42.680" style="s2">drivers around chronological time no</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.590" end="00:32:44.090" style="s2">longer existed or met it and and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.680" end="00:32:47.090" style="s2">those families that were able to</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.090" end="00:32:49.760" style="s2">recalibrate their sense of time the</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.090" end="00:32:52.450" style="s2">sense of relationships do place actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.760" end="00:32:55.400" style="s2">did really well through the lock down</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.450" end="00:32:59.180" style="s2">again so so it&#39;s those sort of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.400" end="00:33:02.900" style="s2">about and I think this is where some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.180" end="00:33:05.300" style="s2">your indigenous knowledge tools if you</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.900" end="00:33:08.090" style="s2">like can next be help because those are</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.300" end="00:33:10.610" style="s2">the things they almost help us connect</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.090" end="00:33:14.960" style="s2">into the space between the circle in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.610" end="00:33:19.910" style="s2">what the square P glue a end and and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.960" end="00:33:22.520" style="s2">think because it is about and we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.910" end="00:33:24.470" style="s2">talk about their recalibration processes</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.520" end="00:33:25.130" style="s2">we use the tomb location location</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.470" end="00:33:27.650" style="s2">location</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.130" end="00:33:31.130" style="s2">so tell you locate yourself within a</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.650" end="00:33:34.250" style="s2">certain worldview if you like it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.130" end="00:33:36.410" style="s2">how you anchor yourself to place and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.250" end="00:33:40.040" style="s2">third shift is how you locate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.410" end="00:33:47.690" style="s2">in a relationship with time and and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.040" end="00:33:49.880" style="s2">as sense of I think Greek used the cross</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.690" end="00:33:53.210" style="s2">you know that Chronos and Kairos is here</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.880" end="00:33:57.860" style="s2">so in their kurios time it&#39;s it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.210" end="00:33:59.510" style="s2">a moment can last for Yuma and in that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.860" end="00:34:01.670" style="s2">time you actually get to commune with</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.510" end="00:34:03.230" style="s2">your ancestors and your descendants to</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.670" end="00:34:07.520" style="s2">come you know because it&#39;s a time-space</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.230" end="00:34:09.860" style="s2">type continuum and and so you know and</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.520" end="00:34:13.490" style="s2">this is where we&#39;ve sort of seen the</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.860" end="00:34:14.470" style="s2">deeper sort of contrast the depth of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.490" end="00:34:16.790" style="s2">colors of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.470" end="00:34:20.420" style="s2">you know you can look at green but these</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.790" end="00:34:25.400" style="s2">dips of green and you know because your</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.420" end="00:34:29.210" style="s2">your viewers shuffling and so we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.400" end="00:34:31.550" style="s2">it with a lot of families and so we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.210" end="00:34:35.390" style="s2">developed um like we have a Mari</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.550" end="00:34:37.250" style="s2">language version of ale calendar but we</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.390" end="00:34:40.130" style="s2">also have a non mari vision because some</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.250" end="00:34:42.500" style="s2">of the families we deal with might be</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.130" end="00:34:44.840" style="s2">Maori but don&#39;t have language don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.500" end="00:34:47.900" style="s2">know so so this is their first tip of</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.840" end="00:34:51.680" style="s2">just recalibrating themselves back to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.900" end="00:34:54.920" style="s2">those fucker proper systems this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.680" end="00:34:56.750" style="s2">fascinating for me because I I a couple</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.920" end="00:34:58.820" style="s2">of weeks ago I talked to a man called</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.750" end="00:35:03.260" style="s2">Martin from Hildebrand who lives in</p>

<p begin="00:35:19.610" end="00:35:27.110" style="s2">the few places in Amazonia where where</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.630" end="00:35:28.940" style="s2">that means we&#39;re talking about thirty</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.300" end="00:35:59.570" style="s2">different from one way to another and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.250" end="00:36:02.810" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s may be expressed in a language</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.610" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">area because the spirits are there and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.440" end="00:36:10.970" style="s2">they&#39;re doing and there&#39;s a story around</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.530" style="s2">the two spirits doing what whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.970" end="00:36:14.390" style="s2">what it&#39;s also and this is where they</p>

<p begin="00:36:14.390" end="00:36:19.310" style="s2">it&#39;s actually also doing indirectly is</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.270" end="00:36:21.290" style="s2">that in that area of the forest there</p>

<p begin="00:36:23.570" end="00:36:28.090" style="s2">replenish that so so there&#39;s there are</p>

<p begin="00:36:28.090" end="00:36:32.460" style="s2">wrapped him in indifferent storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.880" end="00:36:35.620" style="s2">in different mythology and different</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.460" end="00:36:38.740" style="s2">frameworks that actually have enabled</p>

<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:17.320" style="s2">way they turned into that skid and said</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.630" end="00:37:19.840" style="s2">okay you help us communicate this</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.320" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">knowledge through your little video on</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.570" end="00:37:32.710" style="s2">everybody does know and of course that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.660" end="00:37:34.630" style="s2">it&#39;s I find it a bit awkward because</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.710" end="00:37:38.290" style="s2">again I&#39;m wondering how much does the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.630" end="00:37:41.560" style="s2">use of that tool change the what is</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.290" end="00:37:49.710" style="s2">contained in in that long lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.560" end="00:37:53.800" style="s2">tradition but but M how do we reap</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.710" end="00:37:56.170" style="s2">discover in this globalized attention</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.170" end="00:38:03.370" style="s2">reach analyze economic systems as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.780" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">as systems of governance and it will</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.370" end="00:38:07.030" style="s2">always pull our attention what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:11.410" style="s2">on out in the global we have so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.030" end="00:38:14.650" style="s2">learning to do to get back to that kind</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.410" end="00:38:17.890" style="s2">of level of awareness of our</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.180" end="00:38:35.020" style="s2">differently and some depending on what</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.980" end="00:38:38.550" style="s2">the climate does at least you have some</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.020" end="00:38:42.520" style="s2">almonds and any like</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.550" end="00:38:45.310" style="s2">do you find that you&#39;ve found effective</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.520" end="00:38:48.010" style="s2">ways of because you said if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.310" end="00:38:51.130" style="s2">elders talk about it and you young</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.010" end="00:38:54.490" style="s2">people talk about did you know and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.130" end="00:38:56.950" style="s2">do you enable that so I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.490" end="00:39:02.349" style="s2">what I think one of those challenges is</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.950" end="00:39:04.750" style="s2">how technology is an enabler but every</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.349" end="00:39:07.990" style="s2">generation history has had to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.750" end="00:39:10.420" style="s2">technology in some form you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.990" end="00:39:13.090" style="s2">think about my sisters we in the potato</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.420" end="00:39:16.570" style="s2">James Cook bought the potato to New</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.090" end="00:39:18.730" style="s2">Zealand and and that was one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.570" end="00:39:22.720" style="s2">transformational pieces of technology</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.730" end="00:39:26.530" style="s2">that there as an outcome it enabled us</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.720" end="00:39:28.420" style="s2">to have two potato crops a year it led</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.530" end="00:39:32.710" style="s2">to the creation of more settled villages</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.420" end="00:39:37.630" style="s2">as opposed to moving across the our</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.710" end="00:39:39.550" style="s2">resource spaces on this cycle you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.630" end="00:39:44.170" style="s2">from the sea to inland you know he wears</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.550" end="00:39:46.630" style="s2">so so I think each generation has had to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.170" end="00:39:48.700" style="s2">contend with technology in some form or</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.630" end="00:39:50.740" style="s2">another and when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.700" end="00:39:52.660" style="s2">indigenous people I mean I just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.740" end="00:39:54.220" style="s2">that this and my mum Tunes alias she and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.660" end="00:39:57.070" style="s2">just symptoms of what she&#39;s witnessed</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.220" end="00:39:59.260" style="s2">there near 80 years because you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.070" end="00:40:01.810" style="s2">when she was growing up on the bomb you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.260" end="00:40:04.780" style="s2">know they walk eight miles on the middle</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.810" end="00:40:08.290" style="s2">runner on a gravel road for them rode a</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.780" end="00:40:10.680" style="s2">horse you know and and in her lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.290" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">she got to see someone go to the moon a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.680" end="00:40:14.070" style="s2">microwave get a meeting you know all</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:17.770" style="s2">that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.070" end="00:40:20.859" style="s2">and and and and and in just in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.770" end="00:40:23.950" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve only had to experience</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.859" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">this sort of system squeeze system for</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.950" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">two hundred years so we&#39;re relatively</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:30.700" style="s2">young and it seems other indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:33.220" style="s2">peoples a bit longer you know when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.700" end="00:40:37.390" style="s2">think about North America South American</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.220" end="00:40:40.089" style="s2">places like there and and and but we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.390" end="00:40:42.369" style="s2">hit the consistency of the British in</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.089" end="00:40:44.290" style="s2">that time too so so from a Commonwealth</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.369" end="00:40:46.030" style="s2">perspective it&#39;s been helpful in</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.290" end="00:40:48.430" style="s2">communicating with and the other</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.030" end="00:40:51.880" style="s2">indigenous and communities because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.430" end="00:40:52.359" style="s2">got similar English symbology language</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.880" end="00:40:54.249" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.359" end="00:40:56.739" style="s2">sort of things so we can go to other</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.249" end="00:40:58.930" style="s2">parts of the Commonwealth in still feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.739" end="00:41:02.499" style="s2">at home in that seats because of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.930" end="00:41:05.499" style="s2">symbols of British Empire you know so I</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.499" end="00:41:07.509" style="s2">think the key is the most important</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.499" end="00:41:11.940" style="s2">thing is that intergenerational transfer</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.509" end="00:41:14.589" style="s2">of values because that that&#39;s what has</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:16.150" style="s2">maintained our resilience for a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.589" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">years within New Zealand</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.150" end="00:41:21.130" style="s2">and on the back of fifty thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:23.410" style="s2">and the Pacific could be like so so</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.130" end="00:41:26.559" style="s2">that&#39;s the critical part and and I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.410" end="00:41:33.009" style="s2">what we&#39;ve seen is a displacement of</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.559" end="00:41:34.869" style="s2">values and and and so so one of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.009" end="00:41:36.220" style="s2">interesting points so one of those</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.869" end="00:41:39.339" style="s2">things at the moment early on dealing</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.220" end="00:41:43.539" style="s2">with climate change is around going m</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.339" end="00:41:47.200" style="s2">Academy what I find really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.539" end="00:41:48.640" style="s2">is it just focused on on the future it</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.200" end="00:41:51.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really acknowledge the past</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.640" end="00:41:54.579" style="s2">there&#39;s a way of helping anchor values</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.670" end="00:41:59.589" style="s2">inca for cut you know because of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.579" end="00:42:03.130" style="s2">sense of connectedness over time and so</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.589" end="00:42:05.200" style="s2">I think that so al conversation of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.130" end="00:42:06.549" style="s2">young people is and they fall into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.200" end="00:42:10.239" style="s2">whole thing like oh can we do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.549" end="00:42:12.609" style="s2">can we do a madam attacker app and and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.239" end="00:42:16.059" style="s2">and what we sort of talk about is sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.609" end="00:42:18.460" style="s2">of two things that phone but the the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.059" end="00:42:21.999" style="s2">digital phone is really good like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.460" end="00:42:24.460" style="s2">diary for recording observing you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.999" end="00:42:25.390" style="s2">recording your observation camera film</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.460" end="00:42:29.769" style="s2">all that sort of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.390" end="00:42:32.890" style="s2">talking diary what I can&#39;t do is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.769" end="00:42:34.989" style="s2">actually connect with NATO so it can</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.890" end="00:42:36.519" style="s2">help support that and and and I see</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.989" end="00:42:38.259" style="s2">because it&#39;s nothing like going they</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.519" end="00:42:40.180" style="s2">actually step outside and have a look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.259" end="00:42:43.720" style="s2">what the moon is doing the apps not</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.180" end="00:42:47.470" style="s2">going to really tell you you know so so</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.720" end="00:42:50.519" style="s2">it&#39;s about and I think the critical</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.470" end="00:42:54.700" style="s2">thing is goes back to the storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.519" end="00:42:58.029" style="s2">so the storytelling is really the form</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.700" end="00:43:00.369" style="s2">that the code is the libitum and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.029" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">the code within the stories which is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.369" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">important stuff so like your point you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:06.200" style="s2">made around the elders saying oh look we</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:09.920" style="s2">don&#39;t go to that part</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.200" end="00:43:12.440" style="s2">the bush at that certain time because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.920" end="00:43:13.940" style="s2">the spirits now underneath it they would</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.440" end="00:43:16.250" style="s2">have been like we&#39;ve seen some other</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.940" end="00:43:17.540" style="s2">reason why they the story just creates</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.250" end="00:43:19.730" style="s2">that you know because it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.540" end="00:43:23.480" style="s2">stopping people going over the year to</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.730" end="00:43:25.910" style="s2">certain time of the year so so and this</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.480" end="00:43:29.270" style="s2">is part of the language so and the way</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.910" end="00:43:32.180" style="s2">the Western square system have said are</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.270" end="00:43:33.620" style="s2">those are just myths and legions there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.180" end="00:43:39.140" style="s2">actually the other holders of the code</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.620" end="00:43:40.820" style="s2">and and and and so um so the opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.140" end="00:43:44.390" style="s2">is how can the next couple of</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.820" end="00:43:47.240" style="s2">generations in their context be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.390" end="00:43:50.000" style="s2">encode those stories with the code</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.240" end="00:43:54.050" style="s2">because it&#39;s about the code and if they</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.000" end="00:43:57.100" style="s2">able to share the code for YouTube or</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.050" end="00:43:59.600" style="s2">whatever form in order to help connect</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.100" end="00:44:02.780" style="s2">the values in that&#39;s the most important</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.600" end="00:44:04.940" style="s2">thing because often we get caught up at</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.780" end="00:44:07.640" style="s2">that super at the surface level of this</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.940" end="00:44:09.920" style="s2">technology it&#39;s actually if we put that</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.640" end="00:44:12.280" style="s2">tick technology within a circle system</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.920" end="00:44:15.230" style="s2">then that&#39;s all good it&#39;s sort of their</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.280" end="00:44:17.240" style="s2">methodology and method mm-hmm so using</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.230" end="00:44:18.890" style="s2">screen methods and a circle methodology</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.240" end="00:44:20.690" style="s2">but it&#39;s all good because of the context</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.890" end="00:44:23.870" style="s2">there it&#39;s it&#39;s um and how you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.690" end="00:44:25.490" style="s2">it and as opposed to square technology</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.870" end="00:44:27.710" style="s2">in a square system that&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.490" end="00:44:29.900" style="s2">the risk and that&#39;s their shift</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.710" end="00:44:32.450" style="s2">displacement or values so it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.900" end="00:44:35.510" style="s2">much the tick itself it&#39;s a system that</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.450" end="00:44:38.180" style="s2">detects it&#39;s um and and that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.510" end="00:44:40.130" style="s2">sort of explain what the operating</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.180" end="00:44:44.030" style="s2">system like what the whole operating</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.130" end="00:44:45.350" style="s2">system whole systems are is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.030" end="00:44:47.780" style="s2">have different models of practice that</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.350" end="00:44:50.380" style="s2">are like EPS that sit within either</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.780" end="00:44:53.810" style="s2">Apple or Microsoft operating system and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.380" end="00:44:56.360" style="s2">and it&#39;s really about describing the</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.810" end="00:44:57.890" style="s2">circle system in that way is there you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.360" end="00:45:00.710" style="s2">can have all these different tools</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.890" end="00:45:03.590" style="s2">frameworks but a sexual system that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.710" end="00:45:06.710" style="s2">sits in and where you use it and there</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.590" end="00:45:09.890" style="s2">comes down to your values you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.710" end="00:45:14.080" style="s2">in what we&#39;re driving with counsel in</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.890" end="00:45:16.670" style="s2">terms of the decision making is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.080" end="00:45:18.230" style="s2">when we&#39;ve gone through the climate</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.670" end="00:45:20.089" style="s2">change risk frameworks that have been</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.230" end="00:45:23.410" style="s2">developed they all human centered</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.089" end="00:45:26.390" style="s2">and what we&#39;re saying there&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.410" end="00:45:28.759" style="s2">what is the risk to nature what is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.390" end="00:45:32.749" style="s2">risk to the lien not just the rest to</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.759" end="00:45:35.209" style="s2">people and and and and they&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.749" end="00:45:37.789" style="s2">heart of it what is the capacity and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.209" end="00:45:39.319" style="s2">ability of the lane to care for nature</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.789" end="00:45:41.150" style="s2">in people what is the capacity and</p>

<p begin="00:45:41.150" end="00:45:46.160" style="s2">know that so when you start to think</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.130" end="00:45:48.049" style="s2">about the types of decision-making we</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.160" end="00:45:50.569" style="s2">need to be thinking about is putting all</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.049" end="00:45:53.319" style="s2">those things in balance and and and more</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.569" end="00:45:56.390" style="s2">recently what we&#39;ve sort of seen in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.319" end="00:45:58.609" style="s2">treaty settlement type process between</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.390" end="00:46:01.910" style="s2">and some of your indigenous tribes in</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.609" end="00:46:05.509" style="s2">the government is the creation of legal</p>

<p begin="00:46:05.509" end="00:46:13.369" style="s2">for where my mother comes from a a sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.650" end="00:46:15.019" style="s2">of mountainous region and and when the</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.369" end="00:46:16.579" style="s2">government and their tribe were</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.019" end="00:46:19.160" style="s2">negotiating what the settlement will</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.579" end="00:46:22.519" style="s2">look like the government offered some</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.160" end="00:46:24.019" style="s2">joint management of a national pact and</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.519" end="00:46:26.199" style="s2">our tribes who actually that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.019" end="00:46:28.519" style="s2">national pact to us that&#39;s how ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.199" end="00:46:31.519" style="s2">and we don&#39;t want to jointly manage a</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.519" end="00:46:33.229" style="s2">and sister so so the in negotiations got</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.519" end="00:46:36.890" style="s2">suspended for almost two years because</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.229" end="00:46:38.900" style="s2">of this impasse or will view in some</p>

<p begin="00:46:38.900" end="00:46:45.769" style="s2">why don&#39;t we create legal personality</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:50.359" style="s2">and what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll share care of</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.769" end="00:46:53.179" style="s2">this ancestor and and so so so in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.359" end="00:46:55.789" style="s2">sense the rights of nature have been</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.179" end="00:46:58.400" style="s2">acknowledged hmm and so when we think</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.789" end="00:47:00.380" style="s2">about equity and equality it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.400" end="00:47:03.799" style="s2">from a human sense it&#39;s also they you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.380" end="00:47:06.229" style="s2">know so unless at the heart of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.799" end="00:47:08.420" style="s2">reciprocity between humanity and nature</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.229" end="00:47:12.799" style="s2">in the way that we care for each other</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.420" end="00:47:14.829" style="s2">and and and I find it fascinating to see</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.799" end="00:47:14.829" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.089" end="00:47:23.999" style="s2">how much agility you have in like the</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.869" end="00:47:40.589" style="s2">that then we both agree that climate</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.759" end="00:47:42.989" style="s2">change is just as you were saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.589" end="00:47:45.509" style="s2">covered nineteen is a message that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.989" end="00:47:47.369" style="s2">need to change our ways otherwise the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.509" end="00:47:49.940" style="s2">message is what will get harder you said</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.369" end="00:47:54.509" style="s2">earlier before we started recording and</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.940" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">climate change is we are on the path to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.509" end="00:48:02.900" style="s2">the message is getting extremely hard</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.400" end="00:48:05.039" style="s2">but we&#39;ve both met at this meeting of</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.039" end="00:48:09.630" style="s2">within the Commonwealth and and and</p>

<p begin="00:48:22.890" end="00:48:30.089" style="s2">unemployment we&#39;ve got climate change</p>

<p begin="00:48:30.089" end="00:48:35.910" style="s2">to actually start from reframing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.400" end="00:48:37.859" style="s2">start start from potential and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.910" end="00:48:40.710" style="s2">that you&#39;ve framed the sort of over</p>

<p begin="00:48:51.089" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">what would happen if we learned to</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.489" end="00:48:58.769" style="s2">reconnect to that ancient lineage of</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.680" end="00:49:01.650" style="s2">knowledge that is that understands that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.769" end="00:49:05.210" style="s2">the land is our ancestors that we we</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.650" end="00:49:09.390" style="s2">come from this earth and then very</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.210" end="00:49:11.839" style="s2">carefully not as a sort of rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.390" end="00:49:15.719" style="s2">all technology but as a real</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.839" end="00:49:17.999" style="s2">soul-searching inquiry into how do we</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.719" end="00:49:20.150" style="s2">use this technology wisely so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.999" end="00:49:23.190" style="s2">become our master rather than it stays</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.150" end="00:49:27.780" style="s2">in service to to us and through that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.190" end="00:49:29.850" style="s2">service to the land and to life M the</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.780" end="00:49:31.650" style="s2">how do you find I mean this is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.850" end="00:49:35.550" style="s2">beautiful example you just gave in terms</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.650" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">of how in that process of saying no we</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.550" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">don&#39;t want management of a national park</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">because we don&#39;t manage a land ancestor</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:46.500" style="s2">to get to inviting the square system to</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:49.740" style="s2">arrive at a point where they can</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.500" end="00:49:51.660" style="s2">understand that - then do Aikido with</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.740" end="00:49:58.610" style="s2">their system or create legal personage</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.660" end="00:50:02.610" style="s2">for the land and it&#39;s a wonderful shift</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.610" end="00:50:04.500" style="s2">in terms of how that land is related to</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.610" end="00:50:08.550" style="s2">but it&#39;s that the powerful shift is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.500" end="00:50:10.470" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually changed the minds of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.550" end="00:50:12.690" style="s2">square system of many people in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.470" end="00:50:16.950" style="s2">square system we have to engage with</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.690" end="00:50:18.510" style="s2">that way of thinking and but it feels</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.950" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">that these sort of things need to happen</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.510" end="00:50:25.230" style="s2">really place sourced and place-based</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:29.270" style="s2">yeah I think - because I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.230" end="00:50:33.600" style="s2">what&#39;s really critical and what is that</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.270" end="00:50:35.310" style="s2">we do have a Western system could</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.600" end="00:50:39.240" style="s2">regenerative development thinking in a</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.310" end="00:50:42.570" style="s2">circular system and and I think things</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.240" end="00:50:46.200" style="s2">like climate change in in covered 19 is</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.570" end="00:50:50.220" style="s2">driving us to at least become aware of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.200" end="00:50:54.510" style="s2">sequel systems thinking and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.220" end="00:50:57.150" style="s2">what what has been working well within</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.510" end="00:50:58.710" style="s2">Auckland is there and this is the impact</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.150" end="00:51:00.770" style="s2">of the work they&#39;re building being have</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.710" end="00:51:06.980" style="s2">been doing rien region Assessors there</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.770" end="00:51:10.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve got quite a significant number of</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.980" end="00:51:13.320" style="s2">regenerative practitioners and thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.020" end="00:51:16.770" style="s2">and and albeit at the moment as it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.320" end="00:51:19.200" style="s2">being tied to placemaking which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.770" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">ironic to him in itself because place</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:22.640" style="s2">sort of shapes you not the other area</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:29.010" style="s2">but but you know it&#39;s a North American</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.640" end="00:51:30.810" style="s2">urban sort of development - and and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.010" end="00:51:33.510" style="s2">that worked at a program that I talked</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.810" end="00:51:36.740" style="s2">about probably a 50 year program is this</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.510" end="00:51:40.560" style="s2">opportunity and so what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.740" end="00:51:43.660" style="s2">we&#39;re partnering with - Sukie</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.560" end="00:51:46.540" style="s2">systems approaches the regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.660" end="00:51:49.810" style="s2">thinking and indigenous thinking and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.540" end="00:51:53.710" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the key is that if we</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.810" end="00:51:56.849" style="s2">can start to recirculate squeezed</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.710" end="00:52:00.150" style="s2">systems as the square P agree on hope</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.849" end="00:52:03.550" style="s2">and climate change covert nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.150" end="00:52:07.540" style="s2">economic recovery crates that window for</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.550" end="00:52:12.790" style="s2">us to sort of reimagine reframe in resit</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.540" end="00:52:14.920" style="s2">they think because of we can get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.790" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">succour systems you know in Maori</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.920" end="00:52:17.920" style="s2">culture when we greet each other we rub</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:19.660" style="s2">noses in Heba homey</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.920" end="00:52:21.460" style="s2">so what we&#39;re wondering that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.660" end="00:52:25.869" style="s2">they have those two circles have a Hong</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.460" end="00:52:28.089" style="s2">E and and then by literally</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.869" end="00:52:30.130" style="s2">recalibrating with the binoculars you</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.089" end="00:52:31.690" style="s2">actually start to develop the shared</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.130" end="00:52:33.609" style="s2">view in this new space where new</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.690" end="00:52:35.260" style="s2">knowledge and this is where the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.609" end="00:52:37.599" style="s2">indigenous Asian of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.260" end="00:52:41.500" style="s2">systems work ooh</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.599" end="00:52:45.760" style="s2">because I think because of past because</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.500" end="00:52:48.310" style="s2">of history the trauma we all carry we</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.760" end="00:52:51.250" style="s2">need to find our way of at least coming</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.310" end="00:52:53.790" style="s2">together and to do a hungee so that we</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.250" end="00:52:57.010" style="s2">start to share their distance and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.790" end="00:52:58.900" style="s2">and then it&#39;s recognizing their food</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.010" end="00:53:00.970" style="s2">space so in our thinking we sort of have</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.900" end="00:53:04.750" style="s2">this formula of one plus one equals</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.970" end="00:53:06.430" style="s2">three and then and then together the two</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.750" end="00:53:09.130" style="s2">binocular views actually creates that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.430" end="00:53:11.170" style="s2">infinity and so a lot of your framing</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.130" end="00:53:12.940" style="s2">reason eights that type of cycle</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.170" end="00:53:18.550" style="s2">thinking of sharing knowledge sharing</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.940" end="00:53:20.170" style="s2">you know and and I think that and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.550" end="00:53:21.460" style="s2">think that that like what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.170" end="00:53:23.710" style="s2">is that it&#39;s not about telling people</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.460" end="00:53:26.950" style="s2">how to think it&#39;s inviting them to look</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.770" end="00:54:59.820" style="s2">expresses it in a lovely way of saying</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.540" end="00:55:03.970" style="s2">that all life is in tension between</p>

<p begin="00:55:17.530" end="00:55:25.390" style="s2">time and as Western people are starting</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.380" end="00:55:29.080" style="s2">to wake up of the shortcomings of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.390" end="00:55:31.240" style="s2">square system and one of their thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.080" end="00:55:34.690" style="s2">traps like you&#39;ve heard us talk about a</p>

<p begin="00:55:40.450" end="00:55:43.720" style="s2">thinking that is no longer serving us to</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.220" end="00:55:46.150" style="s2">this new thinking that is so much better</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.720" end="00:55:47.980" style="s2">because all the old is now not worth it</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.150" end="00:55:50.619" style="s2">anymore the last time we did that swing</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.980" end="00:55:54.400" style="s2">we forgot all the indigenous knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.619" end="00:55:57.490" style="s2">and called it primitive and and and so I</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.400" end="00:56:00.450" style="s2">I would love to hear from from the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.490" end="00:56:03.970" style="s2">wisdom that your lineage carries and</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.450" end="00:56:06.720" style="s2">this ego eco relation</p>

<p begin="00:56:06.720" end="00:56:12.970" style="s2">if we actually embrace ego in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.320" end="00:56:14.980" style="s2">different way like that what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.970" end="00:56:17.230" style="s2">learned from working with the way of</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.980" end="00:56:19.750" style="s2">counsel which comes out of the North</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.230" end="00:56:22.060" style="s2">American native indigenous tradition is</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.750" end="00:56:25.240" style="s2">you always ask three question</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.060" end="00:56:27.790" style="s2">does it serve myself does it serve my</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.240" end="00:56:34.440" style="s2">people and does it serve the whole or</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.790" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">life yeah yeah em how do we get into a</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.440" end="00:56:44.290" style="s2">healthy relationship with providing for</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:46.960" style="s2">our families and our personal immediate</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.290" end="00:56:49.000" style="s2">needs but in the spirit that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.960" end="00:56:51.910" style="s2">base work that we need to do of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.000" end="00:56:56.440" style="s2">donut of the ground of yeah mother earth</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.910" end="00:56:59.640" style="s2">that that that we that then enables us</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.440" end="00:57:01.900" style="s2">to to be resourced to be in service of</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.640" end="00:57:05.700" style="s2">the relationship between father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.900" end="00:57:07.630" style="s2">grandmother the larger system how do you</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.700" end="00:57:10.270" style="s2">relate to that from from your</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.630" end="00:57:12.070" style="s2">perspective yeah I mean I you that</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.270" end="00:57:13.030" style="s2">really resonates with me and you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.070" end="00:57:16.839" style="s2">picked it up in the video</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.030" end="00:57:20.530" style="s2">Yoel video in that last but weird talks</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.839" end="00:57:23.260" style="s2">about you know quo call queer katawa</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.530" end="00:57:25.810" style="s2">which is you me and us together that</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.260" end="00:57:28.540" style="s2">same thinking and and I think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.810" end="00:57:30.820" style="s2">almost like um that visualization of</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.540" end="00:57:40.150" style="s2">ripples in the pool we&#39;re all of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.820" end="00:57:42.849" style="s2">same pool and and as it representing</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.150" end="00:57:46.660" style="s2">there the greater sense of me is in</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.849" end="00:57:51.160" style="s2">though we yeah so so that&#39;s it seems of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.660" end="00:57:57.010" style="s2">self you know and and that is in that</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.160" end="00:58:01.300" style="s2">sense of um power of a wider family my</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.010" end="00:58:04.480" style="s2">community but also that is nature place</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.300" end="00:58:06.730" style="s2">in people not just my human community in</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.480" end="00:58:10.750" style="s2">that sense you know and in the minute</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.730" end="00:58:12.430" style="s2">that isn&#39;t just an intellectual or how</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.750" end="00:58:13.869" style="s2">nice were all one they&#39;re all part of</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.430" end="00:58:16.840" style="s2">nature&#39;s like the way that sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.869" end="00:58:19.840" style="s2">said in in in Western institutions</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.840" end="00:58:23.680" style="s2">and like onion is with the ecology spoke</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.840" end="00:58:29.200" style="s2">of the ecological self and they it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.680" end="00:58:32.080" style="s2">real embodied fully understanding</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.200" end="00:58:34.300" style="s2">oneself adds life that with that comes</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.080" end="00:58:35.860" style="s2">the the different perspective of time as</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.300" end="00:58:38.070" style="s2">you were saying earlier the fifty year</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.860" end="00:58:42.310" style="s2">project that you won&#39;t see finished and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.070" end="00:58:45.880" style="s2">the minute you you understand or one</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.310" end="00:58:47.710" style="s2">understands like oneself as life there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.880" end="00:58:54.520" style="s2">actually a connection to a certain</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.710" end="00:58:57.490" style="s2">immortality purpose you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.520" end="00:59:00.130" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think one thing we it sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.490" end="00:59:02.020" style="s2">of standard controversial one of them I</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.130" end="00:59:05.410" style="s2">think was a committee meeting what</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.020" end="00:59:07.840" style="s2">counsel was I said you know what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.410" end="00:59:11.560" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is that you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.840" end="00:59:13.300" style="s2">fighting for your survival as humanity</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.560" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">the thing though is that I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.300" end="00:59:18.280" style="s2">confident that my fucking Papa is gonna</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:23.020" style="s2">last forever because my DNA is made up</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.280" end="00:59:26.410" style="s2">of sadness you know so so I will still</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.020" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">be around or my DNA was still in some</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.410" end="00:59:29.530" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:31.990" style="s2">I don&#39;t have any control over that form</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.530" end="00:59:34.180" style="s2">that&#39;s why our insistence to determine</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.990" end="00:59:36.070" style="s2">the net since you know so because when</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.180" end="00:59:39.580" style="s2">you sort of think about our fucker Papa</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.070" end="00:59:42.130" style="s2">humility that the form we are now is and</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.580" end="00:59:44.140" style="s2">what the form we started with and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.130" end="00:59:46.360" style="s2">every hundreds of thousands of years you</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.140" end="00:59:49.360" style="s2">know so so when we sort of think about</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.360" end="00:59:51.550" style="s2">in and that&#39;s why what I love is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.360" end="00:59:53.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a our essence and the cellular</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.550" end="00:59:56.410" style="s2">level in a cellular level it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.650" end="00:59:58.120" style="s2">DNA it&#39;s the same fuckup upper and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.410" end="01:00:01.480" style="s2">fucker Papa that we share with nature</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.120" end="01:00:06.300" style="s2">and other you know and so and there is</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.480" end="01:00:08.980" style="s2">that um sort of I guess goes back to um</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.300" end="01:00:11.520" style="s2">seeing the space that connects us you</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.980" end="01:00:16.050" style="s2">know our ancestors were able to navigate</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.520" end="01:00:18.870" style="s2">across the Pacific I</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.050" end="01:00:21.750" style="s2">thousands of years because beer view was</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.870" end="01:00:23.460" style="s2">the water connected or the island they</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.750" end="01:00:25.050" style="s2">went aiming for this island it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.460" end="01:00:27.150" style="s2">actually the water that connected</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.050" end="01:00:30.240" style="s2">everything so so it&#39;s that sort of view</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.150" end="01:00:31.680" style="s2">of connectedness in understanding so so</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.240" end="01:00:35.550" style="s2">when we sort of see their whole living</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.680" end="01:00:37.740" style="s2">system of the universe so we look to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.550" end="01:00:40.410" style="s2">black of the space not all or sprinkly</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.740" end="01:00:43.170" style="s2">of the stars you know that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.410" end="01:00:44.880" style="s2">again those slightly different world</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.170" end="01:00:47.490" style="s2">views of what I would say a circular</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.880" end="01:00:50.310" style="s2">will view systems you as we actually</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.490" end="01:00:52.170" style="s2">recognize the importance of space so so</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.310" end="01:00:56.520" style="s2">even to the point that our ancestors had</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.170" end="01:01:01.050" style="s2">names for the space in between atoms or</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.520" end="01:01:05.580" style="s2">with an atom an ability describe what</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.050" end="01:01:09.380" style="s2">that was you know early maps there our</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.580" end="01:01:12.480" style="s2">ancestors drew in 1800 was almost this</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.380" end="01:01:16.350" style="s2">bird&#39;s eye GPS view of the form of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.480" end="01:01:20.370" style="s2">lane and when the cartography or that</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.350" end="01:01:22.050" style="s2">time was though almost picture type to</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.370" end="01:01:24.000" style="s2">one dimension all sort of view wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.050" end="01:01:27.000" style="s2">the bird&#39;s eye view was the way that</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.000" end="01:01:28.710" style="s2">right you know so so again that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.000" end="01:01:31.770" style="s2">whole ability of where you can locate</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.710" end="01:01:34.230" style="s2">yourself to appreciate that view of</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.770" end="01:01:36.360" style="s2">perspective and that&#39;s why I always come</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.230" end="01:01:39.180" style="s2">back to the UM the view of running and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.360" end="01:01:42.150" style="s2">Papa the sky father earth mother on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.180" end="01:01:43.860" style="s2">moon because we knew seed and it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.150" end="01:01:46.920" style="s2">of the images I&#39;d like using in my</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.860" end="01:01:48.300" style="s2">presentations is be able to and then I</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.920" end="01:01:52.890" style="s2">guess that&#39;s one of those opportunities</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.300" end="01:01:56.040" style="s2">is there it&#39;s enabling people do have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.890" end="01:02:02.220" style="s2">view from the moon to really appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.040" end="01:02:04.650" style="s2">the whole in the relationship of Adomian</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.220" end="01:02:07.770" style="s2">Papa because when we earth beyond we</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.650" end="01:02:10.320" style="s2">only see this up and down D yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.770" end="01:02:12.090" style="s2">where&#39;s when you step to the side and</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.320" end="01:02:17.210" style="s2">you see the full appreciation of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.090" end="01:02:17.210" style="s2">relationship and so I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.430" end="01:02:24.950" style="s2">and obviously it&#39;s how we because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.740" end="01:02:27.359" style="s2">almost got to do it as three generations</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.950" end="01:02:30.510" style="s2">we sort of represent that middle</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.359" end="01:02:32.160" style="s2">generation in terms of when thinking</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.510" end="01:02:34.829" style="s2">about our parents we know with an</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.160" end="01:02:37.230" style="s2">elderly memory and then you think about</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.829" end="01:02:40.440" style="s2">our children in there our grandchildren</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.230" end="01:02:43.160" style="s2">so so within three living generations we</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.440" end="01:02:46.589" style="s2">influence another two or three beyond it</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.160" end="01:02:49.559" style="s2">or they&#39;ve been you know so so so we</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.589" end="01:02:51.059" style="s2">need to move through this journey in</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.559" end="01:02:52.589" style="s2">that way where we do not have an</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.059" end="01:02:56.250" style="s2">intergenerational weight within our</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.589" end="01:02:59.250" style="s2">families and because that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.250" end="01:03:01.980" style="s2">transfer of values occur from generation</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.250" end="01:03:03.809" style="s2">to generation and then they are being in</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.980" end="01:03:07.680" style="s2">our modelling we&#39;re teaching our</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.809" end="01:03:09.450" style="s2">children to be good grandparents in that</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.680" end="01:03:11.160" style="s2">way you know but they&#39;ve got to do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.450" end="01:03:13.530" style="s2">with the near context within the tools</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.160" end="01:03:16.230" style="s2">they hear with a near life but it</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.530" end="01:03:19.859" style="s2">ultimately is about the transfer of</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.230" end="01:03:23.299" style="s2">those values in the value of boats fucka</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.859" end="01:03:27.180" style="s2">Papa relationships which i think is the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.299" end="01:03:29.040" style="s2">key to rien digitizing humanity and</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.180" end="01:03:31.410" style="s2">whatever language you use it at a</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.040" end="01:03:33.589" style="s2">fundamental base level we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.410" end="01:03:38.299" style="s2">talking about those intergenerational</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.589" end="01:03:44.430" style="s2">symbiotic relationships just made me</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.299" end="01:03:46.589" style="s2">tuned into something that I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.430" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">particularly like you earlier when you</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.589" end="01:03:52.559" style="s2">spoke about if you think of it in the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:54.420" style="s2">Pacific since your ancestry goes back</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.559" end="01:03:57.720" style="s2">fifty thousand years and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.420" end="01:03:59.940" style="s2">Pacific Islanders and it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.720" end="01:04:05.250" style="s2">particular type like if you you could</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.940" end="01:04:09.690" style="s2">almost say that the there&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.250" end="01:04:13.530" style="s2">ocean lineage and the land lineage of of</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.690" end="01:04:16.440" style="s2">our ancestry that and and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.530" end="01:04:19.170" style="s2">representing the the ocean lineage and</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.440" end="01:04:21.390" style="s2">and this image that you did that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.170" end="01:04:23.880" style="s2">like just recently a friend of mine who</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.390" end="01:04:26.050" style="s2">who last winter sale - Antarctica&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.880" end="01:04:27.369" style="s2">shared a map of</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.050" end="01:04:31.599" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.369" end="01:04:35.589" style="s2">the world that is ocean centric yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.599" end="01:04:38.880" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s basically the land is just a</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.589" end="01:04:41.380" style="s2">little bit in between and yeah and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:45.009" style="s2">increasingly like like last week I was</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.380" end="01:04:47.919" style="s2">invited to put some input into a</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.009" end="01:04:49.689" style="s2">workshop that the Ocean Race which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.919" end="01:04:53.589" style="s2">the former Whitbread around the world</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.689" end="01:04:59.669" style="s2">and the Volvo Ocean Race not just the</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.589" end="01:05:03.130" style="s2">Ocean Race and they&#39;ve put this idea of</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.669" end="01:05:05.650" style="s2">supporting ocean health at the center of</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.130" end="01:05:07.239" style="s2">their communication strategy in using</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.650" end="01:05:09.489" style="s2">the race around the world and all the</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.239" end="01:05:12.630" style="s2">media attention to to really highlight</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.489" end="01:05:14.859" style="s2">the issue of ocean health after the last</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.630" end="01:05:16.719" style="s2">race around the world they did a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.859" end="01:05:19.449" style="s2">research on ocean plastics and really</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.719" end="01:05:21.039" style="s2">helped to highlight that issue and they</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.449" end="01:05:23.709" style="s2">began to realize that that&#39;s a sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.039" end="01:05:25.749" style="s2">problem scent centred approach and and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.709" end="01:05:29.709" style="s2">actually using the concept of health is</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.749" end="01:05:32.189" style="s2">much more circular already and in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.709" end="01:05:35.650" style="s2">context I learned about a man that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.189" end="01:05:36.999" style="s2">you know Glenn Edney if you heard of</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.650" end="01:05:40.299" style="s2">it&#39;s an organization in New Zealand</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.999" end="01:05:43.079" style="s2">called ocean spirit all right</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.299" end="01:05:45.849" style="s2">yeah and he wrote I wrote a book about</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.079" end="01:05:48.939" style="s2">an exec can remember so the ocean is</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.849" end="01:05:51.789" style="s2">alive or something and and as you were</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.939" end="01:05:56.949" style="s2">just speaking I thinking to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.789" end="01:06:02.109" style="s2">if we want to refit our human family</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.949" end="01:06:05.279" style="s2">into the wider family and paying</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.109" end="01:06:05.279" style="s2">attention to the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.410" end="01:06:11.680" style="s2">life is animated water and that we all</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.370" end="01:06:15.660" style="s2">from the oceans that our tears our ocean</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.680" end="01:06:17.980" style="s2">that Alice blood is ocean salinity and</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.660" end="01:06:19.810" style="s2">also understanding like in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.980" end="01:06:21.580" style="s2">more problem conversation focused</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.810" end="01:06:25.480" style="s2">conversations around climate change I</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.580" end="01:06:27.520" style="s2">think we need to urgently and put the</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.480" end="01:06:30.100" style="s2">ocean at the center because that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.520" end="01:06:34.660" style="s2">the big buffer but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.100" end="01:06:36.460" style="s2">long-term like if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.660" end="01:06:38.440" style="s2">protect the oceans and of course we can</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.460" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">only do that if we change how how we</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.440" end="01:06:42.000" style="s2">deal with the land as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.570" end="01:06:51.650" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re not going to avoid kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.940" end="01:06:51.650" style="s2">cataclysmic climate change how do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.740" end="01:06:57.600" style="s2">how do you bring in to the climate</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.200" end="01:06:59.660" style="s2">change conversation Orkut logic there</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.600" end="01:07:02.730" style="s2">the Auckland climate change adaptation</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.660" end="01:07:06.660" style="s2">plan this whole shift in perspective</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.730" end="01:07:11.150" style="s2">towards um how critical the ocean is to</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.660" end="01:07:14.670" style="s2">life yes so we&#39;ve sort of I guess</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.150" end="01:07:19.530" style="s2">anchored on water you know in the same</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.670" end="01:07:23.520" style="s2">sort of seats and because in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.530" end="01:07:25.370" style="s2">our part of our creation narratives what</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.520" end="01:07:31.710" style="s2">we call y hora which is the life-giving</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.370" end="01:07:36.000" style="s2">waters and and but also our spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.710" end="01:07:40.980" style="s2">essence we refer to as way two to three</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.000" end="01:07:43.890" style="s2">waters flow within you and so just their</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.980" end="01:07:45.930" style="s2">whole reflection of the importance of</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.890" end="01:07:49.470" style="s2">water the water cycle the fuck off of</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.930" end="01:07:53.820" style="s2">water in that way and and and so one of</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.470" end="01:07:58.470" style="s2">those so so the big sort of El El</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.820" end="01:08:01.920" style="s2">pathway sort of transformational pathway</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.470" end="01:08:05.010" style="s2">we&#39;ve got what we call two too short to</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:09.750" style="s2">medium type ships and three big shifts</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.010" end="01:08:11.880" style="s2">that I framed this five key drivers a</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.750" end="01:08:13.560" style="s2">few life in terms of certainly our body</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.880" end="01:08:16.980" style="s2">response to climate change but also</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.560" end="01:08:19.589" style="s2">advocating to council and so so these</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.980" end="01:08:21.660" style="s2">that the two short to medium chefs is</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.589" end="01:08:26.190" style="s2">really about a recalibration of business</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.660" end="01:08:30.420" style="s2">as usual to reap to realign to do that</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.190" end="01:08:32.910" style="s2">well-being sort of focus the second but</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.420" end="01:08:34.890" style="s2">which often isn&#39;t being talked about and</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.910" end="01:08:36.060" style="s2">you talk about that just their paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.890" end="01:08:38.520" style="s2">shift from here to there</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.060" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">no one talks about the in could be</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.520" end="01:08:44.220" style="s2">incremental shop so so we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:49.890" style="s2">about how do we prepare communities for</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.220" end="01:08:53.000" style="s2">the shift and and so there&#39;s a key piece</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.890" end="01:08:56.910" style="s2">of work around educating informing</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.000" end="01:08:59.070" style="s2">developing the tools to enable the show</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.910" end="01:09:01.920" style="s2">so if we&#39;re gonna talk about a shift and</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.070" end="01:09:04.170" style="s2">land use how you gonna talk to our</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.920" end="01:09:08.180" style="s2">farmers on what that is about you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.170" end="01:09:11.810" style="s2">in imposing new legislation around</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.180" end="01:09:14.370" style="s2">emissions you know it&#39;s either blunt</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.810" end="01:09:18.690" style="s2">stick or you know a carrot type where is</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.370" end="01:09:21.690" style="s2">actually shifting the agriculture sort</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.690" end="01:09:24.660" style="s2">of system to behave what we call like a</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.690" end="01:09:26.340" style="s2">coy turkey a guardian custodian of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.660" end="01:09:29.220" style="s2">reciprocal fucking Papa relationships</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.220" end="01:09:34.980" style="s2">land is a ancestor in some of our</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.600" end="01:09:38.160" style="s2">economic thinkers here are saying that</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.980" end="01:09:42.980" style="s2">if if the businesses in their adopted</p>

<p begin="01:09:42.980" end="01:09:47.940" style="s2">shifting away from natural resource is</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.109" end="01:09:50.220" style="s2">you know something to manage to have us</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.940" end="01:09:52.320" style="s2">to actually what we call a tongue is a</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.220" end="01:09:56.010" style="s2">treasure your relationship totally</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.320" end="01:09:57.690" style="s2">shifts with with the key of looking</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.010" end="01:10:00.090" style="s2">after there is a place to resource the</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.690" end="01:10:03.510" style="s2">minute so these are species of work</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.090" end="01:10:05.550" style="s2">around preparing for the change and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.510" end="01:10:09.360" style="s2">three big shifts one is what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.550" end="01:10:11.460" style="s2">calling the regeneration of ecological</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.360" end="01:10:14.280" style="s2">systems and and let&#39;s look at a whole</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.460" end="01:10:17.160" style="s2">catchment approach but with a specific</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.280" end="01:10:21.390" style="s2">focus on parts of the catchment so we</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.160" end="01:10:25.860" style="s2">talk about basically the ocean the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.390" end="01:10:28.800" style="s2">harbor wetlands and in their upper</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.860" end="01:10:34.260" style="s2">catchment they&#39;re the work you need to</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.800" end="01:10:36.810" style="s2">do is a whole system catchment so so you</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.260" end="01:10:39.690" style="s2">know and and so but what we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.810" end="01:10:41.670" style="s2">at is the cycle of water in those fucker</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.690" end="01:10:43.650" style="s2">Papa relationships from the ocean and</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.670" end="01:10:46.590" style="s2">then in the importance of wetlands</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.650" end="01:10:48.150" style="s2">within that context because they&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.590" end="01:10:50.190" style="s2">narratives the wetlands were actually a</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.150" end="01:10:52.860" style="s2">domain there because some of our</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.190" end="01:10:56.670" style="s2">ancestors like kangaroo who&#39;s the old</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.860" end="01:11:01.500" style="s2">covenant - like Poseidon or niching so</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.670" end="01:11:04.470" style="s2">in our in our pantheon of ancestors they</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.500" end="01:11:07.179" style="s2">they sort of lived in a darkness of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.470" end="01:11:09.670" style="s2">appearance of briefs and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.179" end="01:11:11.199" style="s2">some breaks back CA da hey why don&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.670" end="01:11:14.920" style="s2">sort of separate them so there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.199" end="01:11:17.590" style="s2">room for us and then some of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.920" end="01:11:19.090" style="s2">siblings took sides with the parents</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.590" end="01:11:21.400" style="s2">some didn&#39;t want them to be separated</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.090" end="01:11:23.890" style="s2">some I&#39;m gonna go up dead I was gonna go</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.400" end="01:11:27.159" style="s2">mum and it created another ruction</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.890" end="01:11:29.860" style="s2">across the siblings and and so we have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.159" end="01:11:33.610" style="s2">narrative - why climate change exists in</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.860" end="01:11:35.560" style="s2">their context and and basically Tong</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.610" end="01:11:40.030" style="s2">Aurora who&#39;s their Neptune Cafferty</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.560" end="01:11:43.000" style="s2">who&#39;s L in sister wounds Thani who</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.030" end="01:11:44.650" style="s2">actually separated the two parents he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.000" end="01:11:46.960" style="s2">sort of one of our ancestors for</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.650" end="01:11:49.780" style="s2">humility for the forest birds all that</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.960" end="01:11:56.230" style="s2">type of thing but it but he&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.780" end="01:11:59.790" style="s2">provider of human knowledge and so so</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.230" end="01:12:01.900" style="s2">basically those siblings had this battle</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.790" end="01:12:03.280" style="s2">because of the issues they had with each</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.900" end="01:12:06.699" style="s2">other in the separation of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.280" end="01:12:11.020" style="s2">appearance and what happened was -</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.699" end="01:12:13.300" style="s2">ganged up on one who which was tougher T</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.020" end="01:12:15.340" style="s2">and tougher he limped off the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.300" end="01:12:17.469" style="s2">battlefield and saying well okay</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.340" end="01:12:21.070" style="s2">you won this time but I&#39;m gonna take my</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.469" end="01:12:24.100" style="s2">wrath out on your children so so the</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.070" end="01:12:26.560" style="s2">name did teruki or tougher T Maori name</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.100" end="01:12:30.370" style="s2">for the climate plain is refused to the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.560" end="01:12:33.150" style="s2">struggles or frustrations of tougher and</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.370" end="01:12:36.010" style="s2">but also tongue or or the ocean as</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.150" end="01:12:38.710" style="s2">biting at the heels of Tammy in the way</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.010" end="01:12:40.690" style="s2">of erosion and all those sort of things</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.710" end="01:12:43.570" style="s2">so big storm events so what we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.690" end="01:12:46.630" style="s2">seen as witnessing the sparrow occurring</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.570" end="01:12:49.060" style="s2">between our ancestors but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.630" end="01:12:50.890" style="s2">happened is part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.060" end="01:12:54.699" style="s2">they&#39;re peddling is we&#39;ve caused this</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.890" end="01:12:57.550" style="s2">generations issues and so until we start</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.699" end="01:13:00.460" style="s2">to reconcile with our ancestors and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.550" end="01:13:03.360" style="s2">sort of make peace that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.460" end="01:13:06.310" style="s2">be caught in between this battle between</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.360" end="01:13:11.380" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating because ultimately what</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.310" end="01:13:13.380" style="s2">you hinging the the whole frame on in</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.380" end="01:13:16.170" style="s2">terms of him</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.380" end="01:13:20.040" style="s2">a circular system restoration of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.170" end="01:13:23.870" style="s2">water cycle and that is so much more</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.040" end="01:13:27.210" style="s2">upstream response to climate change</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.870" end="01:13:30.170" style="s2">basically it is the diluting of the land</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.210" end="01:13:34.440" style="s2">and so many areas around the world</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.170" end="01:13:39.060" style="s2">ultimately climate change is an upset</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.440" end="01:13:41.760" style="s2">what does I got and yeah and so the</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.060" end="01:13:44.909" style="s2">water and oceans really critical in and</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.760" end="01:13:49.080" style="s2">so so when we am starting looking for my</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.909" end="01:13:52.820" style="s2">Western science you and locate the</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.080" end="01:13:55.110" style="s2">reduction of sedimentation or the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.820" end="01:13:58.650" style="s2">reduction in emissions and sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.110" end="01:14:00.750" style="s2">carbon targets reduction and carbon what</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.650" end="01:14:03.090" style="s2">we see in the circular view is if they</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.750" end="01:14:05.429" style="s2">become important because what they to</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.090" end="01:14:07.469" style="s2">get to that level what we&#39;re creating is</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.429" end="01:14:09.239" style="s2">breathing space for the ancestors is</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.469" end="01:14:12.810" style="s2">that regenerating because we&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.239" end="01:14:14.989" style="s2">in covert 19 so those targets and a</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.810" end="01:14:17.400" style="s2">circle context they&#39;re important because</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.989" end="01:14:21.900" style="s2">through our human is that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.400" end="01:14:24.750" style="s2">trying to do is shift our behavior sort</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.900" end="01:14:27.030" style="s2">of shift the Olympics and to a point</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.750" end="01:14:28.710" style="s2">where those fucker proper systems can</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.030" end="01:14:31.320" style="s2">regenerate themselves because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.710" end="01:14:34.710" style="s2">need humans to did it what we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.320" end="01:14:37.530" style="s2">do is manage shell behavior in a way to</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.710" end="01:14:39.870" style="s2">help minimize that impact so that um</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.530" end="01:14:41.159" style="s2">those systems can actually regenerate</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.870" end="01:14:43.949" style="s2">themselves because they&#39;re the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.159" end="01:14:45.750" style="s2">fucker popper not as you know so and who</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.949" end="01:14:49.199" style="s2">are we as humans do you say are we gonna</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.750" end="01:14:52.710" style="s2">fix up nature we can reciprocate we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.199" end="01:14:55.440" style="s2">and play our role but but ultimately in</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.710" end="01:14:58.590" style="s2">this one the biggest thing through</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.440" end="01:15:00.510" style="s2">covert 19 is city is watching globally</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.590" end="01:15:03.530" style="s2">the regeneration of those systems</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.510" end="01:15:06.449" style="s2">because of the fact that humanity got</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.530" end="01:15:10.699" style="s2">locked up a bit and put away for a while</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.449" end="01:15:14.790" style="s2">you know lynn ostrom</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.699" end="01:15:17.480" style="s2">could you you said this earlier and now</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.790" end="01:15:17.480" style="s2">you said it again</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.039" end="01:15:23.829" style="s2">of course we need much more humility of</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.219" end="01:15:26.250" style="s2">who are we in this largest cycle and and</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.829" end="01:15:28.739" style="s2">like changed the narrative away from</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.250" end="01:15:31.510" style="s2">what we&#39;re trying to save the earth or</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.739" end="01:15:34.929" style="s2">like we&#39;re really trying to save our</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.510" end="01:15:39.090" style="s2">future to some extent dire or acababa is</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.929" end="01:15:43.480" style="s2">going to continue in in her cycles and</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.090" end="01:15:45.130" style="s2">I&#39;m reminded of as you know like when I</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.480" end="01:15:46.900" style="s2">started writing my book there&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.130" end="01:15:50.619" style="s2">the key questions that that I came back</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.900" end="01:15:52.420" style="s2">to was it was a question that mentor of</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.619" end="01:15:54.639" style="s2">mine David Orr had asked me 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.420" end="01:15:58.929" style="s2">before I started writing the book which</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.639" end="01:16:00.760" style="s2">was when I asked him about really the</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.929" end="01:16:04.690" style="s2">spiritual dimension of the shift that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.760" end="01:16:10.119" style="s2">now had to do as as a species and he</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.690" end="01:16:12.219" style="s2">said before we can answer the what we</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.119" end="01:16:13.750" style="s2">need to do and how we might be able to</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.219" end="01:16:15.849" style="s2">do it in order to create a sustainable</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.750" end="01:16:20.199" style="s2">or regenerative human presence on earth</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.849" end="01:16:22.750" style="s2">and we need to unser a deeper question a</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.199" end="01:16:25.119" style="s2">much more difficult question and we need</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.750" end="01:16:29.409" style="s2">to ask why are we worth sustaining what</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.119" end="01:16:32.469" style="s2">is it in us that is worth worth it</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.409" end="01:16:35.789" style="s2">that we are continuing as part of vaca</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.469" end="01:16:38.530" style="s2">papa and for me I would love to hear</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.789" end="01:16:40.750" style="s2">because on the one hand I completely</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.530" end="01:16:42.699" style="s2">agree we need much more humility and not</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.750" end="01:16:45.909" style="s2">take ourselves so important but there</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.699" end="01:16:49.300" style="s2">must be some wisdom in in your lineage</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.909" end="01:16:53.469" style="s2">that that also speaks to what is our</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.300" end="01:16:55.210" style="s2">role like well what why are we here</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.469" end="01:16:57.280" style="s2">because otherwise maybe maybe we should</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.210" end="01:17:01.110" style="s2">just bow out as quickly as possible and</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.280" end="01:17:04.349" style="s2">let the rest get on with I think I think</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.110" end="01:17:08.579" style="s2">yeah I I think and this would probably</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.349" end="01:17:14.440" style="s2">resonate with our Amazonian indigenous</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.579" end="01:17:18.540" style="s2">communities - and and in</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.440" end="01:17:20.710" style="s2">1 why are these sort of two words one</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.540" end="01:17:25.750" style="s2">because we&#39;re just part of that system</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.710" end="01:17:28.570" style="s2">or fuckup and and nfe if you think</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.750" end="01:17:30.850" style="s2">Humanity is an awesome example of multi</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.570" end="01:17:35.290" style="s2">copy the opportunity mother earth has</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.850" end="01:17:37.330" style="s2">done because the diversity of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.290" end="01:17:39.850" style="s2">in the different locations across the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.330" end="01:17:43.810" style="s2">planet and the way those places are</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.850" end="01:17:45.910" style="s2">shaped us both in terms of and they so I</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.810" end="01:17:49.420" style="s2">sort of go back to this tomb around</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.910" end="01:17:51.850" style="s2">ecological cultural perspectives because</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.420" end="01:17:54.340" style="s2">that&#39;s what the fuck up up is it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.850" end="01:17:58.750" style="s2">the ecological cultural element and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.340" end="01:18:02.260" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing why because the</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.750" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">Earth Mother in sky father have deemed</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.260" end="01:18:09.130" style="s2">it so that we&#39;re here long you know the</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.880" end="01:18:12.310" style="s2">the other thing I think in Tunis from an</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.130" end="01:18:14.530" style="s2">indigenous perspective because of their</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.310" end="01:18:17.380" style="s2">close association in knowledge and</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.530" end="01:18:20.440" style="s2">wisdom over generations of those systems</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.380" end="01:18:23.500" style="s2">is that we are just the human</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.440" end="01:18:26.680" style="s2">manifestation or the human voice of this</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.500" end="01:18:28.449" style="s2">particular ecological system that my</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.680" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">ancestors are incurred and the same way</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.449" end="01:18:35.260" style="s2">that our Amazonian relations are our</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:38.320" style="s2">voice and so I made a comment when I</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.260" end="01:18:40.630" style="s2">spoke at that in London was that if the</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.320" end="01:18:42.910" style="s2">Amazon are the lungs of the earth then</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.630" end="01:18:46.390" style="s2">indigenous people are re our spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.910" end="01:18:49.750" style="s2">consciousness and and I think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.390" end="01:18:52.330" style="s2">there the opportunity in the re and</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.750" end="01:18:57.940" style="s2">digitizing and recirculating of humanity</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.330" end="01:18:59.620" style="s2">is the return to they in the Western</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.940" end="01:19:05.890" style="s2">world there are a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.620" end="01:19:08.560" style="s2">speak about our role as human beings is</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.890" end="01:19:10.360" style="s2">to some extent the universe becoming</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.560" end="01:19:13.989" style="s2">conscious of itself it&#39;s the it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.360" end="01:19:15.699" style="s2">ability of that hole to actually take</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.989" end="01:19:18.219" style="s2">enough of a perspective that then</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.699" end="01:19:20.890" style="s2">through this false separation that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.219" end="01:19:23.650" style="s2">dynamic of being for self and being part</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.890" end="01:19:25.510" style="s2">of all actually creates a perspective</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.650" end="01:19:26.910" style="s2">that will always be limited but in our</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.510" end="01:19:29.370" style="s2">storytelling we can</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.910" end="01:19:33.690" style="s2">together as human beings and and create</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.370" end="01:19:37.620" style="s2">this multiple kaleidoscopic experience</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.690" end="01:19:41.460" style="s2">of rule from within and that that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.620" end="01:19:45.750" style="s2">ultimately the purpose of us that back</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.460" end="01:19:48.390" style="s2">but then I think understanding all of</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.750" end="01:19:50.100" style="s2">life as conscious and and even beyond</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.390" end="01:19:55.970" style="s2">that possibly the rocks and the rivers</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.100" end="01:19:59.820" style="s2">and and great well trees alike it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.970" end="01:20:03.180" style="s2">that everything has a perspective on on</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.820" end="01:20:05.280" style="s2">the whole as being in that dynamic yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.180" end="01:20:09.480" style="s2">being for oneself and being part of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.280" end="01:20:11.400" style="s2">larger whole and we I guess we we do</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.480" end="01:20:13.050" style="s2">bring in and that&#39;s where the time inter</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.400" end="01:20:15.900" style="s2">is interesting we bring in that</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.050" end="01:20:19.020" style="s2">awareness of patterns that we then turn</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.900" end="01:20:22.260" style="s2">into our ancestry storytelling innocence</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.020" end="01:20:26.910" style="s2">and therefore we create to some extent</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.260" end="01:20:29.820" style="s2">through the this observation of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.910" end="01:20:32.040" style="s2">system we are we also create the</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.820" end="01:20:34.290" style="s2">capacity for some form of foresight we</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.040" end="01:20:37.230" style="s2">might not know what&#39;s coming at us but</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.290" end="01:20:41.040" style="s2">but to be wisely prepared to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.230" end="01:20:44.880" style="s2">respond to future transformations comes</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.040" end="01:20:49.280" style="s2">with that awareness and and and so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.880" end="01:20:52.290" style="s2">this is where we were waking up to that</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.280" end="01:20:54.240" style="s2">role with now that the dangers of</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.290" end="01:20:56.460" style="s2">climate change in endangering our own</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.240" end="01:21:01.130" style="s2">species and so many other species with</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.460" end="01:21:01.130" style="s2">it is to say we need to</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.330" end="01:21:15.820" style="s2">returned to trusting the feedback that</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.960" end="01:21:17.920" style="s2">Gaia is giving also through us yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.820" end="01:21:20.920" style="s2">totally agree with it and and if</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.920" end="01:21:25.000" style="s2">anything through that observation it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.920" end="01:21:27.790" style="s2">the because the so cause impotence you</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.000" end="01:21:29.170" style="s2">know really important and and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.790" end="01:21:32.130" style="s2">just so in terms of some of our</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.170" end="01:21:35.350" style="s2">knowledge is that we&#39;ve been able to UM</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.130" end="01:21:38.170" style="s2">constantly observe those patterns and</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.350" end="01:21:42.130" style="s2">cycles over many generations so that so</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.170" end="01:21:49.270" style="s2">a tion and and it&#39;s a and I guess it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.130" end="01:21:54.220" style="s2">be observation in in what you see feel</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.270" end="01:21:56.410" style="s2">in here you know and so these are deeper</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.220" end="01:21:58.660" style="s2">sense of that feeling and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.410" end="01:22:01.360" style="s2">observing observing spirit and movement</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.660" end="01:22:03.160" style="s2">all those sort of thing and and I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.360" end="01:22:07.330" style="s2">that one of those things that we on</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.160" end="01:22:10.390" style="s2">observation is the ability then to</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.330" end="01:22:12.820" style="s2">actually hear the different voices of</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.390" end="01:22:16.570" style="s2">nature so so we have we use the Tim</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.820" end="01:22:18.610" style="s2">material which is language but we have</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.570" end="01:22:21.790" style="s2">our human language the trees have their</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.610" end="01:22:23.620" style="s2">language so the ability to TuneIn like</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.790" end="01:22:25.270" style="s2">to what the perspectives of nature say</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.620" end="01:22:28.480" style="s2">from beer view from their point of view</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.270" end="01:22:31.780" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s the key is there the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.480" end="01:22:33.760" style="s2">ability to locate ourselves and those</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.780" end="01:22:35.230" style="s2">different and appreciate those different</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.760" end="01:22:36.700" style="s2">views so the view from the mountain the</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.230" end="01:22:40.960" style="s2">view from the river the view from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.700" end="01:22:43.690" style="s2">ocean and and and so there&#39;s all living</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.960" end="01:22:46.210" style="s2">beings in in living elements they all</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.690" end="01:22:50.650" style="s2">have their own consciousness in mixing</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.210" end="01:22:52.030" style="s2">and and so and you sort of see that in</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.650" end="01:22:56.260" style="s2">nature you sort of see it in the way</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.030" end="01:22:59.500" style="s2">water responds to contamination and</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.260" end="01:23:02.110" style="s2">other things you know so so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.500" end="01:23:04.060" style="s2">where it comes back to that focus on</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.110" end="01:23:05.590" style="s2">well-being but the well-being of those</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.060" end="01:23:09.010" style="s2">connections that well-being all those</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.590" end="01:23:12.670" style="s2">systems and and and then it becomes that</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.010" end="01:23:14.920" style="s2">that greater self for me within the week</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.670" end="01:23:17.620" style="s2">and they you know we are you know so</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.920" end="01:23:21.310" style="s2">and that you know and and I and my</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.620" end="01:23:26.460" style="s2">upbringing I&#39;m a very I&#39;m very much a</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.310" end="01:23:28.840" style="s2">why in hell person you know because</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.460" end="01:23:31.420" style="s2">listening to your elders when something</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.840" end="01:23:33.910" style="s2">came into the meeting or whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.420" end="01:23:37.179" style="s2">asked those sort of two questions why</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.910" end="01:23:39.969" style="s2">and then the how and the how really is</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.179" end="01:23:42.340" style="s2">so the wire is what is this what does</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.969" end="01:23:44.620" style="s2">this opportunity how does a relate to us</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.340" end="01:23:47.890" style="s2">else just them our way of thinking our</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.620" end="01:23:49.719" style="s2">way of seeing our way of knowing and in</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.890" end="01:23:51.520" style="s2">the how is how we&#39;re going to respond to</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.719" end="01:23:56.140" style="s2">this opportunity challenge or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.520" end="01:24:00.550" style="s2">it is within the context of practicing</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.140" end="01:24:04.060" style="s2">our values and so so often people</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.550" end="01:24:07.360" style="s2">getting caught up on the what and then</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.060" end="01:24:09.130" style="s2">the who you know and we actually like</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.360" end="01:24:13.210" style="s2">what you see it actually the we need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.130" end="01:24:14.920" style="s2">answer or at least ask the wife is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.210" end="01:24:17.440" style="s2">not even about the answers just by</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.920" end="01:24:19.570" style="s2">asking the question per se so those two</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.440" end="01:24:24.310" style="s2">Christians elders used to ask I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.570" end="01:24:26.410" style="s2">on to say every situation even you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.310" end="01:24:28.630" style="s2">do my masters and I&#39;m now preparing for</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.410" end="01:24:32.620" style="s2">PhD those are sort of almost the two</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.630" end="01:24:36.429" style="s2">fundamental questions of or why and how</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.620" end="01:24:39.610" style="s2">you know and so because if you can get</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.429" end="01:24:41.110" style="s2">those two elements right then it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.610" end="01:24:43.270" style="s2">matter the what know what does the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.110" end="01:24:44.710" style="s2">mirror because whatever you&#39;ll be doing</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.270" end="01:24:47.140" style="s2">is all going to be aligned to the why</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.710" end="01:24:48.280" style="s2">and a half and in the what is very often</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.140" end="01:24:51.100" style="s2">like again coming back to that</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.280" end="01:24:53.770" style="s2">conversation at with Joel glance Berg he</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.100" end="01:24:56.710" style="s2">often speaks of the the systems and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.770" end="01:24:58.660" style="s2">structures in the probe that that we</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.710" end="01:25:00.760" style="s2">actually see our monetary system our</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.660" end="01:25:03.699" style="s2">governance system the houses we built</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.760" end="01:25:07.840" style="s2">that the roads we put in and while there</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.699" end="01:25:11.620" style="s2">the tracks the the process is really</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.840" end="01:25:13.960" style="s2">behind it and when changed something</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.620" end="01:25:16.480" style="s2">over time to just work with the tracks</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.960" end="01:25:18.880" style="s2">design another building and change</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.480" end="01:25:22.110" style="s2">layout of the city is it&#39;s just working</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.880" end="01:25:25.060" style="s2">on changing the tracks again rather than</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.110" end="01:25:27.909" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m conscious that we&#39;ve talked for</p>
