<p begin="00:00:32.160" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">the adjacent possible so what could be</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.500" end="00:00:40.500" style="s2">done with 10,000 people and $100,000</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">right now and we can get started so</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.500" end="00:00:44.250" style="s2">would anyone like to start what they do</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:46.469" style="s2">for food what they like about it what</p>

<p begin="00:00:46.469" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">two minutes each I can catch Edward okay</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:01:01.590" style="s2">I just want to bring up a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">I think what we&#39;re seeing right now with</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.590" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">the coronavirus and everything is is</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:12.840" style="s2">showing us how fragile our you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">supply chains are so much of our food</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.840" end="00:01:19.530" style="s2">system depends on that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:23.729" style="s2">just like the rest of our systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.530" end="00:01:27.990" style="s2">you know just-in-time supply and all</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.729" end="00:01:30.720" style="s2">these things are extremely fragile so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.990" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">would just like to praise that</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.720" end="00:01:42.540" style="s2">particular point all right thank you</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:43.740" style="s2">yes fragile is huge so next I have in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.540" end="00:01:45.299" style="s2">house like I used to eat a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.740" end="00:01:47.579" style="s2">takeaway and I eat a lot of processed</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.299" end="00:01:49.110" style="s2">food because I don&#39;t have the spoons</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.579" end="00:01:51.990" style="s2">that you can think about what to cook</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.110" end="00:01:53.220" style="s2">let alone make it and at the same time I</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.990" end="00:01:55.829" style="s2">don&#39;t really have some money to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.220" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">takeout and packaged but I also have two</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.829" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">things that work really well in my life</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:03.240" style="s2">which is my collective house my</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">cohousing community where we eaten eat</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.240" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">together three times three to four times</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:09.179" style="s2">a week where every adult shows up once a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:10.830" style="s2">month and cooks and cleans and I get to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.179" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">show up every other meal and pay the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.830" end="00:02:14.340" style="s2">cost of food and I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.090" end="00:02:15.959" style="s2">looking clean as well as there is a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.340" end="00:02:17.819" style="s2">non-profit grocery store here called</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.959" end="00:02:21.209" style="s2">quest that you need a referral the shop</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.819" end="00:02:22.709" style="s2">at but it&#39;s all of like the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.209" end="00:02:24.540" style="s2">all the other grocery stores would throw</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.709" end="00:02:26.370" style="s2">out because it&#39;s damaged or about to</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.540" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">expire but instead of throwing it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.370" end="00:02:31.019" style="s2">they donate it and then people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:32.489" style="s2">below the poverty line can buy it for a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.019" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">fraction of the cost of what they would</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.489" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">buy so to me it had a lot more dignity</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:38.370" style="s2">than the food bank and I get to choose</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:40.049" style="s2">what works and what doesn&#39;t and stock it</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.370" end="00:02:41.160" style="s2">end up being stocking up on junk food a</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.049" end="00:02:42.510" style="s2">lot of the time but they also have</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.160" end="00:02:44.700" style="s2">produce that needs to be used in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.510" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">couple days so that is how do I got</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.700" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">going on well what tends to stand out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:57.060" style="s2">me is the the fact that buying junk food</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:03:01.230" style="s2">is generally cheaper than buying food</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.060" end="00:03:03.120" style="s2">that&#39;s actually good for us so I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.230" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">that that&#39;s that&#39;s an issue in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.120" end="00:03:08.280" style="s2">you know sort of continued poverty</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:10.769" style="s2">cycles or without punishing as well so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.280" end="00:03:14.129" style="s2">it&#39;s you know we need the nutrition in</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.769" end="00:03:15.510" style="s2">order to be able to to function well to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.129" end="00:03:17.130" style="s2">be healthy to be prepared for something</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.510" end="00:03:19.350" style="s2">like this growing virus because if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.130" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2">you know if your immunocompromise then</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.350" end="00:03:25.230" style="s2">you&#39;re more at risk so yeah I would like</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.340" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">to see I would like to see that change</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.230" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">in terms of stuff that&#39;s positive I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:32.190" style="s2">it&#39;s nice to be able to do the things</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">like online orders it&#39;s nice that there</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.190" end="00:03:36.030" style="s2">are you know farmers markets around the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">place so if you do that bit of research</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.030" end="00:03:43.889" style="s2">you can actually go and get fresh</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:46.880" style="s2">produce here anyway and I&#39;m liking some</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.889" end="00:03:50.180" style="s2">of what I&#39;m seeing in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.880" end="00:03:52.200" style="s2">permaculture and you know ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.180" end="00:03:53.819" style="s2">regeneration and things like that where</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.200" end="00:04:02.880" style="s2">they&#39;re focusing on providing food as</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.819" end="00:04:05.849" style="s2">well on it so what I like about the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.880" end="00:04:07.620" style="s2">current system I you know it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.849" end="00:04:09.799" style="s2">best for everyone or do you find</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.620" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">involved but I do like the option to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.799" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">non-local things right so being in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:16.769" style="s2">Canada like I can still get avocados</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:18.419" style="s2">year-round that the pepper is nice and</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.769" end="00:04:20.250" style="s2">you know pick your other fruit and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.419" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">veggies it&#39;s nice to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.250" end="00:04:25.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s somewhat efficient to have you</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:28.930" style="s2">know like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.870" end="00:04:31.270" style="s2">food shipped from the farms to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.930" end="00:04:33.370" style="s2">like in some sort of a shipping</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.270" end="00:04:35.740" style="s2">warehouse that tends to be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.370" end="00:04:42.270" style="s2">more efficient ways to move that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.740" end="00:04:46.330" style="s2">like lull look stuff but it does feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.270" end="00:04:48.190" style="s2">less efficient with how I think most</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.330" end="00:04:51.100" style="s2">people still get their food which is you</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.190" end="00:04:54.400" style="s2">know each person goes to the the grocery</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.100" end="00:04:57.639" style="s2">store well you know eat well let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.400" end="00:04:59.020" style="s2">say every week and sort of picks through</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.639" end="00:05:02.050" style="s2">their own stuff and then brings it home</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.020" end="00:05:04.600" style="s2">it does seem not that efficient plus</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.050" end="00:05:06.580" style="s2">well I do sometimes cook it also seems</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.600" end="00:05:09.370" style="s2">less efficient for me to do the effort</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.580" end="00:05:13.150" style="s2">of you know the the food prep and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:14.740" style="s2">cook time I do like the the cohousing</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.150" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">that Julie mentioned where it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.740" end="00:05:20.020" style="s2">you might cook once a week or once every</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:21.550" style="s2">two weeks you&#39;re cooking for a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.020" end="00:05:22.479" style="s2">people and then all the other days you</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.550" end="00:05:24.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about it cuz</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.479" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">somebody else is cooking I quite like</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.520" end="00:05:32.229" style="s2">that approach hey now we have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:34.090" style="s2">an open discussion if you want as to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.229" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">what is we&#39;re not working in this for</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.090" end="00:05:39.580" style="s2">the five or so minutes and then go on to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:42.870" style="s2">the beautiful future we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.580" end="00:05:45.820" style="s2">create that&#39;s maybe not possible yet but</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.870" end="00:05:47.070" style="s2">something else they came up well I liked</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.820" end="00:05:49.900" style="s2">a lot of what you brought up the fragile</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.070" end="00:05:51.760" style="s2">the chunky food being cheaper is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.900" end="00:05:52.870" style="s2">is a huge piece there was something else</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.760" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">that was working but I&#39;ll let someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.870" end="00:05:58.840" style="s2">else talk well I think about it now</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:01.000" style="s2">doing so like the permaculture stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.840" end="00:06:04.120" style="s2">that Katya mentioned I think that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.000" end="00:06:06.789" style="s2">quite interesting and I&#39;m sure still</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.120" end="00:06:09.039" style="s2">plenty of room to grow both just in our</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.789" end="00:06:09.849" style="s2">knowledge of permaculture and just in</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:14.919" style="s2">the number of people that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.849" end="00:06:17.770" style="s2">doing it yeah I think a permaculture and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.919" end="00:06:19.870" style="s2">regenerative agriculture in general is</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.770" end="00:06:22.360" style="s2">huge because it kind of hits two birds</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.870" end="00:06:27.099" style="s2">with one stone it acts actually works</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.360" end="00:06:31.500" style="s2">towards sequestering carbon soils you</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.099" end="00:06:34.810" style="s2">know regenerating ecosystems so merging</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.500" end="00:06:36.940" style="s2">agriculture and bringing it from the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.810" end="00:06:39.070" style="s2">industrial model to that sort of thing I</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.940" end="00:06:42.550" style="s2">think is really important</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.070" end="00:06:44.710" style="s2">I remember two things one of which was</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.550" end="00:06:46.120" style="s2">right now getting the meal delivery kits</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.710" end="00:06:48.070" style="s2">actually don&#39;t like them because coho</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.120" end="00:06:49.690" style="s2">seems way better but they do help me</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.070" end="00:06:51.550" style="s2">think about what to make there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.690" end="00:06:52.990" style="s2">a hybrid of those where like I can get</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.550" end="00:06:54.760" style="s2">stuff delivered I have some of it in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.990" end="00:06:56.230" style="s2">fridge and some of its staple and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.760" end="00:06:56.590" style="s2">it knows what I&#39;m making it helps me do</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.230" end="00:06:58.660" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.590" end="00:07:00.790" style="s2">sorry that&#39;s getting things out of</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.660" end="00:07:02.350" style="s2">sequence but it could be but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.790" end="00:07:04.480" style="s2">also this place looking to here called</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.350" end="00:07:06.520" style="s2">abundance farm the people can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.480" end="00:07:08.800" style="s2">and of course there&#39;s all those CSA</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.520" end="00:07:10.570" style="s2">oh they&#39;re called the boxes of like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.800" end="00:07:12.790" style="s2">get in with the farmer and then they</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.570" end="00:07:14.200" style="s2">they send you boxes of food they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.790" end="00:07:15.880" style="s2">know how many people are feeding for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.200" end="00:07:17.470" style="s2">year and they plans accordingly but an</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.880" end="00:07:19.330" style="s2">abundance farm actually has the people</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.470" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">who have the shares do the work as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.330" end="00:07:23.230" style="s2">so you can come and you can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">harvesting and part of planting and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.230" end="00:07:27.790" style="s2">building whatever&#39;s on the farm and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:28.840" style="s2">everyone has has a part playing that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.790" end="00:07:30.340" style="s2">have an issue cuz I can&#39;t get out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.840" end="00:07:32.320" style="s2">there I can&#39;t get out there with</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.340" end="00:07:34.030" style="s2">transportation it takes like two hours</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.320" end="00:07:35.880" style="s2">to get there but I love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.030" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">working together in community and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.880" end="00:07:40.180" style="s2">growing your own food even if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:42.100" style="s2">living there and it&#39;s just more fun</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.180" end="00:07:43.870" style="s2">right they&#39;re not they&#39;re not having to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.100" end="00:07:48.940" style="s2">harvest a certain yield they&#39;re not paid</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.870" end="00:07:51.010" style="s2">per it&#39;s just it&#39;s paid they&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.940" end="00:07:54.220" style="s2">together and harvesting together and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.010" end="00:07:59.050" style="s2">they shearing them into the harvest and</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.220" end="00:08:02.850" style="s2">bounty I&#39;d be interested to know how</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.050" end="00:08:05.170" style="s2">much of our food is provided through</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.850" end="00:08:08.380" style="s2">through watch we call it like the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.170" end="00:08:10.600" style="s2">old model of you know sort of mass</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.380" end="00:08:12.190" style="s2">production with you know all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.600" end="00:08:14.250" style="s2">pesticides and herbicides and everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.190" end="00:08:17.730" style="s2">that sort of you know destroys the soil</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.250" end="00:08:20.830" style="s2">versus you know how much is actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.730" end="00:08:22.690" style="s2">through you know the farmers markets and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.830" end="00:08:24.970" style="s2">through you know like some sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.690" end="00:08:29.170" style="s2">organic approach whether it&#39;s whether</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.970" end="00:08:32.550" style="s2">it&#39;s permaculture raw just a better kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.170" end="00:08:34.960" style="s2">of better kind of farming it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.550" end="00:08:36.550" style="s2">difficult for me to get a picture of how</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.960" end="00:08:37.990" style="s2">much of each is happening because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.550" end="00:08:40.150" style="s2">got the interest in your soil</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.990" end="00:08:42.490" style="s2">regeneration and so on I get to see an</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.150" end="00:08:44.470" style="s2">awful lot of that come up in my you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.490" end="00:08:46.450" style="s2">my recommended readings and things like</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.470" end="00:08:48.580" style="s2">that and I&#39;m sure that it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.450" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">very very very small percentage and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.580" end="00:08:51.750" style="s2">just in my face all the time</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.240" end="00:08:57.230" style="s2">all right should we go on to the next</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:58.730" style="s2">the next phase which is what is I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.230" end="00:09:00.170" style="s2">we probably know what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.730" end="00:09:02.720" style="s2">food I don&#39;t think any of this has been</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.170" end="00:09:04.190" style="s2">a shock to anyone what it&#39;s fragile that</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.720" end="00:09:05.720" style="s2">that&#39;s why this one&#39;s so much shorter</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.190" end="00:09:07.280" style="s2">than this is but you know generally what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.720" end="00:09:08.900" style="s2">we concentrate on in societies like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.280" end="00:09:12.410" style="s2">what&#39;s broken and what&#39;s not working and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.900" end="00:09:14.410" style="s2">so moving on to the big huge utopian</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.410" end="00:09:17.720" style="s2">vision of the future that we all might</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.410" end="00:09:19.460" style="s2">be grandparents in one day does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.720" end="00:09:24.410" style="s2">have a bit of that they would like to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.460" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">share I&#39;d like to bring up something and</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.410" end="00:09:31.730" style="s2">that is I think it&#39;s valuable to look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:34.940" style="s2">this on a meta scale and what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.730" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">that is that each unique location you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.940" end="00:09:41.860" style="s2">have rural areas urban areas rural</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:45.800" style="s2">communities urban neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.860" end="00:09:47.680" style="s2">individuals the solutions going to look</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.800" end="00:09:50.540" style="s2">a little bit different for everybody I</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.680" end="00:09:53.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s one size fits all</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.540" end="00:09:58.750" style="s2">solution for food production and food</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.960" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">consumption so I think it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.750" end="00:10:05.000" style="s2">perhaps on a global scale or on a larger</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:07.720" style="s2">scale to create kind of like the design</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.000" end="00:10:12.250" style="s2">globally manufacturing locally on</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.720" end="00:10:15.290" style="s2">concept for agriculture as well so if</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.250" end="00:10:17.240" style="s2">you know places in the world that are</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.290" end="00:10:19.040" style="s2">trying different things unique to</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.240" end="00:10:21.350" style="s2">different locations can share that</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.040" end="00:10:24.290" style="s2">information and knowledge and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.350" end="00:10:26.600" style="s2">people can have access to that and adopt</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.290" end="00:10:31.430" style="s2">it to their individual situation or</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.600" end="00:10:34.930" style="s2">individual location I think that&#39;s would</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.430" end="00:10:38.450" style="s2">be part of the solution for me</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.930" end="00:10:41.480" style="s2">absolutely I envision a world of shared</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.450" end="00:10:42.920" style="s2">shared technology that that it feeds</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.480" end="00:10:44.570" style="s2">back into the system but also my own</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.920" end="00:10:46.670" style="s2">data feeds back into the system as I</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.570" end="00:10:48.890" style="s2">think I&#39;m gonna eat something and buy it</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.670" end="00:10:50.840" style="s2">or I don&#39;t think I buy it in my utopian</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.890" end="00:10:52.790" style="s2">future but I was involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.840" end="00:10:55.970" style="s2">production of it and I have my food I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.790" end="00:10:57.770" style="s2">can also register what I throw or what I</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.970" end="00:11:00.260" style="s2">didn&#39;t use all of I would love someone</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.770" end="00:11:02.810" style="s2">else to do the executive functioning of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.260" end="00:11:04.820" style="s2">I pick my meals and it tells me what</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.810" end="00:11:05.540" style="s2">what works for me and my family went</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.820" end="00:11:07.370" style="s2">doesn&#39;t last time</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.540" end="00:11:09.019" style="s2">made that this got thrown out maybe make</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.370" end="00:11:11.600" style="s2">less of it this time your neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.019" end="00:11:12.980" style="s2">making it let&#39;s let&#39;s share up the more</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.600" end="00:11:15.529" style="s2">we can use technology to make it as</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.980" end="00:11:18.500" style="s2">efficient as possible as well as share</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.529" end="00:11:21.170" style="s2">in the labor of you know if I need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.500" end="00:11:23.269" style="s2">work a month on a farm every year to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.170" end="00:11:25.279" style="s2">able to pay for my food I&#39;m down with</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.269" end="00:11:27.649" style="s2">that especially if it&#39;s if it feels good</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.279" end="00:11:30.380" style="s2">to work there if there&#39;s music and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.649" end="00:11:34.279" style="s2">festivals and things that are don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.380" end="00:11:36.110" style="s2">it feel feel arduous and having 3d 3d</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.279" end="00:11:37.639" style="s2">farms be able to just show up and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:39.860" style="s2">here&#39;s what I&#39;m getting and robots pick</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.639" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">it for me and having all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.860" end="00:11:44.690" style="s2">interwoven together where you can get</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:46.639" style="s2">your hands in the dirt and and grow it</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.690" end="00:11:49.100" style="s2">or you can have it produce for you and</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.639" end="00:11:50.600" style="s2">get the recipes and everything feeds</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.100" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">back into it so you can know what the</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.600" end="00:11:54.350" style="s2">yield is if I can tell you we know what</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.930" style="s2">the weather is and in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.350" end="00:11:58.519" style="s2">what the soil conditions are and then we</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.930" end="00:12:00.019" style="s2">can put back in well you know it grew</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.519" end="00:12:02.180" style="s2">eight tomatoes they were the best this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.019" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">year and I can coordinate with my</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.180" end="00:12:05.779" style="s2">neighbors so if I do I grow 20 Tomatoes</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:07.130" style="s2">I can I can give them to my to my</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.779" end="00:12:09.819" style="s2">neighbors maybe they grow too many</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.130" end="00:12:12.740" style="s2">watermelons and find a way to</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.819" end="00:12:14.329" style="s2">interchange the things they truly cannot</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.740" end="00:12:16.790" style="s2">grow here like even if we could grow</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.329" end="00:12:18.319" style="s2">bananas in during Canada I still feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.790" end="00:12:19.579" style="s2">like it makes more sense to grow them</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.319" end="00:12:21.199" style="s2">somewhere else and ship them here</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.579" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">because they&#39;re a huge tree but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.199" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">not maybe that&#39;s taking up a lot of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.850" end="00:12:27.260" style="s2">lot of their real estate and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:29.120" style="s2">transportation so that&#39;s a bit of my how</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.260" end="00:12:31.160" style="s2">I would like to see oh and tailor made</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.120" end="00:12:33.529" style="s2">to me that also like my toilet is smart</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.160" end="00:12:35.209" style="s2">and so it knows what nutrients are</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.529" end="00:12:38.149" style="s2">staying in my body and knows how to like</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.209" end="00:12:40.970" style="s2">help me pick a diet that does work for</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.149" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">me that&#39;s not one-size-fits-all and</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.970" end="00:12:44.630" style="s2">petri dish meat so I don&#39;t have to eat</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:49.189" style="s2">animals but can get little big good</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.630" end="00:12:52.459" style="s2">sorry well that last bit sounds</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.189" end="00:12:57.560" style="s2">wonderful I think one of the things I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.459" end="00:13:00.740" style="s2">like to see is a bit more a bit more of</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.560" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">a resilience spread of food so that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.740" end="00:13:03.800" style="s2">know we have more in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:05.899" style="s2">community gardens that there are more</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.800" end="00:13:07.639" style="s2">you know fruit trees on the street that</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.899" end="00:13:10.699" style="s2">there are more you know vegetable</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.639" end="00:13:14.319" style="s2">gardens that the people sort of allow</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.699" end="00:13:17.329" style="s2">access to to each other</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.319" end="00:13:18.590" style="s2">it used to been in Australia I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.329" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">like in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.590" end="00:13:21.800" style="s2">you know like straight after the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:23.540" style="s2">Depression era that people would have</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.800" end="00:13:25.910" style="s2">you know fruit trees in their front yard</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.540" end="00:13:27.290" style="s2">and I didn&#39;t have the fences and all</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.910" end="00:13:29.029" style="s2">that kind of thing and it was the way</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.290" end="00:13:31.160" style="s2">that they were sort of working together</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.029" end="00:13:34.370" style="s2">to sort of make sure that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.160" end="00:13:36.170" style="s2">everybody on the street was was fed I</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.370" end="00:13:40.220" style="s2">think I would like to see more of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.170" end="00:13:43.270" style="s2">and less of less of the shipping I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.220" end="00:13:45.320" style="s2">that we&#39;ve just gotten comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.270" end="00:13:47.029" style="s2">you know with it with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.320" end="00:13:51.350" style="s2">shipping things from around the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.029" end="00:13:53.860" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know that we should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.350" end="00:13:56.300" style="s2">so much of it like some of it sure that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.860" end="00:13:59.000" style="s2">you know by and large I&#39;d like to see a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.300" end="00:14:02.089" style="s2">lot more a lot more local a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.000" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">free you know simply because it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.089" end="00:14:10.550" style="s2">the effort that&#39;s going in rather than</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:11.810" style="s2">the money going in yeah I think that&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.550" end="00:14:16.640" style="s2">do me you guys would cover the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.810" end="00:14:21.080" style="s2">it I definitely like the idea of having</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.640" end="00:14:22.610" style="s2">more food being nearby both the free and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.080" end="00:14:26.839" style="s2">the paid versions just so that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.610" end="00:14:27.920" style="s2">less reliant on transportation like the</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.839" end="00:14:29.750" style="s2">shipping and that sort of thing if</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.920" end="00:14:31.550" style="s2">there&#39;s any issues there then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.750" end="00:14:32.930" style="s2">sudden we lose the ability to feed</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.550" end="00:14:37.940" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.930" end="00:14:39.560" style="s2">I do like an emphasis on sort of not to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.940" end="00:14:42.140" style="s2">like really manufactured food with a</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.560" end="00:14:44.300" style="s2">bunch of preservatives but yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.140" end="00:14:45.710" style="s2">pretty much everyone knows and agrees</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.300" end="00:14:48.410" style="s2">like that&#39;s not great for you but we do</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.710" end="00:14:51.110" style="s2">it anyway because it&#39;s easy and usually</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.410" end="00:14:53.900" style="s2">cheaper and so to build a system that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.110" end="00:14:55.430" style="s2">will either you know allow if you really</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.900" end="00:14:59.200" style="s2">want to cook that system to make it a</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.430" end="00:15:01.570" style="s2">bit I guess easier both from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.200" end="00:15:04.280" style="s2">shopping that I think what gets wasted</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.570" end="00:15:07.459" style="s2">possibly doing something useful with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.280" end="00:15:09.260" style="s2">waste but my goal is always to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.459" end="00:15:12.589" style="s2">have people do what they&#39;re good at I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.260" end="00:15:15.410" style="s2">not necessarily good at cooking so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.589" end="00:15:16.490" style="s2">feel like you know I could spend three</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.410" end="00:15:17.779" style="s2">hours to make something that somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.490" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">who&#39;s good at cooking could do it half</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.779" end="00:15:22.490" style="s2">an hour and do a better job at so I</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:25.880" style="s2">prefer to have sort of systems where</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.490" end="00:15:28.730" style="s2">there&#39;s an emphasis on local and almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.880" end="00:15:30.980" style="s2">like a meal subscription plan where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.730" end="00:15:32.510" style="s2">again not profit centered so I&#39;m not you</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.980" end="00:15:35.300" style="s2">know trying to buy some new</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.510" end="00:15:37.639" style="s2">Hoover eats person yacht but rather just</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.300" end="00:15:41.860" style="s2">the price of food plus you know 5 or 10%</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.639" end="00:15:43.579" style="s2">I know I guess and the labor and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.860" end="00:15:47.779" style="s2">understanding of that would probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.579" end="00:15:50.120" style="s2">mean you wouldn&#39;t have the full menu of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.779" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">options if somebody is if there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.120" end="00:15:54.769" style="s2">sort of a meal plan it&#39;s probably just</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:56.269" style="s2">gonna be a couple of options but if the</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.769" end="00:15:57.980" style="s2">food is good and the price is reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.269" end="00:16:00.440" style="s2">that is fine with me</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.980" end="00:16:04.279" style="s2">and then for food that like you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.440" end="00:16:06.680" style="s2">trying to get Mikado&#39;s in canada in in</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.279" end="00:16:09.019" style="s2">winter I do think that the price on that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.680" end="00:16:10.790" style="s2">should probably be the real price so</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.019" end="00:16:14.029" style="s2">right now you know we tend to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.790" end="00:16:15.649" style="s2">not price for the the pollution and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.029" end="00:16:18.260" style="s2">shipping in it and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.649" end="00:16:19.550" style="s2">involved with shipping you know avocados</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.260" end="00:16:21.320" style="s2">from whatever they can grow to all over</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.550" end="00:16:22.490" style="s2">the world and all the other fruits and</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.320" end="00:16:24.769" style="s2">veggies that we&#39;re used to getting the</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.490" end="00:16:26.779" style="s2">baby we in Canada shouldn&#39;t be used to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.769" end="00:16:29.860" style="s2">getting year-round I think that&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.779" end="00:16:32.630" style="s2">available but just the price is real so</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.860" end="00:16:34.339" style="s2">you know if we can grow avocados in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.630" end="00:16:37.459" style="s2">summer great that&#39;s a reasonable price</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.339" end="00:16:38.600" style="s2">if we lose the ability ok avocados you</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.459" end="00:16:40.699" style="s2">know they might be available but they</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.600" end="00:16:42.769" style="s2">might be five or ten dollars a piece so</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.699" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">if you really want them it&#39;s an option</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.769" end="00:16:48.230" style="s2">but probably there&#39;s going to be less of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.079" end="00:16:49.910" style="s2">that I achieve unless that stupid said</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.230" end="00:16:54.050" style="s2">we find some way to grow bananas in</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.910" end="00:16:59.089" style="s2">Canada we&#39;re never gonna be stuck on a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.050" end="00:17:01.459" style="s2">lot less food in Canada but yeah we also</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.089" end="00:17:04.640" style="s2">this this you know we can open up and</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.459" end="00:17:07.209" style="s2">I&#39;ll I&#39;ll talk about the future twenty</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.640" end="00:17:10.280" style="s2">years from now I mean I think for me</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.209" end="00:17:12.110" style="s2">eating in season is also a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.280" end="00:17:14.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s better for our bodies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.110" end="00:17:15.890" style="s2">better for the planet but if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.360" end="00:17:17.419" style="s2">available in stores I&#39;m gonna buy it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.890" end="00:17:19.459" style="s2">I&#39;ll still will buy it but to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.419" end="00:17:20.750" style="s2">price it to know that well if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.459" end="00:17:22.069" style="s2">getting abaca dough&#39;s there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.750" end="00:17:24.140" style="s2">labor I&#39;m putting into the system or</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.069" end="00:17:27.290" style="s2">money I&#39;m putting into the system when</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.140" end="00:17:28.520" style="s2">they&#39;re when they&#39;re not available but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.290" end="00:17:30.020" style="s2">maybe you can get blackberries</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.520" end="00:17:31.700" style="s2">year-round because they can grow indoors</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.020" end="00:17:33.080" style="s2">but then you should I be eating it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.700" end="00:17:35.270" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the tailor making for my</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.080" end="00:17:36.890" style="s2">body is is being able to track those</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.270" end="00:17:39.440" style="s2">things with with my health which of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.890" end="00:17:40.760" style="s2">course isn&#39;t food specifically but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.440" end="00:17:42.950" style="s2">sure we will talk about that when we</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.760" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">when we saw it when we solution raised</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.950" end="00:17:46.150" style="s2">health care and health</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.310" end="00:17:51.560" style="s2">so that comes back to I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.260" end="00:17:54.290" style="s2">like prices as an information signal</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.560" end="00:17:55.820" style="s2">that you know that tells you what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.290" end="00:17:59.090" style="s2">you know what&#39;s the better thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.820" end="00:18:01.520" style="s2">this is the the worst thing to do you</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.090" end="00:18:05.030" style="s2">know if you if you&#39;ve got all of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.520" end="00:18:06.080" style="s2">costs of of transport and what happens</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.030" end="00:18:09.470" style="s2">to the environment and so on actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.080" end="00:18:10.580" style="s2">included in a food product and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.470" end="00:18:12.920" style="s2">going to end up being a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.580" end="00:18:14.780" style="s2">expensive than the version of you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.920" end="00:18:16.160" style="s2">walking down the street and you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.780" end="00:18:20.180" style="s2">plucking something out of the community</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.160" end="00:18:23.450" style="s2">garden you know so one is better for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.180" end="00:18:25.940" style="s2">local area probably better in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.450" end="00:18:28.910" style="s2">health and season and all that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.940" end="00:18:33.890" style="s2">thing that should be a lot cheaper and</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.910" end="00:18:36.040" style="s2">easier I&#39;m thinking and you know in in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.890" end="00:18:39.410" style="s2">society where you&#39;re trying to align</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.040" end="00:18:43.880" style="s2">what works for each person with what</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.410" end="00:18:46.940" style="s2">works for the whole then just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.880" end="00:18:48.260" style="s2">focusing on having everything available</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.940" end="00:18:50.180" style="s2">so like you still want to have it</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.260" end="00:18:52.160" style="s2">available but you should be able to know</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.180" end="00:18:56.600" style="s2">the choice that you&#39;re making is a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.160" end="00:18:58.420" style="s2">one so Nick came up earlier talking is</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.600" end="00:19:01.820" style="s2">there some people who have a very</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.420" end="00:19:03.920" style="s2">restricted diet who either be due to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.820" end="00:19:05.300" style="s2">health concerns like allergies or</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.920" end="00:19:07.010" style="s2">something like autism where they just</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.300" end="00:19:10.040" style="s2">can&#39;t you know they want the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.010" end="00:19:11.180" style="s2">every day and I feel like if that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.040" end="00:19:13.610" style="s2">you should you shouldn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.180" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">have to pay 15 bucks for an avocado but</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.610" end="00:19:16.400" style="s2">there was a way to know that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:18.350" style="s2">because it&#39;s like well no if you eat an</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.400" end="00:19:19.640" style="s2">avocado every day and it&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.350" end="00:19:21.800" style="s2">you do that and that&#39;s basically all you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.640" end="00:19:24.760" style="s2">do it&#39;s like avocado on toast then yours</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.800" end="00:19:28.040" style="s2">can be somewhat offset by other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.760" end="00:19:30.290" style="s2">yeah or help you find other things or</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.040" end="00:19:33.230" style="s2">maybe we do grow a picado locally for</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.290" end="00:19:35.330" style="s2">you right having it be like you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.230" end="00:19:36.650" style="s2">more a lot of those things and if</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.330" end="00:19:38.810" style="s2">everyone wants to have a keto everyday</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.650" end="00:19:41.690" style="s2">then we figure we figure that out how</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.810" end="00:19:43.220" style="s2">many do we need to grow locally yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.690" end="00:19:45.500" style="s2">well maybe at the other end you just</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.220" end="00:19:51.180" style="s2">have more money available to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.500" end="00:19:57.750" style="s2">buy the things that you need also</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.180" end="00:20:01.380" style="s2">I think to putting a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.750" end="00:20:04.680" style="s2">together here um you know consuming food</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.380" end="00:20:06.990" style="s2">closer to where it&#39;s produced and</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.680" end="00:20:10.860" style="s2">thinking of special diets for people</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.990" end="00:20:12.660" style="s2">there&#39;s also technologies so you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.860" end="00:20:13.980" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do things via</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.660" end="00:20:16.740" style="s2">permaculture but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.980" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">technologies that allow you to grow</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.740" end="00:20:23.340" style="s2">avocados indoor vertical farming and</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:28.520" style="s2">stuff so I think it&#39;s a real mix of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.340" end="00:20:34.700" style="s2">different methodologies modalities and</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.520" end="00:20:40.880" style="s2">pricing to have choice but also not</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.700" end="00:20:43.340" style="s2">externalize that choice via you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.880" end="00:20:46.410" style="s2">transportation thousand-mile</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.340" end="00:20:50.310" style="s2">transportation you know and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.410" end="00:20:51.720" style="s2">thing one of the things we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.310" end="00:20:53.970" style="s2">explicitly bring up during the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.720" end="00:20:56.790" style="s2">part which I do want to now bring up in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.970" end="00:21:00.510" style="s2">the positive is like zero slave labor</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.790" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">nobody is and meeting also just really</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.510" end="00:21:06.300" style="s2">low labor nobody has to work 80 hours a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:08.280" style="s2">week with their kids in the field to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.300" end="00:21:12.810" style="s2">able to feed themselves in order for us</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.280" end="00:21:14.840" style="s2">to get that offset externality right</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.810" end="00:21:18.180" style="s2">like anything that&#39;s available to me for</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.840" end="00:21:19.830" style="s2">Canadian especially Canadians we just</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.180" end="00:21:21.180" style="s2">talked about bananas like anything</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.830" end="00:21:23.940" style="s2">that&#39;s available for a Canadian and at</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.180" end="00:21:25.770" style="s2">that that labor point is also available</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.940" end="00:21:27.990" style="s2">around the world for people and to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.770" end="00:21:30.120" style="s2">able to help them grow that and do that</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.990" end="00:21:31.500" style="s2">right than any anywhere any anyone</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.120" end="00:21:33.720" style="s2">anywhere in the world can come together</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.500" end="00:21:36.030" style="s2">with their community and find a system</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.720" end="00:21:37.980" style="s2">for growing food together that is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.030" end="00:21:41.340" style="s2">most efficient that is greenhouses and</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.980" end="00:21:43.170" style="s2">3d farming and permaculture and that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.340" end="00:21:44.850" style="s2">rest of the world can help them whether</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.170" end="00:21:47.310" style="s2">that looks like financing earlier on</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.850" end="00:21:50.880" style="s2">helping do a barn raising type thing of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.310" end="00:21:54.210" style="s2">building it or just I want to know that</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">my my bounty of my life doesn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.210" end="00:21:58.280" style="s2">from the cost of somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.080" end="00:22:09.789" style="s2">except that wait that&#39;s another thing so</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.850" end="00:22:12.000" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got the technology in there to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.789" end="00:22:15.220" style="s2">sort of talk about what stocks are</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.000" end="00:22:17.049" style="s2">everywhere of everything and you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.220" end="00:22:18.970" style="s2">kind of you know go in the same way as</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.049" end="00:22:21.190" style="s2">you know as at the moment I use Google</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.970" end="00:22:25.419" style="s2">all the time to say such-and-such near</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.190" end="00:22:27.909" style="s2">me and you know and I find that but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.419" end="00:22:30.039" style="s2">don&#39;t have the kind of information that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.909" end="00:22:32.230" style="s2">might help in terms of you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.039" end="00:22:34.090" style="s2">the what&#39;s the cheapest nutritious meal</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.230" end="00:22:37.120" style="s2">that I could create at the moment based</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.090" end="00:22:39.730" style="s2">on the stocks that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.120" end="00:22:41.950" style="s2">available and to be able to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.730" end="00:22:47.259" style="s2">things that might otherwise get thrown</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.950" end="00:22:48.850" style="s2">out yeah and to be able to I have people</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.259" end="00:22:50.409" style="s2">in my life especially in the community</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.850" end="00:22:52.090" style="s2">who were amazing at that even to the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.409" end="00:22:53.529" style="s2">point where denoise be like I do we just</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.090" end="00:22:55.929" style="s2">made I was cooking on Monday and we made</p>

<p begin="00:22:57.490" end="00:23:00.940" style="s2">of the freezers like we need to use this</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:03.070" style="s2">first cuz it was made first like no but</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.940" end="00:23:05.470" style="s2">this looks fresh but like he&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.070" end="00:23:07.480" style="s2">at knowing what&#39;s there in rotating it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.470" end="00:23:09.370" style="s2">and his partner&#39;s the one who knows</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.480" end="00:23:11.379" style="s2">what&#39;s like being grown right there and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.370" end="00:23:13.059" style="s2">how to and to be able to use that</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.379" end="00:23:14.679" style="s2">informations I just didn&#39;t even think</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.059" end="00:23:16.090" style="s2">that there was rice in the freezer I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.679" end="00:23:18.970" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have made it to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.090" end="00:23:20.620" style="s2">right so good to know those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.970" end="00:23:24.460" style="s2">things like what do I have on hand here</p>

<p begin="00:23:26.169" end="00:23:30.100" style="s2">actually but yes that that sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.120" end="00:23:32.049" style="s2">having 2 or 3 options of the local</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.100" end="00:23:39.850" style="s2">produce that is high soft would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.049" end="00:23:41.110" style="s2">amazing even more so now I&#39;m thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.850" end="00:23:42.820" style="s2">connecting with the neighbors where</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.110" end="00:23:44.350" style="s2">because everyone not everyone but a lot</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.820" end="00:23:47.620" style="s2">of people would want that right the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.350" end="00:23:48.909" style="s2">cheap easy high stock food and so if</p>

<p begin="00:24:44.350" end="00:24:47.830" style="s2">sure he already did but for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.410" end="00:24:53.740" style="s2">long-term</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.830" end="00:24:58.960" style="s2">yeah sure of it right and also move on</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.740" end="00:25:00.430" style="s2">to the the adjacent possible now if so</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.960" end="00:25:02.350" style="s2">can we have five seconds of silence I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.430" end="00:25:05.110" style="s2">ready</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.350" end="00:25:06.490" style="s2">I think the adjacent possible like what</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.110" end="00:25:08.320" style="s2">I was talking about sort of having the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.490" end="00:25:12.460" style="s2">emphasis on local cooking and somebody</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.320" end="00:25:15.340" style="s2">else do it I think that could sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.460" end="00:25:17.140" style="s2">the next step people are already used to</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.340" end="00:25:19.630" style="s2">ordering food on their phones you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.140" end="00:25:22.720" style="s2">and like skip the dishes and nuber eats</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.630" end="00:25:25.030" style="s2">I think you could make a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.720" end="00:25:26.710" style="s2">schedule that we&#39;re instead of it being</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.030" end="00:25:27.820" style="s2">like you you&#39;re sort of paying a premium</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.710" end="00:25:29.860" style="s2">because you&#39;re getting it from a</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.820" end="00:25:32.470" style="s2">restaurant and you want it right now if</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.860" end="00:25:34.720" style="s2">you were able to set some kind like sort</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.470" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">of a ubereats the skipty dishes meets</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.720" end="00:25:39.670" style="s2">like a meal planning service where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:41.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have a full you know menu from</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.670" end="00:25:43.480" style="s2">every restaurant your area there might</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.500" end="00:25:46.150" style="s2">be ten things in a given week and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.480" end="00:25:47.680" style="s2">say okay I&#39;m gonna you know eat that in</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.150" end="00:25:49.420" style="s2">the week and sort of build your plan</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.680" end="00:25:52.120" style="s2">around that and then you would just get</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.420" end="00:25:53.710" style="s2">a delivery where instead of it being you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.120" end="00:25:55.690" style="s2">know two pizzas it&#39;s like a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:26:49.330" end="00:26:53.740" style="s2">scale of like okay we&#39;re doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:56.020" style="s2">the the prep food of dishes hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.740" end="00:26:57.940" style="s2">without the the waste because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.020" end="00:26:59.110" style="s2">lot of waste that comes with those but</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.940" end="00:27:00.280" style="s2">when you&#39;re knowing that it&#39;s getting to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.110" end="00:27:01.419" style="s2">get delivered to your neighborhood every</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.280" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">two days because there&#39;s enough people</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.419" end="00:27:04.450" style="s2">in your neighborhood like it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:06.549" style="s2">meeting these thresholds and then having</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.450" end="00:27:08.500" style="s2">that that happened so I know that I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.549" end="00:27:10.690" style="s2">the stockpile of balsamic vinegar and</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.500" end="00:27:12.669" style="s2">olive oil and then they just deliver the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.690" end="00:27:14.350" style="s2">other end and we can even have it more</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.669" end="00:27:16.030" style="s2">delivered like things are cut up because</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.350" end="00:27:18.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve participe</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.030" end="00:27:21.400" style="s2">or we&#39;ve offset offset our labor with</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.340" end="00:27:23.500" style="s2">money so at a fair and decent wage right</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.400" end="00:27:26.169" style="s2">so I might put in twenty hours a month</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.500" end="00:27:28.179" style="s2">and get my food for free or I might put</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.169" end="00:27:30.039" style="s2">in five hours and get my food at cost</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.179" end="00:27:32.620" style="s2">like whatever it happens to be right or</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.039" end="00:27:34.120" style="s2">I might think I don&#39;t have any time and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.620" end="00:27:36.429" style="s2">so I&#39;ll pay a little bit of a premium</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.120" end="00:27:38.740" style="s2">for not contributing labor in every</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.429" end="00:27:40.150" style="s2">level right whether that&#39;s going to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.740" end="00:27:41.919" style="s2">store and buying it and doing the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.150" end="00:27:43.030" style="s2">shopping online whether it&#39;s sorting it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.919" end="00:27:44.740" style="s2">whether it&#39;s cutting it or well</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.030" end="00:27:46.299" style="s2">transporting it like whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.740" end="00:27:47.620" style="s2">to do as long as there&#39;s not a surplus</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.299" end="00:27:49.510" style="s2">of Labor in that area and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.620" end="00:27:51.490" style="s2">wants to Anna&#39;s want to do another that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.510" end="00:27:53.830" style="s2">and that can be a metric right that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.490" end="00:27:55.419" style="s2">switches around driving is really</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.830" end="00:27:58.030" style="s2">everyone loves it so that when you put</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.419" end="00:28:06.340" style="s2">in an hour and five minutes for instead</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.030" end="00:28:11.080" style="s2">of an hour I think too closing some</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:12.760" style="s2">loops with waste composting so I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.080" end="00:28:15.549" style="s2">that could even happen in an urban</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.760" end="00:28:18.159" style="s2">environment so you know if everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.549" end="00:28:21.159" style="s2">have food delivered you can also have</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.159" end="00:28:25.179" style="s2">waste taken away and cycle back into the</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.159" end="00:28:26.950" style="s2">the growing system yeah and for 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.179" end="00:28:28.150" style="s2">people that actually I like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.950" end="00:28:31.240" style="s2">especially if you&#39;ve got the regular</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.150" end="00:28:32.679" style="s2">like here&#39;s here&#39;s your food give me</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.240" end="00:28:33.940" style="s2">your waste off to the next place here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.679" end="00:28:34.450" style="s2">your food give me your weight off to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.940" end="00:28:36.760" style="s2">next place</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:41.399" style="s2">right that&#39;s super efficient I like it</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.760" end="00:28:41.399" style="s2">yeah I want the waste in the same car</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.400" end="00:28:49.090" style="s2">through people there&#39;s two separate</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.420" end="00:28:51.880" style="s2">parts right but having like we have</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.090" end="00:28:55.210" style="s2">compost pickup in Vancouver and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.880" end="00:28:56.530" style="s2">both gross and good it&#39;s like a little</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.210" end="00:28:58.120" style="s2">grossed out of it like I think to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.530" end="00:29:00.310" style="s2">degree for having local farming happy</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.120" end="00:29:01.720" style="s2">local compost is good the same guy did</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.310" end="00:29:04.090" style="s2">the rice thing else it was amazing</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.720" end="00:29:05.650" style="s2">compost he would be like always he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.090" end="00:29:07.750" style="s2">like out there with gloves on picking up</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.650" end="00:29:10.210" style="s2">the compost it&#39;s like his meditation I</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.750" end="00:29:11.350" style="s2">don&#39;t know if every every neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.210" end="00:29:15.310" style="s2">is gonna be lucky enough to have one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.350" end="00:29:18.220" style="s2">him but one of the other things is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.310" end="00:29:20.830" style="s2">for me I don&#39;t feel confident in growing</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.220" end="00:29:23.230" style="s2">a garden so I would really love to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.830" end="00:29:25.180" style="s2">a app that helps me with that that</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.230" end="00:29:28.150" style="s2">actually literally is like the Sun like</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.180" end="00:29:29.710" style="s2">here&#39;s my here I can just do a 3d cat</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.150" end="00:29:31.420" style="s2">and this is not a hundred thousand it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.710" end="00:29:33.880" style="s2">a little over the top but it can start</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.420" end="00:29:35.800" style="s2">with a beta right where it&#39;s just hey we</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.880" end="00:29:37.540" style="s2">know from Google Maps where your where</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.800" end="00:29:39.730" style="s2">your house is and we assume the Sun is</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.540" end="00:29:41.410" style="s2">here plant your what do you want and</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.730" end="00:29:43.090" style="s2">then here are the companion plants and</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.410" end="00:29:44.710" style="s2">then if I can feed that information back</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.090" end="00:29:46.630" style="s2">into the system and my neighbors use it</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.710" end="00:29:48.850" style="s2">and so if I have a surplus of something</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.630" end="00:29:50.980" style="s2">I can offer it to them or my raspberries</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.850" end="00:29:52.720" style="s2">come up earlier than theirs or I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.980" end="00:29:55.090" style="s2">even think I could grow raspberries and</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.720" end="00:29:57.700" style="s2">then my neighbor has a has a bounty and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.090" end="00:30:00.880" style="s2">next year you know I&#39;m I&#39;m help with you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.700" end="00:30:05.500" style="s2">can help with seed sharing and soil</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.880" end="00:30:06.940" style="s2">regeneration soil testing and to know to</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.500" end="00:30:08.380" style="s2">water it right now I&#39;m gone for a week</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.940" end="00:30:11.950" style="s2">but my neighbors also there can someone</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.380" end="00:30:13.660" style="s2">water mine and gives me an alert on my</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.950" end="00:30:14.950" style="s2">phone to water it when I forgot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.660" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">extra hot today you might want to water</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.950" end="00:30:20.470" style="s2">it twice or water it here and doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:22.860" style="s2">things like that that are adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.470" end="00:30:25.810" style="s2">possible that&#39;s not that difficult</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.860" end="00:30:27.640" style="s2">there&#39;s also a level of automation that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.810" end="00:30:31.750" style="s2">can be introduced with technology like</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.640" end="00:30:35.260" style="s2">farmbot so far bot is really cool for</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.750" end="00:30:37.060" style="s2">you know it can be use in a community</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.260" end="00:30:40.410" style="s2">garden that can be used in a backyard</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.060" end="00:30:42.940" style="s2">and basically it&#39;s all open source and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.410" end="00:30:44.260" style="s2">you know you don&#39;t have to actually if</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.940" end="00:30:47.890" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to do the playing you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.260" end="00:30:49.630" style="s2">don&#39;t have to it&#39;s automated and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.890" end="00:30:51.700" style="s2">information to share and further</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.630" end="00:30:54.510" style="s2">information to be shared of the type</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.700" end="00:30:54.510" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:31:01.210" style="s2">reminded of a conversation I had with</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.230" end="00:31:04.240" style="s2">say a young young guy elsewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.210" end="00:31:06.730" style="s2">Australia last year he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.240" end="00:31:09.460" style="s2">getting into you know into farming but</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.730" end="00:31:11.650" style="s2">he didn&#39;t have any kind of land in order</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.460" end="00:31:14.440" style="s2">to do it so we were talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.650" end="00:31:18.580" style="s2">possibility of having sort of a almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.440" end="00:31:21.220" style="s2">like a and a Commons app set up such</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.580" end="00:31:24.010" style="s2">that people who have land but don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.220" end="00:31:25.660" style="s2">to garden could set aside a certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.010" end="00:31:28.660" style="s2">amount and say you know how I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.660" end="00:31:30.760" style="s2">some you know ten square metres of land</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.660" end="00:31:33.990" style="s2">here that&#39;s you know that I&#39;m happy for</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.760" end="00:31:36.370" style="s2">other people to you know garden for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.990" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">and that they would then get you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.370" end="00:31:41.320" style="s2">like a box of food or something you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:43.360" style="s2">every so often as well so that way it</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.320" end="00:31:45.700" style="s2">could sort of be a group of people who</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.360" end="00:31:47.560" style="s2">are interested in you know in doing all</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.700" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">of that tending and the composting and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.560" end="00:31:51.490" style="s2">all that kind of thing who could then</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:55.120" style="s2">run and you know like a whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.490" end="00:31:57.450" style="s2">neighborhood if you like to cover sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.120" end="00:32:01.000" style="s2">of all needs and then distribute our</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.450" end="00:32:03.160" style="s2">food to anybody who is participating or</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.000" end="00:32:06.580" style="s2">sell at markets or whatever the case may</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.160" end="00:32:10.990" style="s2">be with the both kind of excited about</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.580" end="00:32:14.170" style="s2">that as a concept but one of the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.990" end="00:32:17.290" style="s2">things is um just tracking like what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.170" end="00:32:18.790" style="s2">buying where and especially that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.290" end="00:32:20.050" style="s2">easier thing to track if I literally</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.790" end="00:32:21.910" style="s2">just take a picture of what&#39;s on my</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.050" end="00:32:23.230" style="s2">conveyor belt and my receipt and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.910" end="00:32:24.430" style="s2">somehow matches it up again not a</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.230" end="00:32:27.610" style="s2">hundred thousand it would be more people</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.430" end="00:32:30.850" style="s2">who want to match it up - no - and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.610" end="00:32:32.560" style="s2">it learns from there but and then as</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.850" end="00:32:34.360" style="s2">that continues you&#39;re able to see at</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.560" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">what point it makes sense to grow our</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.360" end="00:32:39.520" style="s2">own or to produce our own crackers or</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:41.560" style="s2">whatever it might be or just bulk buy it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.520" end="00:32:43.150" style="s2">together right I think one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.560" end="00:32:44.350" style="s2">things that probably doesn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.150" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">there when we have the infrastructures</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.350" end="00:32:47.740" style="s2">grocery stores then if I can get it</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:49.030" style="s2">delivered to me and I don&#39;t need it to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.740" end="00:32:50.380" style="s2">sit there and they&#39;re paying for rents</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.030" end="00:32:51.940" style="s2">and I&#39;m driving there and driving back</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.380" end="00:32:55.360" style="s2">and getting the coronavirus from you</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.940" end="00:32:56.350" style="s2">then we can you like it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.360" end="00:32:57.730" style="s2">more convenient to have it delivered</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.350" end="00:33:00.070" style="s2">it&#39;s actually shown to be more</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.730" end="00:33:01.480" style="s2">environmentally friendly I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.070" end="00:33:03.700" style="s2">everyone getting their groceries</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.480" end="00:33:04.690" style="s2">delivered to their door for and again</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.700" end="00:33:06.550" style="s2">that&#39;s something we could share in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.690" end="00:33:08.350" style="s2">labor of it&#39;s not 0f</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.550" end="00:33:11.380" style="s2">to do that someone has to organize it</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.350" end="00:33:12.940" style="s2">I&#39;ll put some plastic bags but having</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.380" end="00:33:14.710" style="s2">that not sorting or you&#39;re just both</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.940" end="00:33:17.230" style="s2">buying and then sorting it together and</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.710" end="00:33:19.150" style="s2">you&#39;re able to know like if you really</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.230" end="00:33:21.340" style="s2">want Cheerios maybe get Cheerios but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.150" end="00:33:23.320" style="s2">you if you switch to this cereal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.340" end="00:33:25.210" style="s2">way less because it&#39;s the most popular</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.320" end="00:33:27.310" style="s2">and we can multiply it in in large</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.210" end="00:33:29.890" style="s2">quantities and it would be you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.310" end="00:33:32.980" style="s2">warehouse and ten thousand people could</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.890" end="00:33:34.930" style="s2">absolutely do that in a sustainable way</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.980" end="00:33:37.450" style="s2">that they then if they invited the rest</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.930" end="00:33:38.980" style="s2">of their City there would be no grocery</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.450" end="00:33:41.260" style="s2">stores in that city rather soon which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.980" end="00:33:43.000" style="s2">scary if it&#39;s owned by somebody else or</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.260" end="00:33:44.770" style="s2">a conglomerate but if we own it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.000" end="00:33:47.020" style="s2">everything&#39;s it costs as long as the</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.770" end="00:33:51.760" style="s2">producers of the food are still there we</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.020" end="00:33:53.980" style="s2">don&#39;t need the middleman I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.760" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">important like there&#39;s an element that I</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.980" end="00:33:58.180" style="s2">would like to see well I&#39;m all about</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:34:00.100" style="s2">technology and the efficiencies there I</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.180" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">also don&#39;t want our food to rely on it</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.100" end="00:34:03.910" style="s2">so something like you know you have an</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:05.980" style="s2">app that teaches you Hale do this and</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.910" end="00:34:08.140" style="s2">water this and that but I think before</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.980" end="00:34:09.460" style="s2">you get to that step you have like an</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.140" end="00:34:10.929" style="s2">encyclopedia of here&#39;s how to grow</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.460" end="00:34:12.550" style="s2">tomatoes here&#39;s how to you know get</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.929" end="00:34:15.220" style="s2">seeds from Tomatoes here&#39;s how to root</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.550" end="00:34:17.890" style="s2">like the end to end of what you would</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.220" end="00:34:19.720" style="s2">need to be able to plant yourself at you</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.890" end="00:34:21.940" style="s2">know kind of become a farmer if you had</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.720" end="00:34:24.100" style="s2">to and then to make sure that there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.940" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">sort of local printed copies of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.100" end="00:34:28.929" style="s2">wherever possible so it was an app that</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:30.790" style="s2">makes it sort of you don&#39;t bit easier</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.929" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">and more efficient anybody can do it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.790" end="00:34:34.210" style="s2">then there&#39;s sort of some local printed</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:36.340" style="s2">copies of here&#39;s how to grow it here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.210" end="00:34:37.810" style="s2">how harvest seeds here&#39;s all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.340" end="00:34:40.510" style="s2">that you need to know just set up your</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.810" end="00:34:43.810" style="s2">own sort of renewable food system</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.510" end="00:34:46.120" style="s2">without the use of any technology and to</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.810" end="00:34:47.890" style="s2">know who that person is not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.120" end="00:34:49.540" style="s2">like but like who in your community is</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.890" end="00:34:51.070" style="s2">the bet is the best at growing food who</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.540" end="00:34:52.870" style="s2">has that no information in their head</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.070" end="00:34:55.720" style="s2">because I those books exist those books</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.870" end="00:34:58.630" style="s2">exist at cohousing I&#39;m so like sorry</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.720" end="00:35:00.070" style="s2">where do I grow my money like to be able</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.630" end="00:35:01.540" style="s2">to get that guidance but I would be able</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.070" end="00:35:03.400" style="s2">to learn through somebody else and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.540" end="00:35:05.560" style="s2">through an app and then to know to</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.400" end="00:35:07.060" style="s2">always have that conversation and we</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.560" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">can&#39;t be too reliant on this technology</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.060" end="00:35:12.970" style="s2">right I guess we all starve now the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:15.550" style="s2">Internet&#39;s down yes make sure you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.970" end="00:35:17.619" style="s2">we have an absolutely when ours is down</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.550" end="00:35:19.569" style="s2">if it isn&#39;t a global thing all</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.619" end="00:35:21.759" style="s2">the internet goes down like a solar</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.569" end="00:35:23.589" style="s2">flare or something that we we know who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.759" end="00:35:25.240" style="s2">Edie and who is not and we can ship food</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.589" end="00:35:27.009" style="s2">to them when needs be even if we are</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.240" end="00:35:28.630" style="s2">trying to stay local like we don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.009" end="00:35:32.499" style="s2">our communities neighboring communities</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.630" end="00:35:34.809" style="s2">starve right that&#39;s not tangential</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.499" end="00:35:38.140" style="s2">tomorrow sadly but I think it actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.809" end="00:35:40.869" style="s2">is adjacent possible to have an</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.140" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">understanding of what food growing</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.869" end="00:35:46.029" style="s2">systems are out there and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:49.809" style="s2">produce the highest like yield for every</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.029" end="00:35:52.180" style="s2">individual like the geography right for</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.809" end="00:35:53.920" style="s2">the climate and it&#39;s a degree analysis</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.180" end="00:35:55.630" style="s2">it outside as a 3d farming is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.920" end="00:35:57.009" style="s2">permaculture and can you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.630" end="00:35:58.779" style="s2">combination but if the community wants</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.009" end="00:36:00.160" style="s2">to grow what&#39;s gonna be their most</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.779" end="00:36:02.319" style="s2">efficient if we&#39;re feeding that back</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.160" end="00:36:05.410" style="s2">into the system the information and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.319" end="00:36:08.950" style="s2">sharing the intellectual resource that</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.410" end="00:36:12.249" style="s2">can be very powerful I like not having</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.950" end="00:36:13.660" style="s2">it all in in the technology system I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.249" end="00:36:15.700" style="s2">actually just thinking it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.660" end="00:36:17.589" style="s2">good you know for the early part of</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.700" end="00:36:19.930" style="s2">schooling to not just have you know like</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.589" end="00:36:27.789" style="s2">the reading writing and arithmetic but</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.930" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">growing hell yes yeah that definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.789" end="00:36:31.749" style="s2">should be a part of school II like them</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.279" style="s2">I don&#39;t think probably anyone here has</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.749" end="00:36:34.509" style="s2">really had proper schooling in how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.279" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">grow your own food you know how to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.509" end="00:36:40.230" style="s2">survive if there is a grocery store to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:42.430" style="s2">go and buy stuff from and then also</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.230" end="00:36:44.920" style="s2">probably an important thing is to figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.430" end="00:36:46.569" style="s2">out you know which seeds are our</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.920" end="00:36:48.039" style="s2">Terminator seeds and which things have</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.569" end="00:36:50.559" style="s2">sort of been made to not be long-lasting</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.039" end="00:36:53.019" style="s2">and make sure that we&#39;re not doubling in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.559" end="00:36:54.489" style="s2">that area cuz that&#39;s incredibly did that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.019" end="00:36:56.190" style="s2">seems incredibly did dangerous for sort</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.489" end="00:36:58.960" style="s2">of long-term being able to feed a</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.190" end="00:37:01.450" style="s2">community and not being reliant on the</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.960" end="00:37:02.920" style="s2">overall system is like oh yeah but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.450" end="00:37:05.789" style="s2">can only grow those Tomatoes for three</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.920" end="00:37:08.140" style="s2">generations and then they&#39;re gonna stop</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.789" end="00:37:10.539" style="s2">knowing who&#39;s who&#39;s holding the hair</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.140" end="00:37:11.890" style="s2">looms right blue hands like not because</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.539" end="00:37:13.059" style="s2">you have to but because hey you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.890" end="00:37:14.440" style="s2">really passionate about heirloom</p>

<p begin="00:38:19.210" end="00:38:24.010" style="s2">for the next step it does seem like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.339" end="00:38:25.660" style="s2">lot of these are components that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.010" end="00:38:31.180" style="s2">would definitely want to solve as soon</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.660" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">as possible I think that like oh sure if</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.180" end="00:38:34.089" style="s2">somebody said it here or this is just in</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.980" end="00:38:41.710" style="s2">something like the you know the meal</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.550" end="00:38:43.630" style="s2">delivery app starting up by identifying</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.710" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">sort of areas that are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.630" end="00:38:48.339" style="s2">areas that have like kind of a soup</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:50.410" style="s2">kitchen mmm nearby that could act as the</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.339" end="00:38:52.210" style="s2">commercial kitchen and then you can also</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.410" end="00:38:54.910" style="s2">say hey while we&#39;re here maybe five to</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.210" end="00:38:56.349" style="s2">ten or or more percent ends up staying</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.910" end="00:38:59.530" style="s2">in the soup kitchen to two feet almost</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.349" end="00:39:02.980" style="s2">people but then you are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.530" end="00:39:05.589" style="s2">much bigger volumes of food and you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.980" end="00:39:08.200" style="s2">and making that same use of the time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.589" end="00:39:10.270" style="s2">you&#39;re sort of also been in that area</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.200" end="00:39:11.349" style="s2">once you get that established and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.270" end="00:39:13.869" style="s2">have either you know people</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.349" end="00:39:16.540" style="s2">participating or ideally in the early</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.869" end="00:39:18.369" style="s2">stages just paying customers then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.540" end="00:39:20.500" style="s2">can you know either seek to expand</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.369" end="00:39:22.150" style="s2">and/or say oh we&#39;re actually in a good</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.500" end="00:39:24.250" style="s2">setup with this soup kitchen there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.150" end="00:39:26.770" style="s2">plot nearby that we could buy and start</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.250" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">to you know like set up a community</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.770" end="00:39:31.720" style="s2">garden where the end goal is you&#39;d start</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:33.430" style="s2">with just the sort of the system as we</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.720" end="00:39:35.829" style="s2">have it where the soup kitchen will just</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.430" end="00:39:38.079" style="s2">go and buy the ingredients either from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.829" end="00:39:40.510" style="s2">grocery store or if they can swing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.079" end="00:39:42.339" style="s2">and have the connections from local</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.510" end="00:39:43.210" style="s2">farmers and then use that either try and</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.339" end="00:39:45.820" style="s2">set up more of</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.210" end="00:39:48.310" style="s2">those spots or starting to actually grow</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.820" end="00:39:50.410" style="s2">your own food and starting to track that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.310" end="00:39:53.080" style="s2">that seems sort of like the next step</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.410" end="00:39:54.520" style="s2">from where we&#39;re starting now yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.080" end="00:39:55.990" style="s2">think there&#39;s there&#39;s next steps in all</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.520" end="00:39:57.760" style="s2">of these places right there&#39;s like how</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.990" end="00:40:00.220" style="s2">we grow food together the next step</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.760" end="00:40:02.740" style="s2">there&#39;s how we like the labor we put</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.220" end="00:40:04.300" style="s2">into our food already right even if</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.740" end="00:40:07.180" style="s2">we&#39;re disconnected from it we go to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.300" end="00:40:08.500" style="s2">grocery store we prep it we you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.180" end="00:40:10.150" style="s2">have to clean up after it to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.500" end="00:40:11.920" style="s2">content it make that more efficient to</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.150" end="00:40:14.349" style="s2">have a recipe sharing to have that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.920" end="00:40:16.150" style="s2">knowledge base and then also the end</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.349" end="00:40:18.130" style="s2">right that we want the compost we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.150" end="00:40:19.930" style="s2">to go back into the system and stay</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.130" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">there and then I kind of adjacent is</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.930" end="00:40:24.070" style="s2">also like all of the packaging and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:26.470" style="s2">that&#39;s there right if we can have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.070" end="00:40:28.300" style="s2">conversation about packaging and what is</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.470" end="00:40:29.950" style="s2">currently being done like restaurants I</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.300" end="00:40:32.410" style="s2">eat a restaurants a lot I like the idea</p>

<p begin="00:40:56.830" end="00:41:00.580" style="s2">much more efficiently than doing it on a</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.540" end="00:42:55.050" style="s2">that could be taken soon I won&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.620" end="00:42:57.030" style="s2">might be you know in the in the long</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.050" end="00:42:59.460" style="s2">term sort of more power and developing</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.030" end="00:43:01.920" style="s2">the the resilience at the beginning of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.460" end="00:43:04.130" style="s2">the food chain rather than sort of at</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.920" end="00:43:06.030" style="s2">the end of it you know it&#39;s so making</p>

<p begin="00:43:09.210" end="00:43:17.040" style="s2">more focused on the creation of like raw</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.690" end="00:43:18.570" style="s2">foods and the distribution of those do</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.040" end="00:43:21.360" style="s2">you like me like so I think meals are</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.570" end="00:43:23.070" style="s2">important but it&#39;s kind of its kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.360" end="00:43:25.800" style="s2">assuming that all of the ingredients are</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.070" end="00:43:31.380" style="s2">there right and they&#39;re going to come</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.800" end="00:43:33.180" style="s2">from brittle system so yeah um that was</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.380" end="00:43:34.890" style="s2">just what I was pondering I love the</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.180" end="00:43:36.360" style="s2">idea of having is what I&#39;ve had what I</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.890" end="00:43:38.220" style="s2">bought cuz we have a lot of cute like</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.360" end="00:43:40.130" style="s2">little um produce places that are close</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.220" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">by they have way cheaper produce and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.130" end="00:43:46.080" style="s2">they&#39;re mainly Indian food because</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:47.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the neighborhood on in that being</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.080" end="00:43:49.710" style="s2">able to know what is offered at that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.970" end="00:43:51.510" style="s2">local store and have somebody say oh</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.710" end="00:43:52.680" style="s2">yeah I walked in and made this meal and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.510" end="00:43:54.120" style="s2">then have them be able to put that in</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.680" end="00:43:55.430" style="s2">the system so I can be like I can just</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.120" end="00:43:57.060" style="s2">lock it like using someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.430" end="00:43:59.280" style="s2">intellectual labor because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.060" end="00:44:00.900" style="s2">amazing at that and I&#39;m not to be like</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.280" end="00:44:03.060" style="s2">oh this is in season I can make this</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.900" end="00:44:04.740" style="s2">meal for five bucks right and that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.060" end="00:44:06.090" style="s2">something that is possible but it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.740" end="00:44:07.410" style="s2">possible at the larger scale than ten</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.090" end="00:44:09.030" style="s2">thousand Eibon need ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.410" end="00:44:10.800" style="s2">in Vancouver putting their information</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.030" end="00:44:13.620" style="s2">in for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.800" end="00:44:15.810" style="s2">but we do know what&#39;s in season in</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.620" end="00:44:17.460" style="s2">Vancouver so almost everywhere I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.810" end="00:44:19.050" style="s2">have chief cucumbers at the same time or</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.460" end="00:44:21.870" style="s2">chief whatever at the same time so</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.050" end="00:44:23.160" style="s2">having a chef put in a system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.870" end="00:44:25.770" style="s2">like yes I can&#39;t tell you what&#39;s at your</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.160" end="00:44:26.730" style="s2">local store and I can say this meal is</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.770" end="00:44:28.890" style="s2">probably gonna be way cheaper than</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.730" end="00:44:30.330" style="s2">normal and then if you work with that</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.890" end="00:44:31.860" style="s2">with the staples we know we&#39;re almost in</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.330" end="00:44:33.330" style="s2">everyone&#39;s kitchen if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.860" end="00:44:36.570" style="s2">those staples you can both buy them at</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.330" end="00:44:38.490" style="s2">this price then we&#39;re able to do it in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.570" end="00:44:40.860" style="s2">much more efficient level to say right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.490" end="00:44:44.430" style="s2">now that&#39;s not the growing right but</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.860" end="00:44:46.050" style="s2">like then we&#39;re working with hey then it</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.430" end="00:44:48.240" style="s2">can it is a very short growing seasons</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.050" end="00:44:50.760" style="s2">we have my buy it goes more to the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.240" end="00:44:52.350" style="s2">side of it but during growing season all</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.760" end="00:44:55.020" style="s2">of your neighbors have peas right now</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.350" end="00:44:56.490" style="s2">everyone has spinach right now here are</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.020" end="00:44:58.980" style="s2">the things you can make with that and</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.490" end="00:45:00.420" style="s2">you can buy it from your local your mix</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.980" end="00:45:01.980" style="s2">next-door neighbor right there</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.420" end="00:45:03.090" style="s2">collecting it here&#39;s the price point</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.980" end="00:45:04.470" style="s2">they&#39;re all their food that they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.090" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">extra goes somewhere and we&#39;re selling</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.470" end="00:45:07.740" style="s2">it out to people so you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">worry about that I&#39;m buying it for my</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.740" end="00:45:10.500" style="s2">neighbor and I got to go get it and I</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:13.020" style="s2">mined this from them you know making it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.500" end="00:45:15.780" style="s2">more efficient so Kylie when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.020" end="00:45:17.700" style="s2">talking about sort of helping up the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.780" end="00:45:20.010" style="s2">earliest part of the system with people</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.700" end="00:45:21.780" style="s2">doing individual farms are you picturing</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.010" end="00:45:23.460" style="s2">almost like a crowd farming where</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.780" end="00:45:25.800" style="s2">instead of it being one big farm it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.460" end="00:45:26.930" style="s2">off in the distance that that sends it</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.800" end="00:45:29.790" style="s2">back and forth you just have like</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.930" end="00:45:31.410" style="s2">anybody with a plot of land you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.790" end="00:45:34.010" style="s2">there&#39;s some system that would figure</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.410" end="00:45:36.180" style="s2">out as Julie what sort of hinting at</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.010" end="00:45:37.740" style="s2">what to grow in and who&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.180" end="00:45:39.150" style="s2">growing what&#39;s like nope we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.740" end="00:45:43.710" style="s2">enough cucumbers to thank you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.150" end="00:45:46.560" style="s2">plant some peas where that sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.710" end="00:45:48.150" style="s2">the first step is to replace the big</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.560" end="00:45:52.320" style="s2">farms with you know a thousand small</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.150" end="00:45:55.370" style="s2">farms um yes I&#39;m not even thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.320" end="00:45:58.320" style="s2">in terms of funds it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.370" end="00:46:00.570" style="s2">like micro farms like not true farms but</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.320" end="00:46:03.090" style="s2">a garden and look um there&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.570" end="00:46:06.510" style="s2">proud of this is me thinking about so</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.090" end="00:46:08.790" style="s2">not really high-density living but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.510" end="00:46:10.410" style="s2">know suburbia okay so if you actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.790" end="00:46:13.470" style="s2">had a pretty good-sized backyard and</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.410" end="00:46:15.930" style="s2">even a front yard and like quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.470" end="00:46:18.360" style="s2">of space to grow it yet not even huge</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.930" end="00:46:21.420" style="s2">but just you know something we can we</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.360" end="00:46:23.730" style="s2">could grow something right but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.420" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">knowing I think that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.730" end="00:46:27.329" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:30.930" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested in you know in</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.329" end="00:46:33.960" style="s2">growing it themselves but but you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.930" end="00:46:36.510" style="s2">might be interested in having their land</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.960" end="00:46:39.450" style="s2">be made available for people to come in</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.510" end="00:46:43.500" style="s2">growing there and in return get some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.450" end="00:46:45.329" style="s2">the get some of the produce right from</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.500" end="00:46:48.300" style="s2">yeah wait there&#39;s like you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.329" end="00:46:49.950" style="s2">contribute your time and you know like</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.300" end="00:46:52.589" style="s2">the you know skills you can also</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.950" end="00:46:53.970" style="s2">contribute the land that you own yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.589" end="00:46:59.250" style="s2">and if it&#39;s open</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.970" end="00:47:00.869" style="s2">it&#39;s one day he said or you own and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.250" end="00:47:02.310" style="s2">like I rents where I am but I could say</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.869" end="00:47:03.420" style="s2">yes you can use my backyard right as</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.310" end="00:47:05.700" style="s2">long as I okay with you upstairs</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.420" end="00:47:07.980" style="s2">neighbors you&#39;re legally permitted to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.700" end="00:47:09.900" style="s2">let people grow up yeah I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.980" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">share that like a cohousing and it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.900" end="00:47:14.819" style="s2">Vancouver it&#39;s some of the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:16.500" style="s2">expensive lands on the planet and in</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.819" end="00:47:19.380" style="s2">three Lots that&#39;s what they grew these</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.500" end="00:47:22.770" style="s2">the grew they grew 40 units some 393</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.380" end="00:47:24.359" style="s2">Lots they built but they have a green</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.770" end="00:47:26.520" style="s2">how this like beautiful growing space</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.359" end="00:47:31.550" style="s2">they grow in every square inch oh that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.520" end="00:47:34.530" style="s2">you can grow in and for about May until</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.550" end="00:47:37.079" style="s2">October nearly every bite of solid that</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.530" end="00:47:38.700" style="s2">we make is thrown there like next-door</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.079" end="00:47:40.230" style="s2">neighbor we go and eat I&#39;m like how do</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.700" end="00:47:42.270" style="s2">we eat the blueberries from the neighbor</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.230" end="00:47:43.980" style="s2">when like their one house and we&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.270" end="00:47:47.369" style="s2">know forty or forty households whatever</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.980" end="00:47:49.170" style="s2">but it&#39;s um you can grow a lot in an</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.369" end="00:47:51.510" style="s2">urban area and this is an and Cooper not</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.170" end="00:47:52.650" style="s2">even suburbia where it&#39;s everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.510" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">their own backyard the next-door</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.650" end="00:47:56.069" style="s2">neighbor has a beautiful big backyard</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.240" end="00:47:59.099" style="s2">who grows the blueberry but we&#39;ve grown</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.069" end="00:48:01.619" style="s2">on about three of those plots there was</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.099" end="00:48:03.810" style="s2">a used to live in East Vancouver and</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.619" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">there was this one house that had this</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.810" end="00:48:06.599" style="s2">really interesting setup where the</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">actual had a sign explaining it I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.599" end="00:48:10.470" style="s2">more so that people wouldn&#39;t steal their</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:12.119" style="s2">food but they had this really narrow</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.470" end="00:48:13.950" style="s2">strip of land and I think they were</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.119" end="00:48:14.460" style="s2">calling it the hundred meter diet or</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.950" end="00:48:18.300" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.460" end="00:48:19.680" style="s2">um design where the idea was that a it</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.300" end="00:48:22.349" style="s2">was like in your yards it was a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.680" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">meters you know from your house but it</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.349" end="00:48:27.150" style="s2">was also like you find yourself on I</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:30.720" style="s2">think it was 100 square meters or some</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.150" end="00:48:32.849" style="s2">smaller I&#39;m not that and in their front</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.720" end="00:48:34.829" style="s2">yard in Vancouver they had like wheat</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.849" end="00:48:36.180" style="s2">growing and like a bunch of other things</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.829" end="00:48:37.320" style="s2">that you don&#39;t normally see grown in</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.180" end="00:48:40.200" style="s2">Vancouver or even</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.320" end="00:48:42.870" style="s2">in cities in general that I think like</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.200" end="00:48:44.850" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of a a set up on a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.870" end="00:48:47.040" style="s2">scale in suburbia could be very cool</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.850" end="00:48:49.290" style="s2">where you&#39;re driving down a suburbia and</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.040" end="00:48:50.670" style="s2">instead of you know just kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.290" end="00:48:54.780" style="s2">boring manicured lawns you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.670" end="00:48:57.030" style="s2">like wheat and yeah and tomatoes and</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.780" end="00:48:58.590" style="s2">peas and like people&#39;s front yards and</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.030" end="00:49:00.930" style="s2">then who knows what their backyards are</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.590" end="00:49:02.640" style="s2">like probably even more what I really</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.930" end="00:49:06.050" style="s2">like about good sorry go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.640" end="00:49:12.270" style="s2">Edward I think another thing to consider</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.050" end="00:49:15.260" style="s2">is surplus and community resilience in</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.270" end="00:49:18.600" style="s2">terms of preparing for disaster</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.260" end="00:49:24.150" style="s2">you know drought or that the Cascadia</p>

<p begin="00:49:45.300" end="00:49:48.570" style="s2">of things and knowing having a database</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.250" end="00:49:50.550" style="s2">of that right to know that so many</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.570" end="00:49:52.020" style="s2">pickles we have by the way the number of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.550" end="00:49:54.300" style="s2">people that are involved we actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.020" end="00:49:56.220" style="s2">only home two days worth of food just so</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.300" end="00:49:59.070" style="s2">we&#39;re clear like you can actually even</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.220" end="00:50:00.180" style="s2">do that math right what what I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.070" end="00:50:01.770" style="s2">share was what I loved about the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.180" end="00:50:03.120" style="s2">gardening app idea right and knowing</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.770" end="00:50:05.580" style="s2">this plan and knowing that I can share</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.120" end="00:50:08.940" style="s2">with it is if it wasn&#39;t half right if it</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.580" end="00:50:10.860" style="s2">wasn&#39;t just um I don&#39;t know on paper or</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:12.930" style="s2">something is that I can also share my</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.860" end="00:50:14.520" style="s2">labor when I&#39;m capable of it right on a</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.930" end="00:50:16.770" style="s2">day I have more spoons I can be like</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.520" end="00:50:18.810" style="s2">who&#39;s got work for me to do right like I</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.770" end="00:50:20.340" style="s2">could go read my neighbor&#39;s lawn right I</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.810" end="00:50:22.440" style="s2">think I have ten minutes of time to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.340" end="00:50:25.050" style="s2">and so I can do it in small bursts or I</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.440" end="00:50:26.340" style="s2">can do you know it&#39;s it&#39;s done on my</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.050" end="00:50:29.760" style="s2">schedule and yet it would still be</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.340" end="00:50:31.080" style="s2">tracked and put into a system of here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.760" end="00:50:33.090" style="s2">how much food I get out of it if I</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.080" end="00:50:34.740" style="s2">needed that to happen or just hey I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.090" end="00:50:37.160" style="s2">really good putting in an hour worth of</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.740" end="00:50:41.310" style="s2">time knowing that it feeds my neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.160" end="00:50:43.830" style="s2">yeah yeah and within a few also up you</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.310" end="00:50:46.710" style="s2">unlock other cool options like you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.830" end="00:50:49.050" style="s2">if you&#39;re having like a crowd farming</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.710" end="00:50:51.240" style="s2">and each individual plot has notes on</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.050" end="00:50:54.450" style="s2">things you can do you can do</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.240" end="00:50:56.430" style="s2">crop cycling like hey you grew corn last</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.450" end="00:50:58.650" style="s2">year maybe a girl cabbage this year and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.430" end="00:51:00.780" style="s2">then you can also have an overall you</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.650" end="00:51:02.670" style="s2">know snapshot of okay there&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.780" end="00:51:05.849" style="s2">farms in this you know small village</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.670" end="00:51:08.490" style="s2">here&#39;s what each one is growing you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.849" end="00:51:09.570" style="s2">you if you want to start up any one</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.490" end="00:51:12.420" style="s2">great here&#39;s what other people are</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.570" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">growing here&#39;s what we need and if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.420" end="00:51:15.180" style="s2">want to get fancy you could like test</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.089" style="s2">the soil and figure out what might</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.180" end="00:51:19.500" style="s2">actually grow the best there because</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.089" end="00:51:23.900" style="s2">it&#39;s like what if the insects get the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.500" end="00:51:23.900" style="s2">app they&#39;re like over here</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.730" end="00:51:38.010" style="s2">you know ants will be the first ones</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.490" end="00:51:40.260" style="s2">little their little GPS devices instead</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.010" end="00:51:44.010" style="s2">of 5g killing everything just all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.260" end="00:51:45.630" style="s2">bugs learn how to speak the bees tell</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.010" end="00:51:52.050" style="s2">each other the bees tell them the bees</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.630" end="00:51:57.750" style="s2">are all over the place that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.050" end="00:52:00.300" style="s2">sidetracking but ya know crop rotation</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.750" end="00:52:02.339" style="s2">is huge and no I mean you know like both</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.300" end="00:52:03.420" style="s2">for insects then also for nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.339" end="00:52:06.150" style="s2">right that this one fixes the nitrogen</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.420" end="00:52:08.310" style="s2">and part of that is like we grow in that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.150" end="00:52:09.570" style="s2">way even though I don&#39;t grow we grow it</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.310" end="00:52:11.310" style="s2">that way and it&#39;s never it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.570" end="00:52:14.520" style="s2">really grow in the quantity you want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.310" end="00:52:17.430" style="s2">use them it grows in the quantity that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.520" end="00:52:19.589" style="s2">works for the the ecological footprint</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.430" end="00:52:21.660" style="s2">of those plants right so there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.589" end="00:52:23.640" style="s2">like hey we have a surplus of beans</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.660" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">because they&#39;re nitrogen fixing but</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.640" end="00:52:27.359" style="s2">we&#39;re not eating enough beans we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:30.089" style="s2">find a way to eat more beans or we can</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.359" end="00:52:31.830" style="s2">also use that to pay for pay to feed</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.089" end="00:52:34.380" style="s2">animals right to be like hey we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.830" end="00:52:38.670" style="s2">excess excess food we can put this into</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.380" end="00:52:41.339" style="s2">that or and that animal so we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.670" end="00:52:44.070" style="s2">chickens locally and goats and in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.339" end="00:52:46.020" style="s2">short trade that in you know just</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.070" end="00:52:48.480" style="s2">typical game a like we have a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.020" end="00:52:50.580" style="s2">beans I&#39;ve really want some avocados</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.480" end="00:52:52.500" style="s2">right like and just do it it just a</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.580" end="00:52:56.609" style="s2">regular sell our beans for money and use</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.500" end="00:52:59.310" style="s2">the money to buy other cars and I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.609" end="00:53:02.130" style="s2">once you&#39;ve got a network of that going</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.310" end="00:53:03.690" style="s2">you could also do like property nerve</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.130" end="00:53:04.920" style="s2">work if you know because we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.690" end="00:53:07.650" style="s2">Vancouver a no sir</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.920" end="00:53:10.170" style="s2">a certain corn season we just have</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.650" end="00:53:11.370" style="s2">cucumbers all year long maybe in an area</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.170" end="00:53:12.690" style="s2">where for whatever reason they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.370" end="00:53:14.670" style="s2">grow cucumbers but they have you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.690" end="00:53:17.880" style="s2">good berries or apples or something you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.670" end="00:53:20.220" style="s2">could start to set up sort of medium to</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.880" end="00:53:21.930" style="s2">long term shipping but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.220" end="00:53:23.160" style="s2">meant as more of like a trade like hey</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.930" end="00:53:24.750" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna send you two truckloads full</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.160" end="00:53:28.350" style="s2">of beans please send those to truffles</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.750" end="00:53:30.570" style="s2">pull apples and well it&#39;s not ideal for</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.350" end="00:53:33.750" style="s2">like a long-term shipping perspective it</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.570" end="00:53:34.920" style="s2">does help unlock some of that other food</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.750" end="00:53:39.080" style="s2">that maybe you wouldn&#39;t be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.920" end="00:53:41.490" style="s2">in probably the most ideal way possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.080" end="00:53:44.430" style="s2">yeah I think we should wrap up this</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.490" end="00:53:47.340" style="s2">section possibly by saying what we think</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.430" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">is the most powerful adjacent possible</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.340" end="00:53:51.450" style="s2">that we talked about you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:58.920" style="s2">pick any one you can pick the same one</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.450" end="00:54:01.710" style="s2">and then I think for me I like the idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.920" end="00:54:04.680" style="s2">of something sort of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.710" end="00:54:07.020" style="s2">scheduled food app for something like</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.680" end="00:54:09.150" style="s2">uber eats where it&#39;s actually helping</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.020" end="00:54:11.970" style="s2">people save money and eat better and at</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.150" end="00:54:13.950" style="s2">the same time that organization or app</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.970" end="00:54:15.630" style="s2">or whatever is starting to gain money so</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.950" end="00:54:18.510" style="s2">that it can then go you know and buy</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.630" end="00:54:22.860" style="s2">some garden plots or start to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.510" end="00:54:27.560" style="s2">grow in its in its purpose with you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.860" end="00:54:27.560" style="s2">still mostly playing by game a rules I</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.570" end="00:54:40.660" style="s2">can say mine</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.810" end="00:54:44.470" style="s2">I&#39;m for me my in my life what I would</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.660" end="00:54:47.110" style="s2">find most powerful is a way for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.470" end="00:54:49.090" style="s2">recipe sharing to know what I can I can</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.110" end="00:54:51.220" style="s2">afford with both my spoons and my money</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.090" end="00:54:52.330" style="s2">to be able to know what I can create and</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.220" end="00:54:53.830" style="s2">then be able to coordinate with my</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.330" end="00:54:56.050" style="s2">neighbors and other people to bring that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.830" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">purchasing power up even though I do</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.050" end="00:55:00.240" style="s2">think the most powerful is the gardening</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.350" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">yeah for be oh that&#39;s okay yeah just to</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.390" end="00:55:14.890" style="s2">start some test projects on you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:16.870" style="s2">maybe something in an urban environment</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.890" end="00:55:29.650" style="s2">something in a rural environment and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.870" end="00:55:31.660" style="s2">just start sharing information I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.650" end="00:55:34.330" style="s2">think it&#39;s quite that crazy if that</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.660" end="00:55:37.840" style="s2">makes sense it&#39;s like the data that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.330" end="00:55:40.630" style="s2">would need at the level of you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.840" end="00:55:42.310" style="s2">recipe sharing or if you know like</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.630" end="00:55:45.330" style="s2">wanting a particular kind of meal or</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.310" end="00:55:49.690" style="s2">something on those lines that could</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.330" end="00:55:52.870" style="s2">fairly easily flow up from the what do</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.690" end="00:55:54.910" style="s2">we have from this gardening that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.870" end="00:55:57.700" style="s2">all doing what are we missing that we</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.910" end="00:56:00.520" style="s2">might be able to trade on what do we</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.700" end="00:56:02.260" style="s2">have a lot of and you know people</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.520" end="00:56:05.020" style="s2">putting in there this is how I&#39;m using</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.260" end="00:56:06.820" style="s2">it that&#39;s then there next when you put a</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.020" end="00:56:10.780" style="s2">you know like a surplus of the same</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.820" end="00:56:12.730" style="s2">thing and you know the oh we can do this</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.780" end="00:56:15.070" style="s2">so we preserved this and this is how to</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.730" end="00:56:17.470" style="s2">do it and then you&#39;ve got a you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.070" end="00:56:20.410" style="s2">like when you have a fair bit of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.470" end="00:56:24.490" style="s2">information and if you have something</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.410" end="00:56:26.410" style="s2">that sort of community community based</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.490" end="00:56:29.050" style="s2">in terms of gardening you can also pull</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.410" end="00:56:31.480" style="s2">in the education for kids you know like</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.050" end="00:56:33.400" style="s2">that a you know that it could be like</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.480" end="00:56:35.830" style="s2">whether it&#39;s some part of normal school</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.400" end="00:56:39.070" style="s2">system or just a you know like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.830" end="00:56:41.380" style="s2">bringing kids along for lecture of days</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.070" end="00:56:44.710" style="s2">gardening or something like that so I</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.380" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">think you know it&#39;s like I like all of</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.710" end="00:56:49.750" style="s2">the ideas I&#39;m just wondering whether</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:51.180" style="s2">they actually needed to be separate or</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.750" end="00:56:52.800" style="s2">whether you could</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.180" end="00:56:55.589" style="s2">one thing that kind of just grows and</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.800" end="00:56:57.960" style="s2">flows sort of from that you know from</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.589" end="00:56:59.309" style="s2">the beginning to to the end I think we</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.960" end="00:57:01.800" style="s2">absolutely can have it all and I like</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.309" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">that that they do all mean but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.800" end="00:57:04.410" style="s2">starting with one data that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">hundred thousand dollars right so it</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.410" end="00:57:08.760" style="s2">would be prioritizing what&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:10.920" style="s2">impactful we have and then yeah clearly</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.760" end="00:57:13.230" style="s2">like I want it to go down to the growing</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.920" end="00:57:15.329" style="s2">the food and up to the efficiency of my</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.230" end="00:57:17.010" style="s2">neighbors and working with schools and</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.329" end="00:57:20.099" style="s2">making sure everyone in my neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.010" end="00:57:22.230" style="s2">fed and ya know we can do this like this</p>

<p begin="00:57:22.230" end="00:57:28.140" style="s2">sorry solution raising is is like this</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.020" end="00:57:29.579" style="s2">was possible right like not maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.140" end="00:57:31.260" style="s2">four of us but if there were ten</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.579" end="00:57:32.819" style="s2">thousand people putting in ten dollars</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.260" end="00:57:34.260" style="s2">we could create a food app that we owned</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.819" end="00:57:36.420" style="s2">together and it continually get better</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.260" end="00:57:36.930" style="s2">and better and who wouldn&#39;t want to use</p>
