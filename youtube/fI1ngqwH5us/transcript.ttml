<p begin="00:01:08.719" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">when it kept both these visions together</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.990" end="00:01:16.579" style="s2">that of the right hemisphere and that of</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:17.959" style="s2">the left but then in every case and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.579" end="00:01:22.990" style="s2">believe we&#39;re repeating the pattern for</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.990" end="00:01:30.189" style="s2">overreached itself things deteriorated</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.170" end="00:01:33.109" style="s2">and the mindset became more rigid more</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.189" end="00:01:36.020" style="s2">bureaucratic less imaginative less</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.109" end="00:01:38.950" style="s2">flexible less in touch with reality and</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.020" end="00:01:41.329" style="s2">became locked into a way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.950" end="00:01:46.340" style="s2">which is that the left hemisphere which</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.329" end="00:01:49.759" style="s2">is useful it&#39;s not a mistake that we</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.340" end="00:01:52.130" style="s2">have it but it cannot be our way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.759" end="00:01:55.429" style="s2">contacting reality a simple way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.130" end="00:01:58.520" style="s2">putting it is it&#39;s like mistaking the</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.429" end="00:02:00.439" style="s2">map for the territory and you you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.520" end="00:02:02.239" style="s2">touched already on what the dangers are</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.439" end="00:02:04.459" style="s2">of this what</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.239" end="00:02:05.689" style="s2">why does do you think this happens why</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.459" end="00:02:07.819" style="s2">do you think this is a pattern that has</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.689" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">repeated itself so many times well there</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.819" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">are a number of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:17.069" style="s2">one is that it the left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">really a very limited kind of organ it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.069" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">the bit that helps us grasp things it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">relatively simplistic but it does enable</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:29.969" style="s2">you to grab things it&#39;s the part of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:32.939" style="s2">brain that controls your right hand with</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.969" end="00:02:35.430" style="s2">which we grasp things and it controls</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.939" end="00:02:38.639" style="s2">also the aspects of our mental life</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.430" end="00:02:40.079" style="s2">whereby we say oh I&#39;ve grasped it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.639" end="00:02:43.139" style="s2">unfortunately it doesn&#39;t know what it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.079" end="00:02:45.569" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know and it therefore neglects a</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.139" end="00:02:47.519" style="s2">whole range of things which the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.569" end="00:02:49.189" style="s2">hemisphere does know but the right</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.519" end="00:02:51.359" style="s2">hemisphere has no speech</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.189" end="00:02:55.079" style="s2">the right hemisphere contributes to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.359" end="00:02:57.870" style="s2">language but speaking for 97% of us at</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.079" end="00:02:59.909" style="s2">any rate of us right-handers is in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.870" end="00:03:02.040" style="s2">left hemisphere and so the knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.909" end="00:03:05.459" style="s2">that the right hemisphere has is not</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.040" end="00:03:08.819" style="s2">easily expressible and as we become more</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.459" end="00:03:10.799" style="s2">powerful and in each case the Greeks the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.819" end="00:03:13.530" style="s2">Romans overreach themselves for them as</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.799" end="00:03:15.030" style="s2">and in our case I think simply you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.530" end="00:03:17.669" style="s2">the West has done the same thing again</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.030" end="00:03:20.849" style="s2">and it&#39;s very difficult to let go of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.669" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">this mentality that gives you I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.849" end="00:03:26.750" style="s2">that I&#39;ll take that and it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:29.069" style="s2">selfish kind of way of thinking not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.750" end="00:03:31.409" style="s2">communitarian way of thinking it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.069" end="00:03:33.689" style="s2">broad picture it&#39;s a very narrow picture</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.409" end="00:03:36.509" style="s2">it sees the short term not the long term</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.689" end="00:03:38.879" style="s2">and it&#39;s perfectly successful in its own</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.509" end="00:03:41.759" style="s2">terms but if what it doesn&#39;t see is its</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.879" end="00:03:43.590" style="s2">leading into a blind alley and one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.759" end="00:03:44.939" style="s2">the criticisms of your work I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.590" end="00:03:47.459" style="s2">and I think you actually address it at</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.939" end="00:03:49.169" style="s2">the beginning of the the RSI animation</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.459" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">that there was a very simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.169" end="00:03:55.259" style="s2">understanding of right-brain left-brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:56.370" style="s2">in the past maybe the 60s and 70s and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.259" end="00:03:58.469" style="s2">lot of people say well that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.370" end="00:03:59.819" style="s2">discredited the whole idea of these two</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.469" end="00:04:01.439" style="s2">parts of the brain doing different</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.819" end="00:04:04.019" style="s2">things has been completely discredited</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.439" end="00:04:04.940" style="s2">yes well that was one of the hurdles I</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.019" end="00:04:08.190" style="s2">had to get</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.940" end="00:04:11.030" style="s2">and probably if I&#39;d had a regular career</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.190" end="00:04:14.160" style="s2">where I had to just churn my way through</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.030" end="00:04:16.709" style="s2">an academic career bringing out papers</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.160" end="00:04:19.350" style="s2">every every few months I&#39;d never had the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.709" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">leisure and time and well it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.350" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">leisure it was time stolen from my</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">clinical work but actually - I spent 20</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:27.090" style="s2">years looking at the literature and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:28.770" style="s2">there&#39;s no question and it would be</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.090" end="00:04:31.500" style="s2">absurd to suggest there&#39;s no difference</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.770" end="00:04:33.450" style="s2">and forests are the most primitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.500" end="00:04:35.520" style="s2">creatures that we know about going back</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.450" end="00:04:37.740" style="s2">700 million years the very first ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.520" end="00:04:40.770" style="s2">that have a neural network already have</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.740" end="00:04:44.430" style="s2">an asymmetrical neural network and that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.770" end="00:04:48.060" style="s2">has simply become more if you&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.430" end="00:04:51.510" style="s2">more pronounced as we go up the Volusia</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.060" end="00:04:53.250" style="s2">nary tree so the two halves of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.510" end="00:04:54.810" style="s2">are just clearly different they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.250" end="00:04:55.979" style="s2">they&#39;re better precises different</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.810" end="00:04:58.770" style="s2">weights different shapes they have</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.979" end="00:04:59.850" style="s2">different so-called gyro patterns that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.770" end="00:05:02.669" style="s2">the convolutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.850" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">the surface of the brain they have</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.669" end="00:05:06.000" style="s2">different preponderance --is of gray and</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.250" end="00:05:12.840" style="s2">differently to hormones they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.530" end="00:05:14.580" style="s2">different and it&#39;s no good saying there</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.840" end="00:05:15.960" style="s2">isn&#39;t the difference also</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.580" end="00:05:18.000" style="s2">psychologically they&#39;re clearly</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.960" end="00:05:20.760" style="s2">different because we know that the left</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.000" end="00:05:22.470" style="s2">hemisphere for example is the one that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.760" end="00:05:24.419" style="s2">speaks it&#39;s the one that does certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.470" end="00:05:26.640" style="s2">aspects of language and the right</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.419" end="00:05:30.000" style="s2">hemisphere we know has other faculties</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.640" end="00:05:34.440" style="s2">there&#39;s I spend the book explaining so</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.000" end="00:05:36.389" style="s2">it&#39;s just that people latched on to a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.440" end="00:05:38.580" style="s2">very simple-minded model and that model</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.389" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">was that of a machine now the question</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.580" end="00:05:42.690" style="s2">you ask of a machine is what does it do</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:44.280" style="s2">and if you ask the question what does</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.690" end="00:05:46.200" style="s2">the left hemisphere do and what does the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.280" end="00:05:48.539" style="s2">right hemisphere do the answers that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.200" end="00:05:50.940" style="s2">came out of pop psychology in the 70s</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.539" end="00:05:52.860" style="s2">and 80s the left hemisphere does reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.940" end="00:05:55.440" style="s2">and language and the right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.860" end="00:05:57.389" style="s2">does emotion and visual spatial things</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.440" end="00:05:59.550" style="s2">is not true they&#39;re both involved in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.389" end="00:06:01.740" style="s2">everything but they&#39;re involved in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.550" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">different ways in reliably different</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.740" end="00:06:08.729" style="s2">ways so it&#39;s not the watt of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.250" end="00:06:10.440" style="s2">it&#39;s the how and that&#39;s a very important</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.729" end="00:06:13.169" style="s2">question but it&#39;s not one that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.440" end="00:06:14.700" style="s2">scientists are so readily going to ask</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.169" end="00:06:16.090" style="s2">because they&#39;re mainly interested in</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.090" end="00:06:20.540" style="s2">but actually it&#39;s as plain as the nose</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.710" end="00:06:23.420" style="s2">on your face when you come to look at it</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.930" end="00:06:31.340" style="s2">networks towards the world they pay</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.480" end="00:06:33.890" style="s2">attention in completely different ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.340" end="00:06:38.600" style="s2">and when you pay attention to the world</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.890" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">you see different things in it and so if</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.600" end="00:06:43.310" style="s2">they do that they&#39;re going to construct</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:45.470" style="s2">two different versions of the world we</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.310" end="00:06:47.720" style="s2">talked a lot on this channel about the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.470" end="00:06:50.230" style="s2">meta conversation the idea that what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.720" end="00:06:52.970" style="s2">need is a conversation that opens up to</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.230" end="00:06:55.100" style="s2">the not knowing to what needs to emerge</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.970" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">beyond and what it feels like is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.100" end="00:06:58.970" style="s2">happening now increasingly with social</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:01.280" style="s2">media is people are getting stuck more</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.970" end="00:07:03.500" style="s2">and more in certainty and in what they</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.280" end="00:07:05.870" style="s2">do know is that a right-brain left-brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.500" end="00:07:08.420" style="s2">phenomena well it can be looked at in</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.870" end="00:07:11.420" style="s2">that way in that one of the features of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.420" end="00:07:14.210" style="s2">the left hemisphere is that it prefers</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.420" end="00:07:16.850" style="s2">what it&#39;s already familiar with and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.210" end="00:07:18.680" style="s2">finds it very difficult to shift set so</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.850" end="00:07:21.050" style="s2">once it&#39;s stuck into something it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.680" end="00:07:23.300" style="s2">on repeating it where&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.050" end="00:07:25.250" style="s2">hemisphere Ramachandra and BS</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">Ramachandran well there neuroscientists</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.250" end="00:07:29.720" style="s2">calls it the devil&#39;s advocate because</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.740" end="00:07:33.290" style="s2">it&#39;s able to see other things than it is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.720" end="00:07:36.770" style="s2">saying yes but yes but is the Zen saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.290" end="00:07:38.150" style="s2">that I very much like so you can see it</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.770" end="00:07:41.600" style="s2">that way the right hemisphere is much</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.150" end="00:07:45.620" style="s2">more able to be flexible and also very</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.600" end="00:07:47.540" style="s2">importantly although or not although but</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.620" end="00:07:49.340" style="s2">just because the two hemispheres have</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.540" end="00:07:50.870" style="s2">different takes on the world they have</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.340" end="00:07:53.390" style="s2">different takes on their own</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.870" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">relationship so the left hemispheres</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.390" end="00:07:59.150" style="s2">take is an exclusive one either this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:08:02.330" style="s2">right or that is right and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.150" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">what I know excludes what you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.330" end="00:08:07.730" style="s2">whereas the right hemispheres take is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:09.590" style="s2">both and to take that there&#39;s a room for</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.730" end="00:08:12.410" style="s2">what the left hemisphere does there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.590" end="00:08:15.400" style="s2">point in analysis but there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.410" end="00:08:19.160" style="s2">point in synthesis and imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.400" end="00:08:22.490" style="s2">what we are desperately lacking is is</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.160" end="00:08:25.009" style="s2">that overall synthesis it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.490" end="00:08:27.259" style="s2">that at the moment we officially pride</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.009" end="00:08:30.289" style="s2">ourselves on being a very free thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.259" end="00:08:33.889" style="s2">people I&#39;m going sound like a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.289" end="00:08:38.719" style="s2">fuddy-duddy but I think the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.889" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">world was far more open in the 60s and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.719" end="00:08:44.019" style="s2">70s when I grew up than it is today</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:46.279" style="s2">it&#39;s closed down to a number of dogmas</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.019" end="00:08:48.980" style="s2">the internet which is a wonderful thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.279" end="00:08:51.050" style="s2">hasn&#39;t helped because it&#39;s possible for</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.980" end="00:08:52.880" style="s2">people to get trapped in bubbles where</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.050" end="00:08:55.579" style="s2">they reinforce the things they believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:58.160" style="s2">Without Really hearing other points of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.579" end="00:09:01.310" style="s2">view I&#39;m a keen proponent that in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.160" end="00:09:03.500" style="s2">education and one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.310" end="00:09:06.589" style="s2">things one must do is teach people</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.500" end="00:09:08.540" style="s2">always to invert everything they believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.589" end="00:09:10.670" style="s2">and see the value in it in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.540" end="00:09:13.819" style="s2">believe there should be in government a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.670" end="00:09:16.670" style="s2">department of inverse policy so whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.819" end="00:09:18.889" style="s2">the government is proposing there should</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.670" end="00:09:20.120" style="s2">be a department that is dedicated to</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.889" end="00:09:23.630" style="s2">seeing what would happen if we did the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.120" end="00:09:25.459" style="s2">precise opposite and it should be you</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.630" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">know centrally funded and I think it</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.459" end="00:09:28.790" style="s2">would be a very useful exercise but</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:31.490" style="s2">really it&#39;s an intellectual exercise</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.790" end="00:09:33.319" style="s2">that we all need to do if we start being</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.490" end="00:09:35.839" style="s2">too certain about anything it means</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.319" end="00:09:38.600" style="s2">we&#39;ve missed something else this brings</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.839" end="00:09:41.000" style="s2">us to a very important metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.600" end="00:09:42.980" style="s2">point which is that a thing that its</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.000" end="00:09:45.019" style="s2">opposite according to the left</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.980" end="00:09:47.209" style="s2">hemisphere simply as far apart as they</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.019" end="00:09:50.319" style="s2">can be and we move over to the linear</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.209" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">way to what we&#39;d identify as good</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.319" end="00:09:54.560" style="s2">everything I know tells me that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:57.260" style="s2">opposites are connected and if you</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.560" end="00:10:01.220" style="s2">pretend that you are only having one you</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.260" end="00:10:03.380" style="s2">don&#39;t notice the dark side and this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.220" end="00:10:08.029" style="s2">terribly true in psychiatry it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.380" end="00:10:10.069" style="s2">an atchoo ism to say that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.029" end="00:10:12.680" style="s2">work one does as a psychiatrist is</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.069" end="00:10:15.470" style="s2">helping people to see that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.680" end="00:10:17.329" style="s2">good side to what it is that they fear</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.470" end="00:10:19.069" style="s2">and disliking themselves but there is</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.329" end="00:10:21.380" style="s2">also a dark side to the bits that they</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.069" end="00:10:23.750" style="s2">pride themselves on and that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.380" end="00:10:25.579" style="s2">get rid of the dark side you accept it</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.750" end="00:10:28.220" style="s2">and work with moving it towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.579" end="00:10:31.339" style="s2">something creative and all creativity</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.220" end="00:10:31.660" style="s2">and all life is creative mental world is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.339" end="00:10:34.330" style="s2">Korea</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.660" end="00:10:36.700" style="s2">our daily reality is created partly by</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.330" end="00:10:38.200" style="s2">us not out of nowhere but it&#39;s grounded</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.700" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">in something else but we helped create</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.200" end="00:10:43.690" style="s2">that process depends on opposition it</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:45.820" style="s2">depends on a degree of resistance</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.690" end="00:10:49.210" style="s2">actually and as soon as you&#39;ve decided</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.820" end="00:10:51.490" style="s2">that x y&amp;z are good and their opposites</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.210" end="00:10:52.960" style="s2">are bad and we must have more and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.490" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">and more and more of the thing we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.960" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">decided is good you end up reaping a</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:11:00.820" style="s2">whirlwind because the things you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:02.890" style="s2">take note of come back and bite you in</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.820" end="00:11:06.730" style="s2">the bung and I think that what we are</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.890" end="00:11:10.690" style="s2">now seeing in the very destructive and</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.730" end="00:11:13.620" style="s2">and damaging and regrettable moves of</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.690" end="00:11:16.960" style="s2">you know Breck&#39;s is and Trump and so on</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.620" end="00:11:20.350" style="s2">entirely understandable reactions which</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.960" end="00:11:22.450" style="s2">I like to perfectly well forgive from</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.350" end="00:11:25.480" style="s2">people who have just been told that</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.450" end="00:11:27.760" style="s2">their opinions are no good because these</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.480" end="00:11:29.650" style="s2">are things we don&#39;t talk about these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.760" end="00:11:31.870" style="s2">things that you know a liberal person</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.650" end="00:11:34.000" style="s2">knows that liberty equality fraternity</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.870" end="00:11:36.430" style="s2">is all it&#39;s about and the opposites</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.000" end="00:11:38.380" style="s2">didn&#39;t matter so I think where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.430" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">enduring now a backlash that we could</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.380" end="00:11:43.540" style="s2">have avoided by having a mature</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:46.300" style="s2">conversation yes this is good but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.540" end="00:11:47.830" style="s2">forgot to take into account that this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.300" end="00:11:50.200" style="s2">what we&#39;ve talked about quite a lot on</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.830" end="00:11:51.880" style="s2">the channel and our perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.200" end="00:11:54.910" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the shadow of liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.880" end="00:11:55.750" style="s2">the Trump and brexit are both the shadow</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.910" end="00:11:57.100" style="s2">of liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.750" end="00:11:58.950" style="s2">I didn&#39;t know that that was what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.100" end="00:12:01.300" style="s2">said but it&#39;s exactly what I believed</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.950" end="00:12:03.130" style="s2">yeah I mean you mentioned a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.300" end="00:12:04.510" style="s2">different psychological thing because I</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.130" end="00:12:07.000" style="s2">mean Jung&#39;s idea of the shadow is a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.510" end="00:12:09.780" style="s2">perfect one and it at some sense it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.000" end="00:12:12.250" style="s2">feels to us that this is the time of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.780" end="00:12:13.390" style="s2">integration of the shadow that what</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.250" end="00:12:15.400" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing through the democratization</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.390" end="00:12:16.960" style="s2">of different forms of media is all the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.400" end="00:12:18.790" style="s2">things and the cracks between things</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.960" end="00:12:20.860" style="s2">that we thought we&#39;ve got rid of are now</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.790" end="00:12:21.820" style="s2">rising up and I going to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.860" end="00:12:25.020" style="s2">dealt with they&#39;re gonna have to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.820" end="00:12:28.240" style="s2">integrated yes how do we do that</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.020" end="00:12:30.100" style="s2">well of course there is no you not</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.240" end="00:12:33.610" style="s2">expecting me to have some simple answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.100" end="00:12:35.470" style="s2">and one of the difficulties is that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.610" end="00:12:38.110" style="s2">have accelerated the pace of change so</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.470" end="00:12:42.160" style="s2">fast that the kind of changes that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.110" end="00:12:42.889" style="s2">require not only sort of work but simply</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.160" end="00:12:50.600" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.889" end="00:12:52.489" style="s2">made to happen that first and we&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.600" end="00:12:55.629" style="s2">crisis which requires something to</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.489" end="00:12:58.790" style="s2">happen very quickly really because</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.629" end="00:13:02.119" style="s2">accelerating technological advance has</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.790" end="00:13:04.189" style="s2">put machine guns in the hands of</p>

<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:57.290" style="s2">about shoveling information in to people</p>

<p begin="00:16:01.820" end="00:16:06.710" style="s2">that in my education I was taught to to</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.910" end="00:16:09.020" style="s2">think of all sides of a question as soon</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.710" end="00:16:10.640" style="s2">as I believed something passionately I</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.020" end="00:16:12.500" style="s2">would be asked to defend the exact</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.500" end="00:16:16.250" style="s2">important exercise that I think no one</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.120" end="00:16:17.960" style="s2">should leave school without doing you</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.250" end="00:16:21.320" style="s2">know this is what you believe speak</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.960" end="00:16:23.270" style="s2">about it now speak about and defend the</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.180" end="00:16:32.420" style="s2">good but it&#39;s also about imagination I</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.600" end="00:16:35.480" style="s2">mean education is drawing out faculties</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.420" end="00:16:37.910" style="s2">within people it&#39;s not shoveling facts</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.480" end="00:16:41.540" style="s2">into people that is the reverse of</p>

<p begin="00:18:22.320" end="00:18:25.919" style="s2">way the film was made was I would go and</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:27.809" style="s2">meet somebody we would be filmed talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.919" end="00:18:29.970" style="s2">together and then there was always a bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.809" end="00:18:31.530" style="s2">where I went out and they just talked to</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.970" end="00:18:34.230" style="s2">that person because then they were free</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.530" end="00:18:36.570" style="s2">to say whatever they wanted to say and a</p>

<p begin="00:18:38.100" end="00:18:46.679" style="s2">chose for some reason to talk about the</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.700" end="00:19:15.250" style="s2">the anxiety behind it you ramp it up</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.340" end="00:19:16.990" style="s2">which is exactly what we&#39;re seeing which</p>

<p begin="00:22:47.710" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to observe in a bird because</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.740" end="00:22:56.050" style="s2">in most Birds the input from the right</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.180" style="s2">eye goes straight to the left hemisphere</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.680" end="00:23:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s more complicated but at least in</p>

<p begin="00:23:04.880" end="00:23:08.720" style="s2">have eyes on the side of the head you</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.500" end="00:23:11.000" style="s2">can tell which hemisphere is engaged by</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.720" end="00:23:14.510" style="s2">just looking at which eye is being used</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.000" end="00:23:17.470" style="s2">for this particular moment and what they</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.510" end="00:23:20.780" style="s2">noticed was that birds and animals</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.470" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">reliably seemed to use their left</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.780" end="00:23:26.360" style="s2">hemisphere for latching on to a small</p>

<p begin="00:23:29.600" end="00:23:35.900" style="s2">they use their right hemisphere the left</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.540" end="00:23:38.810" style="s2">eye for everything else for who others</p>

<p begin="00:23:51.980" end="00:23:58.910" style="s2">itself an aha moment I could see that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.430" end="00:24:01.070" style="s2">this if this was in any way true about</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.910" end="00:24:04.880" style="s2">humans it would have colossal</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.070" end="00:24:07.360" style="s2">implications because I have a background</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.880" end="00:24:10.280" style="s2">in philosophy and I know that attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.360" end="00:24:11.920" style="s2">changes the world so if there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.280" end="00:24:14.750" style="s2">difference in attention one is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.920" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">fragmentary piecemeal narrow the other</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.750" end="00:24:20.390" style="s2">is broad sustained and vigilant they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:23.360" style="s2">going to see two different realities and</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.390" end="00:24:26.390" style="s2">so that got me into then looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.360" end="00:24:28.550" style="s2">human issue and lo and behold this</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.390" end="00:24:30.680" style="s2">difference is very marked in human being</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.550" end="00:24:33.010" style="s2">so if people have a right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.680" end="00:24:35.270" style="s2">stroke they can have this pathological</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.010" end="00:24:37.250" style="s2">narrowing of the window of attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.270" end="00:24:39.680" style="s2">like looking the wrong way down to tell</p>

<p begin="00:24:39.680" end="00:24:44.660" style="s2">theory as well is that we are in a world</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.920" end="00:24:47.930" style="s2">that is concentrated more and more and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.660" end="00:24:49.250" style="s2">more on this narrow atomistic mechanical</p>

<p begin="00:24:49.250" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">neglecting the more holistic the more</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.770" end="00:24:58.580" style="s2">relational aspects well it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.770" style="s2">and that&#39;s the subject of a work I&#39;m now</p>

<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:07.100" style="s2">how they relate and how this think this</p>

<p begin="00:25:07.100" end="00:25:15.100" style="s2">in fact that there are</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.740" end="00:25:23.380" style="s2">are the sort of bits that stand out to</p>

<p begin="00:25:34.000" end="00:25:39.040" style="s2">with focusing on detail is not only do</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.010" end="00:25:42.520" style="s2">you miss the overall meaning the overall</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.170" end="00:26:41.530" style="s2">at university and that that really stuck</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.060" end="00:26:42.850" style="s2">with me that there are two different</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.530" end="00:26:45.670" style="s2">types of relationships we can have in</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.850" end="00:26:47.200" style="s2">the world one the I thou is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.670" end="00:26:48.940" style="s2">kind of on there was an unknowability</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.200" end="00:26:50.560" style="s2">about that relationship is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.940" end="00:26:53.980" style="s2">something do you think that map&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.560" end="00:26:55.660" style="s2">absolutely and the results of a</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.980" end="00:26:57.670" style="s2">reciprocity in the eigth our</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.660" end="00:27:00.100" style="s2">relationship whereas in the I it</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.670" end="00:27:01.770" style="s2">relationship is a unidirectional one</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.100" end="00:27:05.190" style="s2">which is about power and inference</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.770" end="00:27:08.290" style="s2">whereas the other one is about a reverb</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.190" end="00:27:10.990" style="s2">responsive coming into being of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.290" end="00:27:12.880" style="s2">something so that is a very important</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.990" end="00:27:15.880" style="s2">distinction and I relate the I though</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.880" end="00:27:16.999" style="s2">and the I it to the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.880" end="00:27:19.399" style="s2">language we won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.999" end="00:27:21.949" style="s2">time to because it&#39;s a long story but</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.399" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">it&#39;s in the book but in brief I believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.949" end="00:27:27.529" style="s2">that language emerged from what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:30.819" style="s2">might call music in other words the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.529" end="00:27:34.579" style="s2">music of speech the sounds and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.819" end="00:27:37.969" style="s2">denotative language is a kind of special</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.579" end="00:27:39.739" style="s2">set of a much more richly embedded</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.969" end="00:27:42.709" style="s2">embodied connotative way of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.739" end="00:27:45.529" style="s2">communicating and that it became</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.709" end="00:27:48.499" style="s2">necessary when we were no longer in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.529" end="00:27:51.829" style="s2">groups where you were largely just</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.499" end="00:27:54.379" style="s2">talking I too though but we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.829" end="00:27:57.769" style="s2">about a third party or something else we</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.379" end="00:27:59.929" style="s2">had designs on and so that is how where</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.769" end="00:28:02.179" style="s2">language becomes very important I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.929" end="00:28:05.569" style="s2">seen your work reference in many many</p>

<p begin="00:28:37.099" end="00:28:42.379" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s because of the right-brain</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.379" end="00:28:46.519" style="s2">with that well I think there is not true</p>

<p begin="00:28:54.859" end="00:29:00.469" style="s2">pre-socratic philosophy as we know</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.859" end="00:29:02.749" style="s2">something very important and I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.469" end="00:29:05.419" style="s2">very damaging happened to Western</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.749" end="00:29:11.389" style="s2">philosophy with Plato and Aristotle and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.419" end="00:29:13.669" style="s2">particularly with Plato but these other</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.389" end="00:29:16.009" style="s2">aspects in the West have been more</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.669" end="00:29:18.859" style="s2">expressed in our extremely powerful</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.009" end="00:29:22.089" style="s2">music one thing you can say about</p>

<p begin="00:29:22.089" end="00:29:26.850" style="s2">it lacks the wisdom of Oriental</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.129" end="00:29:31.710" style="s2">civilization but it is pretty</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.710" end="00:29:38.490" style="s2">produced you know Shakespeare so I would</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.070" end="00:29:41.610" style="s2">say our art is where it has been</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.490" end="00:29:44.310" style="s2">expressed but when we start doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.610" end="00:29:46.440" style="s2">philosophy we&#39;re like well we&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.310" end="00:29:48.420" style="s2">make this consistence I&#39;ve see this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:52.350" style="s2">I&#39;ll goes in there and this bit leads to</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.420" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">that and whereas you&#39;re therefore as as</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.350" end="00:29:56.130" style="s2">I say sort of building things up from</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.690" style="s2">little certainties but the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.130" end="00:30:00.090" style="s2">is there are no certainties to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.690" end="00:30:02.970" style="s2">from there intuitive you have to start</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.090" end="00:30:07.220" style="s2">from axioms reason is based on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.970" end="00:30:10.170" style="s2">intuition and it ends in intuition and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.220" end="00:30:14.660" style="s2">so I think there are those elements are</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.170" end="00:30:17.190" style="s2">there but they have been sidelined and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.660" end="00:30:19.200" style="s2">neglected the key thing we&#39;ll must</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.190" end="00:30:21.510" style="s2">remember about the left hemisphere is</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.200" end="00:30:25.050" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s bright enough but not</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.510" end="00:30:26.930" style="s2">very bright it doesn&#39;t really see that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.050" end="00:30:31.190" style="s2">there are things that it doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.930" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">it&#39;s so hermetic its world is so</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.190" end="00:30:36.060" style="s2">self-contained and consistent and self</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:37.590" style="s2">referential that it doesn&#39;t feel the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.060" end="00:30:39.180" style="s2">need of anything else because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.590" end="00:30:42.750" style="s2">sensing that there&#39;s something bigger</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.180" end="00:30:45.810" style="s2">the right hemisphere sees what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.750" end="00:30:48.090" style="s2">implicit what is going on not us in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.810" end="00:30:50.790" style="s2">foreground but in the in the background</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.090" end="00:30:56.030" style="s2">in the context in all these things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.790" end="00:31:00.630" style="s2">are everything that we really value love</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.030" end="00:31:02.910" style="s2">art and we used to value spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.630" end="00:31:06.380" style="s2">truths these things are only</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.910" end="00:31:09.030" style="s2">approachable in an indirect implicit way</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.380" end="00:31:10.500" style="s2">as soon as you start to say well we need</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.030" end="00:31:14.010" style="s2">to pinned us down and make it certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.500" end="00:31:18.390" style="s2">you&#39;re already on the wrong track so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.010" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">think that Gary&#39;s right to point to that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.390" end="00:31:24.260" style="s2">it&#39;s just that I think there&#39;s more to</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:27.450" style="s2">the story and you you talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.260" end="00:31:29.730" style="s2">rationality begins an intuition so well</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.450" end="00:31:33.630" style="s2">yes it has to I&#39;m in fact it begins a</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.730" end="00:31:35.610" style="s2">nutrition in two ways one is that we we</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.630" end="00:31:36.210" style="s2">can&#39;t rationally prove my reason as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.610" end="00:31:39.419" style="s2">helpful</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.210" end="00:31:41.820" style="s2">we ensure that it is a useful tool but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.419" end="00:31:44.279" style="s2">secondly when we begin reasoning we have</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.820" end="00:31:47.639" style="s2">to begin from quite a host of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.279" end="00:31:49.740" style="s2">assumptions science they officially</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.639" end="00:31:52.110" style="s2">claims to make no assumptions in fact</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.740" end="00:31:54.539" style="s2">makes quite a few assumptions before it</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.110" end="00:31:57.210" style="s2">gets started it has to that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.539" end="00:31:59.700" style="s2">criticism the system can&#39;t work without</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.210" end="00:32:02.220" style="s2">somewhere to start because nothing could</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.700" end="00:32:04.679" style="s2">be supported on nothing it has to be on</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.220" end="00:32:07.559" style="s2">something before it can get started so</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.679" end="00:32:11.190" style="s2">that&#39;s what they mean and it also ends</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.559" end="00:32:14.789" style="s2">in intuition because the results of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.190" end="00:32:17.460" style="s2">reasoning have to be reintegrated into a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.789" end="00:32:20.009" style="s2">broader picture so it&#39;s an intermediary</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.460" end="00:32:24.509" style="s2">tool reason and indeed the left</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.009" end="00:32:26.789" style="s2">hemisphere is an intermediary to one way</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.509" end="00:32:29.639" style="s2">of thinking of it is it&#39;s like this when</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.789" end="00:32:32.580" style="s2">you learn a musical instrument you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.639" end="00:32:35.759" style="s2">first attracted to a piece of music in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.580" end="00:32:37.529" style="s2">broad sort of way then you start trying</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.759" end="00:32:39.779" style="s2">to play it and you realize you have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.529" end="00:32:41.610" style="s2">go over and over the fingering in bar 18</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.779" end="00:32:44.249" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a return to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.610" end="00:32:46.379" style="s2">dominant at bar 32 or whatever it is but</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.249" end="00:32:48.539" style="s2">then when you&#39;ve done all that</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.379" end="00:32:50.039" style="s2">that&#39;s not time wasted but when you come</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.539" end="00:32:52.190" style="s2">to perform it if you&#39;re still thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.039" end="00:32:54.029" style="s2">like that you can&#39;t perform the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.190" end="00:32:56.460" style="s2">relationship with the hemispheres is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.029" end="00:32:58.529" style="s2">bit like that the immediate grasp of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.460" end="00:33:00.360" style="s2">something that the overall take on it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.529" end="00:33:02.789" style="s2">right image the left hemisphere then</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.360" end="00:33:04.889" style="s2">gets to work and does procedural matters</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.789" end="00:33:06.869" style="s2">but then it&#39;s the right hemisphere that</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.889" end="00:33:09.299" style="s2">must reintegrate that information that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.869" end="00:33:11.159" style="s2">is not lost that process was valuable</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.299" end="00:33:13.200" style="s2">but it must have stopped there in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.159" end="00:33:15.090" style="s2">nutshell I think in our society we</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.200" end="00:33:17.159" style="s2">stopped with the light left hemisphere</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.090" end="00:33:19.740" style="s2">we don&#39;t allow it to be reintegrated</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.159" end="00:33:22.230" style="s2">into a much bigger richer picture which</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.740" end="00:33:23.879" style="s2">is in touch with all the stuff that the</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.230" end="00:33:26.340" style="s2">left hemisphere doesn&#39;t know it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:33:37.590" end="00:33:42.480" style="s2">said that he told the story of Western</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.860" end="00:33:45.269" style="s2">philosophy and said that it had become</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:47.249" style="s2">more and more isolating more and more a</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.269" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">prison of the intellect and that the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.249" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">out would</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:55.610" style="s2">to reom brace in tuition reimbursement</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:57.860" style="s2">get out until we did so it just it</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.610" end="00:33:59.870" style="s2">seemed that it maps on very very clearly</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.860" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">to the the picture that your your</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.870" end="00:34:06.350" style="s2">painting yes that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:10.300" style="s2">the other thing one ought to say is that</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.350" end="00:34:15.070" style="s2">philosophy has made strides in the last</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.300" end="00:34:18.190" style="s2">couple hundred years and i think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.070" end="00:34:23.149" style="s2">there&#39;s been a redressing of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.190" end="00:34:25.550" style="s2">particularly in early on in Hegel and in</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.149" end="00:34:27.080" style="s2">the the German idealists Victor shelling</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.550" end="00:34:30.589" style="s2">and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.080" end="00:34:34.790" style="s2">to an extent in Nietzsche who&#39;s a mad</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.589" end="00:34:40.460" style="s2">genius but mainly in the tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.790" end="00:34:45.020" style="s2">two two groups one is the American</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.020" end="00:34:52.149" style="s2">Tom Giri and the other is the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.389" end="00:34:54.220" style="s2">phenomenological tradition in Europe</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.149" end="00:35:00.020" style="s2">Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.220" end="00:35:02.119" style="s2">marathon T Shayla Russell to a degree so</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.020" end="00:35:04.220" style="s2">I think in and the later Wittgenstein</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.119" end="00:35:08.030" style="s2">would fit with that the earlier they</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.220" end="00:35:11.780" style="s2">could Stein not you there was a comment</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.030" end="00:35:15.080" style="s2">on the RSA video from a physicist who</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.780" end="00:35:17.930" style="s2">said that he found it very useful in</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.080" end="00:35:19.010" style="s2">looking at why they were so far away</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.930" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">from coming up with a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.010" end="00:35:22.280" style="s2">everything because his sense was that</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:23.810" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at the individual</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.280" end="00:35:25.700" style="s2">details and not looking at the whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.810" end="00:35:28.630" style="s2">does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.700" end="00:35:33.920" style="s2">it certainly does and I hadn&#39;t seen that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.630" end="00:35:35.900" style="s2">comment but well one of the gratifying</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.920" end="00:35:38.270" style="s2">things has been the number of physicists</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.900" end="00:35:40.160" style="s2">who have written to me saying there are</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.270" end="00:35:42.859" style="s2">enormous resonances between your work</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.160" end="00:35:47.990" style="s2">and what we are doing in physics</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.859" end="00:35:50.180" style="s2">I thought you unskilled to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.990" end="00:35:52.790" style="s2">those although I have an idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.180" end="00:35:54.619" style="s2">shape they&#39;re talking about and recently</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.790" end="00:35:56.180" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to acquaint myself with</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.619" end="00:35:58.250" style="s2">quantum field theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.180" end="00:36:03.290" style="s2">actually very interesting development</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.250" end="00:36:05.180" style="s2">out of quantum mechanics and I will try</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.290" end="00:36:07.569" style="s2">to write a bit about that in my current</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.180" end="00:36:11.599" style="s2">book but only after running it by some</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.569" end="00:36:15.770" style="s2">very kind physicist friends but I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.599" end="00:36:18.710" style="s2">what is important is that what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.770" end="00:36:20.720" style="s2">saying if it is true will apply to</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.710" end="00:36:22.579" style="s2">everything because it&#39;s about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.720" end="00:36:25.190" style="s2">of reality and the people who are at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.579" end="00:36:27.650" style="s2">coalface of reality are poets and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.190" end="00:36:30.829" style="s2">physicists and you know they have</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.650" end="00:36:33.050" style="s2">written to me saying how how much they</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.829" end="00:36:35.569" style="s2">feel the residents but what has struck</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.050" end="00:36:38.750" style="s2">me is that people that I didn&#39;t expect</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.569" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">like lawyers and people in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.750" end="00:36:44.349" style="s2">finance and economists you know are some</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:46.400" style="s2">of my most frequent correspondence</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.349" end="00:36:49.569" style="s2">because they say what you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.400" end="00:36:53.030" style="s2">is exactly the problems in our realm so</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.569" end="00:36:57.500" style="s2">I&#39;m delighted because I never had the</p>

<p begin="00:36:57.500" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">happen but that what I&#39;m saying has been</p>
