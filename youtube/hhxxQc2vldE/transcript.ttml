<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">bit about his microsci</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:14.159" style="s2">project today we&#39;re going to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:16.799" style="s2">split to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.159" end="00:01:18.799" style="s2">very high side and then get down to some</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.799" end="00:01:20.159" style="s2">details on microscience i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.799" end="00:01:22.799" style="s2">going to start off</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.159" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">talking about the biggest of questions</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.799" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">or one of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:30.320" style="s2">questions in this field is how does mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:31.840" style="s2">arise from brain and can it arise from</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.320" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">an artificial brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.840" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">yosha i think it can</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">obviously and so the question is of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:42.640" style="s2">course what is mind and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:44.960" style="s2">there sometimes we need to clarify our</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.640" end="00:01:46.479" style="s2">terms not so much to absorb them but to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.960" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">make sure that we are talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.479" end="00:01:50.720" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:53.439" style="s2">so uh typically when i say mind i refer</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.720" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">to essentially the software that runs on</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.439" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.399" style="s2">and that enables everything else and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.960" end="00:02:00.640" style="s2">what is software</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.399" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">i think that software is best understood</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:05.360" style="s2">not as a physical thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:05.759" style="s2">as something that has an identity but as</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.360" end="00:02:07.759" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.759" end="00:02:09.280" style="s2">physical law it&#39;s a very specific</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.759" end="00:02:11.280" style="s2">physical law that says</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.280" end="00:02:14.080" style="s2">whenever you put things together in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.280" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">universe in this particular arrangement</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.080" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">the following thing will happen and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">following thing is a description in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">terms of certain macro states that have</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:24.800" style="s2">a causal structure and in this sense you</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:26.319" style="s2">could say that for instance the text</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.800" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">processor in your computer doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.319" end="00:02:30.239" style="s2">an identity</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a physical law and the physical law</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.239" end="00:02:33.519" style="s2">says that when the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:36.239" style="s2">gates in your computer are in this this</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.519" end="00:02:38.000" style="s2">arrangement they can be described as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.239" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">text processor</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.000" end="00:02:41.440" style="s2">and when you interact with it the</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:42.720" style="s2">following thing will happen when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.440" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">when it&#39;s currently in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.720" end="00:02:47.040" style="s2">state so the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.400" style="s2">category of things is mind it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.040" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">have an identity</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.400" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">it&#39;s a principle it&#39;s a software that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.480" style="s2">runs on your brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t uh run on your brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.480" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">because uh it</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">is corresponding one to one to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">configuration</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">of atoms in your neurons but because</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.400" end="00:03:05.920" style="s2">there is a coherence</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:07.760" style="s2">causal structure emerging over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.920" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">activity of the neurons that you can use</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.760" end="00:03:10.720" style="s2">to describe it it&#39;s a lens to look at</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.440" style="s2">the activity</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.720" end="00:03:15.280" style="s2">of many neurons and there is not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.440" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">reason why this should happen</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.280" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">should not happen in other substrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">that are under the same functional</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:22.000" style="s2">constraints and can</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.840" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">implement the same principles in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.000" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">same way as we can implement</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">software on many many different types of</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">computers as long as brains are turing</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">complete</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">you can build mines on different</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">substrates</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.920" style="s2">if you are implementing the same clause</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:38.000" style="s2">of principles</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.920" end="00:03:39.120" style="s2">of course people would argue that human</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.000" end="00:03:40.720" style="s2">mind the human</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.120" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">consciousness we talk we&#39;ll make a</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.720" end="00:03:44.239" style="s2">distinction later about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:45.280" style="s2">and mind but let&#39;s for the moment keep</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.239" end="00:03:48.239" style="s2">them together</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.280" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">is strongly embedded in its bodily</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.040" end="00:03:53.120" style="s2">and that in fact some people like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.799" end="00:03:55.360" style="s2">antonio demacio would argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.120" end="00:03:57.280" style="s2">the actual root of our conscious being</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.360" end="00:03:58.720" style="s2">is deep in the brain stem and is more</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.280" end="00:04:01.200" style="s2">related to our body</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:02.720" style="s2">actually than it is to our higher brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.200" end="00:04:05.599" style="s2">and if if that&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.720" end="00:04:07.920" style="s2">then while we could create artifacts</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.599" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">that were analogous to the mind in some</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.920" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">they essentially can&#39;t be the same if</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">they&#39;re not embodied in the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">kind of structure that the human mind is</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:18.720" style="s2">embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">if i change the interface that you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.720" end="00:04:22.240" style="s2">to the universe so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.199" style="s2">are situated different way for instance</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.240" end="00:04:25.280" style="s2">you are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.199" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">no longer located in your body but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.280" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">are connected to sensors all over a city</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:32.320" style="s2">and your incentives are aligned with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:35.040" style="s2">incentives of the city and you also</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.320" end="00:04:35.759" style="s2">identify with these goals and so on you</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.040" end="00:04:37.919" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.759" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">turn into a city at some level right and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.919" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:44.560" style="s2">still means that you have a mind even if</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">i change your affordances in the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.560" end="00:04:47.759" style="s2">way if i</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">limit your affordances to things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.759" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">are internal to your own mind as it</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:52.320" style="s2">happens for instance during dreams at</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">night it&#39;s not that you lose your</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">consciousness in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:57.759" style="s2">and i think that you can also be</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:04:58.800" style="s2">perfectly conscious uh while playing</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.759" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">minecraft and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.800" end="00:05:02.560" style="s2">even if you are embedded in a vr that</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:05.280" style="s2">only gives you access to minecraft</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.560" end="00:05:07.199" style="s2">that probably has enough complexity to</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.280" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">without loss of generality be sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.199" end="00:05:09.919" style="s2">to be conscious and and to form a bond</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:12.240" style="s2">to an</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.919" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">external world and we can take minecraft</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.240" end="00:05:16.400" style="s2">and implement this on a chip</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">we can implement this on neural tissue</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.400" end="00:05:20.639" style="s2">in principle at least and implement</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:22.639" style="s2">this within the brain itself so you</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.639" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">never need to leave your brain and go</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.639" end="00:05:26.880" style="s2">into your physical body</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">in order to have the experience of the</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:32.400" style="s2">your embodiment can be entirely virtual</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">what you need to have is an</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:39.039" style="s2">have a realization on the physical</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.039" end="00:05:43.680" style="s2">but uh this doesn&#39;t mean that you would</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.080" end="00:05:45.680" style="s2">need to have a physical body that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.680" end="00:05:47.039" style="s2">exactly human-like you only need to have</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.680" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">a human similar</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.039" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">uh affordances if you want to end up as</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">a human-like mind</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">yeah the old brain in the bottle</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:57.039" style="s2">argument right but particularly your own</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">work has put a lot of emphasis on</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.039" end="00:06:00.319" style="s2">emotional states and emotional valences</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:01.759" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.319" end="00:06:03.360" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.759" end="00:06:05.280" style="s2">school of thought that says that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.360" end="00:06:07.199" style="s2">the reality is that the physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.280" end="00:06:10.479" style="s2">reaction of emotions such as</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.199" end="00:06:13.440" style="s2">heartbeat and respiration skin</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.479" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">tone etc actually happened before the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.440" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">feelings i.e the cognitive states</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">associated with emotion so you&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:22.160" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:22.800" style="s2">essentially have inputs that you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:24.400" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.800" end="00:06:26.639" style="s2">at least for humans if you want to try</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.400" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">to extend them to a non-body state brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.639" end="00:06:29.919" style="s2">in a bottle</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">you&#39;d also have to essentially fake out</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.919" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">the physiological emotional responses</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:36.080" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t you we</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:38.319" style="s2">probably noticed that consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.080" end="00:06:40.400" style="s2">not in charge when we control our</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.319" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">interactions with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.400" end="00:06:43.520" style="s2">some meditators say that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.360" style="s2">is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.520" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">this little monkey sitting on top of an</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.360" end="00:06:50.160" style="s2">elephant and it can direct the attention</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:52.240" style="s2">of the elephant by prodding it</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.160" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">but eventually at the end of the day the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.240" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">elephant is still going to do what it</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:57.599" style="s2">wants</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:06:59.599" style="s2">and if the monkey thinks it&#39;s in charge</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.599" end="00:07:01.440" style="s2">then the monkey is often in for big</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.599" end="00:07:03.440" style="s2">disappointments when it notices that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.440" end="00:07:05.280" style="s2">makes decisions but the elephant is not</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.440" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">reacting to them</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.280" end="00:07:09.440" style="s2">and this elephant part of our mind seems</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">to be much older especially</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.440" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">with respect to the high level concepts</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">that the monkey is developing to analyze</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">its own behavior</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">the attention control system is old but</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:19.520" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">analytical systems that the monkey</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.520" end="00:07:22.319" style="s2">employs as a result of its analytical</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.319" end="00:07:26.800" style="s2">attentional reasoning and so on they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:27.520" style="s2">rather young and i think that feelings</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.800" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">are a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.520" end="00:07:32.800" style="s2">in which the emotions and motivational</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:36.160" style="s2">impulses of the elephant are accessible</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.800" end="00:07:38.479" style="s2">to the analytic monkey and</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.160" end="00:07:40.240" style="s2">so in this sense you could argue that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.479" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">there is a lot of stuff that precedes</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.240" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">the feelings because there are a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">of communicating between subsystems in</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:49.039" style="s2">the brain it&#39;s the perceptual system</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">that does the majority of operations in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.039" end="00:07:51.280" style="s2">something like a distributed neural</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.280" end="00:07:56.240" style="s2">with nearly continuous dynamics and then</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:07:58.080" style="s2">this analytical grammatical engine</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">how do you interface these two systems</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.520" style="s2">and you basically need to</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">take the features that are being</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.520" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">computed in this distributed perceptual</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">architecture</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">and translate them to the localist</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">discrete analytical model and you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">this by projecting them into a space</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:15.199" style="s2">and the only space that is consistently</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:17.599" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.199" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">is the body map so feelings are</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.599" end="00:08:21.199" style="s2">projected into the body map to</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">disinvigorate them</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.199" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">you could also take the perceptual space</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">just outside of the body mat but this</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">changes all the time and we would not</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:32.719" style="s2">uh self-assign it we could also have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:33.919" style="s2">specific emotion space that is distinct</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:36.240" style="s2">from the body man why</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.919" end="00:08:37.279" style="s2">why don&#39;t we have feelings outside of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.240" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">the body</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.279" end="00:08:40.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a weird thing and i suspect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">because feelings have been</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.320" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">implemented as an after thought and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:45.120" style="s2">evolution so they had to be mapped into</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:48.240" style="s2">an existing brain region</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.120" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">so when you uh feel love in your heart</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">anxiety in your solar plexus is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">because your gut is involved in these</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:54.959" style="s2">computations</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">your gut is completely occupied with</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.959" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">hurting bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:08:59.839" style="s2">i think that&#39;s simply a projection that</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:02.480" style="s2">happens</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.839" end="00:09:03.519" style="s2">and if you are a paraplegic and you</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.480" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.519" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">access to sensations in your body you</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">still feel emotions in your body</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">yeah the linkage between emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:14.000" style="s2">feelings is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:15.680" style="s2">and at one level you could say they they</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.000" end="00:09:16.880" style="s2">go both ways you know again there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.680" end="00:09:19.519" style="s2">some very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.880" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">psychology lab experiments where for</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.519" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">instance i think one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:26.000" style="s2">more famous ones is a person who walks</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">across a dangerous bridge</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.000" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">versus a non-dangerous bridge and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:33.279" style="s2">meets a attractive member of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">opposite sex who asks them some</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.279" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">questions for a questionnaire and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:39.279" style="s2">probability of a male</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:41.279" style="s2">to ask for the questionnaire person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.279" end="00:09:43.360" style="s2">phone number to ask them for a date</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.279" end="00:09:45.360" style="s2">is way higher if they go across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.360" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">risky bridge than if they go across the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:49.040" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">risky bridge so in sense the bodily</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.040" end="00:09:53.200" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">fear or challenge operating</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.200" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">unconsciously well below the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:58.560" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">through the body itself seems to program</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.560" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">the mind itself into a different state</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s interesting to speculate why</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:08.000" style="s2">that is if it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">that an achievement to deal with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">subjectively life-threatening situation</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:15.120" style="s2">uh leads to</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:17.920" style="s2">a higher sense of competence as the uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.120" end="00:10:19.360" style="s2">theory would predict and this uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.920" end="00:10:20.800" style="s2">basically would lead to greater</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.360" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">risk-taking behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.800" end="00:10:24.480" style="s2">in the case of that agent but to see if</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">that is actually the reason we would</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.480" end="00:10:27.360" style="s2">need to look at into this in much much</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">more detail</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.360" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve read about these experiments myself</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">and i haven&#39;t really made up my mind</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">what the actual cause is and what uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">which systems crosstalk and and so on</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:38.079" style="s2">why is it that we uh fall more easily in</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:42.399" style="s2">after we have been in a life threatening</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:43.760" style="s2">situation i don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.399" end="00:10:45.360" style="s2">even though i can easily come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.760" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">few hypotheses which it just did</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.360" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:50.560" style="s2">yeah exactly well let&#39;s do it come up</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">with one hypothesis love to hear</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.560" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">the yoshi bach take on on that famous</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">result yeah so the easiest</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">hypothesis would be if you and uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">master a risk then your willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">deal with future risks</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:05.680" style="s2">increases momentarily because you have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:09.040" style="s2">higher</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.680" end="00:11:12.000" style="s2">self-description of competence it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.040" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">the case that you put lesser value on</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.000" end="00:11:14.480" style="s2">the perception of risks that you would</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:16.240" style="s2">normally</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.480" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">fill your attentions basically you</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.240" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">normalize risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">if you are for instance find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">with cancer in a hospital</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:25.839" style="s2">and you are threatened with possibility</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">of death</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.839" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">then all the things that normally would</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:32.399" style="s2">give you existential fear</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">like losing your job or losing the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.399" end="00:11:35.040" style="s2">friendship of a person you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">particularly like</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.040" end="00:11:39.440" style="s2">and so on certainly are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:41.040" style="s2">important and as a result you might</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.440" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">start ending relationships that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.040" end="00:11:44.480" style="s2">no longer interested or</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.480" style="s2">asking somebody out that you would never</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.480" end="00:11:47.360" style="s2">dare asking out because the risk is just</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.480" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">not that high</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.360" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">compared to the actual existential risk</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">that you have just been facing</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s basically a rescaling of your</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:12:00.320" style="s2">perception of what&#39;s important and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">the valence of the important things is</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.320" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">that makes a lot of sense actually and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">again i know in your architecture in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:08.160" style="s2">other architectures those</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:09.279" style="s2">states decay relatively rapidly so and</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.160" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">that&#39;s why it may</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.279" end="00:12:12.880" style="s2">manifest in that particular experiment</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">where more or less immediately after</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.880" end="00:12:16.240" style="s2">having a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">challenging experience the test is given</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.240" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">if you came back two days later</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">might not be the case yeah so in some</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:23.519" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:24.639" style="s2">the prediction would be that for most</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.519" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">people there is</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.639" end="00:12:31.040" style="s2">a range of emotions that adapts</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:33.279" style="s2">to this situation that the agent is in</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.040" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">so you have roughly the same emotions</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.279" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">and roughly the same proportions as long</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">as you don&#39;t suffer</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:39.920" style="s2">physical pain or actual threats day to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.920" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">that put you under a real stress as long</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.120" style="s2">as you are existentially safe</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:48.160" style="s2">you feel roughly the same things at most</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.120" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">of the times</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.160" end="00:12:52.639" style="s2">and your emotions will adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">range of events that happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.639" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">right so it&#39;s a normalization that</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">happens in this way</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:01.200" style="s2">and if you introduce new events</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:02.720" style="s2">into this stream of events or if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.200" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">change the stream of events</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.720" end="00:13:06.240" style="s2">then for instance the amount of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:09.040" style="s2">that you experience about things</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.240" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">might still be the same even though the</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.040" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">events are quite different</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">and which means you assign a different</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">different valence to this</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:19.040" style="s2">same events if they are in conjunction</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:20.800" style="s2">with others it&#39;s probably an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.040" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">lesson there for organizing your own</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.800" end="00:13:24.800" style="s2">life so for instance uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">many people suggest that you always make</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.800" end="00:13:27.440" style="s2">sure that</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">in all ages you introduce a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.440" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">novelty into your own life so</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:33.600" style="s2">you always remain young you always store</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">and new</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.600" end="00:13:37.279" style="s2">experiences and information and put</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:38.800" style="s2">value on them</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.279" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">and that you will undergo frequent</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.800" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">changes of your environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">yeah i think i&#39;ve been pretty good at</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">that in my life i&#39;m always getting into</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">some or other right i never</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">i never stand still right</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">congratulations</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.440" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">let&#39;s see what we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.959" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">next get your thoughts on some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:13:58.720" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">theories of mind i&#39;m sure you have them</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.720" end="00:14:02.560" style="s2">one theory that was prominent i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:04.079" style="s2">know 20 years ago is that mind was</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.560" end="00:14:06.720" style="s2">essentially a brain wide</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.079" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">set of interlocking frequencies some of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.720" end="00:14:09.600" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">phase locked and some of them rhythm</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.600" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">locked any thoughts on that theory</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">so when i was confronted with single</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">theories about that that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">is something like a frequency in in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">brain that was also adopted by</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">uh christophe cork i didn&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:26.399" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:27.839" style="s2">and uh mostly because it didn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.399" end="00:14:30.000" style="s2">functional sense it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.839" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">explain how this is necessary and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.000" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">sufficient for producing the phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:36.959" style="s2">i thought that oscillations in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:39.839" style="s2">are necessary because</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.959" end="00:14:41.600" style="s2">neurons are not able to be in a constant</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.839" end="00:14:43.440" style="s2">state and make that constant state to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.600" end="00:14:45.680" style="s2">each other they need to fire</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.440" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">if they are connected in some causal</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.680" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">structure they need to fire in synchrony</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:50.959" style="s2">right there</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:52.959" style="s2">will have to be a wave of activation</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.959" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">that passes through the brain this</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.959" end="00:14:56.639" style="s2">wave will have to be periodic so you</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">will look at</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.639" end="00:15:01.040" style="s2">a cyclic activations in regular</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">frequencies and these regular</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.040" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">frequencies that</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:06.320" style="s2">if you can pick them up on eeg it means</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:07.360" style="s2">that large parts of your cortex are</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.320" end="00:15:09.120" style="s2">firing in sync</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.360" end="00:15:11.279" style="s2">so they don&#39;t disturb each other and you</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.120" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">can see a common signal</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.279" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">but this signal would be the result of</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:16.000" style="s2">the synchronization that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">consciousness it&#39;s not that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.000" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">synchronization itself causes</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:23.279" style="s2">and there is on another hand some</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">interesting insight from the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.279" end="00:15:26.639" style="s2">of a neuroscientist who thinks about how</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:27.600" style="s2">is it possible that neurons solve the</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.639" end="00:15:29.040" style="s2">binding problem</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.600" end="00:15:31.360" style="s2">how is it possible that they talk to</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.040" end="00:15:32.079" style="s2">each other at all and then you can think</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.360" end="00:15:33.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.079" end="00:15:35.680" style="s2">neurons as something like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.680" end="00:15:38.639" style="s2">like a neural lattice that is</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.680" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">acting like an ether and the signals</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.639" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">that are being broadcast to the brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.360" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">moving like electromagnetic signals</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.360" end="00:15:47.040" style="s2">would move through an ether</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:49.120" style="s2">this is a model that you can use as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.040" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">crutch to imagine what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.120" end="00:15:53.440" style="s2">and if that happens the question is if</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">the signals propagate with this neural</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.440" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">lattice</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">how do the individual neurons tune into</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">the different programs</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:01.920" style="s2">that are being played out in the brain</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.519" style="s2">in parallel and it&#39;s tempting to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.920" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">that there is something like</p>

<p begin="00:18:21.679" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">important tool</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.960" end="00:18:27.120" style="s2">i think that we don&#39;t distribute</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.120" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">across the brain into the different</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.960" end="00:18:31.600" style="s2">areas but it needs to be the other way</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">the core feature of consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.559" style="s2">that we remember what we paid attention</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.559" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">if we don&#39;t uh remember that we paid</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">then we are not conscious of it in</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.200" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">right so it needs to be integrated into</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.000" end="00:18:49.520" style="s2">a common protocol</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">where it can be accessed later on and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.520" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">this integration</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">means that it&#39;s somehow local so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:58.400" style="s2">the localization of information that</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.679" style="s2">before existed in a distributed way in</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:03.919" style="s2">so it&#39;s the protocol where that pulls</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.160" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">from different regions</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.919" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">of the brain it&#39;s interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:09.919" style="s2">contrast this and to compare this</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:11.039" style="s2">with the notion of attention in machine</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.919" end="00:19:13.360" style="s2">learning that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.039" end="00:19:15.120" style="s2">currently gaining in prominence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.360" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">that is interesting and in my own work</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.120" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">that i do in the area of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">study of consciousness detention has</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:21.520" style="s2">always been</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">absolutely key in my own model and as</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.520" end="00:19:25.679" style="s2">you say it&#39;s quite interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.120" style="s2">in the newest neural net architectures</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:29.280" style="s2">they&#39;re using something they call</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.280" end="00:19:33.600" style="s2">it&#39;s at least analogous there is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.679" end="00:19:35.280" style="s2">something that is very close to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.600" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">attention that we have in</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">difficulty is</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.960" end="00:19:45.360" style="s2">how can you train a system that is not</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">organized into neat layers our brain is</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.360" end="00:19:49.039" style="s2">not a system that&#39;s organized into neat</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">layers so we could uh train it as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.039" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">whole using break propagation with</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">stochastic gradient descent</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:56.400" style="s2">and even if we could it would not be the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:57.200" style="s2">right way to do it because it&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.400" end="00:19:59.360" style="s2">efficient</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.200" end="00:20:01.840" style="s2">right it takes enormous amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">to train a system many many operations</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.840" end="00:20:06.400" style="s2">uh to get it to do the same thing that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:09.200" style="s2">human being can do so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.400" end="00:20:09.760" style="s2">arguably um a human being is much much</p>

<p begin="00:20:17.039" end="00:20:21.919" style="s2">important probe in my own work which is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.600" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">the way the human brain does it must be</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.919" end="00:20:25.840" style="s2">rather different</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:32.559" style="s2">of the things that really got me</p>

<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:44.400" style="s2">know this was about</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.520" end="00:20:45.280" style="s2">2013 or 14 and i realized that i was</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.400" end="00:20:46.880" style="s2">able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.280" end="00:20:49.200" style="s2">learn the game well enough to beat the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.880" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">pretty good ai really quickly like after</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.200" end="00:20:51.840" style="s2">playing seven</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:53.840" style="s2">games and i realized i was using</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.840" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">transfer learning from the other</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.840" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">times i&#39;d played war games of different</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:20:59.520" style="s2">sorts and i started adding it up</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:01.760" style="s2">how many times had i actually played</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.520" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">relatively sophisticated war games to a</p>

<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:07.360" style="s2">and the highest number i could come up</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:09.120" style="s2">with was 5 000</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.360" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">and probably the real number was</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.120" end="00:21:13.520" style="s2">something closer to 2500</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">so the remarkably tiny number of</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">of analogous games that i could</p>

<p begin="00:21:28.720" end="00:21:31.840" style="s2">not even close even the the new good</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.480" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">chess or go or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:44.559" style="s2">these games are vastly vastly higher</p>

<p begin="00:21:44.559" end="00:21:48.159" style="s2">high you can&#39;t even contemplate</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">how high they are i figured at least 10</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.159" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">to the 60th</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">so yeah i think that the next frontier</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">in thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">learning and cognitive systems and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:03.760" style="s2">we can learn from humans is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:05.120" style="s2">the rate at which we learn as animals</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.760" end="00:22:07.840" style="s2">and not just humans of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.120" end="00:22:08.720" style="s2">animals learn very rapidly as well have</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.840" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">to be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.720" end="00:22:12.080" style="s2">fundamentally different than what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.320" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">seeing so far from the</p>

<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">learn things super fast if we</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:22.960" style="s2">can pay attention right the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">is how can you learn how to pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.960" end="00:22:28.159" style="s2">attention in the right way</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">there is a famous video on</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.159" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">youtube where a coach trains uh somebody</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:36.159" style="s2">to play relatively decent tennis uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">within</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.159" end="00:22:41.200" style="s2">the space of half an hour and this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:42.000" style="s2">because he&#39;s able to direct the</p>

<p begin="00:22:42.000" end="00:22:47.919" style="s2">of the subject in this very great acuity</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.159" end="00:22:49.840" style="s2">and tells her exactly what to pay</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.840" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">so she quickly updates her behavior in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">the parts that count</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:57.280" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t know what to pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">attention to you have to in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.280" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">brute force the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:03.360" style="s2">by uh applying the other function very</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:05.600" style="s2">broadly in your system</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.360" end="00:23:07.039" style="s2">and hoping that the errors accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.600" end="00:23:08.320" style="s2">eventually in those parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.039" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">architecture that make the biggest</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">but it&#39;s a very wasteful way of doing it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.559" end="00:23:18.320" style="s2">when i was in new zealand in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:19.360" style="s2">i worked at ian britton&#39;s laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.320" end="00:23:21.600" style="s2">it&#39;s the same</p>

<p begin="00:23:24.080" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">which is a happy coincidence we never</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.440" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">on modern artificial intelligence he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:37.440" style="s2">the father of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:39.760" style="s2">arithmetic coding and he takes a data</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.440" end="00:23:40.320" style="s2">compression perspective on cognition and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">while he</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.320" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">never prominently took a stance in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:47.279" style="s2">of cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.279" end="00:23:49.279" style="s2">his main motivation was to understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.279" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">how minds work when he studied these</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:53.520" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.240" style="s2">and so when i was working for him he put</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.520" end="00:23:56.960" style="s2">me in the lab</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.240" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">and asked me to find structure and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.960" end="00:24:01.039" style="s2">language automatically</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:02.960" style="s2">so what i did was first look at engram</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.039" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">statistics and i realized that</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.960" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">uh adjacent words in english language</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:10.720" style="s2">there are so many different words in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">english language that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.720" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">you cannot really do good statistics</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:19.200" style="s2">over for instance trigrams or</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">quadrograms or pentagrams</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.200" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">mostly are restricted to bigrams to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">pairs of words</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">and this means that for instance you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">lose the predictive power that an</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.679" end="00:24:29.279" style="s2">article has for a noun if there is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:31.039" style="s2">adjective between the article and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.279" end="00:24:32.720" style="s2">noun and if you have multiple adjectives</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.039" end="00:24:34.640" style="s2">between the article and the noun</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.720" end="00:24:37.440" style="s2">the earlier adjectives are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.640" end="00:24:39.919" style="s2">predict the noun anymore so you forget</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.440" end="00:24:41.600" style="s2">you survey most of the structure and our</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.919" end="00:24:42.720" style="s2">own minds don&#39;t work like this they do</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.600" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.720" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">the structure over the entire sentence</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.720" style="s2">so how can i discover the structure how</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:52.000" style="s2">do i do the statistics</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.720" end="00:24:54.159" style="s2">and i started using ordered pairs of</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.000" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">words that didn&#39;t need to be adjacent</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.159" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">and tried to go beyond that it was very</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">difficult because you</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">have such large statistics that you need</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">to do and in a way</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.960" style="s2">you need to do curriculum learning like</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.200" end="00:25:07.039" style="s2">our own learning does so</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.960" end="00:25:08.400" style="s2">we give children very short and simple</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.039" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">sentences</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.400" end="00:25:12.400" style="s2">that are short and don&#39;t require a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:14.320" style="s2">of pointers to maintain</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.400" end="00:25:16.720" style="s2">so the child knows what to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.320" end="00:25:18.640" style="s2">to and then we go to the next one</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.720" end="00:25:20.400" style="s2">and the child dismisses sentences that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.640" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">are too complicated to understand for</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.400" end="00:25:23.120" style="s2">the child</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">and if you try to do this in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.120" end="00:25:26.880" style="s2">learning system you typically don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">these nice data sets where a human being</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.880" end="00:25:29.360" style="s2">interacts with the system and teaches</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">that language</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.360" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">as we teach our children and make sure</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">that the problem is learnable</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:36.720" style="s2">so instead we need to have a mixture</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">where the system is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.720" end="00:25:39.840" style="s2">have candidates for meaning from</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">complicated sentences</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.840" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">and then builds up from there and back</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:45.600" style="s2">then the memory</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:47.200" style="s2">uh that i had in this computer and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.600" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">cleverness of the algorithm that i had</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.200" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">were very very limited i was able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:54.400" style="s2">discover grammar eventually</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:56.880" style="s2">but i was not able to discover style in</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:58.799" style="s2">the way as gpt3 can do this</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.880" end="00:26:01.039" style="s2">and when i looked at the transformer</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.799" end="00:26:03.039" style="s2">algorithm that underlies gpt3</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.039" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">it was fascinating to see to me that</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.039" end="00:26:06.240" style="s2">they basically found a solution to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:08.159" style="s2">same problems that i</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.240" end="00:26:10.799" style="s2">had to deal with in the 90s and couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.159" end="00:26:13.919" style="s2">solve by myself and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.799" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">to basically make statistics over all</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.919" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">the parts</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">in a working memory and find out which</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">ones of those are related to each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:23.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s still too simplistic because</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:24.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a fixed working memory window it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.440" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">not able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.720" end="00:26:28.000" style="s2">throw things out of its working memory</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">and put things in it</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.000" end="00:26:31.760" style="s2">instead it has 2048 adjacent tokens in</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">the working memory no</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.760" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">more not less in this implementation</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">that they use in gpt3</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:40.559" style="s2">and so for instance you can use this</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:42.080" style="s2">algorithm to interpret images but only</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.559" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">very very small images</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.080" end="00:26:45.200" style="s2">so those that don&#39;t have more pixel</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.559" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">it really doesn&#39;t have any language</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:43.760" style="s2">understanding it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">it seems like it&#39;s just the biggest so</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">of associative statistics i think we</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">have to give a little bit more credit so</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:52.720" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t say that it&#39;s a real shot at</p>

<p begin="00:27:52.720" end="00:27:58.000" style="s2">at least not in its present form but it</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">is able to understand certain things or</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.000" end="00:28:02.399" style="s2">at least consistently act as if it</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">understands it which means i can give it</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.399" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">a task</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.080" style="s2">the way that i give it the task is weird</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:11.039" style="s2">right it&#39;s all autocomplete so i give it</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.080" end="00:28:13.039" style="s2">the beginning of a text about the</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:15.600" style="s2">completion of the task</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.039" end="00:28:17.039" style="s2">and then it&#39;s able to continue that text</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.600" end="00:28:18.080" style="s2">so for instance i could say the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.039" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">following is an</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.080" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">extraction of sentiments from paragraphs</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.799" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">then i&#39;ve given two examples</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:26.399" style="s2">and now now i give it new paragraphs and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going to extract the sentiment from</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.399" end="00:28:29.440" style="s2">these paragraphs</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.520" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">and if that is simple enough the system</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.440" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">is quite reliable</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:34.720" style="s2">so i can ask it for instance to of one</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="00:28:46.559" end="00:28:50.559" style="s2">it&#39;s going to do that just fine and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">in some sense a semantic operation it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.559" end="00:28:54.640" style="s2">does understand at some level</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:56.080" style="s2">what it means to extract a sentiment</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:32.960" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">i think maybe no human being is fully</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">is the famous symbol grounding problem</p>

<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.399" style="s2">yeah as you say the red self-referential</p>

<p begin="00:31:03.279" end="00:31:07.679" style="s2">a proper grounding in in language for</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">many of the operations that it performs</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.679" end="00:31:12.240" style="s2">so when it&#39;s able to do a two-digit</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:14.720" style="s2">arithmetic quite reliably</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.240" end="00:31:15.600" style="s2">there is a in some sense a grounding by</p>

<p begin="00:37:25.359" end="00:37:29.040" style="s2">news because all the good</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.960" end="00:37:30.320" style="s2">answers that you can find without labs</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.040" end="00:37:32.560" style="s2">have been around for</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.320" end="00:37:33.680" style="s2">a very long time you just need to find</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.560" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">and translate them</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.680" end="00:37:37.040" style="s2">into the modern language or into your</p>

<p begin="00:37:37.040" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">and so if he has found a new solution uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.599" end="00:37:42.079" style="s2">the question is</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">what is the solution for what does it</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.079" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">really express and the suspicion that i</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:49.920" style="s2">is that the core of the theory is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:51.359" style="s2">really being published it was also the</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.920" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">impression that i got from personal</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:56.640" style="s2">the core of his theory is not phi it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.960" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">not this measure this measure was</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.640" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">introduced</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">as a need to produce a theory with</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:05.760" style="s2">a quantifiable statements that can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:07.760" style="s2">mapped to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.760" end="00:38:09.760" style="s2">experimental predictions because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.760" end="00:38:10.480" style="s2">somehow seen as the gold standard in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.760" end="00:38:13.200" style="s2">sciences</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.480" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">but not in philosophy for him it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.200" end="00:38:17.359" style="s2">an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.800" style="s2">find a theory that explains or that</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.359" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">talks about penn psychism and</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.800" end="00:38:22.079" style="s2">reintroduces it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:23.760" style="s2">mostly because he doesn&#39;t see how</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.079" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">functionalism can solve the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.760" end="00:38:28.720" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">and he does latch onto this idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.720" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">of a distributed information in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">brain but the distributed information</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">that happens in the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">probably not the same thing as it</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.160" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">happens for instance in quantum</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">mechanics</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:42.880" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think it&#39;s non-computable</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s a little bit ironic if you try</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:45.920" style="s2">to make a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">information theoretic theory and phi is</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.920" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">an information theoretic measure</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">for consciousness that is not</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:52.880" style="s2">functionalist because functionalism</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:55.040" style="s2">information theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.880" end="00:38:56.880" style="s2">are strongly intertwined it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.040" end="00:38:57.599" style="s2">oxymoron to make an anti-functionalist</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.880" end="00:39:00.640" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.599" end="00:39:01.920" style="s2">using information theory i think it</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.640" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">would be helpful for audience if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.920" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">could describe</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:06.480" style="s2">what functionalism means i could try it</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">but i think you could do a hell of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.480" end="00:39:11.760" style="s2">better job than i</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">so a very simply put and very cursory</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.760" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">is that functionalism treats a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">as a result of its implementation so</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">for instance what is a bank a bank</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">is a thing where you can have an account</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">and you can have an interface to it you</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">can store money in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:33.760" style="s2">you can extract the money from it it is</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">conforming to a certain legal interface</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.760" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">it&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:38.400" style="s2">you certain guarantees that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">compatible with the legal and monetary</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.400" end="00:39:42.240" style="s2">system and so on</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:43.920" style="s2">and if an institution is fulfilling all</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.240" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">these principles then it doesn&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.920" end="00:39:49.359" style="s2">sense to not call it a bank</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">and dennett uses this as a metaphor to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.359" end="00:39:54.240" style="s2">explain his opposition to the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">a philosophical zombie a system that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.240" end="00:39:58.960" style="s2">identical in all its features except not</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:40:02.480" style="s2">having phenomenal experience</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.960" end="00:40:04.319" style="s2">to us and zombank would be a bank that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.480" end="00:40:05.520" style="s2">is basically a thing where you can store</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.319" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">money and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.520" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">retrieve it again and you can ask for</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">your account level and</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">so on but it&#39;s not a proper bank because</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">it lacks the essence of a bank it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:16.319" style="s2">true bankness the</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.839" style="s2">thing that you cannot really touch and</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.319" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">that has no</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.839" end="00:40:21.119" style="s2">causal influence of its interaction with</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.119" end="00:40:24.480" style="s2">and this uh we would reject this notion</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:26.240" style="s2">of a zombank as</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.480" end="00:40:27.760" style="s2">nonsensical it doesn&#39;t make sense to</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.240" end="00:40:29.359" style="s2">distinguish between a bank and a zone</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.760" end="00:40:31.280" style="s2">bank because there is no essence</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.359" end="00:40:32.480" style="s2">of a bank beyond its functional</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.280" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">interface</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.480" end="00:40:36.000" style="s2">and uh why would this be different for</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:37.359" style="s2">consciousness is there some kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.000" end="00:40:39.920" style="s2">hidden essence</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.359" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">and so in some sense functionalism is</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.920" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">the rejection of the notion of a hidden</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">essence of something</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">that does not have causal properties</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:48.960" style="s2">that we can observe</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:50.400" style="s2">everything can be explained in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.960" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">its causal properties</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.400" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">and all causal properties ultimately can</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">be explained</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:58.000" style="s2">as functions that are implementable</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">which in my perspective means</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.000" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">computable realizable in the physical</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">yeah i must say when i read dennett&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">consciousness explained while i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:09.599" style="s2">necessarily buy</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:12.079" style="s2">his pandemonium theory i did find his</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.599" end="00:41:14.079" style="s2">rejection of philosophical zombies</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.079" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">reasonably convincing what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.079" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2">thought on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">the pandomian theory by the way goes</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">back to selfridge and has strongly</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">influenced</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">minsky who was selfridge student and has</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:26.079" style="s2">led to the society of mind and i think</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:27.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a very beautiful theory it says</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.079" end="00:41:28.880" style="s2">that the mind is basically a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.440" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">agents that implement different</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.880" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:33.520" style="s2">and you can entrain your mind with new</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">demons</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.520" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">and demon is is a good metaphor in</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">computer science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:42.079" style="s2">a program without a user interface in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">way without a user facing front end</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.079" end="00:41:45.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s an automatic behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:48.000" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.280" end="00:41:49.920" style="s2">can be instantiated can run multiple of</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.000" end="00:41:51.920" style="s2">them they can interact with each other</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.920" end="00:41:53.119" style="s2">and produce combined behavior in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.920" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">computer</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.119" end="00:41:56.640" style="s2">and in this pandemonium theory you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">a stage where you have the active</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.640" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">behaviors that are currently</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">populating your working memory and</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:04.240" style="s2">perform certain tasks</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2">and there are others that are sitting in</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.240" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:08.640" style="s2">uh can basically evaluate what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:10.560" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.640" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">on stage and they can pull others on</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.560" end="00:42:13.920" style="s2">stage or boo some</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:15.200" style="s2">off stage and those that are on stage</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.920" end="00:42:17.359" style="s2">can also</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.200" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">call up their alleys elite behaviors and</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.359" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">get them on stage to enact a certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">scene</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">and so it&#39;s i think a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:25.680" style="s2">metaphor to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">how the self-organization of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.680" end="00:42:29.040" style="s2">in the brain might work</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not not doing much more than this</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.040" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not yet an implementation</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s i think a good start to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:36.400" style="s2">basically see</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">a self-organizing system that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.400" end="00:42:40.560" style="s2">adapting itself to a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">unknown situations in the world by</p>

<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">of behaviors at any given time so this</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">is the power of the pandemonium theory</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">for danette&#39;s theory of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">himself i was always wondering why</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">dennis seemed to be so ineffectual among</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.560" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">and among philosophy students a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.160" end="00:42:58.880" style="s2">philosophy students don&#39;t like danette</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">very much</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.880" end="00:43:02.960" style="s2">and also a lot of philosophers don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">like dana very much or analytical</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.960" end="00:43:07.040" style="s2">philosophy for that matter</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">and i suspect it&#39;s because danette seems</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.040" end="00:43:09.760" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:12.400" style="s2">miss the problem that people try to</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.760" end="00:43:14.000" style="s2">explain he is not talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.400" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">problem very much</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.000" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not because he cannot explain it</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">but because it doesn&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:22.240" style="s2">think that phenomenal experience is that</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">important at all it doesn&#39;t take center</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.240" end="00:43:26.720" style="s2">stage in his philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">and i think that could be because janet</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.720" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">is such a nerd</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">maybe dennis doesn&#39;t have that much</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">phenomenal experience maybe dennett is</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:37.040" style="s2">who is extremely constituted on the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:39.040" style="s2">conceptual side</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.040" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">and i can relate to that because i am</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.040" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">also very constituted on the conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:45.359" style="s2">side it&#39;s only that i started observing</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:47.680" style="s2">this difference in people who are</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.359" end="00:43:49.920" style="s2">constituted on the side of feelings</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.680" end="00:43:52.800" style="s2">that are constituted in the site of what</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.920" end="00:43:55.839" style="s2">the people of science mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.800" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">are intuitions maybe pre-scientific</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.839" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">intuitions that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:01.839" style="s2">scientists are very very off</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:03.760" style="s2">i think that a scientist or a true</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.839" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">philosopher is born</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.760" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">as an aberration it happens when a child</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">is so desperate</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">that it decides to permanently trust its</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">ideas more than its feelings</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:18.079" style="s2">and this is often the case when you are</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:21.040" style="s2">a nerd you have the best of intentions</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.079" end="00:44:22.960" style="s2">you have very pure feelings about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.040" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">you should interact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.960" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">you have compassion for your environment</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">maybe but you might have poor empathy</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">because some of the wires in your brain</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">are not uh wired properly during your</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.760" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:36.640" style="s2">and so you cannot guess the mental</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">states of others you don&#39;t have a sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.640" end="00:44:39.599" style="s2">for the mental states of others it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.079" end="00:44:41.040" style="s2">difficult for you to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.599" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">what you should be believing that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.040" end="00:44:43.680" style="s2">should modify your beliefs to fit in and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">so on</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.680" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">and it&#39;s maybe repulsive to you to</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:49.359" style="s2">modify your beliefs just to fit in</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:51.119" style="s2">or to pretend that you modified them</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.359" end="00:44:53.440" style="s2">because you don&#39;t like the innate sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.119" end="00:44:56.800" style="s2">how important that is to play ball</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.440" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">with most humans and so as a child you</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.800" end="00:45:00.480" style="s2">fail in your social interactions with</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:01.520" style="s2">non-nerds and because nerds are few and</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.480" end="00:45:03.920" style="s2">far between it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.520" end="00:45:05.200" style="s2">probably less than six percent of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.920" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.200" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">are on that spectrum you learn that you</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:11.200" style="s2">cannot trust your feelings when you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">to interact with other people</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">you fail if you do that right so what do</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:16.720" style="s2">you do you need to build rational models</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">for interacting</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.720" end="00:45:20.079" style="s2">and i suspect that&#39;s one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">why so many people that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.079" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">very very good at rational analytical</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:26.319" style="s2">models are nerdy</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:28.000" style="s2">and end up in the sciences and are not</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.319" end="00:45:31.280" style="s2">very good at intuition</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.000" end="00:45:33.119" style="s2">and at intuitive empathy and at</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.280" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">the resulting social interactions right</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.119" end="00:45:37.680" style="s2">it&#39;s almost a trope</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">that uh good scientists are poor in</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.680" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">social interaction</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s a disaster i think that we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:45.359" style="s2">cherishing</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:47.200" style="s2">scientists as a lifestyle archetype and</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.359" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">is the goal of the educational system</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.200" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">that every child should somehow become a</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:52.160" style="s2">scientist</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">no a proper scientist is very useful to</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.160" end="00:45:55.359" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:56.400" style="s2">but is a defective human being if there</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.359" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.400" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">trusting analytical truths which is very</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">brittle and hard to prove</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:04.079" style="s2">more than they trust their feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:06.319" style="s2">intuitions right science works like this</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:08.079" style="s2">science works by always finding</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.319" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">analytical truths and only</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.079" end="00:46:14.000" style="s2">believing in what you can prove but</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">this is not viable for life because</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.000" end="00:46:18.400" style="s2">almost everything in the world is more</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">complicated than you can deal with human</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.400" end="00:46:21.520" style="s2">logic</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:23.119" style="s2">right so uh science is able to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.520" end="00:46:25.920" style="s2">the edge cases</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">but it&#39;s not as good in dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.920" end="00:46:28.720" style="s2">mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:30.880" style="s2">of problems that you have in life</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:32.240" style="s2">scientific theories don&#39;t help with most</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.880" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">of the everyday problems</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.520" style="s2">they only help with the difficult edge</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.640" style="s2">cases where your intuitions fail</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.520" end="00:46:40.880" style="s2">so in some sense science exists to deal</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.640" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">with our darkest emotions in a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.880" end="00:46:44.800" style="s2">literal way because uh or</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.240" style="s2">darkest feelings it&#39;s those feelings</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.800" end="00:46:48.800" style="s2">that are extremely difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.240" end="00:46:50.720" style="s2">disambiguate that&#39;s why they&#39;re dark</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.800" end="00:46:52.160" style="s2">they don&#39;t help us they&#39;re our feelings</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.720" end="00:46:53.680" style="s2">in these darker regions</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.160" end="00:46:56.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t tell us what to do and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.680" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">is where we need logical reasoning</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.000" end="00:47:00.240" style="s2">and so i do think that scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:01.680" style="s2">important they need to be protected but</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.240" end="00:47:02.560" style="s2">they are the result of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.680" end="00:47:04.400" style="s2">mindset</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.560" end="00:47:07.040" style="s2">and this is also true for people like</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.400" end="00:47:09.920" style="s2">dennett then it is not able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">talk to people or very successfully in</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.920" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">the same way as deepak tropha does</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:15.200" style="s2">because deepak tropa</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">might not be analytical completely clean</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.200" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">and pure</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">but he&#39;s able to resonate with people at</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">a very deep level</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.160" style="s2">where he can tell them what they what</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:25.920" style="s2">they really care about</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.160" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">what they want to have explained in</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.920" end="00:47:29.760" style="s2">their everyday life</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">so in some sense if we want to make</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.760" end="00:47:32.559" style="s2">computationalist philosophy attractive</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:34.880" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.559" end="00:47:35.599" style="s2">the mainstream we have to explain to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.880" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.599" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">how functionalism is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">intuition</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:44.319" style="s2">this phenomenal experience this uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:46.319" style="s2">the sense for the greater whole with our</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:47.200" style="s2">sense that we are not confined to a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.319" end="00:47:49.440" style="s2">single self</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.200" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">in a single organism but that we stretch</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.440" end="00:47:52.160" style="s2">far beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">that we are somehow distributed in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.160" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">universe experientially</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.559" style="s2">that&#39;s true for normal people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">probably not true for most scientists</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.559" end="00:48:02.480" style="s2">most scientists are confined to their</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">own intellect at some level</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.480" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">including myself yes and i mean i know a</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:08.079" style="s2">lot of scientists</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">and certainly in the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.079" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">community the kind of folks you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">describing are overrepresented</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">in fact probably the greater ones are</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:16.000" style="s2">even more overrepresented but</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:17.920" style="s2">it&#39;s by no means a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.000" end="00:48:20.079" style="s2">probably not even 50 percent</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.920" end="00:48:21.839" style="s2">probably the greatest scientist i</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.079" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">personally have met and spent time with</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.839" end="00:48:25.520" style="s2">was murray gelman and he&#39;s an amazingly</p>

<p begin="00:48:25.520" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">right he has social intuitions you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:31.920" style="s2">he knows a lot of things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">about science and he can weave them into</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.920" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">an extraordinarily interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">unfortunately he&#39;s now passed he was a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">great guy out at our santa fe institute</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:40.720" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:42.800" style="s2">you know he was certainly an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.720" end="00:48:44.319" style="s2">scientist who nonetheless was a quite</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.800" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">complete human being so</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.319" end="00:48:47.599" style="s2">i would make sure we don&#39;t over oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">absolutely well i agree</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.599" end="00:48:51.920" style="s2">statistically it&#39;s true so these</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:52.400" style="s2">geniuses that are very good at all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.920" end="00:48:55.119" style="s2">fields</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.400" end="00:48:56.720" style="s2">they they do seem to exist but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.119" end="00:48:58.640" style="s2">very rare and uh</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.720" end="00:49:00.480" style="s2">far between it&#39;s basically people that</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.640" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">are able to integrate so well</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.480" end="00:49:05.599" style="s2">over so many areas that they reach that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.839" end="00:49:08.720" style="s2">stage of development</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.599" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">in all the areas right i also would not</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.720" end="00:49:12.960" style="s2">say that scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:14.800" style="s2">in a moral or exponential sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.960" end="00:49:17.280" style="s2">incomplete human beings</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.800" end="00:49:19.119" style="s2">they are just different from your uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.280" end="00:49:20.000" style="s2">run-of-the-mill homo sapiens or many of</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.119" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">them are</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.000" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">even somebody like uh noam chomsky who</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">will very deeply respect</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:29.200" style="s2">or marry minsky there are people that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:31.520" style="s2">have very specific minds right there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.200" end="00:49:33.359" style="s2">very good at some things and there are</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.520" end="00:49:34.000" style="s2">other things that they don&#39;t specialize</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.359" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.000" end="00:49:38.160" style="s2">basically they have indications of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:40.160" style="s2">aspergers of a mind that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.160" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">hyper focused on some areas at the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.160" end="00:49:43.599" style="s2">expense of others</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">and there is the suspicion that this</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.599" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">hyper focus is the result of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:49.359" style="s2">compensation</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:52.240" style="s2">that you get super good at uh writing</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.359" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">uh books and uh chomsky is probably one</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.240" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">of the greatest minds of his generation</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:57.760" style="s2">and also in terms of writing if you ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">him something he&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.760" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">respond with a complete chapter</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">including footnotes and references</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.440" style="s2">most other people that i know only think</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:06.960" style="s2">in paragraphs</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.440" end="00:50:08.720" style="s2">and actually it&#39;s rare only good</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.960" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">thinkers can think in whole paragraphs i</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.720" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">know some that do</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">so let&#39;s get back to the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">zombies and denet</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:16.000" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">dennett doesn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.000" end="00:50:19.920" style="s2">the problem and you know maybe the real</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:21.680" style="s2">payoffs you go one step beyond</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.920" end="00:50:24.720" style="s2">philosophical zombies and</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.680" end="00:50:26.880" style="s2">go to david chalmers hard problem which</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.720" end="00:50:28.000" style="s2">then it also rejects as sort of being a</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.880" end="00:50:30.160" style="s2">non-problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.000" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s relatively close to</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.160" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">his rejection of philosophical zombies</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">what&#39;s your position on chalmers claim</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:41.200" style="s2">of the hard problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">i suspect that uh charmers in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.200" end="00:50:47.599" style="s2">a part of the time sees ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:50.800" style="s2">out of the heart problem but he&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.599" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">mostly on the side where he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.800" end="00:50:55.359" style="s2">his current philosophy is often focusing</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">on the question that we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.359" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">the heart problem itself we need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:02.160" style="s2">explain why people think that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">heart problem</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.160" end="00:51:05.760" style="s2">right so we need to explain the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:07.119" style="s2">psychological certainty and we can come</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.760" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">up with theories that explain their</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.119" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">psychological certainty so we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:12.319" style="s2">to explain</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:14.079" style="s2">the phenomenon how a physical system can</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.319" end="00:51:15.839" style="s2">have conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.079" end="00:51:17.440" style="s2">we need to explain why we think that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.839" end="00:51:19.760" style="s2">have conscious experience</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.440" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting right and i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.760" end="00:51:23.760" style="s2">that this</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">goes in the right direction there is</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.760" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">something that struck me when i was</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">looking into parapsychology</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">and i in some sense grew up with a part</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">of parapsychology for instance</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:39.440" style="s2">in the 70s and 60s when</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:43.119" style="s2">uh lsd was around and still not illegal</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.440" end="00:51:46.160" style="s2">a lot of people at the cia experimented</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.119" end="00:51:46.880" style="s2">this lsd and uh incidentally during the</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.160" end="00:51:50.079" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:53.119" style="s2">there were a lot of experiments that</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.079" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">were similar to if you&#39;ve seen the show</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.119" end="00:51:56.480" style="s2">stranger things</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">the amca ultra program and related</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.480" end="00:52:01.839" style="s2">programs we&#39;re looking also into</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:03.839" style="s2">a clairvoyance and into a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.839" end="00:52:05.599" style="s2">far sensing where people would focus</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.839" end="00:52:06.079" style="s2">their mind on different parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.599" end="00:52:08.880" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.079" end="00:52:10.480" style="s2">and would use out-of-body experiences to</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.880" end="00:52:12.640" style="s2">sense what&#39;s going on there</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.480" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">and that number of papers and books came</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:16.800" style="s2">out of this</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:19.359" style="s2">by people that were not completely loopy</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.800" end="00:52:22.319" style="s2">and that had proper state funding</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.359" end="00:52:22.640" style="s2">and when i read this stuff i concluded</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.319" end="00:52:25.040" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.640" end="00:52:26.800" style="s2">is probably incompatible with physics as</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.040" end="00:52:28.640" style="s2">we know it it&#39;s certainly not compatible</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.800" end="00:52:30.400" style="s2">with the standard model because we need</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.640" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">more than the four forces</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.400" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">that are compatible with the standard</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:36.480" style="s2">model to explain what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:37.680" style="s2">and the quantum non-locality</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.480" end="00:52:40.000" style="s2">explanations that come</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.680" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">up here are not explaining it because</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.000" end="00:52:44.160" style="s2">quantum non-locality does not allow</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:47.040" style="s2">the transmission of information that</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.160" end="00:52:49.200" style="s2">normally would require a photon to send</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.040" end="00:52:50.400" style="s2">right it&#39;s uh it might be possible that</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.200" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">there are different regions of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.400" end="00:52:53.760" style="s2">universe that share state</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">but you don&#39;t know which regions of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.760" end="00:52:58.000" style="s2">universe these are</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.960" end="00:52:59.520" style="s2">so you would need to have a classical</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.000" end="00:53:01.680" style="s2">back channel to that region</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.520" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">to know about the entanglement between</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.680" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">these different regions</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not obvious that there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.440" end="00:53:08.559" style="s2">some kind of quantum mechanical</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:12.079" style="s2">explanation for psy</p>

<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:32.800" style="s2">done a little psychedelics in my day</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.760" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">though not in</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.640" end="00:53:39.920" style="s2">so there is a correlation between</p>

<p begin="00:53:39.920" end="00:53:44.319" style="s2">the ability to look into the future</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:46.160" style="s2">without winning the lottery</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.319" end="00:53:48.240" style="s2">right there&#39;s a weird thing about sci</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.160" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">phenomena they don&#39;t seem to change the</p>

<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:04.240" style="s2">we should see a lot of animals that do</p>

<p begin="00:54:04.240" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">we should have a small subset of the</p>

<p begin="00:54:12.000" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">yet the banks still win how is that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">possible it&#39;s a an argument that for</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:40.240" style="s2">she had prophetic dreams every night</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.480" end="00:54:43.040" style="s2">lucid dreams</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.240" end="00:54:43.520" style="s2">it&#39;s very difficult to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.040" end="00:54:45.920" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.520" end="00:54:47.760" style="s2">she was often able to look into the</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.920" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">future during the streams</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:51.839" style="s2">and she started writing this down and</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:53.040" style="s2">she noticed that when she was</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.839" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">experiencing things</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.040" end="00:54:57.119" style="s2">that were costly relevant that basically</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:54:58.880" style="s2">would be the equivalent of winning the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.119" end="00:54:59.839" style="s2">lottery that would change the future in</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.880" end="00:55:02.160" style="s2">any way</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.839" end="00:55:03.920" style="s2">she was unable to write them down and</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.160" end="00:55:06.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like the men in black basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.920" end="00:55:08.000" style="s2">prevented her from doing that and i</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.240" end="00:55:09.680" style="s2">think there&#39;s only one good explanation</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.000" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">for that the explanation is that your</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.680" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">memories are changing</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:16.880" style="s2">retroactively so you don&#39;t remember when</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">your memory changed</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.880" end="00:55:19.839" style="s2">you don&#39;t remember when your</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.280" style="s2">construction of reality changed she was</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.839" end="00:55:22.960" style="s2">not able to write it down</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.280" end="00:55:24.880" style="s2">because she didn&#39;t know it at the time</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.960" end="00:55:27.359" style="s2">that these lottery numbers would come</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.880" end="00:55:27.920" style="s2">these lottery numbers come and together</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.359" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">with the</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.920" end="00:55:31.599" style="s2">knowledge about these lottery numbers</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">you instantiate the memory</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.599" end="00:55:35.599" style="s2">of having foreseen what these lottery</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">numbers were</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.599" end="00:55:38.720" style="s2">right this is the easiest explanation</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.720" end="00:55:42.400" style="s2">and in which case you actually did not</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:43.760" style="s2">know the lottery numbers right you had</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.400" end="00:55:45.440" style="s2">the memory of knowing the lottery</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.760" end="00:55:48.079" style="s2">numbers not actually knowing them</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.440" end="00:55:48.880" style="s2">yes but there&#39;s a deeper phenomenon here</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.079" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">so if the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.880" end="00:55:52.960" style="s2">uh spiritists and the psi theorists and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:54.799" style="s2">parapsychologists are right</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.960" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m not completely ready to dismiss</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.799" end="00:55:59.680" style="s2">them and turing was also not doing so</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">right it is if the same is 1950 papers</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.680" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">makes explicit</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">and affirmative references to the higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">probability that telepathy is real</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:09.920" style="s2">so he even asked the question could an</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:11.920" style="s2">ai system be truly intelligent if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.920" end="00:56:13.760" style="s2">not telepathic</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:15.359" style="s2">or would this be a sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.760" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">intelligence if it&#39;s not telepathic</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.359" end="00:56:17.680" style="s2">there is a deeper implication that he</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t discuss</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.680" end="00:56:22.000" style="s2">if telepathy is real if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">possibility to use</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.000" end="00:56:25.280" style="s2">unknown physics to send information</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:28.960" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.280" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">minds that are not in any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.960" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">known signal in relationship to each</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:33.760" style="s2">other so there are adjacent so you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:35.760" style="s2">observe the other one</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.760" end="00:56:37.520" style="s2">and entangle yourself with their own</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.760" end="00:56:39.440" style="s2">vibrations in their mind just</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.520" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">using your visual sense or other known</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.440" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">senses right</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:44.640" style="s2">if if that is true if there is something</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">like telepathy using an</p>

<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:51.280" style="s2">how can you guarantee that your</p>

<p begin="00:56:51.280" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">computed in your own brain how can you</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.880" style="s2">guarantee that your brain is not merely</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:58.319" style="s2">an antenna</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.880" end="00:57:00.079" style="s2">and the consciousness is computed</p>

<p begin="00:57:05.119" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s the pedro&#39;s hypothesis right</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">that the microtubules are somehow</p>

<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">right</p>

<p begin="00:57:23.359" end="00:57:27.680" style="s2">theory i&#39;ve never</p>

<p begin="00:57:30.799" end="00:57:34.880" style="s2">in my view and i really really like</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.799" end="00:57:37.040" style="s2">hammeroff as a person</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.880" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">hammeroff is building a psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.040" end="00:57:41.359" style="s2">sculpture garden this is theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.119" end="00:57:42.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a theory that is making more</p>

<p begin="00:57:46.720" end="00:57:50.880" style="s2">and so it&#39;s a theory that explains how</p>

<p begin="00:57:50.880" end="00:57:54.000" style="s2">psychedelics work how consciousness</p>

<p begin="00:58:01.359" end="00:58:05.200" style="s2">in a way that i was at the science of</p>

<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s um you know if you are excluding</p>

<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:18.079" style="s2">roughly the same thing as computation</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.079" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">girdle has shown in my view is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">constructive mathematics is real</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:26.960" style="s2">or can be real in the sense it can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:27.200" style="s2">implemented but classical mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.960" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.200" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">contains infinities cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.760" style="s2">implemented cannot be real</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">nothing in the physical universe relies</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.760" end="01:00:37.359" style="s2">on having known the last digit of pi</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.760" end="01:00:38.799" style="s2">right there are mathematics that pretend</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.359" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">that they are</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.799" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">that this works and some of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:43.359" style="s2">mathematics are even used in physics</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:45.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re not real they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.359" end="01:00:47.839" style="s2">computable they cannot be implemented in</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.440" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">any physical causal structure</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.839" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">so this was the implication and this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:54.240" style="s2">an implication i think that</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">penrose has not seen he believes that</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.240" end="01:00:57.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:59.280" style="s2">ability of our minds to be conscious are</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.280" end="01:01:00.480" style="s2">related to the uncomputable part of</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.280" end="01:01:02.160" style="s2">mathematics and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.480" end="01:01:04.000" style="s2">uncomputable parts of mathematics go</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.160" end="01:01:04.799" style="s2">beyond known physics which in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.000" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">is all</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.799" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">computational right even quantum</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:11.040" style="s2">mechanics takes a bunch of numbers</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:12.559" style="s2">and perform some expensive computations</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.040" end="01:01:13.359" style="s2">on them and then you get the next bunch</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.559" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">of numbers</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.359" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">and this is how we explain the universe</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:19.200" style="s2">and the only part that is not explained</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:20.880" style="s2">in this paradigm so far is quantum</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.200" end="01:01:23.119" style="s2">gravity</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.880" end="01:01:24.720" style="s2">so uh the culprit must be quantum</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.119" end="01:01:25.599" style="s2">brevity right it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.720" end="01:01:27.920" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.599" end="01:01:29.760" style="s2">from penrose perspective and the only</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.920" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">one who tries to offer a theory that</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.760" end="01:01:33.440" style="s2">uses quantum gravity</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:35.520" style="s2">to explain consciousness in the brain is</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.440" end="01:01:36.839" style="s2">penrose using his microtubule</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.520" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">and i think this is how it comes</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.839" end="01:01:40.559" style="s2">together interesting yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:42.079" style="s2">i&#39;ve truthfully read it when it came</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.559" end="01:01:44.240" style="s2">when he came out read a couple things on</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:46.000" style="s2">it and i just put it aside and says</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.240" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">well i&#39;ll know that it&#39;s out there but</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.000" end="01:01:49.359" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to pay it any mind until</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:50.960" style="s2">somebody comes up with some useful</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.359" end="01:01:52.319" style="s2">experimental results</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.960" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">and i&#39;ll have to check out this hammer</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.319" end="01:01:56.720" style="s2">off character i don&#39;t know about him</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">but let&#39;s go slightly back to this uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.720" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">big distinction between</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">physics and the parasite quality</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:05.119" style="s2">which leads us into a different world i</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:07.200" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.119" end="01:02:09.599" style="s2">that there are only two possibilities</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.200" end="01:02:11.680" style="s2">either we live in a mechanical universe</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.599" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">and this is the hypothesis of physics it</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.680" end="01:02:15.280" style="s2">says that everything</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:16.960" style="s2">is at some level there is a causally</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.280" end="01:02:18.400" style="s2">closed mechanical layer</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.960" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">and this doesn&#39;t mean that they close a</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.400" end="01:02:20.960" style="s2">closed mechanical layer needs to look</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.960" end="01:02:25.039" style="s2">what the universe looks like to us right</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.799" style="s2">the einstein space</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.039" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">and our theories of quantum mechanics</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.799" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">are probably high level descriptions</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:32.240" style="s2">that don&#39;t describe the coarsely closed</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:34.799" style="s2">lowest level</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.240" end="01:02:36.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s still mechanical it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.799" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">built in such a way that can be</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:39.920" style="s2">expressed as a computer program</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:42.160" style="s2">and the alternative to that is that we</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.920" end="01:02:43.920" style="s2">live in a dream</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.160" end="01:02:45.920" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference between a dream</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.920" end="01:02:48.640" style="s2">and a mechanical model</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.920" end="01:02:50.880" style="s2">a dream has magical interactions the</p>

<p begin="01:02:53.039" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">appears or the comment appears</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.039" end="01:02:59.280" style="s2">and it predicts your career there is no</p>

<p begin="01:02:59.280" end="01:03:02.880" style="s2">or plausible physical relationship that</p>

<p begin="01:03:02.880" end="01:03:07.119" style="s2">that would explain this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.319" end="01:03:10.000" style="s2">interaction it just means that somebody</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.119" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">is messing with us there is a conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.000" end="01:03:14.400" style="s2">right the same conspiracy that exists in</p>

<p begin="01:04:01.280" end="01:04:04.720" style="s2">that this is so attractive that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:06.960" style="s2">theory that we essentially</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.720" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">must live in a dream is that we actually</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.960" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">live in a dream</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:12.960" style="s2">we do live in a dream it&#39;s it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">to have these experiences it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.960" end="01:04:16.720" style="s2">to experience telepathy it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:18.319" style="s2">experience clairvoyance and so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.720" end="01:04:20.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s because we live in a dream that</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.319" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">is generated</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.400" end="01:04:24.160" style="s2">by a mind on a different level of of</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.240" style="s2">existence and this different level of</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.160" end="01:04:28.319" style="s2">existence happens to be physics and our</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.240" end="01:04:30.400" style="s2">culture is a little bit confused because</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.319" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">it assumes that the world that you and</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.400" end="01:04:34.559" style="s2">me see in everyday life is physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:36.240" style="s2">is the physical world but there are no</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.559" end="01:04:36.960" style="s2">colors in physics and no sounds in</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.240" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.960" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">what we perceive is still the dream and</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:42.000" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:44.000" style="s2">brain that is out there in physics does</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.000" end="01:04:45.039" style="s2">not really look pink and squishy in</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.000" end="01:04:47.280" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.039" end="01:04:48.480" style="s2">it&#39;s only a thing that as this is what</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.280" end="01:04:50.559" style="s2">it looks like in the dream</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.480" end="01:04:52.400" style="s2">the dream that the brain is generating</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.559" end="01:04:54.319" style="s2">and to get this right that is an</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.400" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">important thing yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.319" end="01:04:58.160" style="s2">well we i think we all know we&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">for a long time that we don&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.160" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">actual reality you know we have an</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:04.799" style="s2">interpretation of reality and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:06.640" style="s2">we have meaning maps right so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.799" end="01:05:08.240" style="s2">experience a simulation of reality it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:09.760" style="s2">a simulacrum of reality</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.240" end="01:05:12.240" style="s2">it&#39;s completely as if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.760" end="01:05:13.599" style="s2">isomorphic to the world out there in</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.240" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.599" end="01:05:16.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s at different levels of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:17.440" style="s2">distraction right you mean the human</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.480" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.440" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">capability can&#39;t tell us about atoms for</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:23.920" style="s2">instance right without instruments</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:25.920" style="s2">and you know the idea of colors even as</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.920" end="01:05:26.880" style="s2">we know from anthropology the different</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.920" end="01:05:28.880" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.880" end="01:05:30.079" style="s2">divide the spectrum up in different ways</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.880" end="01:05:32.000" style="s2">so some</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.079" end="01:05:34.079" style="s2">tribe in the amazon might not describe</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.000" end="01:05:34.960" style="s2">the brain as pink and squishy it might</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.079" end="01:05:37.520" style="s2">be blah blah</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.960" end="01:05:39.520" style="s2">and squishy which is a very different</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.520" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">narrower part of the spectrum than pink</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.520" end="01:05:41.520" style="s2">for instance or probably much broader i</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:43.520" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.520" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">actually we have a more fine-grained</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.520" end="01:05:46.559" style="s2">color than many cultures so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.240" style="s2">they&#39;re meaning maps and i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:51.280" style="s2">where people get confused</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.240" end="01:05:52.559" style="s2">i still remain a naive realist at heart</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.280" end="01:05:54.640" style="s2">you know i do believe there is an</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.559" end="01:05:55.039" style="s2">objective universe out there can&#39;t prove</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.640" end="01:05:56.559" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.039" end="01:05:58.079" style="s2">you know as we well know i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.559" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">logically prove the universe wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.079" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">created five seconds ago with</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:03.359" style="s2">all the objects in it including our</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:04.319" style="s2">memories and all ballistic objects in</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.359" end="01:06:06.720" style="s2">motion but</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.319" end="01:06:08.160" style="s2">if only for parsimonious reasons i</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.720" end="01:06:10.079" style="s2">assume there is a</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.160" end="01:06:11.839" style="s2">real universe out there and as you say</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.079" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">we have some physical laws but they&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.839" end="01:06:15.440" style="s2">very long way from the planck</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:16.720" style="s2">scale so there&#39;s probably a shitload we</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.440" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know right</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.720" end="01:06:20.319" style="s2">and yet so far they have shown</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:23.039" style="s2">themselves to be remarkably</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.319" end="01:06:25.119" style="s2">lawful we haven&#39;t been able to detect at</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.039" end="01:06:28.480" style="s2">least with a high fidelity signal</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.119" end="01:06:31.359" style="s2">any sigh any any real even deviation</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.480" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">from deep lawfulness and so at least</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.359" end="01:06:34.400" style="s2">tentatively</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:36.400" style="s2">i side with the physicist though i do</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.400" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">encourage ben which he does regularly</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.400" end="01:06:40.880" style="s2">send me new papers on psy because</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:41.520" style="s2">as you say if we&#39;re wrong or if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.880" end="01:06:44.240" style="s2">wrong and</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.520" end="01:06:46.319" style="s2">psy is real then we have to reevaluate</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:06:48.160" style="s2">is the universe actually lawful</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.319" end="01:06:49.520" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s not just a dream maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.160" end="01:06:51.280" style="s2">is a simulation but</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.520" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">for the time being i reject that on</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.280" end="01:06:56.319" style="s2">grounds of parsimony of no other reasons</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:58.559" style="s2">yeah so the only reason to not do it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.319" end="01:07:00.960" style="s2">be uh to not accept this theory is</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.559" end="01:07:03.280" style="s2">because you don&#39;t think that scientists</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.960" end="01:07:04.640" style="s2">are able to explain the things that need</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.280" end="01:07:07.359" style="s2">to be explained</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.640" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">which is why does reality appear real to</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.359" end="01:07:10.400" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:11.839" style="s2">it from a machine learning perspective</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.400" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">it&#39;s pretty clear that if a learning</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.839" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">system does</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:17.599" style="s2">not in some sense implement the belief</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:19.280" style="s2">that the universe is learnable</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.599" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">then it&#39;s not an effective learning</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.280" end="01:07:22.319" style="s2">system right</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:24.079" style="s2">you have to believe in the learnable</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.319" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">universe to learn it</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.079" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">it&#39;s implicitly and uh so the weird</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:31.359" style="s2">thing that we have to explain</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.960" end="01:07:32.880" style="s2">is i think not the qualities of qualia</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.359" end="01:07:35.280" style="s2">the qualities of qualia</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.880" end="01:07:36.720" style="s2">are easier than most people think</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.280" end="01:07:38.160" style="s2">because this is just the geometric</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.720" end="01:07:39.280" style="s2">calculations that your perceptual</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.160" end="01:07:40.839" style="s2">systems are making</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.280" end="01:07:42.799" style="s2">it&#39;s basically the dimensions the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.839" end="01:07:45.280" style="s2">parameterizations of</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.799" end="01:07:46.319" style="s2">the geometric architecture that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.280" end="01:07:50.000" style="s2">computing</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.319" end="01:07:50.559" style="s2">the perceptual models and in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.000" end="01:07:52.400" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.559" end="01:07:54.319" style="s2">has been neglected for a long time</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.400" end="01:07:56.079" style="s2">because scientists have focused on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.319" end="01:07:56.799" style="s2">linguistic the analytical models too</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.079" end="01:08:00.160" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.799" end="01:08:02.480" style="s2">and only with the widespread takeoff of</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.160" end="01:08:03.680" style="s2">the machine learning paradigms and deep</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.480" end="01:08:05.839" style="s2">learning paradigms</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.680" end="01:08:07.520" style="s2">i think it has gotten more into the</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.839" end="01:08:08.559" style="s2">common consciousness of cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.520" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.559" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">that perception is more akin to the deep</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">learning systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:15.520" style="s2">than it is to linguistic systems to</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:17.839" style="s2">symbolic systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.520" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">right the paradox is you can of course</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.839" end="01:08:21.199" style="s2">implement the deep learning systems on</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">top of symbolic systems that we</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.199" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">actually have to they&#39;re completely</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:26.319" style="s2">implement on top of symbolic systems</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:28.400" style="s2">but they are symbolic systems that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.319" end="01:08:30.000" style="s2">very different from our symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.400" end="01:08:30.719" style="s2">reasoning our symbolic reasoning is</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.000" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">arguably</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.719" end="01:08:35.120" style="s2">limited to a very small stack size into</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">very few elements at the time</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.120" end="01:08:38.640" style="s2">we cannot hold more than like five to</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:40.400" style="s2">seven elements in</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.640" end="01:08:42.159" style="s2">our focus of attention at a time and</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.400" end="01:08:46.239" style="s2">relate them to each other</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.159" end="01:08:47.759" style="s2">unlike uh gpt3 that is looking at 2048</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.239" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">and relates them all to each other at</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.759" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:52.480" style="s2">and is doing this in many many</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:54.319" style="s2">dimensions and</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.480" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">with extremely high resolution and</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.319" end="01:09:00.239" style="s2">availability and no lapse of attention</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:01.839" style="s2">so this is a very different way of doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.239" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">symbolic operation than our mind is</p>

<p begin="01:09:07.120" end="01:09:12.080" style="s2">the property of realness comes about and</p>

<p begin="01:09:12.080" end="01:09:15.520" style="s2">is paradoxically not a feature of</p>

<p begin="01:09:15.520" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">physical reality doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.359" end="01:09:21.279" style="s2">anything there are no feelings in there</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:23.199" style="s2">physical realness can only be</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.279" end="01:09:25.199" style="s2">experienced as part of a model because</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.199" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">it&#39;s itself a model property</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.199" end="01:09:29.120" style="s2">right it&#39;s a label that the mind</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:30.159" style="s2">attaches to some of these parameter</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.120" end="01:09:34.159" style="s2">dimensions</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.159" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">and if you look at them you distinguish</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.159" end="01:09:39.359" style="s2">the non-real imagination from the real</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:40.960" style="s2">world that you experience by this label</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.359" end="01:09:42.159" style="s2">that your mind says this is indeed</p>

<p begin="01:09:45.839" end="01:09:49.759" style="s2">and this includes the internal</p>

<p begin="01:09:50.400" end="01:09:53.759" style="s2">in your own thinking processes and</p>

<p begin="01:09:55.280" end="01:09:59.520" style="s2">your experiences are real experiences</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.920" end="01:10:01.600" style="s2">because they are predictive</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.520" end="01:10:02.640" style="s2">of your next experiential features right</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.600" end="01:10:05.120" style="s2">there are models</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.640" end="01:10:05.679" style="s2">of what you experience and the realness</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.120" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.679" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">is a model of of the fact that they are</p>

<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:13.840" style="s2">yeah though of course it&#39;s true that for</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.840" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">humans again as i said before</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.840" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">the resolution of our measurements and</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:19.760" style="s2">perceptions are</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:21.120" style="s2">pretty gross and we&#39;re able to go way</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.760" end="01:10:22.080" style="s2">beyond that with our scientific</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.120" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">instruments</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.080" end="01:10:25.440" style="s2">yes we evolved as if we are in a lawful</p>

<p begin="01:10:25.440" end="01:10:29.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s what works right but it</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.280" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">may well have been that we were</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.040" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">so coarse graining the universe due to</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:34.239" style="s2">our low resolution vision you know the</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:36.880" style="s2">acuity of our feeling</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.239" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">the ability to decompose matter that we</p>

<p begin="01:10:40.640" end="01:10:42.719" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.199" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">at least unless our instruments are</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.719" end="01:10:46.800" style="s2">lying to us we can probe</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.719" end="01:10:48.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t know 20 orders of magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.800" end="01:10:51.120" style="s2">smaller than we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.080" end="01:10:53.840" style="s2">get at as unaided humans and 20</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.120" end="01:10:56.080" style="s2">orders of magnitude larger and yet</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.840" end="01:10:59.120" style="s2">lawfulness still seems to prevail</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.080" end="01:11:00.239" style="s2">in both the microcosm and the macrocosm</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.120" end="01:11:03.040" style="s2">even though</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.239" end="01:11:03.679" style="s2">our formulations of the laws are almost</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.040" end="01:11:06.080" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.679" end="01:11:06.719" style="s2">very substantially incomplete that seems</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.080" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">to me much</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.719" end="01:11:12.480" style="s2">stronger evidence for reality deep</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:14.080" style="s2">reality than merely our sense of reality</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.480" end="01:11:16.159" style="s2">though i do take your point that</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.080" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">you know reality is not an attribute of</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.159" end="01:11:21.360" style="s2">the universe itself but it&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:22.560" style="s2">an experience of a conscious agent</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.360" end="01:11:24.239" style="s2">living in the universe</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.560" end="01:11:26.480" style="s2">but i would say we should have more</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.239" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">confidence in reality than merely our</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.480" end="01:11:29.360" style="s2">naive</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:30.640" style="s2">animal consciousness because of the fact</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.360" end="01:11:31.440" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been able to extend our</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.640" end="01:11:33.840" style="s2">probes</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.440" end="01:11:35.600" style="s2">a long way in both to the microcosm and</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.840" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">the macrocosm</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.600" end="01:11:39.679" style="s2">i think it&#39;s important to hold it</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:42.800" style="s2">somewhat tentatively</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.679" end="01:11:45.520" style="s2">i think that to have an enlightened</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.800" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">relationship to reality it is necessary</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.520" end="01:11:48.239" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:51.120" style="s2">realize that what you perceive is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.239" end="01:11:53.199" style="s2">representation this includes yourself</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.120" end="01:11:55.679" style="s2">and your relationship to the universe</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.199" end="01:11:57.440" style="s2">and this is all in some sense a</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.679" end="01:11:59.440" style="s2">representation that you don&#39;t perceive</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.440" end="01:12:00.560" style="s2">as a representation but as an immediate</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.440" end="01:12:02.400" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.560" end="01:12:04.320" style="s2">and you need to make it visible as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.400" end="01:12:04.960" style="s2">representation you need to pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.320" end="01:12:07.199" style="s2">to that</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.960" end="01:12:08.880" style="s2">you also need to pay attention to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.199" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">attention in such a way that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.880" end="01:12:12.800" style="s2">attention itself</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:14.640" style="s2">becomes visible to you that you can</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.800" end="01:12:16.880" style="s2">notice how your attentional system works</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.640" end="01:12:19.840" style="s2">and how it&#39;s constructing your reality</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.880" end="01:12:21.040" style="s2">if you are interested in that and for a</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.840" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">normal human being</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.040" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">the only reason to be interested in that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:26.640" style="s2">is because it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">and since these attention processes tend</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.640" end="01:12:29.600" style="s2">to work very well</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:31.040" style="s2">most people don&#39;t pay attention to them</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.600" end="01:12:33.360" style="s2">and just take them as given the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.040" end="01:12:35.679" style="s2">processes of reality construction</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.360" end="01:12:37.520" style="s2">and the people that are familiar with</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.679" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">these processes are those that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.520" end="01:12:40.640" style="s2">naturally in altered states of minds</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:41.920" style="s2">because they fell down the stairs at</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.640" end="01:12:44.640" style="s2">first at some point</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.920" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">or have developmental issues or because</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.640" end="01:12:46.800" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:48.719" style="s2">are in an existential crisis for</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.800" end="01:12:50.159" style="s2">instance and this existential crisis</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.719" end="01:12:51.600" style="s2">makes it necessary for them to</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.159" end="01:12:52.880" style="s2">understand their own relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.600" end="01:12:55.679" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.880" end="01:12:57.120" style="s2">and their own self-construction yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.679" end="01:12:59.520" style="s2">let&#39;s step back a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.120" end="01:13:00.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about mind emerging</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.520" end="01:13:02.480" style="s2">from matter we&#39;ve talked about a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.960" end="01:13:03.920" style="s2">the leading theories</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.480" end="01:13:06.239" style="s2">we&#39;ve talked about some of the out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.920" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">theories from your perspective</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.239" end="01:13:13.040" style="s2">what&#39;s important for the next step in</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:15.120" style="s2">the science of explaining</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.040" end="01:13:16.320" style="s2">mind emerging from matter where should</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.120" end="01:13:19.840" style="s2">we be looking</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.320" end="01:13:21.600" style="s2">next what&#39;s the next 10 years look like</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.840" end="01:13:23.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s of course always very difficult</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.600" end="01:13:24.560" style="s2">to make predictions especially about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.679" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.560" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">yes thank you yogi yeah yes</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:32.560" style="s2">i suspect that one of the very</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:33.600" style="s2">interesting areas that we need to look</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.560" end="01:13:36.719" style="s2">at is</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.600" end="01:13:39.440" style="s2">attention-based models and</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.719" end="01:13:42.320" style="s2">the transformer is only the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.440" end="01:13:44.400" style="s2">from my perspective there are</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.320" end="01:13:46.000" style="s2">at least three obvious things that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">wrong with gpt3</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.000" end="01:13:49.600" style="s2">interestingly the fact that gpt3 is not</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:51.360" style="s2">an agent</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.600" end="01:13:53.199" style="s2">is not one of them that can be easily</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.360" end="01:13:54.560" style="s2">fixed right the gpt&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.199" end="01:13:56.719" style="s2">is obviously not an agent it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.560" end="01:14:01.199" style="s2">have a context so if you tell</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.719" end="01:14:04.880" style="s2">gpt3 hey you are gpt3 what are you</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.199" end="01:14:06.080" style="s2">then gptc will uh produce a relatively</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.880" end="01:14:08.960" style="s2">random sentence</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.080" end="01:14:10.080" style="s2">because uh gpt3 has been trained on</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.960" end="01:14:11.920" style="s2">statistical</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:14.880" style="s2">statistics and language until october</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.920" end="01:14:16.480" style="s2">2019 and gpt streets didn&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.880" end="01:14:19.440" style="s2">october 2019</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.480" end="01:14:21.840" style="s2">right so unless uh openaa has built</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.440" end="01:14:23.840" style="s2">something into gpt 3 explicitly to teach</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.840" end="01:14:26.480" style="s2">it about gpt3 what it should say</p>

<p begin="01:16:02.640" end="01:16:06.320" style="s2">and then a parser is reading these</p>

<p begin="01:16:12.719" end="01:16:15.600" style="s2">language is not the right level of</p>

<p begin="01:16:38.480" end="01:16:42.640" style="s2">at the moment</p>

<p begin="01:16:54.960" end="01:16:58.000" style="s2">is but during training it is of course</p>

<p begin="01:16:58.000" end="01:17:02.560" style="s2">takes something from it has seen before</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.800" end="01:17:04.239" style="s2">but it&#39;s not able to re-establish the</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.560" end="01:17:06.719" style="s2">context in which it took it</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.239" end="01:17:07.600" style="s2">it took these insights right when i read</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.719" end="01:17:10.239" style="s2">a book</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.600" end="01:17:11.840" style="s2">i might in a later chapter recall an</p>

<p begin="01:17:11.840" end="01:17:14.960" style="s2">and create a context this is merging the</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.320" end="01:17:17.440" style="s2">current</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.960" end="01:17:18.320" style="s2">chapter with the previous chapter and</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.440" end="01:17:20.080" style="s2">then uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.320" end="01:17:22.560" style="s2">rewrite everything that i learned from</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.080" end="01:17:24.960" style="s2">the previous chapter in the new light</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.560" end="01:17:26.320" style="s2">because i i can reconstruct what i</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.960" end="01:17:27.920" style="s2">learned from the previous chapter and</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.320" end="01:17:28.320" style="s2">where i got this knowledge from and so</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.920" end="01:17:30.719" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.320" end="01:17:32.159" style="s2">right so for instance i i have an idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.719" end="01:17:33.120" style="s2">that i misunderstood or that there was</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.159" end="01:17:35.040" style="s2">too simplistic</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.120" end="01:17:37.040" style="s2">and i need to rewrite this idea and i</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.040" end="01:17:38.960" style="s2">asked myself where did i get this idea</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:40.480" style="s2">from why and how am i revising this</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.960" end="01:17:43.360" style="s2">right and now i create a</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.480" end="01:17:44.719" style="s2">new working memory context in which i</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.360" end="01:17:46.640" style="s2">direct my attention</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.719" end="01:17:47.920" style="s2">and this working memory construction is</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.640" end="01:17:50.719" style="s2">a thing that gptcv</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.920" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">cannot do yet so we need to extend</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.719" end="01:17:54.640" style="s2">attention in such a way that it&#39;s able</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:56.320" style="s2">to change working memory context</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.640" end="01:17:57.520" style="s2">actively and construct working memory</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.320" end="01:17:59.040" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.520" end="01:18:00.800" style="s2">and we need to change the level of</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.040" end="01:18:04.080" style="s2">representation from</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.800" end="01:18:04.400" style="s2">language to a multi-modal representation</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.080" end="01:18:06.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.400" end="01:18:08.320" style="s2">is agnostic to what it represents and</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.880" end="01:18:09.679" style="s2">addresses</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.320" end="01:18:11.600" style="s2">and you know you mentioned something in</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.679" end="01:18:13.440" style="s2">passing which i want to call up</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.600" end="01:18:15.840" style="s2">which is rewriting you know one of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.440" end="01:18:16.560" style="s2">things that we know humans do is our</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.840" end="01:18:18.320" style="s2">memories</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.560" end="01:18:20.320" style="s2">are not only low fidelity but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.320" end="01:18:22.960" style="s2">also quite subject to be</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.320" end="01:18:24.560" style="s2">rewritten right and certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.960" end="01:18:26.800" style="s2">linguistic processing may be</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.560" end="01:18:28.320" style="s2">implementable as rewrite rules</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.800" end="01:18:30.480" style="s2">and you know i think we both have had</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.320" end="01:18:32.000" style="s2">some exposure to the open cog system and</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.480" end="01:18:34.719" style="s2">the open cog system</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.000" end="01:18:37.120" style="s2">a lot of it&#39;s based on the concept of</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.719" end="01:18:39.840" style="s2">both local and global rewriting</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.120" end="01:18:42.159" style="s2">and that seems very far from gpt3 i mean</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.840" end="01:18:44.719" style="s2">it is what it is it doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.159" end="01:18:45.679" style="s2">essentially dynamic rewriting capability</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.719" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">going on in it</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.679" end="01:18:49.360" style="s2">exactly so this is the second thing that</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:51.920" style="s2">is wrong with gbt3 in my view</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.360" end="01:18:53.520" style="s2">the first thing was the working memory</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.920" end="01:18:56.480" style="s2">window which is limited to</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.520" end="01:18:58.159" style="s2">2048 adjacent tokens and basically there</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.480" end="01:19:00.239" style="s2">are hard constraints in there</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.159" end="01:19:01.760" style="s2">in which the working memory is used that</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.239" end="01:19:03.199" style="s2">don&#39;t exist in our own mind</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.760" end="01:19:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessarily that our working</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.199" end="01:19:06.080" style="s2">memory is larger i suspect it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.800" end="01:19:09.760" style="s2">smaller than the ones</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.080" end="01:19:11.520" style="s2">of gpt3 but we are able to construct the</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.760" end="01:19:12.880" style="s2">contents of our working memories with</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.520" end="01:19:14.159" style="s2">way more degrees of freedom</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.880" end="01:19:17.199" style="s2">so this is the first thing the second</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.159" end="01:19:19.120" style="s2">one is online learning gpt 3 is only</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.199" end="01:19:21.360" style="s2">doing offline learning which is good for</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.120" end="01:19:22.719" style="s2">an industry industrial production system</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.360" end="01:19:26.080" style="s2">that is meant to behave</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.719" end="01:19:27.600" style="s2">in pretty much the same way but if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.080" end="01:19:29.520" style="s2">want to build a system that is working</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.600" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">like us it needs to continuously learn</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.520" end="01:19:34.239" style="s2">gpt3 has stopped</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:36.000" style="s2">learning in october 2019 so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.239" end="01:19:37.760" style="s2">know about anything about covet 19</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.000" end="01:19:39.360" style="s2">or george floyd it lives in a different</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.760" end="01:19:40.960" style="s2">universe</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.360" end="01:19:43.040" style="s2">and we need to have an agent that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.960" end="01:19:46.000" style="s2">constantly learning and</p>

<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:21.679" style="s2">so by minimizing the surprisal on all</p>

<p begin="01:20:24.639" end="01:20:26.960" style="s2">you are probably learning something</p>

<p begin="01:20:26.960" end="01:20:30.639" style="s2">it was interesting enough for a human to</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:32.480" style="s2">write it down right so</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.639" end="01:20:34.560" style="s2">just by learning from this this is way</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.480" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">way better than random stuff</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.560" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">but this is not sufficient for a system</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:39.360" style="s2">that is interacting with the world and</p>

<p begin="01:20:50.159" end="01:20:53.520" style="s2">and for this you need to have a</p>

<p begin="01:20:53.520" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">and i think that in practice you</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.560" end="01:21:01.120" style="s2">will have way better results from</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:03.360" style="s2">systems that are able to assign</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:11.040" style="s2">in ways that no human being can do</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.760" end="01:21:11.840" style="s2">because it learns all this stuff which</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.040" end="01:21:13.520" style="s2">we find is</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.840" end="01:21:15.600" style="s2">irrelevant when you read the textbook</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.520" end="01:21:18.320" style="s2">you don&#39;t care about the style so much</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.600" end="01:21:19.760" style="s2">you care about the content and gpt suite</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.320" end="01:21:21.199" style="s2">does not think that the content is more</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.760" end="01:21:23.760" style="s2">important than the style</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.199" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">it only looks for style and goes for so</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.760" end="01:21:26.480" style="s2">deep style that</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:28.880" style="s2">ultimately it often bottoms out in</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.480" end="01:21:31.520" style="s2">content yeah say a little bit more</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.880" end="01:21:34.480" style="s2">about you know the affective part and</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.520" end="01:21:37.760" style="s2">how that might be added into gpt3</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.480" end="01:21:39.360" style="s2">are the effective part uh is uh in</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.760" end="01:21:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s basically something where the psi</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.360" end="01:21:42.639" style="s2">theory i think is still one of the best</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.120" end="01:21:46.000" style="s2">theories today</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.639" end="01:21:49.199" style="s2">the uh sci theory posits that</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.000" end="01:21:51.920" style="s2">you can describe an agent like us</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.199" end="01:21:52.639" style="s2">using homeostasis as a guiding principle</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.920" end="01:21:54.560" style="s2">so there is</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.639" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">a homeostatic balance that keeps the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.560" end="01:21:59.280" style="s2">system stable in the face</p>

<p begin="01:22:03.760" end="01:22:10.560" style="s2">and these control dimensions are given</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.280" end="01:22:11.440" style="s2">to us as needs that when frustrated</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.560" end="01:22:14.000" style="s2">produce</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.440" end="01:22:15.760" style="s2">pain signals and then satisfied produce</p>

<p begin="01:22:15.760" end="01:22:21.120" style="s2">and this when we act on these needs we</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:22.639" style="s2">act on purposes and models of our needs</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.120" end="01:22:25.120" style="s2">and we have strong</p>

<p begin="01:22:41.679" end="01:22:47.600" style="s2">and the more coherent it is</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.080" end="01:22:50.320" style="s2">the more our mind appears to be as</p>
