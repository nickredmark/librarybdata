<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:26.560" style="s2">which ain&#39;t saying much</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">yeah yeah um all right you got one</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.560" end="00:01:29.920" style="s2">no actually so i thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:31.920" style="s2">interesting because um</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.920" end="00:01:33.280" style="s2">you know we&#39;ve talked we we have been a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.920" end="00:01:35.680" style="s2">lot of places and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.280" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">neither of us is particularly adept at</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.680" end="00:01:40.560" style="s2">picking up other languages</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">yeah um but we&#39;ve we&#39;ve dabbled in many</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.560" end="00:01:44.799" style="s2">and we always try to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:45.439" style="s2">try to learn enough wherever we are to</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.799" end="00:01:48.960" style="s2">at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.439" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">um make it clear that we&#39;re trying um</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.960" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">and long ago when we were in madagascar</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:56.799" style="s2">um i had the thought that actually it</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">seems like</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.799" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">maybe every language out there does</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">something best like this or</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">or maybe no the it&#39;s not quite that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:07.840" style="s2">that for every concept there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">language that actually has it drilled</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.840" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">down on</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">most effectively and so in malagasy for</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:16.879" style="s2">instance they have this word sipa</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">which means um sort of you know romantic</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.879" end="00:02:19.440" style="s2">partner</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not yet married so</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.440" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">they you know they do have of course</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">marriage in madagascar but it also</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the sort of triviality of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">boyfriend or girlfriend it&#39;s also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">gender neutral</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:31.360" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t have the sort of clinical</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">thing of partner</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.360" end="00:02:34.080" style="s2">and you know really if you are</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">romantically involved in someone and not</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.080" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">married</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">you refer to your sipa and um it seems</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:40.160" style="s2">to do so much</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:41.280" style="s2">of a better job than any of the words</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.160" style="s2">that we have in english</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.280" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">um so that&#39;s that&#39;s not an answer but um</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.160" end="00:02:45.840" style="s2">i won</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:47.840" style="s2">i wondered if you hadn&#39;t answered this</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.840" end="00:02:49.920" style="s2">one i do but i first want to say about</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.840" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">cipa i also recall a discussion i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.920" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">trying to remember which malagasy person</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">this discussion was with</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">but um it turned out that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">reason in all likelihood that cipa does</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:05.040" style="s2">such a good job</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:08.319" style="s2">of being a non-trivial version of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.040" end="00:03:11.599" style="s2">a boyfriend or girlfriend is</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.319" end="00:03:14.080" style="s2">that the economic</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.599" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">obstacles to marriage are so substantial</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.080" end="00:03:17.440" style="s2">that many people</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.120" style="s2">are effectively married but haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.440" end="00:03:19.920" style="s2">gotten the resources to have the</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.120" end="00:03:22.239" style="s2">ceremony</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.920" end="00:03:23.519" style="s2">and therefore it&#39;s sort of this higher</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.239" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">um higher standing</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.519" end="00:03:26.959" style="s2">yeah in fact you have um you have people</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.959" end="00:03:31.360" style="s2">um children sometimes grown children who</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">themselves might be beginning to start</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.360" end="00:03:34.640" style="s2">families</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">and the parents may still be sipas</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.640" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">because they have not</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.080" style="s2">garnered the resources required</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:41.840" style="s2">basically to throw the big party</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.080" end="00:03:42.799" style="s2">including the sacrificing of the zebu</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.840" end="00:03:44.159" style="s2">and some of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.799" end="00:03:46.239" style="s2">some of the areas of madagascar that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.159" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">required in order to um</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.239" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">really effectively declare to your whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">family look we are we&#39;re taking this</p>

<p begin="00:03:55.920" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">being the malagasy</p>

<p begin="00:04:32.080" end="00:04:35.440" style="s2">was on patois and in fact the argument</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.560" end="00:04:39.040" style="s2">he made</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.440" end="00:04:41.600" style="s2">solved a long-standing paradox for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.040" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">which was about why patwa patois from</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.600" end="00:04:47.280" style="s2">various caribbean islands</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">are so similar and his point was</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.280" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not from those islands which i</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:52.080" style="s2">thought was absolutely fascinating and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:54.080" style="s2">where it was from</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.080" end="00:04:55.919" style="s2">uh is stunning so i would recommend</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.080" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">people go check out the lexicon they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.919" end="00:04:59.199" style="s2">not going to tell us</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.120" style="s2">well let&#39;s put it to you this way i</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.199" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t know that a slave castle</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.120" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">was a thing in africa but the slave</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">trade obviously had all of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:08.479" style="s2">elements</p>

<p begin="00:05:11.680" end="00:05:15.280" style="s2">um so yeah we always make the mistake of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">spending too much time on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.280" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">early questions but</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:21.120" style="s2">um this is not a favorite language but i</p>

<p begin="00:05:35.600" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">but when we would be walking on the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:41.600" style="s2">streets we would</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:42.880" style="s2">inevitably be asked what do you want</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.360" end="00:06:59.360" style="s2">um the nature of the puzzle is this</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.360" end="00:07:02.240" style="s2">tickling has many interesting features</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">um you can&#39;t tickle yourself right you</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.240" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:06.560" style="s2">um it&#39;s hard to tickle it&#39;s hard to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">tickled if you&#39;re in the water</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.560" end="00:07:10.080" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting um or if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">scared if you&#39;re scared</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.080" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">presumably on a battlefield we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:15.199" style="s2">tickling a thing people would be</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">sneaking up on their enemies and</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.199" end="00:07:19.199" style="s2">tickling others right exactly and they</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">would fall to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.199" end="00:07:22.720" style="s2">writhing in agony and then immediately</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">be stabbed or shot or something</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.720" end="00:07:26.400" style="s2">so um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:31.120" style="s2">i believe you are on the verge possibly</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:33.599" style="s2">of getting the giggles</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.120" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">no i just i don&#39;t think that we should</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.599" end="00:07:37.280" style="s2">put you in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:38.560" style="s2">military strategy of course you should</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.280" end="00:07:41.520" style="s2">because you know why because</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.560" end="00:07:43.360" style="s2">i know that tickling is not on the menu</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.520" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">of possibilities so unlike all of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.360" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">other military</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:47.919" style="s2">leaders you will not uh break out</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:50.720" style="s2">tickling as something to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.919" end="00:07:52.560" style="s2">to do on the battlefield many an empire</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.720" end="00:07:54.639" style="s2">has fallen because someone has thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.560" end="00:07:56.080" style="s2">that tickling their enemy was the key to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.639" end="00:07:58.240" style="s2">defeating them and discovered that it</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.080" end="00:08:00.960" style="s2">just didn&#39;t work in that context</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.240" end="00:08:01.440" style="s2">we&#39;re pointed sticks pointed sticks yes</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.960" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.440" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">um so i tell you what i&#39;m gonna promise</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:07.680" style="s2">to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:09.199" style="s2">what i this is a very what i think is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.680" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">a marvelous hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.199" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve had it for many years and</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.000" style="s2">everything i&#39;ve seen has</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.280" style="s2">increased my confidence that it will</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.000" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">turn out to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.280" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">true but i should deploy it in a proper</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">form rather than deeply buried in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:23.360" style="s2">q a here but do notice the pattern the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">pattern is enough to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.360" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">what might be going on in my opinion</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">do any other animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.000" end="00:08:34.080" style="s2">that says animals mammals do any other</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.080" end="00:08:36.880" style="s2">tend to find their identity in their</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.880" end="00:08:43.760" style="s2">species like humans with rice and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:45.040" style="s2">um mammals nothing came to me exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.760" end="00:08:48.480" style="s2">although there may well be</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.040" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">um different uh coat colors within um</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.480" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">within non-domesticated species but the</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">example that really sprang to mind</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:55.760" style="s2">was you you know what i know exactly you</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:59.120" style="s2">know exactly where i&#39;m going</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.839" style="s2">yes so let me just say whether that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">positive assertive mating meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.839" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">um what you are like with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">whatever character it is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">thinking about you tend to choose the</p>

<p begin="00:11:27.680" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">whatever character you&#39;re attending to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">you tend to choose the opposite thing in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">a mate</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">so yes they i i believe that kyle has</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">found kyle summers has found</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:39.680" style="s2">positive assertive mating with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">color morph in oophagia pemelio</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.440" style="s2">panama that was a lot of words that</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.680" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">probably are meaningless to most people</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">no but let&#39;s just put it to you this way</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">there are good reasons that this could</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:52.959" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">um for example color morph may be</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.959" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">but it can be an indicator of lineage</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:12:00.240" style="s2">and there are reasons that creatures</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">might prefer to mate at some distance</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.240" end="00:12:04.160" style="s2">from self</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">but within lineage so um that is an</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.160" end="00:12:07.920" style="s2">awkward fact but</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.760" style="s2">it uh nonetheless it&#39;s not hard to find</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.920" end="00:12:10.240" style="s2">logic by which that would evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.760" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.240" end="00:12:13.600" style="s2">favored and i would just say i in my</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">dissertation</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.600" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">i deployed an argument whereby this</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:21.200" style="s2">might even</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">work in plants right and the example i</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.200" end="00:12:26.560" style="s2">used was hydrangeas</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">and the thing is hydrangeas their</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.560" end="00:12:29.839" style="s2">color the color of the flowers is</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">dependent</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.839" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">on um soil ph</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">and my argument was that</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:40.639" style="s2">plants could use the eyes of insects to</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">choose a mate</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.639" end="00:12:43.920" style="s2">and they would do this if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.880" end="00:12:47.519" style="s2">let&#39;s say blue</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.920" end="00:12:49.519" style="s2">morph of hydrangea blue morph indicates</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.519" end="00:12:51.200" style="s2">what soil type it is growing in so a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.519" end="00:12:53.440" style="s2">plant that has successfully grown in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.200" end="00:12:55.519" style="s2">let&#39;s say acidic soils</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.440" end="00:12:56.880" style="s2">has gotten to the point of flowering and</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.519" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">is looking for a mate</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.880" end="00:13:01.279" style="s2">well its seeds are very likely to end up</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:03.040" style="s2">in acidic soils because if you had to</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.279" end="00:13:05.040" style="s2">guess what soil type the seeds would</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.040" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">land in from an adult if the adult is in</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.040" end="00:13:08.000" style="s2">acidic soils</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:09.839" style="s2">the offspring are liable to end up there</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.000" end="00:13:11.920" style="s2">so it wouldn&#39;t want a hydrangea that was</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.839" end="00:13:14.000" style="s2">well adapted to basic soils</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.920" end="00:13:15.600" style="s2">and so how do you figure this out if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.000" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">don&#39;t have eyes and you can&#39;t see your</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.600" end="00:13:17.680" style="s2">mate because it&#39;s a pollen grain you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">looking for</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.680" end="00:13:20.720" style="s2">well you might put up a blue flower to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:22.480" style="s2">whatever extent there&#39;s a bias in</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.720" end="00:13:24.079" style="s2">insects towards blue or a particular</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.480" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">insect toward blue</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.079" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">that insect would tend to go from a blue</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">hydrangea to a blue hydrangea rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">than from a red hydrangea to a blue</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:32.320" style="s2">hydrangea</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">and this could provide some bias whereby</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.320" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">a plant with no eyes could see</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.760" style="s2">a potential mate and choose one over</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:40.639" style="s2">another flowers</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.760" end="00:13:42.079" style="s2">uh pollinators doing the flowers bidding</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.639" end="00:13:42.800" style="s2">as they do in many regards but</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.079" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.800" end="00:13:46.800" style="s2">having their eyes borrowed yes very good</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:50.639" style="s2">plants borrowing the eyes of insects</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.800" end="00:13:51.440" style="s2">very nice if unity is unable to run a</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.639" end="00:13:53.199" style="s2">ticket this year</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">fantastic question um what i want to say</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.519" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:09.920" style="s2">is i think the most important thing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.519" end="00:14:12.720" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.920" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">is not to vote so as to put unity in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.720" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">best position</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">going forward the problem is that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:19.199" style="s2">could get into a situation</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:21.519" style="s2">where harming the nation you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.199" end="00:14:24.880" style="s2">accelerationist level thinking where</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.519" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">um the faster things get bad the greater</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.880" end="00:14:27.440" style="s2">the chances that we can switch to</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:28.480" style="s2">something better because people will be</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.440" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">motivated to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.480" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">and i think this is too dangerous so</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.880" style="s2">what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:37.440" style="s2">is you need to escape the duopoly&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.880" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">claim that you are obligated to do what</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.440" end="00:14:40.800" style="s2">it says</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:43.279" style="s2">right you you&#39;ve got tweedledum on one</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.800" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">side and tweel dumber on</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.279" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">they the want to tell you what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">obligated to do based on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">the cozy little um situation that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:52.610" style="s2">have erected</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">was that new yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.610" end="00:14:57.839" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.320" style="s2">but in any case i think what you want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.839" end="00:15:00.959" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.320" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">is vote your conscience vote what you</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.959" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">is best for the nation going forward and</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:07.279" style="s2">i don&#39;t think this is a simple thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:09.040" style="s2">in this case at all i think the duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.279" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">has set us up</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.040" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">for disaster either way and different</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">kinds of disaster</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:20.000" style="s2">yep and i will say i did write a piece</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">before it was clear that um</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.000" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">trump was going to win in 2016 i wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.279" style="s2">piece in anticipation that clinton would</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:26.480" style="s2">win because that&#39;s what i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.279" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.480" end="00:15:30.560" style="s2">and the point of my piece which has now</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:31.759" style="s2">been misunderstood by dave rubin who</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.560" end="00:15:33.920" style="s2">mentions it in his book</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.759" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">as if i said something i didn&#39;t but the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.920" end="00:15:37.120" style="s2">point of my piece was</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:39.519" style="s2">there was literally not a single thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.560" style="s2">you could do in the 2016 election</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.519" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t vote for either of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.560" end="00:15:45.920" style="s2">major party candidates you couldn&#39;t vote</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:48.320" style="s2">for a write-in as i did</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.920" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t not vote without harming</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.320" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">some constituency</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:53.279" style="s2">we were given nothing but bad choices</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">and you had to pick one which meant</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.279" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">that effectively at some level you owed</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">somebody an apology</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:01.440" style="s2">and that that i argued was the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:03.440" style="s2">that any system</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.440" end="00:16:05.199" style="s2">in which doesn&#39;t which doesn&#39;t give you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.440" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">a move in which you don&#39;t owe</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.199" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">somebody an apology for having made it</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">is a sick</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:13.839" style="s2">system and we need to fix that so um</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">in that light i would say do your best</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.839" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">vote your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.320" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to the goddamn duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">because it&#39;s what put us in this mess in</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.320" end="00:16:23.360" style="s2">the first place</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:26.320" style="s2">and uh yeah if we can&#39;t win this time</p>

<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.440" style="s2">short</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.640" end="00:17:30.480" style="s2">um snippets and you know that not all</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.440" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">questions can be</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.480" end="00:17:34.640" style="s2">shortened to very very short snippets no</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">i do know that i do know that but i also</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.640" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">that um that one can often</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">get way farther than you think sure i i</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">learned this in</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:48.559" style="s2">a spectacular form i once sent a</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:50.240" style="s2">letter to the editor to the new york</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.559" end="00:17:52.080" style="s2">times um</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.240" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">but they have very strict limits i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.080" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">it was a 500 word</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:56.400" style="s2">limit or something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">probably less than that maybe it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.400" end="00:18:00.080" style="s2">than that but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">i wrote my letter that&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.080" end="00:18:02.799" style="s2">almost as long as an op-ed it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">be more like 150 words</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.799" end="00:18:05.760" style="s2">yeah maybe 150 words but in any case i</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">wrote something and it was more than</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.760" end="00:18:10.000" style="s2">twice the length they would accept and i</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">set about trying to figure out how to</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.000" end="00:18:13.520" style="s2">get it down to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:14.640" style="s2">word limit and i did and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.520" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">i was shocked by</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.640" end="00:18:17.840" style="s2">was that it actually tightened it up</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">quite a bit there&#39;s a lot of extra</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.840" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">verbiage in there</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.840" style="s2">yeah well i i won&#39;t tell my horrifying</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.679" style="s2">editing story right now but um</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.840" end="00:18:27.280" style="s2">but yeah often you really can tighten</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.679" end="00:18:27.679" style="s2">things a lot and then there&#39;s a point at</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.280" end="00:18:29.280" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.679" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">you try to tighten it further and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.280" end="00:18:33.840" style="s2">decoheres and you lose all meaning</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:35.440" style="s2">now i believe that in this case much</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.840" end="00:18:38.400" style="s2">like with twitter</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.440" end="00:18:39.280" style="s2">this person could break their question</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.400" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">into a couple</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.280" end="00:18:43.919" style="s2">of different ones and they could file</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:44.799" style="s2">them together and we would see them come</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.919" end="00:18:47.520" style="s2">in together</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">yep um so anyway that&#39;s a possibility or</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.520" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">you can wait till the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.240" style="s2">better platform emerges that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:54.799" style="s2">okay so um</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.240" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">i&#39;ve told the people on discord uh that</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.799" end="00:18:58.559" style="s2">uh once a week</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.559" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">questions amongst themselves and vote on</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">what question they would really like to</p>

<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:10.000" style="s2">effects of casual sex culture and how</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.960" end="00:19:12.320" style="s2">sex is for bonding</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.000" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">in pairs in light of this how should</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.320" end="00:19:15.600" style="s2">people be dating and what place does sex</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.120" end="00:19:20.080" style="s2">what advice could you give to younger</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.480" end="00:19:22.160" style="s2">people as the age for marriage rises in</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.080" end="00:19:24.960" style="s2">the western world</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.160" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">well first thing to say is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.960" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">nothing to recommend casual sex you</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:31.039" style="s2">should dress up a bit</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:31.760" style="s2">and then dress down i guess that&#39;s sort</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.880" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">um is not particularly interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.240" style="s2">certainly not honorable</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:08.400" style="s2">and women aspiring to do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.240" end="00:21:09.039" style="s2">is neither interesting nor honorable</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.400" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">either</p>

<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">society and it&#39;s also just not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.679" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">you know it it&#39;s just the physical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">just the physical stuff and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">um in in engaging in</p>

<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">your body and your sexuality but um that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:35.280" style="s2">is different from saying you need to</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">save yourself for marriage</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.280" end="00:21:39.679" style="s2">or um that go into a bar because</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">you want to pick someone up because</p>

<p begin="00:21:50.880" end="00:21:54.400" style="s2">discussed</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">yeah and i mean i also just think</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.400" end="00:21:57.120" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:58.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t know why we&#39;re always playing</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.120" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">defense on this question</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.559" end="00:22:02.559" style="s2">the the ethos of the moment is so</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:06.000" style="s2">backwards</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.559" end="00:22:08.159" style="s2">that it is as if you know this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.000" end="00:22:10.480" style="s2">it&#39;s another case where the term that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.159" end="00:22:13.600" style="s2">been deployed sex positivity</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.480" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">is um a misnomer and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.600" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">the fact is sex positivity takes one</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:22.240" style="s2">view of sex and what its value is and</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">how to get there but i would just</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.240" end="00:22:29.360" style="s2">suggest just as a proof of concept</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">ask yourself this question when has</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.360" end="00:22:34.480" style="s2">sexual liberty</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">been greater i think the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.480" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">never at all sorts of levels the stigma</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">is gone</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">from pornography and masturbation</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">stuff is being</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.440" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">normalized sex work</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">how satisfied do people seem</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.840" end="00:23:00.240" style="s2">i think they seem really unsatisfied i</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">think they are sexually frustrated and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.240" end="00:23:03.280" style="s2">that the very thing that they thought</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:03.679" style="s2">was going to address it has done the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.280" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.679" end="00:23:07.360" style="s2">opposite it has taken the magic out of</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:10.640" style="s2">this landscape</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.360" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">and replaced it with um it&#39;s junk sex</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.640" end="00:23:14.320" style="s2">strength sex yeah now it&#39;s um and this i</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">mean this is a point that we make</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.320" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">in in our book that we were writing um</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">and it was a point that was really well</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">made with a lot of backup from</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">from data from various sorts actually in</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:26.240" style="s2">a 2019 or 18 i can&#39;t remember which</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.000" style="s2">atlantic article that was called i think</p>

<p begin="00:23:28.000" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">which you know adds to what you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">said that actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">um many young people are actually having</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:35.760" style="s2">a lot less sex</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.600" style="s2">right that there&#39;s you know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.760" end="00:23:38.720" style="s2">obviously a rise in casual sex and one</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.600" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">night stands and and</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.720" end="00:23:42.320" style="s2">all of this but that there&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">lot you know people</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">um people seem to be uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:50.880" style="s2">replacing what used to be real human</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:51.840" style="s2">you know amazing important tactile</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:55.760" style="s2">content</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.840" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">with you know screens and uh with a with</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.760" end="00:23:58.400" style="s2">sexting as if</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">you know as if there is any way for that</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.400" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">to do you know even</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:04.400" style="s2">a 20th the same thing in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.640" style="s2">connecting you to another human being</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.400" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">yeah and you know people are being</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.640" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">synchronized that this uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">the competition in the porn industry to</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.240" style="s2">get people&#39;s attention</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">has resulted in this move in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">direction of extreme stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">uh in many cases insane stuff</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">dangerous things that for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">women don&#39;t want to have anything to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.640" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:28.880" style="s2">epidemiologically ill-advised things</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.640" end="00:24:30.880" style="s2">so anyway it&#39;s obviously not working</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.880" end="00:24:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.880" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">compromised things that do work and i</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.840" end="00:24:41.039" style="s2">think i think the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">that uh the term casual sex itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.039" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">and the fact that you feel the need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">separate</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:49.520" style="s2">an objection to casual sex from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">suggestion that sex needs to wait for</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.520" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">marriage</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">what it is is divorcing sex from</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:58.559" style="s2">meaningful relationships is a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">right the configurations i mean as we</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.559" end="00:25:02.799" style="s2">pointed out with the point about uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.320" style="s2">malagasy sipas these are people who are</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.799" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">bonded and may produce</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.320" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">children but aren&#39;t married because</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:09.600" style="s2">marriage is difficult to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:12.080" style="s2">right so there&#39;s lots of room for stuff</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.600" end="00:25:15.760" style="s2">but i would say as i&#39;ve said about</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.080" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">hallucinogenic drugs the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.760" end="00:25:21.840" style="s2">it makes sense to seek</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:23.360" style="s2">satisfaction sexual satisfaction is</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.840" end="00:25:27.120" style="s2">awesome</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.360" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">but that is not the same thing as</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.120" end="00:25:33.200" style="s2">treating it casually right the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">it&#39;s very pleasurable does not mean in</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.200" end="00:25:36.880" style="s2">fact the route to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">it being pleasurable involves one taking</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.880" end="00:25:41.520" style="s2">it seriously right this is the whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:43.440" style="s2">message of tantric sex is that taking it</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.520" end="00:25:45.039" style="s2">very seriously is a way of elevating</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.440" end="00:25:48.480" style="s2">pleasure and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.039" end="00:25:49.039" style="s2">um the the junkification of everything a</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.480" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">friendship</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.039" end="00:25:53.760" style="s2">of sex of um the whole landscape is not</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">serving anybody</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.760" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">so in terms of advice um</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:02.400" style="s2">my advice would be figure out who also</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">aspires to something better</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.400" end="00:26:07.919" style="s2">and opt out of the um</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">the consensus together that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.919" end="00:26:12.240" style="s2">would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:13.600" style="s2">all right next question the next one</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:15.279" style="s2">refers to the fact that it is rosh</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.440" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">wired in instinct to protect women</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.279" end="00:27:06.400" style="s2">would this instinct have a negative</p>

<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:16.400" style="s2">um we tend to not use the word instinct</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:17.360" style="s2">for a variety of mostly not very</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.679" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">to me that is not the main reason to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.120" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">perhaps concerned about a mixed sex</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">combat unit it&#39;s more about</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.760" end="00:27:57.840" style="s2">yeah um but</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.440" end="00:27:59.039" style="s2">um but this this is a possibility too</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.840" end="00:28:02.159" style="s2">well i have</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.039" end="00:28:04.960" style="s2">hypothesized elsewhere that this is why</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.159" end="00:28:05.600" style="s2">ships are female like ships are called</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">females</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.600" end="00:28:09.679" style="s2">names given female names and my my</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:13.039" style="s2">argument is</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.679" end="00:28:14.840" style="s2">that the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.039" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">what would the term even be it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.840" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">anthropomorphizing</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.320" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">the femopomorphizing of ships</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:26.640" style="s2">femorifizing femorphizing uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">is a mechanism to trigger men&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.640" end="00:28:31.039" style="s2">built-in tendency to want to protect</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">women especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.039" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">women on whom they are dependent</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">and that basically ships that have</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:42.000" style="s2">a a female place in the mind tend to</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">survive better</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.000" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">than ships that don&#39;t that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:47.440" style="s2">argument that we would evolve</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:48.399" style="s2">to view them in this way because it does</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.440" end="00:28:50.159" style="s2">give them</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.399" end="00:28:52.320" style="s2">the kind of protection that results in</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.159" end="00:28:56.240" style="s2">the people on those ships making it to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.320" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">uh to shore yeah great prediction</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.240" end="00:29:00.799" style="s2">hard to test because i don&#39;t think ships</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:03.440" style="s2">are ever given male names at this point</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.799" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">um right yeah i don&#39;t know if i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.440" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">know if through history</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:08.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t we&#39;ll probably hear about it if</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">there are but</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.000" end="00:29:13.679" style="s2">um not being an expert of uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.440" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">of ship history i don&#39;t know when that</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.679" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">started and if we have any</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">records from before then where there</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:19.919" style="s2">were ships named with male names</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:22.080" style="s2">actually it does strike me that we do</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.919" end="00:29:24.159" style="s2">now give ships male names do we know</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.080" end="00:29:25.840" style="s2">oh i guess well like battleships like we</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.159" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">name them for for military leaders</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.840" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">mccain and nimitz oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:32.480" style="s2">okay so yeah a little hard to test</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">because the uh you know we&#39;re not losing</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.480" end="00:29:38.640" style="s2">as many ships as we once were but</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:40.159" style="s2">um i wrote a letter to senators about</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.640" end="00:29:42.399" style="s2">putting unity above partisanship</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.159" end="00:29:43.520" style="s2">in filling rbg&#39;s seat if you like it</p>

<p begin="00:29:50.960" end="00:29:56.240" style="s2">or if not um do you what do you think of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.919" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">crickets as a source of protein</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.240" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">well here&#39;s the thing crickets are among</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">the staunchest critics of humor i find</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">they are absolutely unforgiving when it</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:11.679" style="s2">comes to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:13.279" style="s2">atomic timing as for a source of protein</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.679" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">they are potentially good source of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.279" end="00:30:16.559" style="s2">protein but you got to get them down and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:20.159" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s the tough part</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.559" end="00:30:23.440" style="s2">um they&#39;re a little yeah no i mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.159" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">insects as a source of protein um</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.440" end="00:30:27.440" style="s2">yes we probably all should be and those</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:29.600" style="s2">of us who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.440" end="00:30:31.200" style="s2">been in places where there were for</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.600" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">instance you know fried grubs available</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.200" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">from street vendors and have tried them</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:38.080" style="s2">and who grew up with western dietary</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:41.120" style="s2">sensibilities are none too keen</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.080" end="00:30:42.000" style="s2">to incorporate those into our diets i at</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.120" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">least am not</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.000" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">so it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s an individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:50.000" style="s2">versus population level</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:52.480" style="s2">uh analysis where i i i prefer my rib</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">eye thank you very much except except</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.480" end="00:30:56.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:59.360" style="s2">i believe the market is now delivering</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.320" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">um this isn&#39;t going to be protein bars</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.360" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">that are filled with cricket powder i</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:06.240" style="s2">believe that&#39;s a thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:07.120" style="s2">i believe i did not make that up okay um</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.240" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">frankly</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.120" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">yeah we don&#39;t really eat protein bars</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:13.120" style="s2">right like so we we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">we tend towards whole foods that</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.120" end="00:31:16.640" style="s2">resemble as much as possible the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">organisms that they came from</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.640" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">or mixed in home in a culinary fashion</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">as much as possible and so the uh the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">packaged</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">processed foods aren&#39;t for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:30.559" style="s2">a part of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">of our diet um</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.559" end="00:31:34.480" style="s2">if they were i would i would definitely</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">advocate for giving</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:38.559" style="s2">that a try 100 you probably can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.559" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s often soy protein like and you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">from people who probably don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">sit around snacking on soybeans so much</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.159" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">and you know as insects go</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">crickets are not disgusting yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:51.760" style="s2">not deep fried crubs</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">yeah yeah like you find on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.760" end="00:31:56.559" style="s2">of coca and ecuador cockroaches</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:58.080" style="s2">cockroaches um chocolate ants are</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.559" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">probably easy but that&#39;s more chocolate</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.080" end="00:32:02.159" style="s2">than ant i expect i would imagine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.159" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">in his debate with dawkins brett made</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:07.440" style="s2">the analysis that pre-positioned society</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">is not an error but a feature which</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.440" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">assists in spreading society&#39;s genes</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:12.799" style="s2">will this also be the case for</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">homosexuality in modern times</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.799" end="00:32:17.279" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a leap in that question um</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:18.720" style="s2">i believe it is probably a warranted</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.279" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">leap but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.720" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">what i would say is</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">it is difficult to know what to make of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:32.399" style="s2">homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:34.799" style="s2">in modern times i think we are in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.399" end="00:32:36.080" style="s2">scenario that is so novel that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.799" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">likely to serve</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.080" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">the role that it may have served in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">past and i&#39;m not going to say</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:42.000" style="s2">more than that because again this is one</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">of these things that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.000" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">presented as a full argument not an</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">response to uh to a question but i do</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.919" end="00:32:50.720" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">um you are very much in the right</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.720" end="00:32:56.880" style="s2">neighborhood of</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:59.279" style="s2">very important discovery</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.880" end="00:33:00.720" style="s2">this is just a recommendation a request</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.279" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">after you finish your book i&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.720" end="00:33:04.159" style="s2">see you two make a nature documentary</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">about humans approaching us as any other</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.159" end="00:33:06.640" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">maybe intercut videos of parallel</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.640" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">behaviors from other animals and really</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">get into the weeds</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">yeah i was with you until until the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:17.679" style="s2">weeds part you don&#39;t like weeds</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:18.799" style="s2">um you know i the thing is their very</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.679" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">nature is weeds</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.799" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">makes them less exciting than some you</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">know don&#39;t you that weed is a social</p>

<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:27.919" style="s2">yes actually like it actually is i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.880" end="00:33:30.720" style="s2">saying that to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.919" end="00:33:31.600" style="s2">snarky and and mock wokism it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.720" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">a social concept</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.600" end="00:33:35.039" style="s2">there is no evolutionary thing that is</p>

<p begin="00:33:35.039" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">um it is a plant that is somewhere where</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.679" end="00:33:40.399" style="s2">the person talking about it has decided</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:44.640" style="s2">doesn&#39;t belong</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.399" end="00:33:46.720" style="s2">weeds are botanical noise</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.640" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s social it&#39;s it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.720" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">doesn&#39;t include now it&#39;s not enough no</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">no that&#39;s not it does because noise are</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">the patterns that you are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">not into noise are</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.120" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">apparently my brain is still full of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.679" end="00:34:02.320" style="s2">bit of smoke</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">no noise noise is the best sorry noise</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.320" end="00:34:08.800" style="s2">is the pattern that noise</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:11.119" style="s2">i know what i said let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.800" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">here&#39;s my argument that uh i used to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:16.560" style="s2">make to students about signal and noise</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">okay okay all you got is patterns right</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.560" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">everything is patterns the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in studying</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:24.240" style="s2">that signal the patterns that interface</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:25.599" style="s2">with your measurement but aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.240" end="00:34:27.040" style="s2">ones you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.599" end="00:34:28.800" style="s2">that&#39;s noise but you could study those</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.040" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">patterns too so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.800" end="00:34:32.879" style="s2">the designation of a particular pattern</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.159" style="s2">as noise is not inherent to the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.879" end="00:34:36.079" style="s2">it&#39;s inherent to your</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.159" end="00:34:37.520" style="s2">interest in knowing about that or your</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.079" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">need to exclude it in order to see the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.520" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">pattern you are interested in which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:42.320" style="s2">exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:44.399" style="s2">that you are arguing is going on with</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.320" end="00:34:45.839" style="s2">weeds and i agree it is</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.399" end="00:34:47.760" style="s2">right you&#39;re trying to cultivate these</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.839" end="00:34:49.520" style="s2">things relative to the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.760" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">either are trying to cultivate or prefer</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.520" end="00:34:53.760" style="s2">to look at</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">these other species are their noise they</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.760" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">the undesired botanical patterns</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.240" style="s2">i can&#39;t believe i haven&#39;t convinced you</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:02.800" style="s2">because i believe that was a very solid</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.240" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.800" end="00:35:05.839" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna go like 85 on this</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:08.079" style="s2">one not</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.839" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">nearly good enough okay all right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.079" end="00:35:11.440" style="s2">i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">set about convincing you yeah we&#39;ll work</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.440" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">on this maybe come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">our botanical noise</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.640" end="00:35:23.119" style="s2">what did you say zach 35 minutes we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">gonna spend a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.119" end="00:35:26.160" style="s2">minutes on this one before we switch to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">the next one</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.160" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">um you say that females</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">produce large gametes and males small</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">gametes and this is one of the clear</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:35.760" style="s2">differences between the sexes</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">how does giant sperm fit into this love</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.760" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">your podcast don&#39;t ever stop greetings</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.359" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">from denmark denmark cool</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.520" end="00:35:42.720" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know anything about giant</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:46.320" style="s2">sperm never heard that before</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.720" end="00:35:48.079" style="s2">but the large versus small is a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.320" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">a semantic shortcut so what the</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.079" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">distinction really is</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">is um lacking in cytoplasm and</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">able to move so tends to be small</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:35:58.640" style="s2">because it lacks in cytoplasm and able</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:02.240" style="s2">to move</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.640" end="00:36:05.440" style="s2">it&#39;s zippy or motile that&#39;s sperm and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.240" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">full of cytoplasm uh and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.440" end="00:36:09.200" style="s2">and sessile which is what eggs are so</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">giant sperm whatever</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.200" end="00:36:13.040" style="s2">whatever that is i don&#39;t know if that</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">brings a bell for you there may well be</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.040" end="00:36:16.000" style="s2">some gametes that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">are male gametes that are much bigger</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.000" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">than would be expected</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.359" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">um but if they still lack cytoplasm</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">um they are still most 100 fitting into</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">the male gamete model of</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:34.320" style="s2">no cytoplasm therefore no ability to</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">render themselves a zygote by selfing</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.320" end="00:36:37.920" style="s2">for instance</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:38.560" style="s2">um now that said are there errors you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.920" end="00:36:40.560" style="s2">know or</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.560" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">is it possible there&#39;s sperm that end up</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.560" end="00:36:44.800" style="s2">with cytoplasm in them that are errors</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:46.160" style="s2">sure it&#39;s a complex system uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.800" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">the history of of</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.160" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">of of sexual reproduction is it possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:52.640" style="s2">maybe but i&#39;ve never heard of them so i</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">just want to point out that this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.640" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">actually we have just landed</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:58.640" style="s2">in the same place as the discussion from</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:36:59.400" style="s2">if you&#39;ll think all the way back to live</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.640" end="00:37:03.119" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.400" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">45 our last live stream</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.119" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">um we had a discussion about squamates</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">snakes</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:13.599" style="s2">in which there was a reversal of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">the system from z w to x y am i correct</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.599" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">you remembering that yeah so i asked the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">question when we were talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.640" style="s2">what had switched did you have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">consistent line of male and female that</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.640" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">had switched its chromosomal</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:28.560" style="s2">uh mechanism and i said probably not</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">because it almost certainly</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.560" end="00:37:33.040" style="s2">um evolved separately from a</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:35.040" style="s2">environmental sex determination</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.040" end="00:37:36.960" style="s2">system rather than moving from one</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.040" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">chromosomal sex determination to another</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.960" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">so the question is if it had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">reversal in other words if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">not like you&#39;re describing where you had</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:51.040" style="s2">chromosomal sex determination</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:52.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s flipped from cw to xy that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.040" end="00:37:54.720" style="s2">to say whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.320" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">males or females are the heterogametic</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.720" end="00:37:58.079" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">then you would have had to have a shift</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.079" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:02.880" style="s2">um what style of gamete was produced</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:04.000" style="s2">because as you have been pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.880" end="00:38:04.480" style="s2">for months and months and months and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.000" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.480" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">on these podcasts um the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">motility of gametes is the consistent</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:13.839" style="s2">diagnostic</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">character motility and presence or</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.839" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">absence of cytoplasm</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:18.079" style="s2">those are the two things um those are</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">the two characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.079" end="00:38:22.000" style="s2">so i don&#39;t like presence or absence of</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">cytoplasm because it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.000" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">continuum</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:30.000" style="s2">um but so i don&#39;t disagree that we see</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">a discrete difference in well and eggs</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.000" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">can move a little bit i mean</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">neither of these are perfect binaries</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">modal motile versus not</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:38.079" style="s2">cytoplasm versus not they&#39;re not perfect</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">binaries whereas</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.079" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">male versus female pretty much is right</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">but i guess my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">the um you can do</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:50.240" style="s2">a relative calculation of size and</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:53.520" style="s2">motility</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.240" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">inside of any species</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.520" end="00:38:56.960" style="s2">and a reversal might well involve</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.960" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">like sperm that are suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:04.160" style="s2">large you can imagine a small error in</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:05.040" style="s2">the developmental process of sperm that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.160" end="00:39:08.240" style="s2">caused that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.040" end="00:39:09.920" style="s2">and allowed a flip i&#39;m willing to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.240" end="00:39:12.880" style="s2">that that would be possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.920" end="00:39:13.200" style="s2">if it were possible that you would have</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.880" end="00:39:15.680" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.200" end="00:39:16.720" style="s2">switch in the type of chromosomal sex</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.680" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">determination system</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.720" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that that thing has ever</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">happened i don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="00:39:29.440" end="00:39:32.079" style="s2">that we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">that is to say um you know even so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.079" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">example from last livestream was</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:39.119" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this parthenogenetic python</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">and it turns out that in boeins</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.119" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">which includes both the boas and pythons</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.960" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">there&#39;s two apparently different</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.640" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">evolutions of the um</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:49.280" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be they have the xy system</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.520" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember which it is yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.520" end="00:39:54.880" style="s2">i can&#39;t remember which which most snakes</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">have um</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.880" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">maybe yeah i think most snakes have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:01.520" style="s2">zy system zw system</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">and boads um two different times have</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.520" end="00:40:06.400" style="s2">evolved in xy system</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:07.920" style="s2">and it is not imagined uh that one of</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.400" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">those systems evolved from the other but</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.920" end="00:40:10.960" style="s2">rather that all three of them evolve</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">from the basal state</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">of having environmental sex</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">determination so i</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:18.160" style="s2">agree with you on the likelihood of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">these things evolving i don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.160" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">you would imagine that you never get a</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">reversal</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:26.880" style="s2">i mean for one thing these in plants</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:27.280" style="s2">chromosomal reorganizations are common</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.880" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.280" end="00:40:33.599" style="s2">triploides and plants are weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">no they&#39;re not well the whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.599" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">non-segregated germline thing makes them</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">makes it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">a different kind of analysis they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">different but um</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:42.560" style="s2">you know none of it&#39;s weird you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:44.240" style="s2">plants it&#39;s all weird</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.560" end="00:40:45.920" style="s2">okay it&#39;s then it&#39;s all weird but my</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.240" end="00:40:47.040" style="s2">point would be major chromosomal</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.920" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">reorganizations</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.040" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">are commonplace in plants for reasons we</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">get um</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:54.640" style="s2">in animals they&#39;re tougher but we see</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:56.880" style="s2">evidence of lots of reorganizations and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.640" end="00:41:00.400" style="s2">we don&#39;t know how they happened</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.880" end="00:41:02.480" style="s2">um so my point is you&#39;ve got some big</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.400" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">hidden landscape of chromosomal major</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.480" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">chromosomal changes that were not</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:06.640" style="s2">catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.000" style="s2">it might end up i mean we&#39;re really in</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:09.920" style="s2">the weeds for most people here but it</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.000" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">might i wonder if it might not accompany</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.920" end="00:41:14.720" style="s2">uh changes in ploidy</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:15.359" style="s2">uh so you know we&#39;re so we are diploid</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.720" end="00:41:18.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.359" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">uh 20 humans have 23 chromosomes each of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.319" end="00:41:23.359" style="s2">each egg or sperm is just 23</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:24.079" style="s2">but every other cell of your body has 46</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.359" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.079" end="00:41:27.599" style="s2">23 is the haploid number 46 is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:30.400" style="s2">diploid number</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.599" end="00:41:31.280" style="s2">uh i believe that chimps they&#39;re one off</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.400" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">22</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.280" end="00:41:35.200" style="s2">and 44 i think i don&#39;t think it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:36.079" style="s2">other direction but they&#39;re one off of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.200" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.079" end="00:41:42.319" style="s2">um whereas uh frogs for instance</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:44.160" style="s2">um have just an incredible rate of</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.319" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">polyploidy of just like</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.160" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">doublings triplings octuplings of their</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:50.319" style="s2">ploidy numbers</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:51.599" style="s2">and this has all sorts of cascading</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.319" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">effects most of which i think we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.599" end="00:41:55.440" style="s2">yet know and i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">somewhere in these sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.440" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">ploidy doublings and triplings there</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">might be the opportunity for some kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.280" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">of funky</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">switch toggle of genetic sex</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">determination that&#39;s exactly what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">getting at and you might even do an</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:10.400" style="s2">explorer mode thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:14.000" style="s2">where the ability to flip is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.400" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">uh retained in a latent form and</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.000" end="00:42:20.880" style="s2">a ploidy shift allows it to become</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:22.319" style="s2">manifest um this does remind me</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.880" end="00:42:23.520" style="s2">there were a couple of corrections i</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.319" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">wanted to make and i should have done</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.520" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">them on the main livestream oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.920" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">um one a former student of mine desi</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">rose</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.760" style="s2">contacted me and said that there had</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.359" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">been parthen</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.760" end="00:42:39.200" style="s2">parthenogenesis in turkey as she thought</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:41.760" style="s2">and i looked into this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.200" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">and it turns out so you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.760" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">looked at this separately what i</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:47.839" style="s2">got to was that we see evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">embryos that are produced this way but</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.839" end="00:42:50.720" style="s2">nothing</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go viable yeah chickens and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.720" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">is and i didn&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.520" style="s2">i wanted to talk about it too on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">main live stream and then you know ruth</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.520" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">bader ginsburg up and died and it sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">of threw everything into into chaos but</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.359" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">the little bit that i looked into uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:05.359" style="s2">suggests that yes some domesticated foul</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:06.960" style="s2">and there may be some example from a</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.359" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">pigeon as well which obviously isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.960" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">usually domesticated although</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:15.599" style="s2">sometimes are there effect yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:16.560" style="s2">right so um it seems that the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.599" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">produce eggs</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.560" end="00:43:21.040" style="s2">absent in emails um has been noted in in</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.680" style="s2">many cases</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.040" end="00:43:24.720" style="s2">in chickens and turkeys um but that may</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.680" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">be never</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.720" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">or if ever extraordinarily rarely do</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:31.920" style="s2">those eggs end up becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">being viable enough to hatch so there is</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.920" end="00:43:34.720" style="s2">embryo but</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">that parthenogenetic embryo therein</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.720" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be viable</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:41.680" style="s2">right my prediction would be um well</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">a it&#39;s conspicuous that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.680" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">domesticated and human-associated</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:48.160" style="s2">birds that show this pattern but b i</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:50.319" style="s2">would suggest that that means</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.160" end="00:43:51.280" style="s2">that if we look long and hard enough in</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.319" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">nature and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.280" end="00:43:54.319" style="s2">zoo animals eventually we&#39;re gonna find</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:57.440" style="s2">this we&#39;re gonna see it</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.319" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">um okay that&#39;s one correction second</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.440" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">correction</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">which is i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m groping for some</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:04.079" style="s2">mechanism to connect it to this but i</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:06.560" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.079" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">nothing oh it&#39;s not gonna be wolverines</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.560" end="00:44:09.359" style="s2">oh no it&#39;s not wolverine okay can i go</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:12.640" style="s2">wolverines then</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.359" end="00:44:14.160" style="s2">you got you please okay um so i we had</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.640" end="00:44:16.000" style="s2">i had said i thought wolverines were</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.160" end="00:44:17.359" style="s2">hibernating i don&#39;t know what do they do</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.000" end="00:44:19.599" style="s2">do something so</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.359" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">i think i think they don&#39;t i have not</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.599" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">looked into it fully fully but what they</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">what they do do which is sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:28.160" style="s2">vision that i had in my head</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">um is that they build these ice dens</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.160" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">these snow dens</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:33.760" style="s2">and that they do store sperm they do so</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">they mate earlier and they store sperm</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.760" end="00:44:37.119" style="s2">and then implants in particular the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:38.480" style="s2">zygote becomes fertilized implants at a</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.119" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">particular point</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.480" end="00:44:41.200" style="s2">or actually i&#39;m not sure if they just if</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:42.800" style="s2">they store sperm or they delay</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.200" end="00:44:44.480" style="s2">implantation or both i&#39;m not sure which</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.800" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">it is but they control the timing of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.480" end="00:44:46.880" style="s2">reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">regardless of exactly when they&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.880" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">it back in the summer</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">and then they give birth in these snow</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">dens in the winter and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:54.560" style="s2">the mothers don&#39;t hibernate they</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:57.200" style="s2">continue to go out</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">um but their babies um persist in these</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.200" end="00:45:01.119" style="s2">in these snow dens</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:01.920" style="s2">um and are born at the right moment such</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.119" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.920" end="00:45:05.280" style="s2">at the point wherever they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">latitudinally when they can come out and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.280" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">begin to make a life for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:09.440" style="s2">presumably while being taught by their</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">mothers they can do so so</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.440" end="00:45:12.560" style="s2">they do not i i had said i thought they</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:14.560" style="s2">hibernated</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.560" end="00:45:15.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t think they do no instead it is</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.560" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">these</p>

<p begin="00:46:28.720" end="00:46:33.040" style="s2">uh was very generous and reached across</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.000" end="00:46:36.240" style="s2">the aisle okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.040" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">okay so um oh boy</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.240" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">how long how far are we in zach</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.640" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">okay so we got a switch but i did want</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.240" end="00:46:45.760" style="s2">to just um</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.000" end="00:46:47.520" style="s2">we will pick up a few more of these next</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.760" end="00:46:50.319" style="s2">time for sure</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.520" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">um i did want to read this one this was</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.319" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">just fun imagine it takes 60 minutes for</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">a virus that doubles every minute to</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">fill a jar</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:46:58.079" style="s2">what percentage of the jar will be full</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:59.520" style="s2">at five minutes to the hour</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.079" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">if you were an average virus when do you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.520" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">realize you&#39;re running out of space</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">and then it says credit al bartlett and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">it and i didn&#39;t realize when i first</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">read this that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:09.200" style="s2">number it then gives is the answer but i</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:12.160" style="s2">wanted</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.200" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">um just to just to quickly do like the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.160" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">back of the envelope</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:16.000" style="s2">logic that allows you to quickly get</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">there because this is the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.000" end="00:47:18.480" style="s2">question that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">um i see i&#39;m like oh good let&#39;s figure</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">it out and i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:23.520" style="s2">because of their atrocious math</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">education are like i have no idea how i</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.520" end="00:47:27.520" style="s2">would even begin to get there</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:29.040" style="s2">so the question again is imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.520" end="00:47:31.280" style="s2">takes 60 minutes for a virus that</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.040" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">doubles every minute to fill a jar</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.280" end="00:47:34.720" style="s2">what percentage of the jar will be full</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:37.040" style="s2">at five minutes to the hour</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.720" end="00:47:38.559" style="s2">so i think this question needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.040" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">rephrased as</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.559" end="00:47:44.880" style="s2">cells or something virus doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to do this with virus so</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.880" end="00:47:48.720" style="s2">as a total abstraction yeah but i can i</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">can read it as cells or</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.720" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">you know bacteria bacteria is easier</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:54.720" style="s2">yeah bacteria</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:56.319" style="s2">we know the model from bacteria and um</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.720" end="00:47:59.760" style="s2">and exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.319" end="00:48:00.960" style="s2">um so uh i would you know for me i would</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.760" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">just cluj this there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.960" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">clearly an elegant mathematical way to</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:05.200" style="s2">answer the question but i would include</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:07.200" style="s2">you because you only have to go five</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.200" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">minutes back so at the hour it&#39;s 60</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.200" end="00:48:09.920" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.280" style="s2">at zero minutes back you&#39;re at 100 it</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.920" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">doubles every minute</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.280" end="00:48:15.280" style="s2">um go back one minute you&#39;re at 50 go</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:16.880" style="s2">back two minutes you&#39;re at 25 percent</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.280" end="00:48:18.720" style="s2">go back three minutes you&#39;re at 12 and a</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.880" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">half percent go back four minutes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.720" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">six and a quarter percent and go back</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:24.960" style="s2">five minutes and you&#39;re at three and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">eight percent so you&#39;re about three five</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.960" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">minutes to the hour</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.839" style="s2">uh that jar is going to be full at the</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.200" style="s2">hour but five minutes beforehand you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.839" end="00:48:34.880" style="s2">still only three percent full</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.200" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">yep the lesson here being um</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.880" end="00:48:38.960" style="s2">one should spend a good deal of time</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:41.119" style="s2">thinking about exponential growth</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.960" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">before you decide how comfortable to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.119" end="00:48:45.200" style="s2">about any process that has that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:48.960" style="s2">exponential aspect to it bingo</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.200" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">yep that&#39;s exactly right all right</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.960" end="00:48:55.359" style="s2">um okay next</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:57.280" style="s2">first question in the new hour is from</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.960" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">get their act together as the federal</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.319" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">government was going to come get them</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">and obviously this is all a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.359" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">of a caricature and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">reading from anything but um uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:13.520" style="s2">effective pushback tactic or hilarious</p>

<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">and it it&#39;s one of these things where it</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">gets done and you think</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:25.040" style="s2">oh yeah how is it that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.839" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">places are claiming</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.040" end="00:51:31.280" style="s2">that they are in severe</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:33.760" style="s2">um violation of the law</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:35.680" style="s2">and uh and the law isn&#39;t doing anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.760" end="00:51:36.000" style="s2">about it well because everyone knows</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.680" end="00:51:37.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.000" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">they&#39;re lying that they&#39;re not in severe</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.599" end="00:51:40.000" style="s2">violation of the law but if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:41.920" style="s2">going to continue to claim this</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.000" end="00:51:43.280" style="s2">they don&#39;t get to have it both ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.920" end="00:51:44.960" style="s2">either you admit that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.280" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually engaging in systemic</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.960" end="00:51:48.000" style="s2">racism at the level that these</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.000" style="s2">loons that you&#39;re letting run the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.000" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">institution are are</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.000" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">telling you you are or you accept that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">um the effects of your actions of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:51:59.599" style="s2">claims are that well then there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:02.000" style="s2">to be an investigation</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.599" end="00:52:02.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s actually perfect it reminds me a</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.000" end="00:52:04.400" style="s2">little bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.640" end="00:52:06.240" style="s2">of uh something that happened during the</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.400" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">the evergreen meltdown</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.240" end="00:52:12.319" style="s2">where you know the the rioters were</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">accusing people very prominently they</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.319" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">were accusing the president of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:18.240" style="s2">college of being</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.720" end="00:52:19.839" style="s2">uh full of racism and by gesticulating</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.240" end="00:52:21.520" style="s2">with his hands engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.839" end="00:52:22.880" style="s2">microaggressions against people of color</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.520" end="00:52:25.200" style="s2">or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.880" end="00:52:26.319" style="s2">and at some point the president</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.200" end="00:52:28.960" style="s2">experimented</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.319" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">with getting ahead of this and saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.960" end="00:52:32.720" style="s2">that he was</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">taking steps to deal with his own racism</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.720" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">and instead of embracing this they were</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:37.280" style="s2">like aha</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">we told you he was a racist and here</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.280" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">he&#39;s admitted it</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:43.599" style="s2">yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:45.280" style="s2">why why think you can beat these people</p>

<p begin="00:52:45.280" end="00:52:48.720" style="s2">that their game is dumb</p>

<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">pathogenicity uh in other in in</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.640" end="00:54:28.640" style="s2">other social spaces but females are</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">evaluating</p>

<p begin="00:54:32.079" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">in species where um basically the males</p>

<p begin="00:54:47.680" end="00:54:52.880" style="s2">i should say i think that hypothesis has</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">some merit to it but it is not the</p>

<p begin="00:56:10.079" end="00:56:14.799" style="s2">interesting observation and i</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.160" end="00:56:16.720" style="s2">just i haven&#39;t seen it myself i haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.799" end="00:56:19.839" style="s2">i haven&#39;t noticed this</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.720" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">um in fact yeah i would predict it the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.839" end="00:56:22.319" style="s2">other way</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">actually so i&#39;m i&#39;m very curious about</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.319" end="00:56:26.480" style="s2">what the actual pattern is i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">explain something that may or may not be</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.480" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">a pattern right</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:30.640" style="s2">um and i would also want to know if it</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:32.160" style="s2">was local to</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.640" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">some group of immigrants or if it was</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.160" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">general uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:41.200" style="s2">but surely that data exists somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.200" end="00:56:46.000" style="s2">is that all yeah okay uh heather</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">you said what we can&#39;t do is have</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.000" end="00:56:48.880" style="s2">discretion held within particular</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:50.240" style="s2">demographics</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.880" end="00:56:51.760" style="s2">surely you see the issue with giving</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.240" end="00:56:53.280" style="s2">children full autonomy can you be</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.760" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">certain they should not extend any other</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.280" end="00:56:55.920" style="s2">demographic</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.839" end="00:57:00.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.319" end="00:57:01.440" style="s2">obviously children is is different and</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.960" end="00:57:03.040" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.440" end="00:57:06.160" style="s2">some people now are arguing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.040" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">not and that&#39;s not correct</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.160" end="00:57:09.920" style="s2">well anybody who is not in a position to</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.920" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">good decisions right but then you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">so then you know discretion</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:19.920" style="s2">um that all of these have slippery</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.400" end="00:57:22.640" style="s2">slopes somewhere along the way</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.920" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">right so he&#39;s not in a position to make</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.640" end="00:57:26.960" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">good decisions um what about people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.960" end="00:57:31.440" style="s2">were deemed</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:33.520" style="s2">uh not smart enough to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.440" end="00:57:34.960" style="s2">have children and therefore had their</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:37.200" style="s2">reproductive uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.960" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">rights taken away from them when they</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.200" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">were not able to make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:43.839" style="s2">on their own uh you know there is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">there is a long history of</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.839" end="00:57:48.799" style="s2">a racial bias in that uh in the early</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:50.400" style="s2">part of the 20th century and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.799" end="00:57:53.599" style="s2">19th century in the u.s</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.400" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">and and even i think among just</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.599" end="00:57:57.760" style="s2">lower-class</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:59.359" style="s2">uh white people in the u.s so well but</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.760" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure why we end up inheriting</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.359" end="00:58:02.720" style="s2">responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">um i&#39;m just saying that policy of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.720" end="00:58:06.720" style="s2">past you know is there room for policy</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.720" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">does society have a right to exert</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">discretion over the reproduction of</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">people who do not have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:19.680" style="s2">take care of offspring</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:22.960" style="s2">because they are mentally compromised</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.680" end="00:58:25.680" style="s2">right i i believe it is</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.960" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">i would argue obvious that society has</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.680" end="00:58:28.000" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">right to navigate that question i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.000" end="00:58:31.599" style="s2">want responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:33.359" style="s2">you know navigating on the fly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.599" end="00:58:35.280" style="s2">where the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.359" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">you know the line needs to be drawn i</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.280" end="00:58:39.440" style="s2">have no idea right</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">yeah but i don&#39;t want to grant that</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.440" end="00:58:43.920" style="s2">because there have been abuses of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:45.839" style="s2">discretion in the past that discretion</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.920" end="00:58:49.200" style="s2">is suspect because it&#39;s clearly not</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.839" end="00:58:50.480" style="s2">yeah now i&#39;m actually i&#39;m um</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.200" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking about you know i won&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.480" end="00:58:53.760" style="s2">won&#39;t give anything away for privacy</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:54.799" style="s2">reasons but i&#39;m thinking about a woman</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.760" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">we once knew</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.799" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">who&#39;s um whose firstborn daughter</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">uh was developmentally compromised quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">a bit and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">uh upon becoming of age upon becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">young woman</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:09.760" style="s2">um was also quite an attractive young</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:11.760" style="s2">woman but really did not have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.760" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">ability to understand</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.760" end="00:59:15.280" style="s2">the new sexual attention she was getting</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:18.240" style="s2">um nor</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.280" end="00:59:19.440" style="s2">the her mother the woman we knew felt</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.240" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">would she have been</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.440" end="00:59:24.160" style="s2">in any way capable of of taking care of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:28.640" style="s2">a child herself</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.160" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">and she the mom the woman we knew</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.640" end="00:59:33.599" style="s2">made the difficult decision but she felt</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.839" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">a hundred percent absolutely the right</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.599" end="00:59:38.480" style="s2">decision</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:40.799" style="s2">um to uh provide for her daughter</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.480" end="00:59:42.480" style="s2">uh an endogenous form of birth control i</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.799" end="00:59:43.680" style="s2">don&#39;t remember what it was but something</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.480" end="00:59:45.440" style="s2">wherein</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.680" end="00:59:47.280" style="s2">she would not get pregnant no matter no</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.440" end="00:59:49.680" style="s2">matter what um</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.280" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">and as far you know we have we&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.680" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">touch with her over the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">years but um</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">you know there was no there was no sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">that she was worried about</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="01:00:00.640" style="s2">um about her daughter having</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">having sex forced on her although</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.640" end="01:00:05.280" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s a risk always but</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:06.400" style="s2">it was that she was finding in her new</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:08.559" style="s2">sexuality</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.400" end="01:00:09.599" style="s2">um this sort of freedom that she had had</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.559" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">not felt before because she was</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.599" end="01:00:12.799" style="s2">constrained by her very developmental</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:16.079" style="s2">deficits</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.799" end="01:00:17.520" style="s2">and um would not have been capable of</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.079" end="01:00:20.079" style="s2">making decisions</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.520" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">that would preclude pregnancy so that</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.079" end="01:00:23.599" style="s2">was a within family decision that was</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:24.960" style="s2">still wrenching because the daughter had</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.599" end="01:00:26.559" style="s2">no way of even understanding what was</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.960" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">happening to her</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.559" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">but it seemed absolutely important but</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">you know i feel completely comfortable</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:32.720" style="s2">with a mother</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">doing that as opposed to the state</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.720" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">coming in and saying</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.839" end="01:00:37.119" style="s2">uh we&#39;re going to do this to all</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:40.160" style="s2">children with an iq of less than</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:40.559" style="s2">you know 70 or so i agree the right the</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.160" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.559" end="01:00:43.920" style="s2">or the best place for this to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">resident is somebody who has the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.920" end="01:00:48.559" style="s2">person&#39;s interests</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">at heart by virtue of being family yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.559" end="01:00:52.799" style="s2">that said there&#39;s obviously a landscape</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">here that requires</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.799" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">uh nuance and discretion and</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m sure that will get pushed back</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:05.200" style="s2">um what is your hypothesis on new</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.200" end="01:01:10.559" style="s2">such as smartphone and their profusion</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:13.520" style="s2">of information on brain development</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.559" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">oh we&#39;ve got a lot of thoughts on this</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.520" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">yeah i mean it&#39;s obviously destructive</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t mean every aspect of it is</p>

<p begin="01:01:58.319" end="01:02:01.760" style="s2">this is written very sparsely but i</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:03.599" style="s2">think i know what the question</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.760" end="01:02:05.520" style="s2">what it actually says is rogan retracts</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.599" end="01:02:08.880" style="s2">wildflower wildflower</p>

<p begin="01:02:08.880" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">thoughts question mark um so uh he had</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.280" end="01:02:17.119" style="s2">you probably know more about this story</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:20.319" style="s2">than i do yeah he uh in his</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.119" end="01:02:21.760" style="s2">podcast with douglas murray he had said</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.319" end="01:02:25.760" style="s2">that there had been arrests</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.760" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">of uh protesters who had set fires</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.760" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">now there you know i believe that what</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.599" end="01:02:34.880" style="s2">actually happened is ambiguous there</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:37.200" style="s2">is at least one instance of a fire that</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.880" end="01:02:40.400" style="s2">was quickly put out by</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.200" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">civilians i think that was started by</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.400" end="01:02:44.880" style="s2">fireworks in the context of</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:47.200" style="s2">or at least plausibly linked to</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.880" end="01:02:48.559" style="s2">protesters but let&#39;s just say that the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.200" end="01:02:50.799" style="s2">you know what we were complaining about</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.559" end="01:02:54.400" style="s2">on our last live stream was</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.799" end="01:02:56.559" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have a trustworthy</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.400" end="01:02:57.839" style="s2">mechanism for determining whether or not</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.559" end="01:02:58.400" style="s2">you know certainly the pattern that you</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.839" end="01:02:59.920" style="s2">revealed</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.400" end="01:03:01.440" style="s2">the smoke being right up and down the</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.920" end="01:03:03.920" style="s2">five suggests some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.440" end="01:03:05.280" style="s2">anthropogenic process let me just say</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.920" end="01:03:08.960" style="s2">incidentally with regard to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.280" end="01:03:11.039" style="s2">um two things</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.960" end="01:03:12.559" style="s2">that&#39;s upon looking at that again so</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.039" end="01:03:14.480" style="s2">this again is something we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.559" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">in episode 45 and i showed these fires</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.480" end="01:03:17.200" style="s2">all starting on september 8th just in</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:19.520" style="s2">this line this</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.200" end="01:03:20.640" style="s2">this north-south line in oregon and up</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.520" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">into washington</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.640" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">um i think that was farther east than</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.240" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">the five um but the fact that it was a</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:27.039" style="s2">line</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:28.160" style="s2">looks makes it look anthropogenic very</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.039" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">much so</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.160" end="01:03:32.079" style="s2">that said and actually i got a question</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:34.720" style="s2">i think over the email that caused me to</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.079" end="01:03:35.680" style="s2">to remind me that oh of course one of</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.720" end="01:03:39.039" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.680" end="01:03:41.599" style="s2">um anthropogenic but not um you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.039" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">intentionally nasty sources of fire is</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.599" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">power lines</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:46.240" style="s2">and in fact in some places where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">winds were picking up preemptively the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.240" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">power grids got shut down so there</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:52.720" style="s2">fire started um so um that might that</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:54.480" style="s2">that might have been along</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.720" end="01:03:56.160" style="s2">another road i think i think it was not</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.480" end="01:03:57.680" style="s2">actually the five um but it might have</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.160" end="01:03:59.119" style="s2">been along another road which probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.680" end="01:04:00.720" style="s2">would make more sense anyway because the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.119" end="01:04:02.160" style="s2">five&#39;s by far the you know the the</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.720" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">biggest interstate um</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.160" end="01:04:05.359" style="s2">the busiest one um but it might also</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.359" end="01:04:11.119" style="s2">um you know that that high wind event</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:12.000" style="s2">and a bunch of power lines um banging</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.119" end="01:04:13.920" style="s2">together doing whatever</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.000" end="01:04:15.920" style="s2">it is that they do in wind that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:18.880" style="s2">causes sparks and causes fires</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.920" end="01:04:20.799" style="s2">sure there&#39;s also uh elevational stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.880" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">so to the extent that you have a line</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.799" end="01:04:23.839" style="s2">uh every so often if you fly into the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.599" style="s2">pacific northwest you notice that you</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.839" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">have volcanoes</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.599" end="01:04:29.200" style="s2">sticking up in a line yeah in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">cascades and</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.200" end="01:04:34.000" style="s2">that obviously impacts weather and you</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:36.799" style="s2">could have a phenomenon where lightning</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.000" end="01:04:38.079" style="s2">uh was accompanying uh some weather</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.799" end="01:04:39.760" style="s2">system passing through</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.079" end="01:04:41.680" style="s2">oh that&#39;s interesting a</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.760" end="01:04:45.680" style="s2">non-anthropogenic reason for a line</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.680" end="01:04:49.119" style="s2">okay yeah um but anyway um</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.680" end="01:04:51.920" style="s2">so i don&#39;t think we know how these fires</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.119" end="01:04:52.400" style="s2">started in many cases in a few cases we</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.920" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">do though</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.400" end="01:04:55.839" style="s2">we do know in a few cases we do know i</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:56.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know that it has anything to do</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.839" end="01:04:58.400" style="s2">with the protest but we</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.960" end="01:05:00.640" style="s2">there&#39;s very conspicuous stuff</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.400" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">surrounding the fire down in medford</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.640" end="01:05:05.920" style="s2">southern oregon yep um so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">rogan clearly got it wrong he followed</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.920" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">some wrong information that suggested</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">that we knew more than we actually know</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:14.079" style="s2">and he did the right thing which is he</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:15.440" style="s2">retracted it um you know he put up an</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.079" end="01:05:17.119" style="s2">instagram post which i</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.440" end="01:05:18.400" style="s2">tweeted i said this is what an honorable</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.119" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">person does when they discover that</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.400" end="01:05:21.119" style="s2">they&#39;ve made a</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:23.200" style="s2">an important mistake and so anyway i</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.119" end="01:05:27.039" style="s2">thought it was a good model</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.200" end="01:05:29.599" style="s2">um but you know people of course are</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.039" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">going to take it to be evidence of you</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.599" end="01:05:31.760" style="s2">know some problem with rogan on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:34.880" style="s2">other hand</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.760" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">no it&#39;s evidence of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.880" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">evidence quite to the contrary right in</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:41.200" style="s2">fact he&#39;s a decent</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:41.839" style="s2">he&#39;s a fundamentally decent guy and he</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.200" end="01:05:45.200" style="s2">puts out</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.839" end="01:05:47.200" style="s2">so many hours of content across so many</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.200" end="01:05:49.280" style="s2">different topics that it&#39;s surprising</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.200" end="01:05:50.400" style="s2">how rarely he needs to do something like</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.280" end="01:05:53.440" style="s2">this so</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.400" end="01:05:56.559" style="s2">um anyway very much so yeah</p>

<p begin="01:06:22.720" end="01:06:26.079" style="s2">it very much complicates the uh argument</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.599" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.079" end="01:06:34.160" style="s2">you know everything trump does is is bad</p>

<p begin="01:06:43.119" end="01:06:46.880" style="s2">to be forced to violence</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.960" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">how often is it the only option</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.880" end="01:06:51.359" style="s2">realistically could you if you had to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:52.160" style="s2">practically or morally that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.359" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.160" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">yeah well you got your answer</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.359" end="01:07:00.799" style="s2">no i don&#39;t have a a answer i might i</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.760" end="01:07:15.760" style="s2">comes to sort of widespread violence</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:17.200" style="s2">and i you know i&#39;m desperate to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.760" end="01:07:19.359" style="s2">that outcome</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.200" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t know there&#39;s a question so this</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.359" end="01:07:21.599" style="s2">question is about an individual this is</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:23.839" style="s2">not about</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.599" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">the societal level stuff this is about</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.839" end="01:07:29.359" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">like you or me as individuals</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.359" end="01:07:32.319" style="s2">um being felt that we were forced to</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:33.280" style="s2">pass you you can answer the society</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.319" end="01:07:34.960" style="s2">level question but</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.280" end="01:07:36.640" style="s2">even in rereading it i still think the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.960" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">answer is the same okay um</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.640" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">you know forced to violence by what by</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:44.240" style="s2">an individual that could happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">um by a larger force that could and may</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.240" end="01:07:46.799" style="s2">well happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:51.599" style="s2">you know one doesn&#39;t know there is this</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.920" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.599" end="01:07:55.440" style="s2">that most people are emotionally</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">devastated</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.440" end="01:07:59.119" style="s2">if they have to kill right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:02.240" style="s2">something that people discover</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.119" end="01:08:03.599" style="s2">that they are not suited to it and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.240" end="01:08:06.240" style="s2">one never really knows until</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.599" end="01:08:07.280" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in that situation um whether</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.240" end="01:08:09.920" style="s2">or not</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.280" end="01:08:11.839" style="s2">you&#39;re you know in the group that can</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.920" end="01:08:13.200" style="s2">handle it or can&#39;t but i do have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.839" end="01:08:17.440" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.200" end="01:08:19.279" style="s2">um how can i say this so i don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.440" end="01:08:20.159" style="s2">myself in terrible trouble but i guess i</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">would say</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:27.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t if i had to kill</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:28.719" style="s2">it would be because it was the right</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.839" end="01:08:30.560" style="s2">thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.719" end="01:08:33.199" style="s2">you know i think i would be if i killed</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:34.799" style="s2">somebody if i hit somebody in the car</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.199" end="01:08:36.640" style="s2">through my own negligence right which</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.799" end="01:08:37.679" style="s2">could happen to any driver i think i</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.640" end="01:08:40.640" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.679" end="01:08:41.440" style="s2">really messed up by that fact for the</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.640" end="01:08:43.839" style="s2">rest of your life</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.440" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">right but if i killed somebody out of</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.839" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">necessity</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:50.000" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it would trouble me if i</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">killed somebody because they</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.000" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">were you know a threat to me or you or</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">children right i think the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:09:01.520" style="s2">it&#39;s actually philosophically so</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:02.319" style="s2">clear that um i would not be troubled by</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.520" end="01:09:06.000" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.319" end="01:09:09.120" style="s2">of having to end somebody&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.000" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">i think um i don&#39;t think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.120" end="01:09:13.040" style="s2">i think analytically that&#39;s true um but</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">i think you would still</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.040" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">um i i think almost any of us</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:22.640" style="s2">uh would still</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:24.400" style="s2">have a hard time coming to grips you</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.640" end="01:09:26.239" style="s2">know if we&#39;d never done it before</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.400" end="01:09:29.839" style="s2">especially hard time coming to grips</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.239" end="01:09:32.880" style="s2">with i mean having ended someone&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.839" end="01:09:34.719" style="s2">i really don&#39;t you know my sense is one</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.880" end="01:09:38.159" style="s2">has an absolute obligation</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.719" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">to tread ultra carefully there up until</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.159" end="01:09:42.960" style="s2">the point that you have no choice</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:43.759" style="s2">at the point that you have no choice it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.960" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">is hard</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.759" end="01:09:47.679" style="s2">i don&#39;t see the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:51.600" style="s2">implication if something is a threat</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.679" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">to one of us a lethal threat</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.600" end="01:09:55.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not disagreeing with uh your</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">conclusion about what the appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.040" end="01:09:56.960" style="s2">behavior would be i mean we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:09:58.640" style="s2">defined</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.960" end="01:10:00.560" style="s2">what the threat would be but you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.640" end="01:10:02.080" style="s2">that there are there threats that would</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:03.520" style="s2">warrant uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.080" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">violence that would end someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:08.880" style="s2">life yes um</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:10.159" style="s2">clearly uh but the idea that um</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.880" end="01:10:11.920" style="s2">what i&#39;m objecting to is your</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.159" end="01:10:13.440" style="s2">characterization of your expected</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.920" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">response afterwards as</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.440" end="01:10:16.560" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t be bothered yeah yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.560" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">um because you</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:26.560" style="s2">i just some people wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:27.920" style="s2">and you would not be plagued with should</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.560" end="01:10:29.840" style="s2">i have or shouldn&#39;t i have</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.920" end="01:10:31.360" style="s2">if it was if it was if it had been clear</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.840" end="01:10:32.960" style="s2">and of course you know part of</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.360" end="01:10:34.560" style="s2">part of what these conversations often</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.960" end="01:10:36.000" style="s2">are is that there was gray area was it</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.560" end="01:10:37.600" style="s2">clear was it not but if</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.000" end="01:10:39.840" style="s2">if it was clear and especially if there</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.600" end="01:10:41.600" style="s2">was a a witness who could say to you yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.840" end="01:10:43.280" style="s2">that was clear you needed to do that 100</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.600" end="01:10:44.880" style="s2">then there wouldn&#39;t be any gray area</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.280" end="01:10:46.800" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:48.719" style="s2">should i or shouldn&#39;t i have but even</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.800" end="01:10:53.440" style="s2">with no gray area i needed to</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.719" end="01:10:55.679" style="s2">i did it it&#39;s done uh still</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.440" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a before and after in your life</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.679" end="01:10:58.239" style="s2">i&#39;ve killed someone i haven&#39;t killed</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.880" end="01:11:00.400" style="s2">someone i&#39;m not saying it</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.239" end="01:11:02.480" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have an effect i&#39;m saying so i</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.400" end="01:11:04.560" style="s2">guess i doesn&#39;t have an effect and i</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.480" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">couldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t be bothered don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.560" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">strike me as having total overlap</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:10.400" style="s2">well you know for one thing this is a</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:12.239" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.400" end="01:11:14.400" style="s2">in advance of it ever happening it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.239" end="01:11:16.159" style="s2">a question in the aftermath of it so</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.400" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">of course that&#39;s a transition right</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.159" end="01:11:18.880" style="s2">there so i&#39;m not arguing it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.400" style="s2">an implication</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.880" end="01:11:23.120" style="s2">but my sense is first of all i spend a</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.400" end="01:11:26.640" style="s2">lot of time</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.120" end="01:11:29.679" style="s2">thinking about the fact that i</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.640" end="01:11:32.320" style="s2">i aim to change</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.679" end="01:11:33.840" style="s2">the way civilization functions because i</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.320" end="01:11:34.880" style="s2">think we&#39;re in a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.840" end="01:11:36.480" style="s2">danger</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.880" end="01:11:38.000" style="s2">that results in the following</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:41.120" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.000" end="01:11:41.840" style="s2">if you change things you run the risk of</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.120" end="01:11:44.080" style="s2">making them</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.840" end="01:11:46.320" style="s2">worse you run the risk that there will</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.080" end="01:11:49.520" style="s2">be downstream consequences that do</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.320" end="01:11:52.000" style="s2">include people&#39;s death right</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.520" end="01:11:53.679" style="s2">so that has to be something that you</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.000" end="01:11:56.880" style="s2">reconcile yourself to</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.679" end="01:11:57.199" style="s2">you know and all i can say is i am being</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.880" end="01:12:00.080" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.199" end="01:12:01.520" style="s2">careful as i possibly can to decrease</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.080" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">the chances</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.520" end="01:12:04.560" style="s2">but that the situation we are in you</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:08.239" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.560" end="01:12:09.760" style="s2">we are living unsustainably in a system</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.239" end="01:12:11.920" style="s2">with rules that are inadequate to</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.760" end="01:12:12.719" style="s2">protect us from processes that are</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.920" end="01:12:16.400" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.719" end="01:12:20.000" style="s2">alive well and putting us in jeopardy</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.400" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">so i don&#39;t i just</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.000" end="01:12:24.159" style="s2">i don&#39;t see the difference for one thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.159" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">you pulling a trigger</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:31.679" style="s2">out of necessity because somebody is a</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:34.800" style="s2">threat to you or your family</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.679" end="01:12:35.360" style="s2">and doing this in the abstract in fact i</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.800" end="01:12:38.480" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.360" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">people to the extent that people see a</p>

<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:43.199" style="s2">they are actually miscalculating right</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.080" end="01:12:46.800" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.199" end="01:12:49.760" style="s2">death is a result of policy</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.800" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">constantly right and to the extent that</p>

<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:53.360" style="s2">don&#39;t treat it seriously because they</p>

<p begin="01:13:06.640" end="01:13:10.400" style="s2">actually do think if the answer is it</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.199" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have to be a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.400" end="01:13:16.000" style="s2">percent certain the point is</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.239" end="01:13:18.400" style="s2">from where i stood was this necessary</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.000" end="01:13:20.640" style="s2">given the information i had i think</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.400" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">frankly that&#39;s sufficient now if it</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.640" end="01:13:24.400" style="s2">turned out somehow to be an error maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.560" end="01:13:26.960" style="s2">that would be uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.400" end="01:13:28.560" style="s2">wildly well i mean of course that would</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.960" end="01:13:29.840" style="s2">change things but i just i think that</p>

<p begin="01:13:29.840" end="01:13:32.960" style="s2">you are imagining a fully analytical</p>

<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:42.239" style="s2">no i&#39;m imagining that the um</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.480" end="01:13:43.920" style="s2">analytics um actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.239" end="01:13:46.320" style="s2">have an implication for the emotional</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.920" end="01:13:46.640" style="s2">stuff as they of course of course they</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.320" end="01:13:50.159" style="s2">do</p>

<p begin="01:14:12.320" end="01:14:16.719" style="s2">towards the person that you killed for</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">putting you in that position i think i</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.719" end="01:14:22.080" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:25.440" style="s2">that&#39;s right um okay let&#39;s do two more</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.080" end="01:14:26.159" style="s2">um how might explorer modes manifest on</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.440" end="01:14:28.480" style="s2">the brain</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.159" end="01:14:30.000" style="s2">human or non-human does the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.480" end="01:14:33.600" style="s2">predict any particular types of neural</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.000" end="01:14:35.199" style="s2">circuitry or psychological experience</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.600" end="01:14:37.040" style="s2">um yeah well if we&#39;re talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.199" end="01:14:39.199" style="s2">human brain sure um</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.040" end="01:14:40.320" style="s2">i would say consciousness consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.199" end="01:14:44.320" style="s2">consciousness and</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.320" end="01:14:46.560" style="s2">consciousness as a an emergent social</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.320" end="01:14:47.360" style="s2">phenomenon not a purely individual</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.560" end="01:14:50.960" style="s2">phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.360" end="01:14:53.760" style="s2">that in effect the ability to model</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.960" end="01:14:55.040" style="s2">a scenario and figure out what is likely</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.760" end="01:14:56.800" style="s2">to work and then exchange that</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.040" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">information with others who might have</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.800" end="01:15:01.920" style="s2">different insight into what might happen</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">that that is the ultimate explorer mode</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.920" end="01:15:06.560" style="s2">and it explains</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:08.400" style="s2">why humans are so good at moving from</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.560" end="01:15:11.520" style="s2">one niche to another without</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.400" end="01:15:12.560" style="s2">having to undergo a morphological or</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.520" end="01:15:15.600" style="s2">physiological</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.560" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">evolutionary change so yes</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.600" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">100 yeah um hi</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:22.880" style="s2">uh so actually we&#39;ve got three</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.040" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">here that i think we can do pretty</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.480" end="01:15:27.440" style="s2">quickly um</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.000" end="01:15:31.199" style="s2">i don&#39;t like the abortion question i</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:32.080" style="s2">prefer the discussion as to why in our</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.199" end="01:15:33.840" style="s2">day and age</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.080" end="01:15:36.080" style="s2">so many people get pregnant who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.840" end="01:15:38.000" style="s2">want a child solving that question and</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.080" end="01:15:40.960" style="s2">social problem will fix over 90</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.000" end="01:15:41.280" style="s2">of the issue do you have thoughts i</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.960" end="01:15:43.120" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.280" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">i think that&#39;s right and you know i i am</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.120" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">obviously not someone who</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:50.840" style="s2">uh feels staunchly about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.800" end="01:15:52.640" style="s2">right of a woman to terminate a</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.840" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">pregnancy at least in the first</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.640" end="01:15:54.960" style="s2">trimester</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">and probably at least halfway through</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.960" end="01:16:00.320" style="s2">the second um</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:02.239" style="s2">no probably halfway through the second</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.320" end="01:16:03.920" style="s2">has anything to do with me celebrating</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.239" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">casual sex and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.920" end="01:16:08.560" style="s2">the so-called sex positive movement um</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.880" end="01:16:15.600" style="s2">it is precisely as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.320" end="01:16:18.000" style="s2">it should be a last-ditch safety net</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.600" end="01:16:20.080" style="s2">and what we should be doing is reducing</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.000" end="01:16:22.800" style="s2">the number of abortions that are ever</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.080" end="01:16:23.760" style="s2">um ever called for in the first place um</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.800" end="01:16:25.040" style="s2">so i mean that is part of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.760" end="01:16:27.440" style="s2">conversation that we</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.040" end="01:16:28.560" style="s2">that we have oh 100 yeah i mean we have</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.440" end="01:16:32.080" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.560" end="01:16:35.040" style="s2">culture that treats this</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.080" end="01:16:35.840" style="s2">issue the issue of sex and what it is</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.040" end="01:16:39.440" style="s2">and what it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.840" end="01:16:41.840" style="s2">and how one might engage with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.440" end="01:16:44.239" style="s2">treats it so frivolously and for such</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.840" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">obviously economically corrupt reasons</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.239" end="01:16:49.280" style="s2">that we just have lost our ability</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:52.159" style="s2">to say you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.280" end="01:16:54.159" style="s2">does does civilization have a right to</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.159" end="01:16:55.760" style="s2">have a culture surrounding sex that</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.159" end="01:16:56.719" style="s2">results in people having healthy sexual</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.760" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.719" end="01:17:00.800" style="s2">it does it hasn&#39;t it has an obligation</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:04.320" style="s2">to do it and an abiding interest</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.800" end="01:17:06.800" style="s2">in it and that we&#39;ve allowed the</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.320" end="01:17:08.320" style="s2">market and other forces to pollute this</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.800" end="01:17:10.159" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.320" end="01:17:11.600" style="s2">very destructive and it is you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.159" end="01:17:15.679" style="s2">the at the point you get</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.600" end="01:17:18.000" style="s2">to abortions late in a pregnancy</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.679" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about many levels of</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.000" end="01:17:23.120" style="s2">failure that didn&#39;t need to be</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:24.239" style="s2">yeah okay um</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.120" end="01:17:26.239" style="s2">we&#39;ve actually got four more here</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.239" end="01:17:26.719" style="s2">including one very large dollar amount</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.239" end="01:17:28.880" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.719" end="01:17:30.320" style="s2">um and three of these are really just</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.880" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">comments so i&#39;m going to read the</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.320" end="01:17:31.920" style="s2">comments and then we&#39;ll end with this</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:34.400" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.920" end="01:17:35.120" style="s2">okay you were wrong about confirmation</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.400" end="01:17:37.040" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.120" end="01:17:39.679" style="s2">10 justices have been confirmed the same</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.040" end="01:17:41.199" style="s2">day 53 confirmed within seven days the</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.679" end="01:17:42.560" style="s2">average confirmation time historically</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.199" end="01:17:45.440" style="s2">is 25 days</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.560" end="01:17:46.880" style="s2">rbg was 45 days so i don&#39;t know if any</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.440" end="01:17:49.840" style="s2">of that&#39;s true but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.880" end="01:17:50.880" style="s2">the claim here so i am going entirely</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.840" end="01:17:53.600" style="s2">based on what i</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.880" end="01:17:55.360" style="s2">understood biden to say i only viewed</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.600" end="01:17:56.960" style="s2">his speech once so either i</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.360" end="01:17:58.640" style="s2">misunderstood biden</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.960" end="01:18:00.239" style="s2">biden misrepresented the truth which</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.640" end="01:18:01.840" style="s2">would be shocking to me</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.239" end="01:18:03.280" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s not like he was saying</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.840" end="01:18:05.440" style="s2">these things off the cuff</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.280" end="01:18:07.280" style="s2">but anyway i would love to know what</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.440" end="01:18:09.120" style="s2">happened here presumably i misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.280" end="01:18:10.159" style="s2">something and i will uh i will look into</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.120" end="01:18:14.080" style="s2">it and figure it out</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.159" end="01:18:15.600" style="s2">okay um finally got it blm riot fever</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.080" end="01:18:17.280" style="s2">looks exactly like a bunch of angry</p>

<p begin="01:19:07.199" end="01:19:12.239" style="s2">does mean that i&#39;m not going to allow</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.840" end="01:19:14.080" style="s2">um that the emotional emotional</p>

<p begin="01:19:14.080" end="01:19:18.000" style="s2">harm has already been engaged and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.960" end="01:19:20.159" style="s2">what i&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.000" end="01:19:21.040" style="s2">is that if you engage that circuitry</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.159" end="01:19:24.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.040" end="01:19:26.880" style="s2">however you end up is the result</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.080" end="01:19:28.320" style="s2">of the process that one would go through</p>

<p begin="01:19:33.120" end="01:19:38.719" style="s2">okay all right okay final question from</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:41.199" style="s2">daniel how is it possible that only</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.719" end="01:19:42.640" style="s2">trump was briefed on sars cove too</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.199" end="01:19:44.159" style="s2">seems like the briefings that resulted</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.640" end="01:19:46.000" style="s2">in the stock sale investigation would</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.159" end="01:19:47.840" style="s2">have included the same intel</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.000" end="01:19:50.239" style="s2">pelosi as third in command and chair of</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.840" end="01:19:54.640" style="s2">the house intel committee seems unlikely</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.239" end="01:19:56.400" style="s2">to not have had that intel yeah i</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.640" end="01:19:58.880" style="s2">agree that it is very likely that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.400" end="01:20:01.679" style="s2">intel was</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.880" end="01:20:03.520" style="s2">widespread i must say there must be more</p>

<p begin="01:20:03.520" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">um yeah so this this person contributed</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.639" end="01:20:11.199" style="s2">quite a bit to</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:14.320" style="s2">to say this uh and i think i think</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.199" end="01:20:18.719" style="s2">the subtext is um</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.320" end="01:20:21.679" style="s2">why are we as many others are uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.719" end="01:20:23.520" style="s2">putting repeatedly putting so much of</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.679" end="01:20:25.360" style="s2">the responsibility for the response to</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.520" end="01:20:27.760" style="s2">service cove too</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.360" end="01:20:28.719" style="s2">on trump uh given that many other people</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.760" end="01:20:31.040" style="s2">must have known</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.719" end="01:20:32.000" style="s2">uh what what was true oh</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.040" end="01:20:34.400" style="s2">disproportionate</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.000" end="01:20:36.000" style="s2">power over the situation that&#39;s why i i</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:38.239" style="s2">don&#39;t trust pelosi</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.000" end="01:20:40.080" style="s2">at all did she play games here yes is</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.239" end="01:20:42.560" style="s2">she constantly playing games</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.080" end="01:20:44.159" style="s2">yes is trump&#39;s response in part the</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.560" end="01:20:45.199" style="s2">result of an impeachment that shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.159" end="01:20:48.880" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.199" end="01:20:51.120" style="s2">right yes so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.880" end="01:20:52.480" style="s2">i&#39;m not making excuses for the</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.120" end="01:20:54.320" style="s2">democratic</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.480" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">leadership but i do think the president</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.320" end="01:20:59.760" style="s2">had a unique position</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:21:04.400" style="s2">from which to do the right thing and um</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.760" end="01:21:06.560" style="s2">and frankly he didn&#39;t in part um</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.400" end="01:21:08.960" style="s2">because he doesn&#39;t seem able to surround</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.560" end="01:21:12.080" style="s2">himself with trustworthy advisors</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.960" end="01:21:14.400" style="s2">he ends up alienating uh all the people</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.080" end="01:21:17.199" style="s2">around him with the with the barest</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.400" end="01:21:20.560" style="s2">exception of a few people in his family</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.199" end="01:21:21.360" style="s2">and a leader needs advisers that they</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.560" end="01:21:23.280" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.360" end="01:21:24.400" style="s2">and that who can speak uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.280" end="01:21:26.960" style="s2">truths to them</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.400" end="01:21:28.400" style="s2">and who are not at risk of being fired</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.960" end="01:21:30.000" style="s2">at a moment&#39;s notice because they said</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.400" end="01:21:30.960" style="s2">the wrong thing or hurt the guy&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.000" end="01:21:32.719" style="s2">feelings</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.960" end="01:21:34.239" style="s2">and i mean this really in some ways</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.719" end="01:21:36.560" style="s2">seems like the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.239" end="01:21:37.280" style="s2">weakness of him as a president that he</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.560" end="01:21:40.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.280" end="01:21:41.920" style="s2">there is no trusting that he will</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.480" end="01:21:43.600" style="s2">learn from and be able to do the right</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.920" end="01:21:45.679" style="s2">thing in another situation because</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.600" end="01:21:47.840" style="s2">if the next situation looks entirely</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.679" end="01:21:50.800" style="s2">different from any prayer situations</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.840" end="01:21:51.520" style="s2">um he he doesn&#39;t have advisers around</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.800" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.520" end="01:21:54.880" style="s2">who whom he trusts and who speak the</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:56.880" style="s2">same language</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.880" end="01:21:58.639" style="s2">and who can say to him you know what</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.880" end="01:21:59.920" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna need these three experts</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.639" end="01:22:01.520" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know who they are but my</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.920" end="01:22:03.760" style="s2">good friend this or my trusted</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.520" end="01:22:05.360" style="s2">advisor this tells me that these are the</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.760" end="01:22:06.800" style="s2">people you know and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.360" end="01:22:10.080" style="s2">that we&#39;re arguing for</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.800" end="01:22:13.520" style="s2">authority and experts on everything but</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.080" end="01:22:14.560" style="s2">but having no ability to seek the advice</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.520" end="01:22:17.440" style="s2">of others</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.560" end="01:22:19.120" style="s2">and to add that into your model even or</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.440" end="01:22:21.760" style="s2">especially when they disagree with you</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.120" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">is a huge liability yeah i would point</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.760" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">out though if we zoom out on this</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:27.520" style="s2">question a little</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:30.080" style="s2">bit um i do find it interesting um</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.520" end="01:22:31.040" style="s2">we take a lot of crap for how hard we</p>
