<p begin="00:05:01.360" end="00:05:06.720" style="s2">parallax and andrew runs it with tom so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">parallax to me is a perfect example of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.880" style="s2">like a really contemporary place you can</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:12.720" style="s2">go online and find tons of really great</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.880" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">materials especially this conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.720" end="00:05:15.840" style="s2">that is somewhere between</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:17.600" style="s2">philosophy politics and spirituality</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.840" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">especially that conversation parallax is</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.600" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">really good at it</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:22.080" style="s2">you&#39;re putting together great work tom</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">and the fact that we&#39;re also now</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.080" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">working from a european basis means that</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:28.240" style="s2">parallax also now introduces</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:29.360" style="s2">translations so you can go into this</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.240" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">discourse</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.360" end="00:05:33.280" style="s2">it&#39;s not just completely anglo-saxon</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of tired of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.280" end="00:05:36.800" style="s2">so much for people are concerned and</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">want to talk about these days is just</p>

<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s either directed from from</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.160" end="00:05:43.039" style="s2">the uk or from the us</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:44.960" style="s2">right but what&#39;s great about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.039" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">work we do is that we&#39;re all based in</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.960" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">continental europe</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">and we want our translations to other</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s an amazing book i hope you will</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.880" style="s2">talk a little bit about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:04.479" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s like with with parallax also</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.880" end="00:06:06.000" style="s2">and this is one of the great ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.479" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">we had in paris with andrew</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:10.720" style="s2">together that you know it&#39;s not just a</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">magazine but there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.720" end="00:06:13.759" style="s2">in the future like a kind of academy</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:16.319" style="s2">attached where you can</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.759" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">search and for new content and for new</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.319" end="00:06:21.360" style="s2">sense make a way of sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:23.600" style="s2">you know and make sense of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.360" end="00:06:24.479" style="s2">world and mess we we are in right now</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.600" end="00:06:26.720" style="s2">and to</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.479" end="00:06:28.160" style="s2">you know to find to find a platform</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.720" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">there and that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.160" end="00:06:32.240" style="s2">general idea we had in paris and so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m really happy that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.240" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">yeah because the all the old</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">institutions are going to go this is one</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">central thesis of my work with john cena</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:41.680" style="s2">quest</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">uh so we&#39;ve written five books we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.680" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">working on the sixth one</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:48.400" style="s2">and um the first three books have been</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:50.560" style="s2">released in lots of different languages</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.400" end="00:06:51.599" style="s2">under the title the futurica trilogy</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.560" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.599" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">futurologists and philosophers at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">same time</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:58.560" style="s2">so we we&#39;ve done a lot of work on where</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.080" style="s2">are we going where&#39;s humanity going next</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.560" end="00:07:01.120" style="s2">and obviously he&#39;s been writing for like</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.080" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">20 years</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.120" end="00:07:04.160" style="s2">we&#39;ve hit the nail now several times</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:06.319" style="s2">over so like</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.160" end="00:07:07.840" style="s2">um a lot of the things we predicted have</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.319" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">been in our books already we predicted</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.840" end="00:07:10.560" style="s2">pandemics would happen and take on a</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:12.319" style="s2">different scale</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.560" end="00:07:13.599" style="s2">in the internet age you know most of</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.319" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">things are happening currently we</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.599" end="00:07:16.560" style="s2">predicted before</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">we rose wrote those three books first</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.560" end="00:07:21.520" style="s2">yada and then we continued</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">now with a new trilogy which probably</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.520" end="00:07:24.960" style="s2">when it&#39;s all finished is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:28.240" style="s2">called the exodus</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.960" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s essentially a philosophy on how</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.240" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">you leave one paradigm of history and</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">walk into another paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:37.120" style="s2">of course the term paradigm is thomas</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:40.160" style="s2">coons a term for saying a certain</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.120" end="00:07:41.680" style="s2">age like a certain age we lived in and</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.160" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">then we move on to another age but of</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:46.240" style="s2">course all these</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:48.720" style="s2">histories about exodus like you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.240" end="00:07:50.319" style="s2">you left amer europe going to america</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.720" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">you know the story of the promised land</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.319" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">the hebrews left egypt</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:55.039" style="s2">all these extras that history are good</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:55.759" style="s2">metaphors what we&#39;re actually going</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.039" end="00:07:57.520" style="s2">through right now</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.759" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">except this time we&#39;re moving from one</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.520" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">age to another age in history</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:03.840" style="s2">and one of the central thesis that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:05.919" style="s2">certificate is now working with is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.840" end="00:08:07.120" style="s2">if you compare the current paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.919" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.120" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">from previous paradigm shifts we</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">discovered that all</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">the old institutions and the entire old</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:16.720" style="s2">power structure of the previous paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">will eventually collapse or at least be</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.720" end="00:08:19.680" style="s2">marginalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:22.560" style="s2">an interesting thing with something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.680" end="00:08:26.000" style="s2">parallax here is that parallax is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.560" end="00:08:29.360" style="s2">of course um somewhere between academic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.000" end="00:08:31.039" style="s2">and mass media in in in the terminology</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.360" end="00:08:32.800" style="s2">of the old paradigm so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.039" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">you know you would have media media</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.800" end="00:08:36.080" style="s2">would all be mass media</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:38.479" style="s2">it would be uh the printing press</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.080" end="00:08:41.200" style="s2">essentially and its electronic versions</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.479" end="00:08:42.080" style="s2">so that would be newspapers radio</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.200" end="00:08:44.959" style="s2">television</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.080" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">and all these mass media would be you</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.959" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:50.000" style="s2">controlled from above and they were</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">recognized by the fact that they would</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.000" end="00:08:54.480" style="s2">distribute</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">information you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.480" end="00:08:58.959" style="s2">very effectively right started system</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">but with no response</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.959" end="00:09:02.959" style="s2">so basically we were told what to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">right so but focusing now more on</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.959" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">digital libido</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">um um you will have like a lecture now</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:11.200" style="s2">it&#39;s like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">what&#39;s the general topic of uh what you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.200" end="00:09:16.080" style="s2">would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:18.000" style="s2">okay so the only situations fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.080" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">new institutions open up so parallax</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.000" end="00:09:21.360" style="s2">that&#39;s where we fit in i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">say that somewhere between the academia</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.360" end="00:09:24.480" style="s2">which is imploding today</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:25.760" style="s2">and mass videos uploading today so</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.480" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">somewhere between these two</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.760" end="00:09:28.880" style="s2">in the online world is where we work at</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:30.560" style="s2">parallax so</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.880" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">i just want to say that right our</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.560" end="00:09:33.519" style="s2">philosophy is tied in with the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">work that you do so people</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.519" end="00:09:37.120" style="s2">see the connection here okay so you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">give me some half hour or something to</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.120" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">explain this box</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">just a little bit yeah yeah 40 45</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">minutes so all right what</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">what will you be talking about okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.839" style="s2">okay now okay i give you the floor</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:50.320" style="s2">finally the technology works i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.839" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">floor</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.320" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">yeah i get the and and all of you out</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:55.680" style="s2">there all you guys out there</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:57.200" style="s2">please remember if you want to stay on</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.680" end="00:09:58.720" style="s2">after i&#39;m finished we&#39;re gonna have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.200" end="00:10:00.480" style="s2">question and answer session and</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.720" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">tom will let you in with your little</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.480" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">face and your name and your voice</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.959" style="s2">and you will then ask a question so we</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">try to make this work so right</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.959" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">thank you alexander we are all yes you</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:16.320" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">okay so i met john soderlist in 1998.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.320" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">believe it or not</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:20.240" style="s2">we knew about each other before we</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">started writing together but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.240" end="00:10:24.320" style="s2">know each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">and uh i had an offer i was hired by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.320" end="00:10:28.399" style="s2">stockholm school of economics in 1998</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">to give a series of lectures on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.399" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">internet and this was like late 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">once i started studying the topic really</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">deeply i discovered that</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">um almost everything we&#39;d assume about</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:41.760" style="s2">the internet already then was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.680" style="s2">that might be easy to say now you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">because we have the dot-com boom and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.680" end="00:10:47.360" style="s2">you know a lot of attempts at</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">understanding internet and frustrating</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.360" end="00:10:51.839" style="s2">you know milk it for money or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:53.600" style="s2">but most of those projects failed it</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.839" end="00:10:55.519" style="s2">turns out that the products that did</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.600" end="00:10:56.320" style="s2">succeed and became the tech giants that</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.519" end="00:10:58.160" style="s2">we have today</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.320" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">took a much more long-term view and had</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.160" end="00:11:00.160" style="s2">a better understanding of what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:01.760" style="s2">internet was</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.160" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">the vast majority of people who tried to</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.760" end="00:11:06.800" style="s2">jump on the bandwagon in the late 1990s</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">so that was the general landscape where</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.800" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">john and i were located</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t work on my own uh um you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:13.600" style="s2">know if</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.040" style="s2">nietzsche had got his dead on his grave</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.600" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">when he died i want to have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.040" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">individual that&#39;s dead on my grave</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">because i never believed in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:22.079" style="s2">individualism i think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:24.079" style="s2">that we&#39;re sort of stuck in our heads</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.079" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">that descartes and the model can&#39;t love</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.079" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">this idea that we&#39;re stuck in our heads</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.360" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">so we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.480" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">you know connect with the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:30.800" style="s2">well to begin with we do connect you</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:32.240" style="s2">know with the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.800" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">including other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:35.760" style="s2">we are incredibly social animals we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">tribal more</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.760" end="00:11:40.399" style="s2">more than anything else and and i always</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">defend the right for humans to be human</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.399" end="00:11:43.279" style="s2">i think try to change this into</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:44.240" style="s2">something we&#39;re not it&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">terrible idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.240" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">also very costly one so anyway this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">the late 1990s john and i meet because</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:52.560" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for a collaborator to work</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">with on writing the books</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.560" end="00:11:55.600" style="s2">and i was offered to write a book on my</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:59.279" style="s2">very radical</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.600" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">internet theory and i met john</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.279" end="00:12:04.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve had dinner this is an old store</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">now it&#39;s a well-known store and i use it</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.000" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">apparently i wasn&#39;t that good of a cook</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:07.760" style="s2">according to john but i cooked some</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">chicken</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.760" end="00:12:11.360" style="s2">it was in my house and we had a drawing</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:12.800" style="s2">board in front of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.360" end="00:12:15.040" style="s2">and we had the chicken and the drawing</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.800" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">board a glass of wine we love drinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.040" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">and we&#39;re sitting there and basically on</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:20.399" style="s2">the map of the drawing board we had a</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:22.880" style="s2">map of the book</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.399" end="00:12:23.680" style="s2">of the theory and then john said</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.880" end="00:12:26.000" style="s2">alexander</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.680" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">this is not just one book this is like</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.000" end="00:12:28.480" style="s2">three books</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">this is like three books that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">write over the next 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.560" end="00:12:34.399" style="s2">and i said okay i don&#39;t even want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">hear about the second and third book</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.399" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">right now i&#39;m going to concentrate on</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:39.279" style="s2">writing the first book</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:40.720" style="s2">so yeah but john said just so that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.279" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">know that the theory is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.720" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">white or way bigger than you&#39;ve assumed</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:46.079" style="s2">for just one book</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">but let&#39;s go into this and see who</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.079" end="00:12:50.000" style="s2">you&#39;re right and that&#39;s how we invented</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:51.440" style="s2">a whole new field of philosophy we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.000" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">called vetturica</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.440" end="00:12:58.079" style="s2">the veturica is essentially literature</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">that deals on future logical issues like</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.079" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">futurist issues</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:02.240" style="s2">from a philosophical point of view say</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">you&#39;re going to do philosophy on the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.240" end="00:13:05.360" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">not on the past not on the now you got</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.360" end="00:13:08.880" style="s2">to do philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.160" end="00:13:10.560" style="s2">on the future you do for tourica so the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.880" end="00:13:12.079" style="s2">vulgar version of a turkey day with</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.560" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">something like ray kurzweil and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.079" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">singularity theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.079" style="s2">and the more advanced version of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">turka would be john cena christian</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.079" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">alexander park</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:20.240" style="s2">so now you get the overall picture so we</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">started writing the first book was</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.240" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">called the nedocrats it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:25.920" style="s2">nether cotton i think in german</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:27.279" style="s2">um it became a worldwide success we</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.920" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">traveled around the world the next four</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.279" end="00:13:30.320" style="s2">years with that book</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">two years later we started working on</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.320" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">the second book which is called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">global empire</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">and if the netocrats is quite accessible</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:41.360" style="s2">i would say the global empire is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">pretty hard technical philosophical work</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.360" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s a very important book in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:46.000" style="s2">hindsight because it was with the global</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:47.440" style="s2">empire second book</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.000" end="00:13:49.680" style="s2">that we launched the entire</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.440" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">philosophical theory of how to</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.680" end="00:13:53.440" style="s2">understand the current paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:55.440" style="s2">and the title speaks volume because when</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.440" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">you hear the title the global empire</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.440" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">you think somebody&#39;s going to conquer</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.720" style="s2">the rest of the planet say be</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:02.720" style="s2">the cmp of china or believe it or not</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.720" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">bill clinton and some nukes from america</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.720" end="00:14:05.680" style="s2">would conquer the rest of the world you</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">would have a global empire but actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.680" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">what we stated in the book this book</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">came out in 2003</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">was that the global empire already</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:14.240" style="s2">exists it&#39;s just that if you don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:14.720" style="s2">the human perspective of the world we</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.240" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.720" end="00:14:19.120" style="s2">ask technology and you would discover</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">that the internet protocol</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.120" end="00:14:24.399" style="s2">is already the constitution of an empire</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">except it&#39;s a technological empire</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.399" end="00:14:28.720" style="s2">so now 20 years later it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:31.040" style="s2">easier to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.720" end="00:14:33.519" style="s2">you know ai would eventually create</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.040" end="00:14:36.000" style="s2">individuals like agents</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.519" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">subjectivity the way human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.000" end="00:14:39.760" style="s2">agents each one of us is an agent and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">can then have agency together we call it</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.760" end="00:14:43.519" style="s2">a collective agency or tribal agency or</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.360" style="s2">national agency whatever</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.519" end="00:14:46.880" style="s2">but the agents that we human beings are</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.360" end="00:14:48.399" style="s2">accustomed to when it comes to each</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.880" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">other we have conversations</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.399" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">it&#39;s an agency obviously a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">machines are going to have in the future</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:55.199" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.079" style="s2">and these agencies of them probably gone</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.199" end="00:14:59.120" style="s2">at her</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.079" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2">to give a global imperial order so</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.120" end="00:15:02.800" style="s2">essentially what we said is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:04.079" style="s2">as soon as you start to collect data</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.800" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">that data will want</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.079" end="00:15:07.839" style="s2">sooner or later to have more data and it</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:10.079" style="s2">will marry other</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.839" end="00:15:11.600" style="s2">collections of data and the world&#39;s data</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.079" end="00:15:12.000" style="s2">centers are very likely eventually</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.600" end="00:15:14.720" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.000" end="00:15:15.519" style="s2">one huge data center this is something</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.720" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">we then explore</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.519" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">later in our work in our fourth book we</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">come to that but this was the global</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">empire</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:22.880" style="s2">they wrote a very accessible book you</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">know to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.880" end="00:15:25.839" style="s2">you know favorites among students and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">you know people who want to get access</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.839" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">to philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">which is the one that i recommend for</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:30.720" style="s2">you if you want to have an easy start</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">with a certificate</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.720" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">and this book is called the body</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:35.720" style="s2">machines</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:37.440" style="s2">and the body machines was essentially an</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.720" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">application</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.440" end="00:15:41.759" style="s2">of our philosophy onto the individual or</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">individual human being</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.759" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">so if you want to write if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:48.079" style="s2">read a book</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:48.959" style="s2">on the digital age and what it means to</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.079" end="00:15:51.600" style="s2">be a digital</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.959" end="00:15:53.199" style="s2">citizen or a person in this age and how</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.600" end="00:15:54.639" style="s2">it&#39;s different from previous paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.199" end="00:15:56.639" style="s2">so what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.639" end="00:15:57.680" style="s2">then the body machines is the place to</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.639" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">go</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:00.959" style="s2">okay those three books were later you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.959" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">re-released and repackaged as the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:06.000" style="s2">photorecord trilogy you can get the</p>

<p begin="00:16:06.000" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">on amazon for example you can also read</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">those books separately but those are the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">first three books</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.199" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">now we come to the current</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:18.880" style="s2">second trilogy we&#39;re writing john</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.279" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">john demanded on me since we&#39;re turning</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.880" end="00:16:22.079" style="s2">60 years old next year and this is going</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">to be the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.079" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">the the sixth book we&#39;re writing at the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:25.839" style="s2">moment after the deliberate is going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:27.600" style="s2">be the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.839" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">because we&#39;re putting pretty hard work</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.600" end="00:16:30.079" style="s2">into digital a bit on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:32.639" style="s2">in the book before that which is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.079" end="00:16:34.240" style="s2">synthesis book but these three books</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.639" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">are going to be eventually another</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.240" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">second trilogy and after that we&#39;re 60</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.440" style="s2">years old we&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:41.440" style="s2">resign and have our students write books</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.440" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">and kill their fathers and we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.440" end="00:16:44.399" style="s2">of drinks and we make</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:46.320" style="s2">commentary on our work or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.399" end="00:16:49.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the current plan</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.320" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">but the second trilogy which digital</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.440" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">libido is the central work</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:55.839" style="s2">it&#39;s called the exodus so what we did</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">was that we started looking at fresh new</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.839" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">eyes on the current</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:17:00.399" style="s2">contemporary society and looking into</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.000" style="s2">the future and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.399" end="00:17:03.680" style="s2">then we discovered there&#39;s a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.000" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">that can be said about it that we</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.680" end="00:17:05.760" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:07.360" style="s2">discussed in the first three books</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.760" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">because the first three books our focus</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.360" end="00:17:10.880" style="s2">is very much on the technology</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">we felt that philosophers had talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.880" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">about human beings quite a lot in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.480" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">they understood how human beings</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">operated we love hegel we love nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:21.520" style="s2">we love freud</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:23.360" style="s2">we love all these thinkers who you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.520" end="00:17:24.799" style="s2">talked and discussed human beings quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.360" end="00:17:26.559" style="s2">a lot and on top of that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.799" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">psychonauts and psychology and other</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.559" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">things to try</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:31.520" style="s2">and attempt to understand human beings</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.520" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">deep ingrained in the world of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:36.400" style="s2">psychoanalysis which is where we get our</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:37.280" style="s2">understanding of the human mind from in</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.400" end="00:17:39.520" style="s2">our work</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.280" end="00:17:40.799" style="s2">so we love slavishik for example we sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.520" end="00:17:42.640" style="s2">of adapted to him</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:44.480" style="s2">shot la khan before him and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.640" end="00:17:47.039" style="s2">freud so we felt that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.480" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">okay the second time around since people</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.039" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">now have</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.600" style="s2">understood that technology is taking</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">over the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.600" end="00:17:56.559" style="s2">on a radical new scale never seen before</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">even matching humans</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.559" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">even on the scale that we might not even</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2">know whether humans will still be around</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">in the future</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:05.440" style="s2">since everybody&#39;s figured that out and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">lot of people are writing poc books on</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.440" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">the topic like super intelligence by</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">nick bostrom and other swede by the way</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:11.440" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:12.799" style="s2">you know people are doing all these</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.440" end="00:18:14.960" style="s2">kinds of ray kurtz foul ideas of</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.799" end="00:18:16.720" style="s2">singularity we found all these ideas to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.960" end="00:18:18.400" style="s2">be very naive</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.720" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">compared to what actually is confronting</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.400" end="00:18:21.360" style="s2">us and not so much neither about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:22.559" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.360" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">we&#39;re really named about what it means</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.559" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">to be human</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:29.039" style="s2">so a key chapter digital libidos is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">chapter about the human constant</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.039" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">and the technological variable and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.440" end="00:18:35.200" style="s2">is fundamental to</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:37.039" style="s2">maya and john&#39;s philosophy is that if</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.200" end="00:18:38.559" style="s2">you look at human beings over the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.039" end="00:18:40.960" style="s2">200 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.559" end="00:18:42.799" style="s2">very little has changed our brains are</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.960" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">about the same size they were 200 000</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.799" end="00:18:44.880" style="s2">years ago</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">sorry but there&#39;s been no real</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.880" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">development to humans and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:51.440" style="s2">that is that even if you plan</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.640" end="00:18:52.720" style="s2">to improve on ourselves and our genetic</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.440" end="00:18:54.320" style="s2">equality</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.720" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">the problem is that we all get drunk and</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.320" end="00:18:57.520" style="s2"> the wrong person on a friday night</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:18:59.039" style="s2">and then we breed and we have more</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.520" end="00:19:00.320" style="s2">children and usually it&#39;s rather the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.039" end="00:19:01.280" style="s2">most stupid people are more children</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">than the smart ones</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:04.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the bad news but that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:07.039" style="s2">it works so at best</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.960" end="00:19:08.080" style="s2">humans can be considered to be constant</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.039" end="00:19:10.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.080" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">humans can be studied much more deeply</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.080" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">than we&#39;ve done in the past</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:16.799" style="s2">and the reason for that is precisely</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:18.799" style="s2">because of the human technological</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.799" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">what do you mean by that well we all</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:26.320" style="s2">know by now</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">that we produce data</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.320" end="00:19:30.559" style="s2">we all know that data is collected huge</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">data centers</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.559" end="00:19:34.000" style="s2">most of these tech jobs are collecting</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:35.039" style="s2">enormous amounts of data and they hardly</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.000" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">even know what they&#39;re going to do with</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.039" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">the data yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">okay but they figured out they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:40.320" style="s2">to be doing incredibly powerful things</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">with the data</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.320" end="00:19:43.679" style="s2">if you use google maps or waste when you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">drive you get an experience of what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.679" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">actually can start doing with people</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:50.559" style="s2">once you get their data you know three</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">years ago you would go to say munich</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.559" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">and you would look for a restaurant and</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">you get 10 different suggestions usually</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">the 10 restaurants that were closest to</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">your ass</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">these days you get three suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">because google will have eliminated</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:03.200" style="s2">seven of the suggestions</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:04.400" style="s2">because they know that you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.200" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">to go there anyway because they know you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.400" end="00:20:06.320" style="s2">well enough and they know your budget</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">well enough</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.320" end="00:20:10.480" style="s2">and you know the kind of taste you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:11.760" style="s2">well enough that you would go to</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.480" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">those seven restaurants so they might as</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:15.120" style="s2">well give you three but in reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:16.720" style="s2">google probably already know which</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.120" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">restaurant you&#39;re gonna go to anyway</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.720" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">so they might as well book the table for</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">you and you go to that restaurant and</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:23.600" style="s2">have a nice meal but they will also take</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:24.799" style="s2">the profit from the restaurant in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.600" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.799" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">that&#39;s why tech giants will make tons of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:31.039" style="s2">money because they got the data</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">but if you ask a philosopher like myself</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.039" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">or john cena quest</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:38.640" style="s2">what we want to do if we get access to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:40.640" style="s2">data we would love to do anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.640" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">so the discovery we had before we wrote</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">is that we will actually know more about</p>

<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">anybody has done before in history we</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">will not just have to sit and guess</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:52.559" style="s2">like sigmund freud did successfully or</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:53.280" style="s2">guests like mercia eliad did</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.559" end="00:20:54.960" style="s2">successfully</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.280" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">guess like even jordan peterson or</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.960" end="00:20:58.559" style="s2">cameron pogba down when they studied</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">you know the history of art or the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.559" end="00:21:03.360" style="s2">history of culture no we will know</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">because we will have data from history</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">on a level we&#39;ve never seen before</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.559" style="s2">that data will be collected and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">processed on a level never seen before</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.559" end="00:21:12.559" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole new science now date</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:14.159" style="s2">anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.559" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">and the data will not only be the sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.159" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">of data that you and i produce through</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">our</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">everyday behaviors which you can&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:22.559" style="s2">it the data will also come from</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:24.159" style="s2">the genetic makeup of human beings so we</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.559" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">will understand that there are different</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.159" end="00:21:25.840" style="s2">men</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:27.919" style="s2">and different women and things in</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.840" end="00:21:28.960" style="s2">between men and women that exist in</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.919" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">human society</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.960" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">and we can start tracing the behavior in</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">a contemporary setting</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">and because we get the data from that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">contemporary setting</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:39.919" style="s2">we can then start applying it in human</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:42.880" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.919" end="00:21:43.679" style="s2">and will be the first thing we do we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.880" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">probably go</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.679" end="00:21:46.720" style="s2">deeper into history to understand</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:50.400" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.720" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">as historical beings that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.400" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">john and i set out to do</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:55.440" style="s2">this is the foundation of the new</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:57.760" style="s2">trilogy so</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.440" end="00:21:58.880" style="s2">while we were experts on technology and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.760" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">the relationship between man and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.880" end="00:22:01.200" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">when we started the neutrality we</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.200" end="00:22:05.919" style="s2">started focusing more on man</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">using technology to understand human</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.919" end="00:22:09.320" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:11.120" style="s2">this is a philosophy we call</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.320" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">socio-analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.120" end="00:22:14.400" style="s2">and i think salvation should also call</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">his work social analysis rather than</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:17.919" style="s2">psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.200" style="s2">just like psychology attempts to be a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.919" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">social science</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.200" end="00:22:22.360" style="s2">and sociology attempts to be social</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.360" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">psychoanalysis is an art form not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:29.200" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.080" style="s2">and in the same way social analysis is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.200" end="00:22:33.400" style="s2">an art form</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.080" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">not a science since sociology tries to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.400" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">understand how human beings operate and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:41.280" style="s2">build their societies</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.240" end="00:22:42.880" style="s2">therefore sociology we could instead do</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.280" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">social analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.880" end="00:22:46.080" style="s2">so that&#39;s the term we launched before we</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.559" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">started writing this trilogy it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.080" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">well let&#39;s do social analysis what it</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:52.880" style="s2">and we realized that there were some</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:55.600" style="s2">really you know cool</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.880" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">scientists out there who also saw the</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">data anthropology would be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">we even talked to google ideas they</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:03.520" style="s2">realized that date anthropology would be</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:05.280" style="s2">interesting for them</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">who wouldn&#39;t want to know how human</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.280" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">beings actually operate</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">especially in the social arena so</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">for example there&#39;s a whole new science</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">called social ontology</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">social ontology is the origin of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">human species as a social creature</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">this is the study the original nomadic</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.000" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">that apparently existed for some 60 to</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.000" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">70 000</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:31.120" style="s2">years before human beings finally</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">decided to settle</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.120" end="00:23:35.600" style="s2">and we only decided to settle some 8 000</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">years ago because some lazy woman who</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.600" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">was still</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">sexually attractive managed to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">her ass somewhere in mesopotamia and</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">decide she wanted to create the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:44.720" style="s2">permanent settlement</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:46.559" style="s2">and simply because with written language</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.720" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">around we could create the first</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.559" end="00:23:50.240" style="s2">permanent settlement</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">that became the beginning of cattle</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.240" end="00:23:55.039" style="s2">racing and eventually farming</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:57.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s civilization as we know it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.039" end="00:23:58.880" style="s2">but before that fat woman sat down and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.200" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">refused to move and people stayed with</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.880" end="00:24:01.919" style="s2">her and were the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">nomadic tribe they decided to become a</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.919" end="00:24:04.559" style="s2">settled community</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">before that happened some eight thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.559" end="00:24:08.480" style="s2">years ago we actually walked around for</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:11.760" style="s2">at least sixty to seventy thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.480" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">and almost our entire genetic makeup was</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.760" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">shaped</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">during those sixty to seventy thousand</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:18.960" style="s2">so if you understand human beings social</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">biologically</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.960" end="00:24:22.400" style="s2">you understand how our genetic makeup</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:24.880" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.400" end="00:24:25.600" style="s2">during those 70 000 years to sort of fit</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.880" end="00:24:27.679" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.600" end="00:24:29.120" style="s2">in some kind of tribal environment and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.679" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">fit in with other human beings</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.120" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">we can orientate ourselves we&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">go back and actually do social ontology</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">which is just one way of application of</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:41.200" style="s2">data anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:43.520" style="s2">so this is what john and i set out to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.200" end="00:24:45.360" style="s2">we started working with scientists</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.520" end="00:24:47.200" style="s2">but we wanted to move into the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.360" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">contemporary society we have today</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.200" end="00:24:51.520" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to cut it short about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:53.360" style="s2">first book because it&#39;s a separate book</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.520" end="00:24:54.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s now in translation to german</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:57.200" style="s2">the first book is called</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.480" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">synthesism creating god in the internet</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.200" end="00:24:59.919" style="s2">age</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">now why did we write a book on religion</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.919" end="00:25:03.279" style="s2">and on god</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:04.720" style="s2">the first thing we do because people</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:07.760" style="s2">orientate themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.720" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">according to some shared value</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.760" end="00:25:12.320" style="s2">and the shared value is god in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">that if you allow yourself to think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.320" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">god doesn&#39;t necessarily have to exist</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">and god doesn&#39;t necessarily have to have</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">created the world or be outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:20.159" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">but god could be something that still</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.159" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">has to come then you would understand</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:26.400" style="s2">that the way technology is used as human</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:28.640" style="s2">beings over the past thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.400" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">is probably technology one day wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.640" end="00:25:31.679" style="s2">take over the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:33.799" style="s2">at least technology has developed and</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.679" end="00:25:36.440" style="s2">progressed over the last 10 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.799" end="00:25:39.200" style="s2">undeniably so in the last 100 years</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.440" end="00:25:40.880" style="s2">undeniably so the last five to ten years</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.200" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">so technology is apparently moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.880" end="00:25:44.640" style="s2">towards some kind of singularity</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:45.840" style="s2">we could just call the singularity god</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.640" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">for analysis something we put in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.840" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">and this is a god that is still to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:52.320" style="s2">created by us</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.480" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">or if the god of creativity like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.320" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">god is called syntheos theologically</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:56.640" style="s2">speaking</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:25:59.279" style="s2">so that explains how we wrote that book</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.640" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">first we laid the groundwork</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.279" end="00:26:04.880" style="s2">we said metaphysics about the void it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">about the world it&#39;s unity the universe</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.880" end="00:26:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s about multiplicity</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">and it&#39;s also about what we can&#39;t create</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.240" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">in the future so we wrote that book it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">a foundational work</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">to prepare for digital libido and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:18.400" style="s2">eventually we&#39;re going to finish it all</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">off with the new narrative which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.400" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">going to be the third book the work at</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">the moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">but where does digital libido come into</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:25.120" style="s2">the picture</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:26.960" style="s2">well it comes into the picture because</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.120" end="00:26:28.400" style="s2">we got to understand the paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.960" end="00:26:30.320" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.400" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">but starting from a deeper understanding</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.320" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">of what it means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">so exactly the sort of chaos we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.720" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">seeing now</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">that&#39;s you know hit us so quickly post</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">corona europe and post corona america</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:44.799" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:46.640" style="s2">is what we talk about in the book so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.799" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">book is already prophetic only a couple</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.640" end="00:26:50.159" style="s2">years after it was written</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:52.159" style="s2">it&#39;s published in 2018 you can already</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.159" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">see many of these ideas in the book</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.159" end="00:26:56.640" style="s2">are all over the place one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">for example wokeness</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.640" end="00:27:00.720" style="s2">so the word woke did not exist you wrote</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:02.720" style="s2">the book three years ago</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.720" end="00:27:04.559" style="s2">it only came along the last year but we</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.720" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">write about what we call the rosso and</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.559" end="00:27:08.000" style="s2">lynch mob and what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">essentially is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.000" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">when there&#39;s no sense of direction to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:14.320" style="s2">given society</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:16.320" style="s2">meaning the future can only be chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.320" end="00:27:18.000" style="s2">which is exactly the sort of society how</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.320" end="00:27:18.480" style="s2">when you go through a dramatic paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.000" end="00:27:20.159" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.480" end="00:27:22.480" style="s2">because what happened is that all the</p>

<p begin="00:27:22.480" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">politics is collapsing has become ironic</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:30.080" style="s2">do you really care whether america</p>

<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">and in this case it&#39;s not even elites</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:21.839" style="s2">that have more money and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">than the underclass house this time it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:37.440" style="s2">so what happens if you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">internet first as a flat structure</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.440" end="00:34:41.200" style="s2">everything is flat everybody has access</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.560" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">structure of 5 billion people</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:56.480" style="s2">but very very quickly you get some nodes</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:57.119" style="s2">in this network you get some people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.480" end="00:34:59.920" style="s2">have what</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.119" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">great infotainment value maybe a group</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.960" end="00:35:10.960" style="s2">after a while they&#39;re so attractive that</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">everybody wants to jump on board</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.960" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">and when that happens you got to</p>

<p begin="00:35:58.240" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">more than anything that&#39;s how we</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.000" end="00:36:04.079" style="s2">disqualify the idea that this is a</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.079" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">and instead john and i say it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.079" style="s2">now so where will all the losers go but</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.079" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">always did throughout history is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:17.920" style="s2">they took whatever ideology they could</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">have from the past</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.920" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">that suited their interests and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">they went after the winners</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what culture does</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:29.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s a lynch mob it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:36:29.680" end="00:36:33.760" style="s2">so the winners the digitally liberal</p>

<p begin="00:36:33.760" end="00:36:38.240" style="s2">will create their own networks they will</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.560" end="00:36:39.280" style="s2">then walk off with their networks and</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.240" end="00:36:41.200" style="s2">make exodus</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.280" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">out of the society we have today i say</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.359" end="00:36:53.839" style="s2">to places like dubai and singapore</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.599" end="00:36:55.680" style="s2">this even our plans and small republics</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.839" end="00:36:57.040" style="s2">in europe like the czech republic in</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.680" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">estonia and slovenia</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.040" end="00:37:00.160" style="s2">that maybe these small countries are the</p>

<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:04.400" style="s2">because they don&#39;t have to deal with</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">and since the vast majority of humanity</p>

<p begin="00:37:15.920" end="00:37:20.480" style="s2">a lot of people and therefore they</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:21.119" style="s2">therefore go for what nietzsche call the</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.119" end="00:37:25.520" style="s2">sentiment and and one of the chapters</p>

<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">so you can read that chapter to deeply</p>

<p begin="00:37:39.200" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">and what lynch mobs do</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.040" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">is that because they can never win the</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">argument when it comes to the substance</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.320" style="s2">of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:51.520" style="s2">they will attack you for the tonality</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.320" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">and the etiquette</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.520" end="00:37:54.960" style="s2">they will attack you for your word use</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">they will say you must not use the</p>

<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:37:59.119" style="s2">they will attack you for your etiquette</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.440" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">they will say you&#39;re rude and you&#39;re a</p>

<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">so they objectify you they will tell you</p>

<p begin="00:38:13.599" end="00:38:17.599" style="s2">so you can no longer speak which</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.359" end="00:38:20.720" style="s2">essentially is to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.599" end="00:38:23.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s all life now happens online</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.720" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">then being the platform is nothing but a</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:30.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re doing all over the place and</p>

<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:34.720" style="s2">use to do that and those platforms are</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.720" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">the platforms that are dying so before</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:41.839" style="s2">politics dies before academia dies</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.599" style="s2">before mass media dies before old</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.839" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">industry dies this is about i&#39;m talking</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.599" end="00:38:46.160" style="s2">about marketing departments you know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:48.480" style="s2">talking about pr</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.160" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">departments now at big companies they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.480" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">gone political now as well they&#39;re also</p>

<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">so the wolf people are moving into all</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.599" end="00:38:56.800" style="s2">of these different old institutions have</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:38:57.359" style="s2">tried to milk whatever and just left</p>

<p begin="00:38:57.359" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">why can they take over these old</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.839" end="00:39:03.280" style="s2">institutions because</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:05.200" style="s2">no necrocrats no winners in the society</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.280" end="00:39:06.640" style="s2">none of the digitally liberal people</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.200" end="00:39:09.280" style="s2">will be there</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.640" end="00:39:10.800" style="s2">why because they&#39;re all online and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.280" end="00:39:12.560" style="s2">are they doing online they&#39;re creating</p>

<p begin="00:39:28.480" end="00:39:32.960" style="s2">increasingly see in autocracy rising</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.200" end="00:39:34.640" style="s2">some people are focused on quality which</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.960" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">can be very smart you focus on few</p>

<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:38.800" style="s2">but you reach people who will rise very</p>

<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.480" style="s2">or you focus on the quantity which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:44.400" style="s2">fine too and then you basically mass</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.480" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">educate people how to become successful</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.400" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">online and get</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.280" end="00:39:53.119" style="s2">because they realize that you use the</p>

<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">how do they do that due to two ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.960" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">they do it through capitalism because we</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.760" end="00:41:31.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s called ads and at least google</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">separated the ads and we did google</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.200" end="00:41:34.240" style="s2">search</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.680" style="s2">we had the algorithm free and open so we</p>

<p begin="00:41:35.680" end="00:41:37.920" style="s2">search essentially we want the quality</p>

<p begin="00:42:03.520" end="00:42:06.480" style="s2">gets so disgusted with google search</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.119" end="00:42:07.359" style="s2">because it&#39;s apparently becoming</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.480" end="00:42:10.079" style="s2">commercialized</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.359" end="00:42:11.359" style="s2">and we know that commercialism will</p>

<p begin="00:42:11.359" end="00:42:14.800" style="s2">will destroy the free and open algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.119" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">and there&#39;s a word we have for that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.800" end="00:42:20.640" style="s2">call it spam</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">and we hate spam that&#39;s why having an ad</p>

<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">and having a spam filter today is the</p>

<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:29.599" style="s2">that we see today in the internet</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.599" end="00:42:33.040" style="s2">now the other thing they try to do when</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.359" end="00:42:34.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t have money and throw money at</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.040" end="00:42:37.119" style="s2">things and try to desperately get your</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.119" end="00:42:40.160" style="s2">is that they try to manipulate you</p>

<p begin="00:42:40.160" end="00:42:43.599" style="s2">and that&#39;s how political manipulations</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.920" end="00:42:45.040" style="s2">of world culture is about today</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.599" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">and this is what we write about due to</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.040" end="00:42:48.319" style="s2">libido is bound to happen was that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:51.839" style="s2">have a reaction</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.319" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">from a political resentful</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:03.119" style="s2">they just don&#39;t have the talent for it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.000" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.119" end="00:43:07.119" style="s2">all they do is that they got facebook</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.160" style="s2">threads where they and moan and</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.119" end="00:43:09.680" style="s2">grow</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.160" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">and that&#39;s what they did the entire</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.680" end="00:43:12.960" style="s2">2010s for 10 years we had the trolls</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:15.119" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.960" end="00:43:17.119" style="s2">or the facebook threads everywhere and</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.119" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">the people then would get into these</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.119" end="00:43:20.720" style="s2">environments create their own echo</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:23.280" style="s2">chambers and they would look for an</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.720" end="00:43:24.480" style="s2">object that they could go after an</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.280" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">abject is</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.480" end="00:43:29.440" style="s2">what a lynch mob creates as an outside</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:31.520" style="s2">they can run after and kill</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.440" end="00:43:33.040" style="s2">to release the social tension within the</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.520" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">lens plot</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.040" end="00:43:36.160" style="s2">hitler used it with the germans he</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:37.599" style="s2">called it a jew</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.160" end="00:43:39.200" style="s2">stalin used it with the russians he</p>

<p begin="00:43:39.200" end="00:43:42.160" style="s2">mao used it essentially and said that</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:43.440" style="s2">you&#39;re going to go and kill your parent</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.160" end="00:43:45.440" style="s2">because your parents are now become</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.440" end="00:43:47.520" style="s2">objectified so they&#39;re abjects</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.440" end="00:43:49.440" style="s2">so the abject is there all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.520" end="00:43:50.160" style="s2">whenever somebody&#39;s being the platform</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.440" end="00:43:52.480" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.160" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">whenever somebody is being accused of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.480" end="00:43:55.440" style="s2">being politically inappropriate</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:57.520" style="s2">and therefore should be culturally</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.440" end="00:43:58.240" style="s2">counseled whenever the war culture does</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.520" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">that today</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.240" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">they do it with the same argument all</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">the time these people must be removed</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">and what they do is they objectify the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.040" style="s2">people that make them abject and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:07.599" style="s2">can then attack them as much as they</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.040" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.599" end="00:44:11.440" style="s2">and then release the social tension</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:13.599" style="s2">after the object is finally the platform</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.440" end="00:44:15.440" style="s2">but they will pretty much very soon</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.599" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">probably go after another object</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.440" end="00:44:18.560" style="s2">because they&#39;re never pleased why</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">they&#39;re never pleased because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.560" end="00:44:21.119" style="s2">get access to the power they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:22.800" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.119" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">ways to be attractive in the online</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.800" end="00:44:26.319" style="s2">world all they can do is to use the old</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">platforms to attack you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.319" end="00:44:31.200" style="s2">so we&#39;re seeing a lot of this happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">today and digital libido explains it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.200" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">now for example if you follow jordan</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:36.560" style="s2">peterson</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:38.400" style="s2">he&#39;s the pop version of the same idea he</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.560" end="00:44:40.240" style="s2">experienced this very well i mean i</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.400" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">highly recommend you to read his books</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.240" end="00:44:42.960" style="s2">maps of meaning was a fantastic worker</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">in the 90s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.960" end="00:44:46.000" style="s2">and he&#39;s writing these books about how</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:47.359" style="s2">you&#39;re going to take these steps in</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.000" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">your life you know to take care of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.359" end="00:44:50.400" style="s2">yourself and to take some responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:52.000" style="s2">to be proper grown-up</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.400" end="00:44:55.200" style="s2">because you write about it digital</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.000" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">libido is that it&#39;s the infantilization</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.200" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">that is the major problem contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">society</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">an infantilized adult who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.599" end="00:45:06.160" style="s2">not an adult who&#39;s not a proper man or a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:06.720" style="s2">woman who&#39;s just an infantalized boy or</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.160" end="00:45:08.880" style="s2">a girl</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.720" end="00:45:10.000" style="s2">in a grown-up man&#39;s or grown-up woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.880" end="00:45:12.960" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.000" end="00:45:15.119" style="s2">is becoming exactly the sort of crybaby</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.960" end="00:45:18.400" style="s2">then becomes the central wall culture</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.119" end="00:45:20.160" style="s2">so what what did the libido does is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.400" end="00:45:21.920" style="s2">what jordan peterson has talked about</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.160" end="00:45:23.200" style="s2">what camille paglas talked about in</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.920" end="00:45:24.720" style="s2">america was douglas</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.200" end="00:45:26.240" style="s2">murray talks about and writes</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.119" end="00:45:31.040" style="s2">did it delivered as the more profound</p>

<p begin="00:45:31.040" end="00:45:34.800" style="s2">that discusses the same thing and goes</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:36.480" style="s2">to the depth and understands what what</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.800" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">are crowds</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.480" end="00:45:40.960" style="s2">what kind of crowds are there okay there</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:43.440" style="s2">are beautiful swarms when people</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">creatively collaborate but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:46.240" style="s2">lynch mobs</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">and these mobs go after you and they</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.240" end="00:45:49.119" style="s2">kill you and they&#39;re blood thirsty</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.000" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">now what is the difference between the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:53.520" style="s2">swarm of the mob and the swarm can</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">eventually lead to the exodus into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.520" end="00:45:56.720" style="s2">new</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">whereas the mob will not want the new at</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.720" end="00:46:00.800" style="s2">all rather the mob</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:03.839" style="s2">was significant for the mob is that when</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.800" end="00:46:06.240" style="s2">it has an accusation against you</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.839" end="00:46:07.760" style="s2">the mob will tell you that you cannot</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.240" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">you can only repent</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.760" end="00:46:12.480" style="s2">you cannot be forgiven so the lynch mob</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.720" style="s2">will tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.480" end="00:46:16.720" style="s2">oh here&#39;s an accusation there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.720" end="00:46:19.760" style="s2">for you to actually argue against it</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.720" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">we call you racist or a bigot well how</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.760" end="00:46:24.160" style="s2">do you argue against that</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">you can&#39;t okay so they go after you they</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:27.119" style="s2">also say</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">there&#39;s no way out of the accusation</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.119" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">there&#39;s no end</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:31.680" style="s2">date to the acquisition there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:34.240" style="s2">for you to repay</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.680" end="00:46:35.119" style="s2">the debt apparently you get because of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.240" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">the accusation</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.119" end="00:46:39.359" style="s2">so they will take any accusation they</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">want for example it can be that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.359" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">women are fantastic men are nasty</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">that was me too essentially right so you</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:48.400" style="s2">can make these accusations that cannot</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.319" style="s2">be met you can&#39;t argue against them</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:52.640" style="s2">but please remember these accusations</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.319" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">are apparently there to be valid for or</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.640" end="00:46:59.920" style="s2">eternity so they&#39;re clearly there</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:02.079" style="s2">to either milk you for the rest of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.920" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">life or to kill you</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.079" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what the lunch mob wants with you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.000" style="s2">that what the linger wants to do with</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">you is either to milk you</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.000" end="00:47:09.440" style="s2">or to kill you they have no interest in</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:11.440" style="s2">you whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.440" end="00:47:13.440" style="s2">and being resurrected and getting back</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.440" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">up on your feet and eventually joining</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.440" end="00:47:15.920" style="s2">them or whatever you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">and why would you join a lunchbox to</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.920" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">begin with why do you want to join a</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:20.000" style="s2">bunch of losers right</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">you want to go and join the winners</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.000" end="00:47:22.640" style="s2">don&#39;t you you want to be in the winners</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">club not the losers club</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.640" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">but we&#39;re already now seeing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:29.520" style="s2">because we&#39;re all online</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:31.760" style="s2">and we&#39;re seeing a small minority of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.520" end="00:47:32.640" style="s2">people who take on nether practical</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.760" end="00:47:35.359" style="s2">qualities</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.640" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">and become the winners we explore this</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.359" end="00:47:37.760" style="s2">in the later book explored in this book</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:39.920" style="s2">too we have</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.760" end="00:47:41.280" style="s2">the informationalists who replace the</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:42.559" style="s2">old capitalists because they deal with</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.280" end="00:47:44.559" style="s2">the information and data</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.559" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">we have the sensocrats to replace the</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.559" end="00:47:48.160" style="s2">old politicians because</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:50.079" style="s2">since socrates is now happening why</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.160" end="00:47:51.760" style="s2">would you vote every four years when you</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.079" end="00:47:52.720" style="s2">actually vote every second with your</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.760" end="00:47:54.079" style="s2">smartphone</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.720" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">that opens up the whole area of</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.079" end="00:47:58.319" style="s2">cinesocracy would that be a dictatorship</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:47:59.520" style="s2">or could that be something more plural</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.319" end="00:48:01.280" style="s2">and democratic</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.520" end="00:48:02.720" style="s2">big questions to be answered we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">working with them for the next book and</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.720" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">we&#39;re involved in dialogues and those</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:06.880" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:08.480" style="s2">and also there&#39;s like a new digital</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.880" end="00:48:10.800" style="s2">priesthood because</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.480" end="00:48:12.319" style="s2">a group we love a lot john and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.800" end="00:48:14.160" style="s2">probably because we belong to it</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.319" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the group that we call the shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.160" end="00:48:18.480" style="s2">cast and here&#39;s where it gets</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:21.599" style="s2">interesting beyond a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.480" end="00:48:23.200" style="s2">because we do social ontology because we</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.599" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">do date anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.200" end="00:48:26.640" style="s2">because we know a lot more about humans</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.319" style="s2">they&#39;ve every day before</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.640" end="00:48:30.559" style="s2">we also know history much better than we</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.319" end="00:48:33.119" style="s2">did before we know big history</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.559" end="00:48:34.800" style="s2">we know deep history we even know that</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.119" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to look for the phallus</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.800" end="00:48:38.480" style="s2">to direct us and give us order out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.480" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">then the phallus also needs to be looked</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:43.119" style="s2">for in history which we call the root of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:45.280" style="s2">the phallus</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.119" end="00:48:46.240" style="s2">it&#39;s an expression that john and i use</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.280" end="00:48:47.920" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.240" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">we can look into history much deeper</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.920" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">than we did before and what do we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">discover we do we discover a map</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:54.559" style="s2">according to which people orientate</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:58.000" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.559" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">this whole new area of both philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.000" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">and science is something called tribal</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:03.520" style="s2">mapping</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">so the travel map you see in digital</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.520" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">libido is a map you could put yourself</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">on that&#39;s where it gets personal in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">book so the travel map will consist of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:14.319" style="s2">matriarchy at the center</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">which we call the inner circuit and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.319" end="00:49:19.520" style="s2">would then have a patriarchy</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:22.319" style="s2">outside called the outer circuit</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.520" end="00:49:24.079" style="s2">so most men the vast majority men are</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.319" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">comfortable being regular heterosexual</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.079" end="00:49:26.480" style="s2">guys you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">they want to do men&#39;s work and be proud</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.480" end="00:49:30.079" style="s2">of being men and they want to work hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">and deliver to the women or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.079" end="00:49:34.400" style="s2">that&#39;s what most men like to do like 92</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:36.319" style="s2">percent of women like to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.400" end="00:49:38.079" style="s2">according to the data then we put them</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.319" end="00:49:39.920" style="s2">in the outer circuit then the vast</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.079" end="00:49:41.520" style="s2">majority of women are heterosexual women</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">and they love to work hard and</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:44.559" style="s2">you know do the right thing in life but</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:46.800" style="s2">they also love to give birth to children</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.559" end="00:49:48.160" style="s2">will be part of the reproduction process</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.800" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">because they&#39;re part of the reproduction</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.160" end="00:49:52.079" style="s2">process which is still the last time i</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:53.839" style="s2">checked is the female monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.079" end="00:49:56.000" style="s2">that means the inner circuit is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.839" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">center of the tribe because without the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.000" end="00:49:58.720" style="s2">inner circuit there can be no</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.280" style="s2">reproduction and without the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.720" end="00:50:04.480" style="s2">reproduction the tribe cannot survive</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.280" end="00:50:06.480" style="s2">so the fundamental idea of a tribe</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.480" end="00:50:08.160" style="s2">something we call nomidology is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.480" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">that men need to serve women</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.160" end="00:50:11.440" style="s2">so that women want to give birth to</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.599" end="00:50:12.400" style="s2">babies if women don&#39;t want to give birth</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.440" end="00:50:14.800" style="s2">to babies</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.400" end="00:50:16.400" style="s2">society falls apart so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.800" end="00:50:18.000" style="s2">matriarchal power which is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.400" end="00:50:18.640" style="s2">negotiating power between the older</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.000" end="00:50:20.800" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.640" end="00:50:22.720" style="s2">and the younger men who are horny on how</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.800" end="00:50:23.359" style="s2">you negotiate the sexual ritual in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.720" end="00:50:25.760" style="s2">tribe</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.359" end="00:50:27.680" style="s2">now please note here though if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.760" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">two border areas</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.680" end="00:50:31.119" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about it there&#39;s first</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">euboria between the outer circle and the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.119" end="00:50:35.520" style="s2">inner circuit</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">that&#39;s when the androgynous cast lives</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.520" end="00:50:38.960" style="s2">androgynous cast is about</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.119" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">four percent of the population according</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.960" end="00:50:42.640" style="s2">to date of topology</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">there&#39;s four percent left though and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.640" end="00:50:46.720" style="s2">that will be called the shamanic caste</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:48.000" style="s2">and the shamanic cast are outside the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.720" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">outer circuit</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.000" end="00:50:51.200" style="s2">they&#39;re basically walking back and forth</p>

<p begin="00:50:51.200" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">tribes and many historians like jar</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">diamond</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:58.640" style="s2">mercy eliad and others have done</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">anthropology on you know tribes in new</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.640" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">guinea and brazil they discovered</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:03.599" style="s2">there are these people who put on weird</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">costumes and walk in and out in between</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.599" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">tribes even in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">battlefields</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">shamans okay so the shamanoid</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.839" style="s2">personalities are people who are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.680" style="s2">very comfortable inside regular society</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.839" end="00:51:17.760" style="s2">they&#39;re basically the outcasts</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.680" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">we probably pull most of our scapegoats</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.760" end="00:51:21.599" style="s2">and people we want to you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:23.280" style="s2">use as objects from that crowd too so</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.599" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">the shaman odds live a pretty hard and</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.280" end="00:51:27.760" style="s2">rough life and take tons of risks</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:29.440" style="s2">but they&#39;re the only go-betweens between</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.760" end="00:51:31.200" style="s2">the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:32.480" style="s2">now if you&#39;re the go-between between the</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.200" end="00:51:33.599" style="s2">tribe and other tribes and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.480" end="00:51:34.839" style="s2">basically if you met someone from</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.599" end="00:51:36.720" style="s2">another time you would kill them in an</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.839" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">instant right</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.720" end="00:51:39.760" style="s2">because they&#39;d be on your territory what</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:41.280" style="s2">would they do there</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.760" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">if they weren&#39;t there to take your food</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.280" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">away from you or steal your wife or kill</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:45.440" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:47.200" style="s2">you would kill them right not shamans</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.440" end="00:51:48.720" style="s2">the shamanic people walk back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.200" end="00:51:50.720" style="s2">between cultures</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.720" end="00:51:52.480" style="s2">easily and are allowed to because</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.720" end="00:51:54.880" style="s2">they&#39;re just a bit crazy aren&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.480" end="00:51:57.119" style="s2">well if you have a monopoly on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.880" end="00:51:58.400" style="s2">communication without the tribes</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.119" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">then you have a monopoly on the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.400" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">communication with the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:04.640" style="s2">that means it&#39;s not only the horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:05.680" style="s2">communication with the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.640" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">that is monopoly</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.680" end="00:52:08.800" style="s2">but also the vertical communication with</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:10.559" style="s2">the outside world</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.800" end="00:52:12.880" style="s2">that means religion starts with the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.559" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">shamanic caste meaning you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.880" end="00:52:16.559" style="s2">shaman</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:18.720" style="s2">and have the shame and talk to the gods</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.559" end="00:52:20.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you get a narrative and a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.720" end="00:52:22.079" style="s2">story for the entire tribe</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.400" end="00:52:23.440" style="s2">now what we&#39;re doing in the book</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.079" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2">essentially we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.440" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">this is a whole new field of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">we&#39;re basically philosophic</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:31.920" style="s2">exploring travel mapping we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">telling you look if you like us have</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.920" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">access to google</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">ideas and their data google computers</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">around the world or data centers and</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:40.079" style="s2">so you have access to tons of data the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:41.359" style="s2">first thing you&#39;ll probably do to find</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.079" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">out what it means to be human is you</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.359" end="00:52:44.720" style="s2">would go</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">back to the origin of humanity going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.720" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">the 60 000 years of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:50.960" style="s2">nomadic tribes that shaped us you would</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">find a tribal map</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.960" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">and you would love to put yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:56.640" style="s2">your specific male</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:57.359" style="s2">or female or androgynous or shamanide</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.640" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">archetype</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.359" end="00:53:02.559" style="s2">onto that map and here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:04.400" style="s2">we need to start separating these things</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.559" end="00:53:05.119" style="s2">again we need to start separating men</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.400" end="00:53:06.400" style="s2">and women</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:08.160" style="s2">we need to start separating the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.400" end="00:53:09.599" style="s2">exclusively heterosexual people from the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.160" end="00:53:11.839" style="s2">very queer ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.599" end="00:53:13.680" style="s2">we need to celebrate androgynous but not</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.839" end="00:53:14.079" style="s2">as an ideal for the rest of society we</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.680" end="00:53:16.079" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.079" end="00:53:17.599" style="s2">all not live like rock stars and die</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.079" end="00:53:19.200" style="s2">young okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.599" end="00:53:21.119" style="s2">a lot of the mistakes are made of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.200" end="00:53:22.640" style="s2">20th century that jordan peterson also</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.119" end="00:53:23.280" style="s2">addresses that we address more deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.640" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">this book</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.280" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">are due to the fact we weren&#39;t given a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">proper travel map</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:29.920" style="s2">so that each one of us could put</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:30.960" style="s2">themselves on the map and said this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.920" end="00:53:32.880" style="s2">the kind of man</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.960" end="00:53:34.720" style="s2">or the kind of woman or the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.880" end="00:53:37.760" style="s2">queer person or the kind of shaman</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.720" end="00:53:38.880" style="s2">that i am and and this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:40.960" style="s2">at the end of the delivery this is what</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.880" end="00:53:43.040" style="s2">we want to provide and put forward</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.960" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">and just basically ask social scientists</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.040" end="00:53:45.599" style="s2">why don&#39;t you dig</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">deeper into this because if you can get</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.599" end="00:53:49.440" style="s2">a map like this for people</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.280" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">to to use as a map for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.440" end="00:53:54.000" style="s2">throughout their lives</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">so much would be gained so i think i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.000" end="00:53:58.640" style="s2">going to finish there so uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">digital libido is at the center it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.640" end="00:54:01.599" style="s2">very now now and now now because</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:02.800" style="s2">obviously a lot of the things in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.599" end="00:54:04.640" style="s2">book already happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.800" end="00:54:06.160" style="s2">way quicker than we thought because of</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.640" end="00:54:07.920" style="s2">corona that&#39;s already happening</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.160" end="00:54:09.920" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing the move to digital is</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.920" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">happening much faster people expected</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.920" end="00:54:13.200" style="s2">from digital we then go into an</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.119" style="s2">augmented world where we fix</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.200" end="00:54:17.040" style="s2">and mix digital and physical all the</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.119" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">time but we&#39;ll also see the old</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.040" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">institutions fall apart and they need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">be replaced</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:23.599" style="s2">and before the old institutions that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">used to run the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.599" end="00:54:26.960" style="s2">but they no longer can because of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">internet but before</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.960" end="00:54:31.200" style="s2">politics and academia and old industry</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:33.359" style="s2">and mass media fall apart completely</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.200" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">there will be chaos</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.359" end="00:54:36.240" style="s2">to get out of that case we need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">become enlightened and aware what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.240" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">going on</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:40.160" style="s2">and we need to create new institutions</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:42.400" style="s2">that replace</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.160" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">the old real symbolic and imaginary</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.400" end="00:54:45.520" style="s2">powers that we were used to</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:47.760" style="s2">but the only way to do that is not to</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.520" end="00:54:49.599" style="s2">save the old institutions it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.760" end="00:54:51.119" style="s2">you burned down versailles you created</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.599" end="00:54:53.440" style="s2">the new institutions when you created</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.119" end="00:54:55.200" style="s2">the republic in paris in 1789</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.440" end="00:54:57.920" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing all over again we</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.200" end="00:55:00.000" style="s2">need to out of the internet</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.920" end="00:55:01.760" style="s2">start talking to the people already</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.000" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">winners in the online world</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.760" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">from tech giants to twitter stars to</p>

<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:09.760" style="s2">and realize that these people are now</p>

<p begin="00:55:09.760" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">and we need to make them enlightened and</p>

<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:16.079" style="s2">about the power they have but we also</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.440" end="00:55:18.839" style="s2">need to</p>

<p begin="00:55:21.520" end="00:55:26.880" style="s2">is you stand up against them and say</p>

<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:47.839" style="s2">i wanted to just ask you about the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.720" end="00:56:51.119" style="s2">opinion of yours what</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.839" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">do you think there&#39;s a relation</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.119" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">between awokeness and his workness</p>

<p begin="00:57:03.359" end="00:57:09.839" style="s2">do you see there is a uh relation there</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:13.040" style="s2">that people oh yeah yeah the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.839" end="00:57:15.520" style="s2">this um what happened was that in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.040" end="00:57:17.599" style="s2">1970s the left stopped reading karl marx</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.520" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">we use a lot of marks in our exotic list</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.599" end="00:57:20.000" style="s2">and eyes so</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:21.920" style="s2">for example netocrats a very marxist</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.000" end="00:57:24.160" style="s2">book it&#39;s a book about class and class</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.920" end="00:57:25.760" style="s2">analysis of contemporary society</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.160" end="00:57:28.079" style="s2">but they stopped reading karl marx&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.760" end="00:57:29.839" style="s2">1970s because they were furious with the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.079" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">workers that the workers didn&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.839" end="00:57:32.520" style="s2">revolution</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">so they went for something called</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.520" end="00:57:36.720" style="s2">intersectionality starting in the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">intersectionality was developed as the</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.720" end="00:57:39.839" style="s2">new id</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:40.799" style="s2">of the left but if you had asked marks</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.839" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">you would have hated it</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.799" end="00:57:45.119" style="s2">because the idea was that you removed</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:47.119" style="s2">class and pretended class did not exist</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.119" end="00:57:49.359" style="s2">when in reality you should both have a</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.119" end="00:57:51.280" style="s2">class analysis of the capitalist society</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.359" end="00:57:53.760" style="s2">which is about money and wealth</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.280" end="00:57:54.559" style="s2">and an attentionist class society class</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.760" end="00:57:56.160" style="s2">analysis which</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.559" end="00:57:58.079" style="s2">john and i have developed and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.160" end="00:57:58.960" style="s2">tensions class analysis says that the</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.079" end="00:58:00.799" style="s2">internet is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.960" end="00:58:02.319" style="s2">some people the small minority winners a</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.799" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">lot of people are losers and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.319" end="00:58:05.119" style="s2">that works</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">okay so if you made the class analysis</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.119" end="00:58:08.799" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t need any of this worksheet</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:10.400" style="s2">what happened was though that was</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.799" end="00:58:11.280" style="s2">comfortable for the middle classes and</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.400" end="00:58:13.680" style="s2">the you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.280" end="00:58:15.520" style="s2">academic middle classes to sort of run</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.680" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">around with people of color and people</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.520" end="00:58:17.280" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:19.520" style="s2">different genders and different</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.280" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">orientations and all kinds of exotic</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.520" end="00:58:24.319" style="s2">shamanic looking people and pretend that</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">this was the future of the left</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.319" end="00:58:28.319" style="s2">and i think there was a terrible</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">strategic mistake in the 1980s that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.319" end="00:58:31.280" style="s2">left made both in europe and north</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.280" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">and here&#39;s how it works the way it works</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.280" end="00:58:36.640" style="s2">is that you got to find an abdi because</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to unify muslims and</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.640" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">women and homosexuals and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:42.079" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:43.680" style="s2">and all kinds of new letters you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.079" end="00:58:45.200" style="s2">even heard yet identities you must</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.680" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">remember apparently</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.200" end="00:58:48.720" style="s2">probably like 78 different pronouns or</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.040" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">something but if this</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.720" end="00:58:53.599" style="s2">this hysteria this this multiplicity</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">that no longer makes sense multiplicity</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.599" end="00:58:58.079" style="s2">for the sake of multiplicity</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:59:00.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve got to be unified with something</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.079" end="00:59:00.559" style="s2">so what the theorists like ernesto la</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.079" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">clau</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.559" end="00:59:04.160" style="s2">and chantal moof and judith batler have</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:04.880" style="s2">all said is that you got to find</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.160" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.880" end="00:59:09.280" style="s2">that unites you and the unification is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">no longer somebody within the group</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.280" end="00:59:12.319" style="s2">it has to be from outside the group so</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">it&#39;s the same way that hitler founded</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.319" end="00:59:15.200" style="s2">you you got to find an</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">abject it turned out it was very</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.200" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">comfortable for this alt</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:22.400" style="s2">left since that existed first to</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:23.119" style="s2">make the white heterosexual man the</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.400" end="00:59:24.799" style="s2">abject</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.119" end="00:59:26.319" style="s2">the problem is that the world has been</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.799" end="00:59:27.839" style="s2">robbed of white&#39;s intersexual men for</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.319" end="00:59:29.760" style="s2">the past at least 400 years</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.839" end="00:59:31.520" style="s2">true but the vast majority white</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.760" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">heterosexual men happen to be regular</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.520" end="00:59:35.359" style="s2">workers</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:37.359" style="s2">not power brokers okay but you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.359" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">comfortably put anybody with white</p>

<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:42.319" style="s2">male in the category of what you could</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">attack as much as you liked</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.319" end="00:59:47.440" style="s2">that meant the left turned against its</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:49.040" style="s2">own history the left aggressively turned</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.440" end="00:59:50.880" style="s2">against its own workers</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.040" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">those workers no longer found any</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.880" end="00:59:54.720" style="s2">response at all in the left</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:56.079" style="s2">which used to be marxist the usb pro</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.720" end="00:59:59.040" style="s2">their interests</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.079" end="01:00:00.799" style="s2">so they left where did they go of course</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.040" end="01:00:02.319" style="s2">they then became the alt-right</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.799" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">but the problem with the old tribe is</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.319" end="01:00:07.280" style="s2">just another roson lynch mob</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">john and i are not for trump or for</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.280" end="01:00:10.400" style="s2">biden or for</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:12.480" style="s2">woke or for anti-walk as things are now</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.400" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">or maybe we&#39;re anti-walk but</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.480" end="01:00:15.920" style="s2">this is just more work so the other woke</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:18.960" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.920" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">or the awoke if you like in this case is</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.960" end="01:00:23.040" style="s2">the alt-right so what did they say well</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">they say since this is now</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.040" end="01:00:27.839" style="s2">nothing else than victimhood cults and</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:28.720" style="s2">it&#39;s a competition for us the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.839" end="01:00:30.720" style="s2">victim</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:32.559" style="s2">and the biggest victim in this race gets</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.720" end="01:00:35.200" style="s2">the biggest compensation</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.559" end="01:00:36.319" style="s2">and nobody works any longer nobody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:37.839" style="s2">creative any longer</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.319" end="01:00:39.839" style="s2">nobody does anything constructive any</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.839" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">longer it&#39;s just a race to the bottom</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.839" end="01:00:44.079" style="s2">of who&#39;s the biggest victim well if</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">everybody has turned against you</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.079" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">it&#39;s only a matter of time before the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:48.400" style="s2">white heterosexual man is gonna stand up</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:53.200" style="s2">and said</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.400" end="01:00:55.119" style="s2">no i&#39;m the victim that is the alt-right</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.200" end="01:00:57.040" style="s2">so we ended up in this trap with all</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">dragon gold left and i think the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.040" end="01:00:59.599" style="s2">us sort of will pull back and retract</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:01.839" style="s2">from it</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.599" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">and look at portland oregon in 2020</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.839" end="01:01:04.720" style="s2">which we said several years ago that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:05.680" style="s2">probably the first place we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.720" end="01:01:07.280" style="s2">see an outright</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.680" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">struggle for months between the ultra</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.280" end="01:01:10.400" style="s2">and north left where they&#39;re also going</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">to get weaponized and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.400" end="01:01:13.920" style="s2">exactly what&#39;s happening in america at</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:15.680" style="s2">the moment so you see these two camps</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.920" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">the ultraviolet get weaponized and</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.680" end="01:01:18.799" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter who wins the election</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:21.440" style="s2">two months or not because whoever</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.799" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">loses at the losing side i&#39;m sure are</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.440" end="01:01:24.880" style="s2">gonna get weaponized and become more</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:26.400" style="s2">military about what they do</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.880" end="01:01:28.000" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll see if the national guard</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.400" end="01:01:29.119" style="s2">of america and the next president can</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.000" end="01:01:30.640" style="s2">stop them</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.119" end="01:01:32.160" style="s2">because otherwise america would go</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.640" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">towards civil war</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.160" end="01:01:35.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that would be my next question do</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:38.000" style="s2">you see a civil war in the foreseeable</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.760" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">future within the united states</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.000" end="01:01:41.680" style="s2">i did but here&#39;s where i have to bring</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:43.440" style="s2">another friend of us thaddeus russell</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:45.040" style="s2">and we did the podcast reason with that</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.440" end="01:01:45.440" style="s2">is correct him he said no alexander</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.040" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.440" end="01:01:50.000" style="s2">historian and whenever we&#39;ve been close</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:51.760" style="s2">to civil war of that magnitude the only</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.000" end="01:01:53.359" style="s2">civil war america had was you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.760" end="01:01:54.880" style="s2">northern states against the southern</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.359" end="01:01:56.559" style="s2">states it was essentially war about are</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.880" end="01:01:59.039" style="s2">you going to have an industrial economy</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.559" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">or a farming economy in north america</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.039" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">and they then made slavery the symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:03.920" style="s2">issue that struggled and that was a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:06.720" style="s2">civil war the northern states</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.920" end="01:02:08.240" style="s2">won america hasn&#39;t had a new civil war</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.720" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">since then this was the mid eighteen</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.240" end="01:02:10.720" style="s2">hundreds</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:12.640" style="s2">but it could have another one and that</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.720" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">was my speculation with john cenacus i</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.640" end="01:02:17.200" style="s2">said decreasing looks really bad</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:18.480" style="s2">and because every time they alt left the</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.200" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">alt-right</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.480" end="01:02:22.559" style="s2">they love each other because if they get</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:24.640" style="s2">everybody else out of the way</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.559" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">this becomes a war between the two of</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.640" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">them that&#39;s what the old stuff are</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">trying to make joe biden</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:31.440" style="s2">their candidate and they certainly got</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:33.280" style="s2">kamala harris on board</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.440" end="01:02:35.200" style="s2">so they can walk up against trump and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.280" end="01:02:36.640" style="s2">say listen even the election</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.200" end="01:02:39.200" style="s2">who&#39;s going to be the president in the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.640" end="01:02:40.480" style="s2">white house is now nothing but all track</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.200" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">versus alt left</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.480" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">all other options are dead that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:48.000" style="s2">exactly what these two</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:49.839" style="s2">camps want they want a war between the</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.000" end="01:02:51.920" style="s2">two of them and they don&#39;t mind because</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.839" end="01:02:53.760" style="s2">they&#39;re better and resentful</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.920" end="01:02:56.000" style="s2">and always which are bitter resentful</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.760" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">people have no problem at all taking two</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.000" end="01:02:59.039" style="s2">weapons</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:00.720" style="s2">it was exactly what the jacobins were</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.039" end="01:03:02.559" style="s2">the pacifists at the beginning of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.720" end="01:03:03.359" style="s2">french revolution it was exactly when</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.559" end="01:03:05.119" style="s2">the jacobins</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:06.559" style="s2">realized they were out of the power game</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.119" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">and they were losing the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.559" end="01:03:10.240" style="s2">when they suddenly turned</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:12.079" style="s2">blood thirsty and when the jacobins due</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.240" end="01:03:13.760" style="s2">to the guillotine could take overpower</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:16.000" style="s2">in france and ruled it for a few months</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.760" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">it was a bloodbath</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.000" end="01:03:19.440" style="s2">i&#39;d be very very careful with the small</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2">culture today because</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.440" end="01:03:22.640" style="s2">both the woke from the left and the walk</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.520" end="01:03:24.559" style="s2">from the right</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.640" end="01:03:25.680" style="s2">if they realize that they&#39;re beginning</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.559" end="01:03:27.520" style="s2">to lose</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.680" end="01:03:28.799" style="s2">whatever struggle they&#39;re involved with</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.520" end="01:03:30.640" style="s2">and the way they will sense it is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.799" end="01:03:31.680" style="s2">they will get less attention for what</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.640" end="01:03:33.200" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.680" end="01:03:34.960" style="s2">when they get less attention what they</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.200" end="01:03:37.440" style="s2">do they will go more</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.960" end="01:03:39.119" style="s2">militaric they will go more violent and</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.440" end="01:03:41.359" style="s2">the violence will increase</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.119" end="01:03:42.480" style="s2">now thaddeus russell says by that stage</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.359" end="01:03:44.400" style="s2">when that happens</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.480" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">the old elite and the new elite say they</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.400" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">all the lead to washington dc and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.839" end="01:03:48.000" style="s2">new elite of solid combat that would</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:49.359" style="s2">unify</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.000" end="01:03:51.039" style="s2">and create a national guard they will</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.359" end="01:03:53.119" style="s2">just blow out these two camps</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.039" end="01:03:54.799" style="s2">so america can return to peace i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.119" end="01:03:56.480" style="s2">sure thaddeus is right though but at</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.799" end="01:03:58.079" style="s2">least i&#39;m listening to his arguments and</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.480" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">i think it&#39;s between</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.079" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">that is russell&#39;s intra-american</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">understanding and the understanding we</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:05.359" style="s2">get from europe and we look at americans</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:06.240" style="s2">like wait a second you had a civil war</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.359" end="01:04:08.160" style="s2">in the past</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.240" end="01:04:10.400" style="s2">over slavery you could certainly have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.160" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">civil war over woke this time around</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.400" end="01:04:13.440" style="s2">unless we get some more civilized</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">positions now</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.440" end="01:04:17.039" style="s2">that are neither of the two sides</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.079" end="01:04:23.920" style="s2">all right perfect okay so now</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.520" end="01:04:24.799" style="s2">um my reading glasses i can read also</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.920" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">the chat channel</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.799" end="01:04:29.119" style="s2">right so we got a uh somebody who wrote</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.240" end="01:04:31.359" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.119" end="01:04:33.520" style="s2">on the chat is there anybody else who</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.359" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">wants to address or</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.520" end="01:04:37.039" style="s2">alexander or ask him something i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.400" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">it was a great</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.039" end="01:04:40.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a good question but it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:43.280" style="s2">great from miranda</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.079" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">nogale so if mara wants to get involved</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.280" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">with us that&#39;d be nice</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.760" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">okay the question is about the algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.520" end="01:04:54.799" style="s2">i can i can i can read the question</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">so everybody uh also in the future will</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.799" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">be on board on that so i read it</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:00.559" style="s2">people are mad or confused like hell and</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:02.400" style="s2">dissatisfied</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.559" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">with the alternatives they are offered</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.400" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">by the elite how can algorithms help</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:09.760" style="s2">people to understand</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:12.799" style="s2">how we got here uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.760" end="01:05:15.119" style="s2">and how the power system operates the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.799" end="01:05:16.720" style="s2">the elite would definitely resist like</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.119" end="01:05:19.039" style="s2">health for its privileges</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.720" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">and all this is priced in in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.039" end="01:05:22.079" style="s2">apocalypse</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:24.640" style="s2">or singularity of all kinds waiting next</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.079" end="01:05:28.960" style="s2">door or even in the abrahamic</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.640" end="01:05:30.559" style="s2">uh as well as uh matsudaik or our uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.960" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">religions becoming a constant war with</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.559" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">each other since three thousand years</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:36.319" style="s2">saying that what the hell is going on in</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:37.920" style="s2">the heavens</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.319" end="01:05:40.240" style="s2">that covers quite a lot of territory</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.920" end="01:05:41.920" style="s2">there uh yeah i&#39;m also very interested</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.240" end="01:05:43.440" style="s2">in in the eastern perspective and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.920" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">working a lot with that the new book</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.440" end="01:05:45.920" style="s2">actually takes the silk route as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:47.520" style="s2">starting point so</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.920" end="01:05:49.520" style="s2">you&#39;re going to get a lot of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.520" end="01:05:50.880" style="s2">raster and iranian heritage a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.520" end="01:05:51.599" style="s2">indian and chinese philosophy in the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.880" end="01:05:52.960" style="s2">next book</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.599" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure we don&#39;t start with the</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.960" end="01:05:57.039" style="s2">greeks uh you some of it is already</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:59.599" style="s2">digital libido so that answers that</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.039" end="01:06:01.440" style="s2">but okay the interesting thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.599" end="01:06:03.119" style="s2">how can algorithms help people to</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.440" end="01:06:05.839" style="s2">understand how we got here</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.119" end="01:06:07.839" style="s2">well you must understand that the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.839" end="01:06:10.960" style="s2">way for the algorithms to operate</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.839" end="01:06:11.680" style="s2">properly now is to not try to manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.960" end="01:06:13.280" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.680" end="01:06:14.960" style="s2">because you once you get into the</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.280" end="01:06:16.319" style="s2">manipulation game</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.960" end="01:06:18.079" style="s2">you try to politicize the algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.319" end="01:06:19.920" style="s2">like the others should be nudged in a</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.079" end="01:06:20.799" style="s2">certain way because certain things are</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.920" end="01:06:23.680" style="s2">desirable</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.799" end="01:06:26.000" style="s2">you become the tyrant that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.680" end="01:06:28.160" style="s2">what authoritarian power does today</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.000" end="01:06:29.680" style="s2">and this is the similarity between the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.160" end="01:06:32.400" style="s2">chinese communist party</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.680" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">and between woke activists in california</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.400" end="01:06:35.440" style="s2">that&#39;s i&#39;m terrified of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:37.440" style="s2">at the tech giants at the moment because</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.440" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">i know from inside google and facebook</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.440" end="01:06:40.640" style="s2">there are a lot of people who want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:43.200" style="s2">politicize that environment</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.640" end="01:06:45.039" style="s2">and they want to redirect the algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.200" end="01:06:45.520" style="s2">and it&#39;s happening already i mean if you</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.039" end="01:06:47.440" style="s2">tap</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.520" end="01:06:49.760" style="s2">marriage onto google search you</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.440" end="01:06:51.920" style="s2">immediately get a black gay couple</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.760" end="01:06:53.440" style="s2">like if you you you must not be racist</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.920" end="01:06:55.280" style="s2">and you must not be anti-gay and</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.440" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">therefore they throw that picture into</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.280" end="01:06:58.240" style="s2">your face even if your algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:00.240" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have done that if you had a</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.240" end="01:07:01.839" style="s2">freedom open algorithm and</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.240" end="01:07:04.079" style="s2">this is where we need to stay out of it</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.839" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">we need to just resist</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.079" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">infiltrating the algorithm so the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">algorithm can stay free and open</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:12.160" style="s2">and the way you you you explore that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:13.599" style="s2">you basically ask people would you like</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:15.280" style="s2">to have a free and open algorithm that</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.599" end="01:07:17.039" style="s2">isn&#39;t manipulated by poli</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.280" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">people for political reasons and we</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.039" end="01:07:20.799" style="s2">allowed her freeman open algorithm that</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">is cleanse the whole ad and spam</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.799" end="01:07:23.760" style="s2">that advertises time to throw in there</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">would you like it to be without</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.760" end="01:07:27.440" style="s2">manipulation corruption anybody would of</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:29.920" style="s2">course answer yes i would like my free</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.440" end="01:07:32.000" style="s2">and open algorithm to be free and open</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.920" end="01:07:33.440" style="s2">now that means we must not use</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:35.760" style="s2">algorithms in any way</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.440" end="01:07:36.880" style="s2">we try to direct them we must let the</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.760" end="01:07:38.599" style="s2">phallus rise</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.880" end="01:07:40.559" style="s2">so to speak the phallus will</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.599" end="01:07:43.760" style="s2">spontaneously rise</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.559" end="01:07:45.440" style="s2">out of the system but if we for example</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.760" end="01:07:47.599" style="s2">have a dialogue here</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.440" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">that is a quality dialogue both to us</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.599" end="01:07:51.280" style="s2">and to people who follow it and</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:53.440" style="s2">get engaged with it the algorithms will</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.280" end="01:07:54.640" style="s2">point towards our dialogue if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.440" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">kept free and open</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.640" end="01:07:58.720" style="s2">because the algorithms will kill</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:08:00.880" style="s2">everything that isn&#39;t quality out there</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.720" end="01:08:02.640" style="s2">it will also sometimes kill some quality</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.880" end="01:08:04.319" style="s2">to in the process that&#39;s so much quality</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.640" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">that most people don&#39;t even get it</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.319" end="01:08:07.599" style="s2">that&#39;s tragedy trying to understand</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.160" end="01:08:08.160" style="s2">there&#39;s a tragedy we sometimes have to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.599" end="01:08:10.319" style="s2">live with</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:12.079" style="s2">but essentially if you do quality stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.319" end="01:08:13.920" style="s2">these days and you&#39;re good at explaining</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.079" end="01:08:14.720" style="s2">it to people and hopefully do so in a</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:16.640" style="s2">fun way</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.720" end="01:08:17.920" style="s2">you will get the algorithms to go your</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.640" end="01:08:19.279" style="s2">way anyway</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.920" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s the way we should look at</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.279" end="01:08:23.040" style="s2">algorithms stay out of manipulation</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.440" end="01:08:29.759" style="s2">okay now we um have another question</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:32.159" style="s2">from roberto he asked what good reasons</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.759" end="01:08:34.239" style="s2">do we have to suppose that we can</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.159" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">now have a real comprehension of humans</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.239" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">many ages have had this illusion</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s only a matter about</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">data of data about humans</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:45.279" style="s2">no that&#39;s correct very good question</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:47.359" style="s2">okay but we know more</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.279" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">we will know more now whether we know</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.359" end="01:08:50.159" style="s2">more insider enhancing and processes</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:52.960" style="s2">it&#39;s a different question</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.159" end="01:08:54.960" style="s2">okay for example when i study philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.960" end="01:08:57.279" style="s2">and when i sit with hegel and nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.960" end="01:08:59.199" style="s2">i discover that they spent every day of</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.279" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">their lives reading tons of books much</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.199" end="01:09:02.640" style="s2">more than i</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">do and i discovered that my students</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.640" end="01:09:05.279" style="s2">that are say 25 years old that i work</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.279" end="01:09:10.000" style="s2">read far less than i had done when i was</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:11.759" style="s2">25. what terrifies me is that we spend</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.000" end="01:09:13.040" style="s2">too much time surfing and jumping from</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">one thing to the next and</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.040" end="01:09:16.560" style="s2">we learn a few lines that are good for</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">cocktail conversations we actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:20.080" style="s2">go deep</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">but human beings are dialectical there</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.080" end="01:09:24.000" style="s2">are also responses to things that we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">we no longer want to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.000" end="01:09:28.400" style="s2">in the facebook threads behaving like</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:30.080" style="s2">trolls that belongs to the 2010s we no</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.400" end="01:09:31.359" style="s2">longer want to stay in echo chambers we</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.080" end="01:09:33.199" style="s2">want to be challenged we want to be</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.359" end="01:09:35.839" style="s2">antagonic in our behavior</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.199" end="01:09:37.359" style="s2">we&#39;re learning as we go along and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.839" end="01:09:39.679" style="s2">same thing here that</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.359" end="01:09:41.759" style="s2">i hope that people go in and stay within</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.679" end="01:09:43.440" style="s2">deep studies i actually think that</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.759" end="01:09:45.359" style="s2">monasteries will come back in a big way</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.440" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">but the monasteries will be wi-fi</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.359" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">miners just turn around so they can both</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:49.359" style="s2">be digital or physical but i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">people will have</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.359" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">enormous need to isolate themselves</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:55.520" style="s2">maybe for months at a time</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:09:57.760" style="s2">to really be able to study something</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.520" end="01:09:58.960" style="s2">deeply without getting disturbed</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.760" end="01:10:00.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the lessons we&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.960" end="01:10:02.480" style="s2">from the 2010s and whether where the</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">hell can i be for four months to study</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.480" end="01:10:05.360" style="s2">something properly</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:06.719" style="s2">without constantly being disturbed by my</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.360" end="01:10:08.080" style="s2">smartphone and</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.719" end="01:10:09.840" style="s2">these are the things people are learning</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.080" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">and we can call this a digital monastery</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.840" end="01:10:11.760" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:13.120" style="s2">i would prophesize and say that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.760" end="01:10:13.679" style="s2">definitely gonna come in the next 10</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.120" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.679" end="01:10:17.920" style="s2">but when it comes to the data because we</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:21.199" style="s2">have more data available</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.920" end="01:10:23.760" style="s2">about humans human genome the human body</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.199" end="01:10:24.960" style="s2">the human history the human brain how it</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.760" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">operates and how it interacts with the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.960" end="01:10:28.239" style="s2">outside world</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">we can at least theoretically say that</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.239" end="01:10:31.360" style="s2">we will probably</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">be able to say a lot more about humans</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.360" end="01:10:35.120" style="s2">and humanness than we could in the past</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:41.679" style="s2">right okay so now um i just see that</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.360" end="01:10:43.600" style="s2">i can&#39;t integrate the participants in</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.679" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">this life</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.600" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">zoom so we have to do it via chat</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:51.679" style="s2">there was a question by jonathan i read</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.199" end="01:10:53.600" style="s2">it again</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.679" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">can you say more about your</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.600" end="01:10:56.880" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:10:58.000" style="s2">of the difference between drive desire</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.880" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">and transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.000" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">how do you relate these psychoanalytic</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:05.360" style="s2">concepts in your social analysis</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">thanks great question love that one</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.360" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">jonathan okay</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">so um john cena crystal has found that</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:12.960" style="s2">chocolate con&#39;s division between drive</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.000" end="01:11:14.320" style="s2">and desire</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.960" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">left a little too much to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.320" end="01:11:17.360" style="s2">imagination so if you&#39;re going to talk</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:21.040" style="s2">about drives</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.360" end="01:11:22.719" style="s2">and a division of drives then uh lacan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.040" end="01:11:24.719" style="s2">description of drive is something</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.719" end="01:11:25.600" style="s2">mechanic so it&#39;s a mechanic something</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.719" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">demandingly</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.600" end="01:11:29.760" style="s2">mechanic is a good way to describe your</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:30.320" style="s2">drive so what is mechanistic about it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.760" end="01:11:32.560" style="s2">drive</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.320" end="01:11:34.719" style="s2">and desire is always that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.560" end="01:11:37.920" style="s2">that&#39;s exclusive for humans</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.719" end="01:11:38.480" style="s2">animals don&#39;t show desire and and desire</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.920" end="01:11:40.320" style="s2">is here</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.480" end="01:11:41.920" style="s2">uh something that comes as a byproduct</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.320" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">of language so</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.920" end="01:11:46.239" style="s2">you we symbolically desire something and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:50.159" style="s2">we have an imagination about the drive</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.239" end="01:11:52.400" style="s2">okay although i think makon is ignoring</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.159" end="01:11:54.000" style="s2">instinct a bit too much here because a</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.400" end="01:11:56.800" style="s2">lot of human behavior is just pure</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.000" end="01:11:57.520" style="s2">instinct say for example you know when</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.800" end="01:11:59.040" style="s2">you&#39;re born</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.520" end="01:12:00.960" style="s2">if you drop the baby on the mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.040" end="01:12:02.080" style="s2">body you&#39;ll immediately crawl to the tip</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.960" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">and start sucking the tip</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.080" end="01:12:05.120" style="s2">out of instinct and instinctive of</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:07.840" style="s2">course how animals</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.120" end="01:12:09.199" style="s2">intelligent animals maybe operate so it</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.840" end="01:12:10.640" style="s2">makes sense to speak about</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.199" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">instinct and the great thing with</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.640" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">instinct is we then get a name for what</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:16.480" style="s2">we can call animalistic drive</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:18.560" style="s2">and it helps people to differentiate in</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.480" end="01:12:20.159" style="s2">psychonauts between be mechanical in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.560" end="01:12:22.480" style="s2">drive and animalistic so</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.159" end="01:12:24.000" style="s2">the animal in me did this is what we</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.480" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">would talk about in terms of instinct</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.000" end="01:12:27.199" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:28.480" style="s2">the mechanic side of me the eerie weird</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.199" end="01:12:29.520" style="s2">thing in me that is just strictly</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.480" end="01:12:31.199" style="s2">mechanic that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.520" end="01:12:32.719" style="s2">energy being thrown into some kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.199" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">system and then it does things</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.719" end="01:12:36.640" style="s2">is what we then call pure drive and pure</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:39.199" style="s2">drive</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.640" end="01:12:40.800" style="s2">and instinct then has desire correctly</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.199" end="01:12:42.400" style="s2">which is what we get from the symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.800" end="01:12:44.960" style="s2">and we get that from language</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.400" end="01:12:47.120" style="s2">but what&#39;s interesting here is that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.960" end="01:12:48.400" style="s2">also need to understand transcendence as</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.120" end="01:12:51.280" style="s2">a drive</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.400" end="01:12:51.840" style="s2">what do you mean by that well the idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.280" end="01:12:53.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.840" end="01:12:55.920" style="s2">you can be part of something bigger or</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.840" end="01:12:58.960" style="s2">greater than yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.920" end="01:13:00.159" style="s2">is a drive the idea that even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.960" end="01:13:01.760" style="s2">gonna die one day</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.159" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">you can leave a heritage behind like</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.760" end="01:13:04.880" style="s2">your children and they can have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">different world than yours and you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.880" end="01:13:07.760" style="s2">actually prioritize</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.320" end="01:13:09.600" style="s2">what&#39;s great for your children you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.760" end="01:13:11.280" style="s2">prioritize in your life</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.600" end="01:13:13.280" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen long after you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.280" end="01:13:14.560" style="s2">dead rather than just prioritize your</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.280" end="01:13:16.640" style="s2">own self-interest</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.560" end="01:13:18.960" style="s2">that&#39;s transcendence transcendence is</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.640" end="01:13:20.800" style="s2">incredibly important for human beings</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.960" end="01:13:22.239" style="s2">simply because it comes out of getting</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.800" end="01:13:23.920" style="s2">tired of the desire</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.239" end="01:13:25.760" style="s2">and it also comes out of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.920" end="01:13:28.080" style="s2">we&#39;re tribal creatures</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.760" end="01:13:29.520" style="s2">and the the way we came up with</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.080" end="01:13:31.199" style="s2">transcendence that&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.520" end="01:13:32.800" style="s2">desire was that</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.199" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">you know it&#39;s always when you go back to</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.800" end="01:13:35.840" style="s2">your masters</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:37.520" style="s2">and you discover there&#39;s a loophole in</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.840" end="01:13:39.600" style="s2">their argument</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.520" end="01:13:41.280" style="s2">so you become more them than they are</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.600" end="01:13:42.480" style="s2">you become more freudian than freud</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.280" end="01:13:43.520" style="s2">that&#39;s what you discover where freud</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.480" end="01:13:45.520" style="s2">misses out on things</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.520" end="01:13:46.960" style="s2">you become more hegelian than hegel</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.520" end="01:13:48.719" style="s2">that&#39;s where you discover the zeitgeist</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.960" end="01:13:50.480" style="s2">must be split it can&#39;t be one</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.719" end="01:13:52.400" style="s2">you can be more nietzsche nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.480" end="01:13:53.760" style="s2">discover the ubermesh must have company</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.400" end="01:13:54.480" style="s2">he&#39;s a tribal creature so there must be</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.760" end="01:13:56.400" style="s2">at least two</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.480" end="01:13:57.920" style="s2">okay so you discover these guys have it</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.400" end="01:13:59.120" style="s2">really figured out fully and you use</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.920" end="01:14:00.239" style="s2">them against them you can do the same</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.120" end="01:14:02.159" style="s2">with lakhan</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.239" end="01:14:04.239" style="s2">and ninja&#39;s name is shot khan is he</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.159" end="01:14:05.760" style="s2">never discusses like he wouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.239" end="01:14:07.280" style="s2">because he likes to be dark and negative</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.760" end="01:14:08.880" style="s2">and everything like he&#39;s he&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.280" end="01:14:10.640" style="s2">a gothic guy let&#39;s put it that way it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.880" end="01:14:13.679" style="s2">a bit like lovecraft right</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.640" end="01:14:15.440" style="s2">solacan never discussed in his work</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.679" end="01:14:17.679" style="s2">what would it be like to be his</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.440" end="01:14:20.080" style="s2">analysion you know his patient</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.679" end="01:14:21.280" style="s2">and be successful with the process what</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.080" end="01:14:24.400" style="s2">does it mean to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.280" end="01:14:25.679" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s post psych analysis</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.400" end="01:14:28.159" style="s2">because this obvious statement when you</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.679" end="01:14:30.080" style="s2">post psychonauts lacan himself hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.159" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">personified that state</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.080" end="01:14:33.920" style="s2">even if you arrive in a sort of weird</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:36.000" style="s2">eerie lacanian place we realize that</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.920" end="01:14:36.719" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to fill your empty self</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.000" end="01:14:38.480" style="s2">all the time</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.719" end="01:14:40.080" style="s2">you can&#39;t stop doing it even you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.480" end="01:14:41.600" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of in vain okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.080" end="01:14:44.800" style="s2">even if you do that there is an</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.600" end="01:14:47.920" style="s2">enlightenment to knowing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.800" end="01:14:49.440" style="s2">and the answer we have is that if you</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.920" end="01:14:52.000" style="s2">get the enlightenment the laconia</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.440" end="01:14:53.920" style="s2">enlightenment which he doesn&#39;t discuss</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.000" end="01:14:55.280" style="s2">then that state is what we call</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.920" end="01:14:56.960" style="s2">transcendence</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.280" end="01:14:58.719" style="s2">so we have four different drives and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.960" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">think it&#39;s a richer variety it makes</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.719" end="01:15:00.960" style="s2">sense to add more to it without</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:04.400" style="s2">inflation</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.960" end="01:15:06.239" style="s2">to speak about instinct pure drive</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.400" end="01:15:11.840" style="s2">desire and transcendence when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.239" end="01:15:11.840" style="s2">approach human drives</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.400" end="01:15:23.120" style="s2">right okay now</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.520" end="01:15:27.360" style="s2">we have a question for from aurelion</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.120" end="01:15:30.320" style="s2">um i will read it again also i mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.360" end="01:15:32.560" style="s2">i came to this book the digital libido</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.320" end="01:15:34.800" style="s2">after first reading a lot of nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.560" end="01:15:36.320" style="s2">when i&#39;ve read when i read nietzsche i</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.800" end="01:15:38.239" style="s2">found on him something which</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.320" end="01:15:40.480" style="s2">something which just seems solely</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.239" end="01:15:43.360" style="s2">lacking today and which almost seems</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.480" end="01:15:44.719" style="s2">incompatible with the climate of today</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.360" end="01:15:46.719" style="s2">and i find in you</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.719" end="01:15:48.640" style="s2">and a few others that you&#39;ve mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.719" end="01:15:52.159" style="s2">your approach to philosophy and politics</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.640" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">and of course in your book</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.159" end="01:15:57.280" style="s2">well okay what is it</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:15:58.560" style="s2">what it is is the willingness to speak</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.280" end="01:16:01.040" style="s2">the harsh harsh truth</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.560" end="01:16:01.679" style="s2">to critique us everyone the dominant</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.040" end="01:16:03.520" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.679" end="01:16:04.800" style="s2">and the cultural expressions of the time</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.520" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">and uh and</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.800" end="01:16:10.000" style="s2">analyze its true consequences why do you</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:13.120" style="s2">think this type of truth speaking</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.000" end="01:16:13.760" style="s2">and critique so incompatible with</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.120" end="01:16:16.560" style="s2">today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.760" end="01:16:18.320" style="s2">why ah okay why do you think this type</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.560" end="01:16:20.800" style="s2">of truth speaking and critique</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.320" end="01:16:21.520" style="s2">is so incompatible with today&#39;s cultural</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.800" end="01:16:23.840" style="s2">climate</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.520" end="01:16:25.600" style="s2">is it also part of the infantilization</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.840" end="01:16:28.800" style="s2">of academia and society</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.600" end="01:16:32.159" style="s2">in general very good question</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.800" end="01:16:34.480" style="s2">so um aurelian the yes uh</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.159" end="01:16:36.400" style="s2">the infantilization is partly</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.480" end="01:16:37.440" style="s2">responsible for that the infantilization</p>

<p begin="01:17:09.760" end="01:17:13.760" style="s2">and those fake fallacies are really</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.920" end="01:17:15.520" style="s2">dangerous and often what they do turns</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.760" end="01:17:17.199" style="s2">out to be bloody because they personify</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.520" end="01:17:18.719" style="s2">the same mechanisms that we see woke</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.199" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">they personified the lynch mob their</p>

<p begin="01:17:22.080" end="01:17:24.960" style="s2">corruption and</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.199" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">this is also because it&#39;s easy for us as</p>

<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:30.400" style="s2">short term so we watch the news every</p>

<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:44.880" style="s2">beautifully and we do that then we see</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.239" end="01:17:46.080" style="s2">patterns for example the corruption of</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.880" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.080" end="01:17:49.679" style="s2">was very much down to the simple fact</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:52.480" style="s2">that if a professor disagreed with</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.679" end="01:17:54.880" style="s2">another professor none of them was fired</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.480" end="01:17:56.400" style="s2">you see so it&#39;s not like you competed</p>
<p begin="01:17:54.880" end="01:17:57.679" style="s2">for the same post there wasn&#39;t any</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.400" end="01:17:58.480" style="s2">competition like there is in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.679" end="01:18:00.640" style="s2">marketplace</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.480" end="01:18:02.080" style="s2">at least the marketplace or say a bazaar</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.640" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">historical marketplace</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.080" end="01:18:05.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain point because new</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.679" end="01:18:07.280" style="s2">forces come into the marketplace all the</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.520" end="01:18:08.960" style="s2">time and want to market their worst</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.280" end="01:18:10.400" style="s2">therefore there&#39;s competition because</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.960" end="01:18:11.440" style="s2">there&#39;s competition you keep a fresh</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.400" end="01:18:12.800" style="s2">blood in the system</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.440" end="01:18:14.800" style="s2">but the way i could deem this worked</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.800" end="01:18:17.679" style="s2">over the last say 60 to 70 years</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.800" end="01:18:19.199" style="s2">is basically that oh okay so these two</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.679" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">different fields do not agree with each</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.199" end="01:18:23.440" style="s2">other let&#39;s put a new prefix in front of</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:25.600" style="s2">them invent even further institutions</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.440" end="01:18:27.760" style="s2">so we had a massive inflation of</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.600" end="01:18:29.920" style="s2">academic production</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.760" end="01:18:31.040" style="s2">but the quality was lower and lower and</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.920" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">lower why</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.040" end="01:18:34.400" style="s2">because there was no antagonism thrown</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:36.239" style="s2">into the system</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.400" end="01:18:37.840" style="s2">there were no challenges thrown into the</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.239" end="01:18:39.120" style="s2">system and if you&#39;re never</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.840" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">challenged in what you do you keep</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.120" end="01:18:41.360" style="s2">producing it and producing it and</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:43.520" style="s2">producing it</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.360" end="01:18:45.440" style="s2">and it becomes more and more junky and</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.520" end="01:18:47.280" style="s2">finally nobody cares about it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.440" end="01:18:49.280" style="s2">an academic paper today does anybody</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.280" end="01:18:51.120" style="s2">care to read it no</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.280" end="01:18:52.480" style="s2">nobody reads academic papers any longer</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.120" end="01:18:54.320" style="s2">do academicians care</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.480" end="01:18:56.320" style="s2">they haven&#39;t seen this movement because</p>
<p begin="01:18:54.320" end="01:18:56.719" style="s2">it&#39;s taken decades for them to reach</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.320" end="01:18:59.120" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.719" end="01:19:00.880" style="s2">they get paid more than ever because we</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.120" end="01:19:02.960" style="s2">force the students to take on academic</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.880" end="01:19:05.199" style="s2">educations they no longer need</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.960" end="01:19:06.800" style="s2">so this is like it&#39;s like one huge</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.199" end="01:19:08.400" style="s2">institution that&#39;s about to fall</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.800" end="01:19:09.520" style="s2">dramatically in the next 10 years and</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.400" end="01:19:12.400" style="s2">that&#39;s academia</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.520" end="01:19:13.920" style="s2">simply because why would anybody pay for</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.400" end="01:19:16.320" style="s2">harvard university now</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.920" end="01:19:18.960" style="s2">in the fall of 2020 when everything at</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.320" end="01:19:19.840" style="s2">harvard goes online and it costs you 55</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.960" end="01:19:21.440" style="s2">000</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.840" end="01:19:23.440" style="s2">to attend a semester at harvard where</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.440" end="01:19:25.600" style="s2">you can get the same thing at praxis.com</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.440" end="01:19:28.080" style="s2">for twelve hundred dollars</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.600" end="01:19:29.280" style="s2">with a certificate it&#39;s only question of</p>

<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:32.800" style="s2">praxis.com looks better than the one</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.800" end="01:19:34.159" style="s2">from harwood because practice.com is not</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.800" end="01:19:36.800" style="s2">completely rotten</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.159" end="01:19:38.480" style="s2">with woke culture like harvard is so</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.800" end="01:19:40.320" style="s2">harvard is killing itself from all</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.480" end="01:19:42.320" style="s2">different directions at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.320" end="01:19:44.239" style="s2">and of course if harvard does that you</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.320" end="01:19:46.239" style="s2">can never imagine how bad it is at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.239" end="01:19:47.920" style="s2">smaller universities and colleges in</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.239" end="01:19:49.760" style="s2">north america and asia and europe at the</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.920" end="01:19:52.159" style="s2">moment so</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.760" end="01:19:53.040" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing this lowered quality</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.159" end="01:19:55.760" style="s2">everywhere</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.040" end="01:19:57.600" style="s2">as a lowered quality and people need to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.760" end="01:19:58.640" style="s2">keep their day jobs and they need to pay</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.600" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">their mortgage</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.640" end="01:20:02.800" style="s2">and when people have loans to pay and</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:04.320" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s below 50 years of age in</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.800" end="01:20:06.080" style="s2">our society is loans to pay</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.320" end="01:20:07.520" style="s2">and everybody&#39;s above 50 years of age</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.080" end="01:20:09.199" style="s2">when they&#39;re no longer corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.520" end="01:20:10.880" style="s2">have money to spend and then they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.199" end="01:20:13.199" style="s2">care any longer that means the people</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.880" end="01:20:14.239" style="s2">who do the careers now between 25 50</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.199" end="01:20:16.000" style="s2">years of age have more</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.239" end="01:20:17.760" style="s2">gifts to pay they need to keep their day</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.000" end="01:20:19.840" style="s2">jobs they often have the day jobs with</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.760" end="01:20:21.520" style="s2">these old institutions they&#39;re dying</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.840" end="01:20:23.920" style="s2">and therefore they keep their mouths</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.520" end="01:20:26.719" style="s2">shut it&#39;s a massive</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.920" end="01:20:28.159" style="s2">corruption of the whole system and i get</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.719" end="01:20:29.760" style="s2">it here in sweden because when i speak</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.159" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">the truth here because i&#39;ve basically</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.760" end="01:20:32.080" style="s2">managed to build the position from which</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:34.400" style="s2">i can speak</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.080" end="01:20:35.120" style="s2">my mind i&#39;m paid to do it and i&#39;m unique</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.400" end="01:20:36.800" style="s2">in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.120" end="01:20:38.880" style="s2">when i meet people they&#39;ll say well you</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.800" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">can&#39;t say that the things you say</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.880" end="01:20:42.320" style="s2">and now you say well i just did yeah you</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:45.520" style="s2">can say that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.320" end="01:20:46.480" style="s2">yeah because i created a platform from</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.520" end="01:20:49.199" style="s2">which i can be</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.480" end="01:20:50.560" style="s2">courageous to be courageous basically</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.199" end="01:20:52.719" style="s2">simply being smart</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.560" end="01:20:54.480" style="s2">about creating a platform for which you</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.719" end="01:20:57.120" style="s2">can speak freely</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.480" end="01:20:58.800" style="s2">and that to me today is to go online</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.120" end="01:20:59.199" style="s2">create your own channel if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.800" end="01:21:00.960" style="s2">trust</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:02.560" style="s2">youtube create your own web page or</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.960" end="01:21:04.560" style="s2">something or go to some more open</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.560" end="01:21:05.360" style="s2">service get a garden parlor account if</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.560" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">you don&#39;t touch</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.360" end="01:21:08.880" style="s2">twitter but the way place to go right</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:10.320" style="s2">now is to go online like parallax is</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.880" end="01:21:11.360" style="s2">done here you go online you do</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.320" end="01:21:13.040" style="s2">everything you do online</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.360" end="01:21:14.800" style="s2">and suddenly you created the free and</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.040" end="01:21:15.280" style="s2">open platform which is also free and</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.800" end="01:21:18.400" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.280" end="01:21:20.639" style="s2">for you as an agent to act from</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.400" end="01:21:22.159" style="s2">so i think i think the problem with the</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.639" end="01:21:24.159" style="s2">dominant culture you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.159" end="01:21:25.679" style="s2">correctly aurelion is this all this</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.159" end="01:21:27.760" style="s2">dominant culture comes from</p>

<p begin="01:25:02.560" end="01:25:05.920" style="s2">we probably have to leave and end up in</p>

<p begin="01:25:20.880" end="01:25:23.360" style="s2">picture at all when you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.000" end="01:25:26.560" style="s2">overall picture but</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.360" end="01:25:26.960" style="s2">you know is the recruitment ground here</p>

<p begin="01:25:39.520" end="01:25:44.000" style="s2">they&#39;re bound to do so so expect the</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.000" end="01:25:46.239" style="s2">mess to stay for at least another 50</p>
<p begin="01:25:44.000" end="01:25:46.239" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.239" end="01:25:55.120" style="s2">right okay so now i have let me just</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.840" end="01:25:58.159" style="s2">see um</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.120" end="01:26:00.159" style="s2">one question by jonathan</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.159" end="01:26:02.239" style="s2">we had a question about time also yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.159" end="01:26:02.560" style="s2">and yeah and by carl and so we started</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.239" end="01:26:04.000" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.560" end="01:26:05.520" style="s2">i think they&#39;re connected because</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.000" end="01:26:06.239" style="s2">they&#39;re both time questions right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.520" end="01:26:09.920" style="s2">okay so</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.239" end="01:26:10.400" style="s2">just answer to carl let me read the</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.920" end="01:26:12.639" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.400" end="01:26:14.400" style="s2">so future listeners know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.639" end="01:26:16.239" style="s2">referring to right</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.400" end="01:26:19.760" style="s2">so the question by carl is what is your</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.239" end="01:26:23.199" style="s2">take on circular time</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.760" end="01:26:24.800" style="s2">right so uh the next book we&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.199" end="01:26:25.760" style="s2">on the follow-up today libido is called</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.800" end="01:26:27.600" style="s2">process and event</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.760" end="01:26:29.280" style="s2">and this is the very likely the title of</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.600" end="01:26:30.560" style="s2">the book as well if it said we did a</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.280" end="01:26:32.320" style="s2">little bit of where they connect is that</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.560" end="01:26:33.679" style="s2">data libido discusses the original</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.320" end="01:26:35.840" style="s2">nomadic tribe</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.679" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">and it then discusses its idea of the</p>

<p begin="01:27:28.560" end="01:27:32.639" style="s2">the patterns he discusses are always</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.320" end="01:27:34.159" style="s2">about circular time and the opposite</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.639" end="01:27:36.320" style="s2">circle of times we talk about it is</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.159" end="01:27:36.960" style="s2">linear time and linear time is quite</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.320" end="01:27:38.560" style="s2">recent</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.960" end="01:27:40.719" style="s2">that innovation was less than four</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.560" end="01:27:42.480" style="s2">thousand years old it was invented by</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.719" end="01:27:43.840" style="s2">zoroaster who founded zoroastrianism in</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.480" end="01:27:46.400" style="s2">persia asian persia</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.840" end="01:27:49.840" style="s2">and it basically said that okay because</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.400" end="01:27:51.840" style="s2">not every circle of history is the same</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.840" end="01:27:54.480" style="s2">there is a small deviation and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.840" end="01:27:56.159" style="s2">deviation can actually be expanded on</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.480" end="01:27:58.159" style="s2">for example the sun can build the</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.159" end="01:28:00.080" style="s2">societies different than the father did</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.159" end="01:28:01.360" style="s2">and because written language had arrived</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.080" end="01:28:03.360" style="s2">it became obvious</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.360" end="01:28:04.880" style="s2">that there was more data available even</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.360" end="01:28:06.400" style="s2">more data available you can create a</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.880" end="01:28:08.560" style="s2">more advanced culture</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.400" end="01:28:10.400" style="s2">so so raster&#39;s idea was simply that</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.560" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">because we could create a more advanced</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.400" end="01:28:12.800" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:14.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make sense to think of time</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.800" end="01:28:17.040" style="s2">as something circular</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.400" end="01:28:19.040" style="s2">so introduce the idea of linear time and</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.040" end="01:28:20.639" style="s2">the linear time</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.040" end="01:28:22.159" style="s2">is called eventology that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.639" end="01:28:23.920" style="s2">book is called process and event it</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.159" end="01:28:24.320" style="s2">discusses process time which is circular</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.920" end="01:28:26.239" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.320" end="01:28:27.520" style="s2">and it discusses linear time which is</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.239" end="01:28:30.480" style="s2">eventology</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.520" end="01:28:32.960" style="s2">and these two different ways of looking</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.480" end="01:28:34.560" style="s2">at time or action also moving into time</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.960" end="01:28:36.800" style="s2">studies per se</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.560" end="01:28:38.639" style="s2">because if you study subphysics which is</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.800" end="01:28:40.560" style="s2">like the part what&#39;s prior to physics</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.639" end="01:28:42.239" style="s2">because it looks like a universe is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.560" end="01:28:44.239" style="s2">big bounce in order to be banned</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.239" end="01:28:46.320" style="s2">you discover that physicists need two</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.239" end="01:28:48.880" style="s2">tone dimensions for that to work</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.320" end="01:28:50.880" style="s2">and funny enough time as we know it</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.880" end="01:28:52.800" style="s2">turns out to be linear it started</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.880" end="01:28:54.400" style="s2">13.8 billion years ago with the</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.800" end="01:28:56.080" style="s2">expansion of classic space time with</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.400" end="01:28:57.120" style="s2">expansion of the universe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.080" end="01:29:00.000" style="s2">guaranteed</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.120" end="01:29:01.760" style="s2">but there must be time prior to time</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.000" end="01:29:04.400" style="s2">it&#39;s called hypertime and it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.760" end="01:29:05.520" style="s2">hypertime is very warped and weird maybe</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.400" end="01:29:07.600" style="s2">not circular</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.520" end="01:29:09.280" style="s2">but incredibly warped and weird so we</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.600" end="01:29:10.400" style="s2">don&#39;t end up with infinitives we look at</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.280" end="01:29:13.600" style="s2">different universes</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.400" end="01:29:15.120" style="s2">now that&#39;s an area of study that i love</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.600" end="01:29:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s an area of study where physicists</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.120" end="01:29:18.480" style="s2">and philosophers and just everybody is</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.880" end="01:29:19.120" style="s2">really interested in grand theoret going</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.480" end="01:29:20.800" style="s2">at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.120" end="01:29:22.320" style="s2">but i find it very very interesting that</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.800" end="01:29:23.440" style="s2">actually linear time and circular time</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.320" end="01:29:27.040" style="s2">are returning</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.440" end="01:29:27.040" style="s2">in the world of physics as well today</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.440" end="01:29:30.880" style="s2">so we had jonathan had another great</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.040" end="01:29:33.040" style="s2">comment about time right but</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.880" end="01:29:34.880" style="s2">again let me read it for future</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.040" end="01:29:37.600" style="s2">listeners so everybody&#39;s on board</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.880" end="01:29:38.080" style="s2">jonathan asked if there is time i have</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.600" end="01:29:40.480" style="s2">one more</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.080" end="01:29:41.600" style="s2">question throughout your books you use</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.480" end="01:29:44.080" style="s2">the term network</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.600" end="01:29:45.679" style="s2">dynamical can you say more about what</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.080" end="01:29:48.400" style="s2">you&#39;re referring to with this term</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.679" end="01:29:50.239" style="s2">particularly in a social context rather</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.400" end="01:29:54.320" style="s2">than in cosmological context</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.239" end="01:29:56.080" style="s2">thanks yes i am a radical relationalist</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.320" end="01:29:57.199" style="s2">and so is general cynicist what we mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.080" end="01:29:59.760" style="s2">by that is that</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.199" end="01:30:01.840" style="s2">relations are prior to relotta so before</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.760" end="01:30:03.840" style="s2">you get interested in the object that</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.840" end="01:30:05.360" style="s2">little ammonium comet is sitting staring</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.840" end="01:30:07.280" style="s2">at as the subject</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.360" end="01:30:08.800" style="s2">there is there are relations there</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.280" end="01:30:10.239" style="s2">there&#39;s the relation between the subject</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.800" end="01:30:11.520" style="s2">and the object there&#39;s also relation</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.239" end="01:30:13.760" style="s2">within the object</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.520" end="01:30:15.600" style="s2">so everything starts with relations and</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.760" end="01:30:17.679" style="s2">fundamentally that&#39;s what physics is</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.600" end="01:30:19.040" style="s2">physics is the beginning of relations</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.679" end="01:30:21.600" style="s2">that are sub-physical</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.040" end="01:30:22.560" style="s2">so potentialities become probabilities</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.600" end="01:30:25.120" style="s2">that they become</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.560" end="01:30:26.400" style="s2">actualities and once something is</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.120" end="01:30:28.000" style="s2">actually you can start measuring it and</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.400" end="01:30:28.719" style="s2">you can bump into it and be walled at</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.000" end="01:30:31.360" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.719" end="01:30:32.239" style="s2">so relations are prior to a lot in our</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.360" end="01:30:33.679" style="s2">philosophy we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.239" end="01:30:35.440" style="s2">radical relational relationalists and we</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.679" end="01:30:35.920" style="s2">take a lot of this work from alfred</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.440" end="01:30:38.800" style="s2">north</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.920" end="01:30:40.400" style="s2">whitehead who was the originator of</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.800" end="01:30:42.880" style="s2">radical relationalism so</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.400" end="01:30:44.320" style="s2">he took leibniz&#39;s and nietzsche&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.880" end="01:30:46.320" style="s2">of relativism</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.320" end="01:30:48.000" style="s2">and basically said it&#39;s not only that</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.320" end="01:30:49.840" style="s2">the relations between the objects</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.000" end="01:30:51.440" style="s2">are relative but actually the objects</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.840" end="01:30:52.800" style="s2">themselves are relative within</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.440" end="01:30:55.440" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.800" end="01:30:57.040" style="s2">so he&#39;s like he&#39;s like you know an</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.440" end="01:30:58.480" style="s2">inverted hegelian in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.040" end="01:31:00.400" style="s2">he thinks like hegel but he thinks i</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.480" end="01:31:02.560" style="s2">can&#39;t go about objects and subjects</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.400" end="01:31:04.159" style="s2">and when you tear the objects apart that</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.560" end="01:31:05.600" style="s2">way you discover they&#39;re just relations</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.159" end="01:31:07.120" style="s2">or relations and relations you become a</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.600" end="01:31:09.920" style="s2">radical relationalist</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.120" end="01:31:12.000" style="s2">now that is cosmologically correct but</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.920" end="01:31:13.679" style="s2">why would we reply to human beings</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.000" end="01:31:14.639" style="s2">because human beings are tribal</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.679" end="01:31:17.360" style="s2">creatures now</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.639" end="01:31:19.440" style="s2">if i wrote philosophy for polar bears</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.360" end="01:31:21.199" style="s2">who are very solitary animals</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.440" end="01:31:23.120" style="s2">they hardly even get along they even eat</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.199" end="01:31:24.400" style="s2">their own kids if they have to like they</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.120" end="01:31:26.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not like you know they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:31:24.400" end="01:31:27.040" style="s2">sentimental as humans are when it comes</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.000" end="01:31:29.360" style="s2">to being brutal</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.040" end="01:31:31.280" style="s2">so polar bears are solitary animals if i</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.360" end="01:31:32.880" style="s2">wrote philosophy for polar bears in</p>

<p begin="01:31:32.880" end="01:31:36.080" style="s2">i would probably write to them why don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:31:41.040" end="01:31:44.719" style="s2">okay the vast majority of human beings</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.960" end="01:31:46.400" style="s2">are fortunate not autistic or</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.719" end="01:31:47.440" style="s2">narcissistic maybe i am to a certain</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.400" end="01:31:49.280" style="s2">extent but you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.440" end="01:31:50.800" style="s2">not more than i can be social creature</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.280" end="01:31:53.760" style="s2">human beings are deeply</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.800" end="01:31:55.440" style="s2">tribal social creatures so to understand</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.760" end="01:31:57.679" style="s2">human beings it makes sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.440" end="01:31:58.639" style="s2">actually to apply relationalism onto</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.679" end="01:32:00.480" style="s2">human beings</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.639" end="01:32:02.719" style="s2">and in the synthesis and book we explore</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.480" end="01:32:04.000" style="s2">this idea we dig deeper into individual</p>
<p begin="01:32:02.719" end="01:32:07.199" style="s2">libido and we call it</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.000" end="01:32:10.159" style="s2">social relationalism so social relations</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.199" end="01:32:10.800" style="s2">is the philosophy then when we apply it</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.159" end="01:32:13.679" style="s2">on the</p>
<p begin="01:32:10.800" end="01:32:15.360" style="s2">man technology interactions we call it</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.679" end="01:32:17.600" style="s2">network dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.360" end="01:32:18.960" style="s2">because networks are dynamical in</p>
<p begin="01:32:17.600" end="01:32:20.960" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.960" end="01:32:22.480" style="s2">but between networks there also has to</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.960" end="01:32:24.800" style="s2">be certain dynamism</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.480" end="01:32:26.560" style="s2">and if a network is no longer dynamical</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.800" end="01:32:28.320" style="s2">it tends to die</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.560" end="01:32:30.159" style="s2">we lose interest in it and we leave it</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.320" end="01:32:32.320" style="s2">and we get out so that&#39;s why network</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.159" end="01:32:40.159" style="s2">dynamical which term using all our work</p>
<p begin="01:32:32.320" end="01:32:43.199" style="s2">is now tied also with social relations</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.159" end="01:32:46.000" style="s2">all right another question</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.199" end="01:32:48.000" style="s2">by aurelian i hope i pronounced that</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.000" end="01:32:51.360" style="s2">correctly</p>
<p begin="01:32:48.000" end="01:32:55.520" style="s2">uh is that a female name i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.360" end="01:32:58.960" style="s2">aurelion i guess so is it a male name</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.520" end="01:32:59.840" style="s2">i&#39;m a phd student myself at malmo</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.960" end="01:33:01.760" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.840" end="01:33:03.760" style="s2">studying philosophy but you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.760" end="01:33:05.920" style="s2">universities are becoming obsolete</p>
<p begin="01:33:03.760" end="01:33:08.239" style="s2">and your prophecies all seem to come</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.920" end="01:33:09.440" style="s2">true so any advice for an aspiring</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.239" end="01:33:11.440" style="s2">philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:33:09.440" end="01:33:13.440" style="s2">philosophy is so important but i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.440" end="01:33:16.639" style="s2">see other platforms</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.440" end="01:33:19.280" style="s2">for it outside academia where does</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.639" end="01:33:20.000" style="s2">where does philosophy go in your opinion</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.280" end="01:33:22.960" style="s2">ah and he</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.000" end="01:33:23.199" style="s2">says he is male so there we go okay uh</p>
<p begin="01:33:22.960" end="01:33:26.239" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.199" end="01:33:27.600" style="s2">really uh john cena kissed and i knew</p>
<p begin="01:33:26.239" end="01:33:29.360" style="s2">that this would happen already we</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.600" end="01:33:30.159" style="s2">started working together almost 25 years</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.360" end="01:33:32.800" style="s2">ago</p>
<p begin="01:33:30.159" end="01:33:34.480" style="s2">so we are academics uh but when i do</p>
<p begin="01:33:32.800" end="01:33:36.159" style="s2">academia for example stop on school</p>
<p begin="01:33:34.480" end="01:33:37.600" style="s2">economics i&#39;m actually teacher at the</p>

<p begin="01:33:50.800" end="01:33:53.840" style="s2">and they want to know what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:33:52.080" end="01:33:55.199" style="s2">the digital world and i teach them that</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.840" end="01:33:57.600" style="s2">but i&#39;m actually not there as a</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.199" end="01:34:00.080" style="s2">philosopher i knew philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:33:57.600" end="01:34:01.600" style="s2">would lose by being inside academia i</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.080" end="01:34:02.400" style="s2">had the discussion with two friends of</p>
<p begin="01:34:01.600" end="01:34:04.320" style="s2">mine you might know</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.400" end="01:34:06.239" style="s2">alexander brady island was a very</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.320" end="01:34:08.880" style="s2">talented young danish philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.239" end="01:34:10.159" style="s2">and cattle last is a great new canadian</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.880" end="01:34:12.480" style="s2">philosopher who</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.159" end="01:34:14.080" style="s2">who works in the tradition of lacan and</p>
<p begin="01:34:12.480" end="01:34:15.679" style="s2">shishek and he&#39;s based in london</p>
<p begin="01:34:14.080" end="01:34:17.199" style="s2">and we had a conversation a private zoom</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.679" end="01:34:17.520" style="s2">conversation today and we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.199" end="01:34:20.320" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.520" end="01:34:20.719" style="s2">and i said maybe speculative realism</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.320" end="01:34:22.800" style="s2">which was</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.719" end="01:34:25.440" style="s2">very very hyped like 10 years ago with</p>
<p begin="01:34:22.800" end="01:34:26.960" style="s2">graham harman and quentin melissa and</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.440" end="01:34:28.719" style="s2">you know some other guys not much</p>
<p begin="01:34:26.960" end="01:34:30.000" style="s2">happened whether to be honest about it</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.719" end="01:34:33.440" style="s2">not much came out of it</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.000" end="01:34:36.719" style="s2">maybe that was just the last hype coming</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.440" end="01:34:38.400" style="s2">of out of academic philosophy these were</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.719" end="01:34:40.800" style="s2">all academic guys made</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.400" end="01:34:42.639" style="s2">academic careers and the way they</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.800" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">pursued their philosophy was by writing</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.639" end="01:34:47.520" style="s2">books in response to one another</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.480" end="01:34:48.320" style="s2">and then sitting in white-walled art</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.520" end="01:34:50.239" style="s2">galleries</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.320" end="01:34:51.760" style="s2">having philosophy discussions with black</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.239" end="01:34:53.520" style="s2">turtlenecks so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.760" end="01:34:54.880" style="s2">always become like a parody of what it</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.520" end="01:34:55.679" style="s2">means to be a philosopher to do that</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.880" end="01:34:57.440" style="s2">kind of work</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.679" end="01:34:58.960" style="s2">i never wanted to be part of that scene</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.440" end="01:35:01.199" style="s2">i i opted out</p>
<p begin="01:34:58.960" end="01:35:02.960" style="s2">i knew i had to find my audience and the</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.199" end="01:35:05.679" style="s2">people i wanted to collaborate with</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.960" end="01:35:08.000" style="s2">in a you know much longer route going</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.679" end="01:35:09.920" style="s2">outside of academia to find them</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.000" end="01:35:11.040" style="s2">but i&#39;m now discovering when we reach</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.920" end="01:35:12.639" style="s2">2020 and</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.040" end="01:35:14.000" style="s2">johnson my books are just about</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.639" end="01:35:15.920" style="s2">everywhere and get to travel around the</p>
<p begin="01:35:14.000" end="01:35:18.400" style="s2">world and we have a fantastic life</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.920" end="01:35:20.320" style="s2">filled with cognac and cigars and great</p>
<p begin="01:35:18.400" end="01:35:21.760" style="s2">books and you know great discussions and</p>
<p begin="01:35:20.320" end="01:35:24.400" style="s2">fantastic students and</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.760" end="01:35:25.600" style="s2">and fantastic interlocutors exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:35:24.400" end="01:35:27.040" style="s2">life we wanted we finally can live</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.600" end="01:35:28.239" style="s2">without but we took the outside of</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.040" end="01:35:30.239" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="01:35:28.239" end="01:35:32.000" style="s2">i would strongly recommend you to find</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.239" end="01:35:33.920" style="s2">other friends your own age</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.000" end="01:35:36.159" style="s2">and then build your own digital</p>
<p begin="01:35:33.920" end="01:35:37.600" style="s2">monastery and keep it digital for now</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.159" end="01:35:39.119" style="s2">and have regular soon conversations and</p>
<p begin="01:35:37.600" end="01:35:40.080" style="s2">other things and then work on your</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.119" end="01:35:41.119" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.080" end="01:35:43.360" style="s2">and then we won&#39;t express your</p>
<p begin="01:35:41.119" end="01:35:45.119" style="s2">philosophy also remember</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.360" end="01:35:46.960" style="s2">i think jordan hall said this to me last</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.119" end="01:35:48.800" style="s2">year in america as jordan hall said</p>
<p begin="01:35:46.960" end="01:35:51.360" style="s2">i intend to be the first philosophers</p>
<p begin="01:35:48.800" end="01:35:52.719" style="s2">and socrates to doesn&#39;t write books</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.360" end="01:35:54.080" style="s2">and see if he can do his philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.719" end="01:35:56.239" style="s2">strictly through using podcasts of</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.080" end="01:35:58.159" style="s2">webcasts and new media</p>
<p begin="01:35:56.239" end="01:35:59.119" style="s2">that that&#39;s a big challenge because</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.159" end="01:36:00.800" style="s2">actually at the end of the day it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:59.119" end="01:36:02.000" style="s2">great to write a book and summarize your</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.800" end="01:36:03.440" style="s2">work at least somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.000" end="01:36:04.800" style="s2">that&#39;s why you put the books out there</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.440" end="01:36:06.560" style="s2">if you&#39;re a philosopher but i would</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.800" end="01:36:08.000" style="s2">strongly recommend you to self-publish</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.560" end="01:36:09.360" style="s2">your work i would strongly recommend you</p>
<p begin="01:36:08.000" end="01:36:10.239" style="s2">to leave academia as soon as you</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.360" end="01:36:11.920" style="s2">possibly can</p>
<p begin="01:36:10.239" end="01:36:13.440" style="s2">i strongly recommend you read as much as</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.920" end="01:36:14.800" style="s2">you possibly can get as deep into</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.440" end="01:36:16.960" style="s2">philosophy as you can</p>
<p begin="01:36:14.800" end="01:36:19.360" style="s2">and express your own way of doing it</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.960" end="01:36:20.719" style="s2">like find yourself on the bigger tribal</p>

<p begin="01:36:20.719" end="01:36:25.840" style="s2">what exactly is it that you could pursue</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.679" end="01:36:26.639" style="s2">and philosophize on and then write about</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.840" end="01:36:30.159" style="s2">and express</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.639" end="01:36:31.679" style="s2">and then do it from a digital physical</p>

<p begin="01:36:34.000" end="01:36:41.920" style="s2">than investing academia today</p>
<p begin="01:36:38.000" end="01:36:44.560" style="s2">right now we have a question by</p>

<p begin="01:37:43.280" end="01:37:48.320" style="s2">just heard from you you seem to see</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.600" end="01:37:49.280" style="s2">the groups elsewhere sociologically and</p>

<p begin="01:37:56.719" end="01:38:00.639" style="s2">um go ahead very good question actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:59.280" end="01:38:02.880" style="s2">there are a couple of questions in there</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.639" end="01:38:04.560" style="s2">yes i am very familiar with gibson</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.880" end="01:38:05.920" style="s2">graves work and i deeply prove it i</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.560" end="01:38:07.920" style="s2">think it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.920" end="01:38:09.679" style="s2">i i you know i&#39;m an old fan of ken</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.920" end="01:38:11.040" style="s2">wilber at least as a psychologist i</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.679" end="01:38:12.239" style="s2">think it&#39;s brilliant and i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.040" end="01:38:14.480" style="s2">very useful</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.239" end="01:38:15.280" style="s2">but when it comes to the philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.480" end="01:38:17.760" style="s2">itself this</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.280" end="01:38:19.520" style="s2">eagerness for integration sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.760" end="01:38:20.960" style="s2">tries to jump to the integration and</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.520" end="01:38:22.639" style="s2">doesn&#39;t realize that you always pay a</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.960" end="01:38:25.679" style="s2">price when you do that</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.639" end="01:38:27.840" style="s2">uh to begin with traditional modernist</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.679" end="01:38:30.719" style="s2">and green post modern cultures here</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.840" end="01:38:31.760" style="s2">are very much from the old paradigm for</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.719" end="01:38:33.360" style="s2">example um</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.760" end="01:38:35.280" style="s2">when it comes to the green issues that</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.360" end="01:38:37.040" style="s2">are very adamant you know they need to</p>

<p begin="01:38:37.040" end="01:38:39.520" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.679" end="01:38:40.639" style="s2">i&#39;m much more echotopian than i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="01:38:39.520" end="01:38:42.320" style="s2">environmentalist because the</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.639" end="01:38:44.080" style="s2">environmentalism ended up as sort of a</p>

<p begin="01:38:47.600" end="01:38:51.119" style="s2">but that doesn&#39;t solve the issues the</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.600" end="01:38:52.239" style="s2">way to solve this is develop new</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.119" end="01:38:54.320" style="s2">technologies</p>
<p begin="01:38:52.239" end="01:38:55.840" style="s2">that actually solve the issues it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.320" end="01:38:57.280" style="s2">kind of weird to use technologies</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.840" end="01:38:58.400" style="s2">against something that partly blame</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.280" end="01:39:00.639" style="s2">technology for</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.400" end="01:39:02.159" style="s2">but i think a culture of exploitation</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.639" end="01:39:03.119" style="s2">can be replaced with the culture of</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.159" end="01:39:04.320" style="s2">implotation</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.119" end="01:39:06.159" style="s2">that&#39;s something we worked on in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.320" end="01:39:07.920" style="s2">nethercrafts 20 years ago once you</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.159" end="01:39:10.560" style="s2">understand the principle implotation</p>
<p begin="01:39:07.920" end="01:39:12.159" style="s2">you then have implotation within systems</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.560" end="01:39:13.760" style="s2">from anything you build say algorithms</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.159" end="01:39:16.480" style="s2">anything else use implotation</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.760" end="01:39:18.400" style="s2">as a principle the system in itself must</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.480" end="01:39:19.119" style="s2">be sustainable you build the system in</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.400" end="01:39:20.960" style="s2">such a way</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.119" end="01:39:22.800" style="s2">that if the system is still around</p>
<p begin="01:39:20.960" end="01:39:24.080" style="s2">around 100 years from now you built it</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.800" end="01:39:26.480" style="s2">the right way</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.080" end="01:39:28.560" style="s2">okay so implotation can be used as a</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.480" end="01:39:29.600" style="s2">principle then you discover that with</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.560" end="01:39:31.440" style="s2">equitopianism</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.600" end="01:39:33.199" style="s2">and maybe fourth generation nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.440" end="01:39:34.960" style="s2">power which environmentalists in europe</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.199" end="01:39:36.719" style="s2">are aggressively against because they go</p>
<p begin="01:39:34.960" end="01:39:38.400" style="s2">for wind and solar power or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.719" end="01:39:40.239" style="s2">they also hate genetically modified</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.400" end="01:39:42.080" style="s2">foods or maybe genetically modified</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.239" end="01:39:43.840" style="s2">foods in 2030 it&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.080" end="01:39:46.080" style="s2">that it was in 1992.</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.840" end="01:39:47.600" style="s2">so you cannot just ban future</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.080" end="01:39:48.719" style="s2">technologies outright because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:39:47.600" end="01:39:50.719" style="s2">scared of them</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.719" end="01:39:53.440" style="s2">that&#39;s a dystopian attitude you need a</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.719" end="01:39:55.679" style="s2">utopian or even a better a protopin</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.440" end="01:39:57.119" style="s2">more playful attitude towards technology</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.679" end="01:39:59.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s from an echotopium</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.119" end="01:40:00.800" style="s2">and equitopianism is an idea that grew</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.199" end="01:40:03.520" style="s2">out of the digital environment</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.800" end="01:40:05.679" style="s2">it didn&#39;t come from out of an attempt to</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.520" end="01:40:06.480" style="s2">integrate environmentalism with its</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.679" end="01:40:08.880" style="s2">opponents which</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.480" end="01:40:10.239" style="s2">essentially climate change deniers</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.880" end="01:40:12.159" style="s2">rather environmentalism</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.239" end="01:40:13.600" style="s2">ended up debating the climate change</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.159" end="01:40:15.360" style="s2">deniers endlessly</p>
<p begin="01:40:13.600" end="01:40:18.159" style="s2">because environmentalism itself had</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.360" end="01:40:19.520" style="s2">become too authoritarian</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.159" end="01:40:21.600" style="s2">now the second you stopping in</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.520" end="01:40:23.520" style="s2">authoritarian allow for difference</p>
<p begin="01:40:21.600" end="01:40:25.440" style="s2">rather than integration allow for more</p>

<p begin="01:40:26.719" end="01:40:30.639" style="s2">you discover that actually you silence</p>

<p begin="01:40:30.639" end="01:40:34.400" style="s2">side that wins the game but it wins the</p>
<p begin="01:40:32.719" end="01:40:37.600" style="s2">game by actually moving on</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.400" end="01:40:39.679" style="s2">to a new higher dialectical level</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.600" end="01:40:41.440" style="s2">that is to really understand hegelian</p>

<p begin="01:40:43.119" end="01:40:47.600" style="s2">and i think my response to that is that</p>

<p begin="01:42:22.320" end="01:42:25.440" style="s2">because there was a deep platforming</p>

<p begin="01:42:28.560" end="01:42:31.679" style="s2">i could tell you that will be in culture</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.159" end="01:42:34.159" style="s2">is a really dangerous place you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:42:36.080" end="01:42:40.000" style="s2">well yeah that that was the debacle as</p>

<p begin="01:42:40.000" end="01:42:45.119" style="s2">germany in regard of the</p>

<p begin="01:42:47.920" end="01:42:54.719" style="s2">uh were you of course and so it was just</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.119" end="01:42:57.119" style="s2">it is like the the spirit of debate</p>
<p begin="01:42:54.719" end="01:42:58.000" style="s2">and discourse which should be like the</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.119" end="01:43:01.760" style="s2">prerogative</p>
<p begin="01:42:58.000" end="01:43:05.280" style="s2">of an integral community was hijacked by</p>

<p begin="01:43:08.560" end="01:43:13.280" style="s2">saying but in a way</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.639" end="01:43:14.880" style="s2">wasn&#39;t fit to debate you actually</p>
<p begin="01:43:13.280" end="01:43:16.639" style="s2">although this option was on the table</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.880" end="01:43:19.199" style="s2">but he flat out declined</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.639" end="01:43:20.000" style="s2">and so you see where where the wind was</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.199" end="01:43:22.800" style="s2">blowing from</p>
<p begin="01:43:20.000" end="01:43:24.080" style="s2">you know so that&#39;s what i don&#39;t do i</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.800" end="01:43:25.679" style="s2">debate with everybody</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.080" end="01:43:26.960" style="s2">at all times and you know as long as i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.679" end="01:43:29.040" style="s2">being treated with respect to people</p>
<p begin="01:43:26.960" end="01:43:30.080" style="s2">into some dialogue i can debate with</p>

<p begin="01:43:30.080" end="01:43:33.360" style="s2">that&#39;s called democracy something we</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.760" end="01:43:34.800" style="s2">should be proud of we created in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.360" end="01:43:37.280" style="s2">previous paradigm we&#39;re now</p>
<p begin="01:43:34.800" end="01:43:38.719" style="s2">trying to save and construct a new</p>
<p begin="01:43:37.280" end="01:43:40.320" style="s2">version of it that actually works in</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.719" end="01:43:41.920" style="s2">digital realm we haven&#39;t really figured</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.320" end="01:43:44.080" style="s2">that out yet but i think uh</p>
<p begin="01:43:41.920" end="01:43:45.920" style="s2">a system of plurality because plurality</p>
<p begin="01:43:44.080" end="01:43:47.119" style="s2">is good in itself plurality is good for</p>
<p begin="01:43:45.920" end="01:43:49.040" style="s2">creativity</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.119" end="01:43:50.880" style="s2">and says we need to be pro-topian in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:49.040" end="01:43:52.800" style="s2">future you know not reach for utopia</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.880" end="01:43:53.119" style="s2">british or protopias kevin kelly calls</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.800" end="01:43:54.800" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:43:53.119" end="01:43:56.880" style="s2">and i think the protopin ideas could</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.800" end="01:43:58.000" style="s2">foster a sense of plurals and socrates</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.880" end="01:43:59.840" style="s2">the model for the future</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.000" end="01:44:01.840" style="s2">we&#39;re working on it it&#39;s not easy you</p>
<p begin="01:43:59.840" end="01:44:03.280" style="s2">know but we we all the chilean pings of</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.840" end="01:44:05.040" style="s2">the world an answer</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.280" end="01:44:06.719" style="s2">we all the fake fellas of the world</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.040" end="01:44:08.639" style="s2">answer what authentic phallic power</p>
<p begin="01:44:06.719" end="01:44:09.920" style="s2">could look like in the digital age</p>
<p begin="01:44:08.639" end="01:44:12.320" style="s2">and it&#39;s gonna take us a while to get</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.920" end="01:44:15.679" style="s2">there but that&#39;s the real challenge</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.320" end="01:44:18.960" style="s2">okay we have two more questions so</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.679" end="01:44:21.440" style="s2">or three again um so i start with</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.960" end="01:44:22.400" style="s2">anton you talk a lot about different</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.440" end="01:44:25.119" style="s2">archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.400" end="01:44:26.159" style="s2">in the tribe you often mentioned the</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.119" end="01:44:28.159" style="s2">trickster</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.159" end="01:44:29.520" style="s2">what other archetypes are there and what</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.159" end="01:44:33.520" style="s2">roles do you think they play</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.520" end="01:44:35.360" style="s2">in modern society very good question and</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.520" end="01:44:36.000" style="s2">very good question in the sense that i</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.360" end="01:44:39.040" style="s2">will not</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.000" end="01:44:40.880" style="s2">answer to it fully uh we are not</p>
<p begin="01:44:39.040" end="01:44:43.600" style="s2">anthropologists and we don&#39;t pretend we</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.880" end="01:44:45.679" style="s2">are so we do philosophically speaking as</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.600" end="01:44:47.119" style="s2">we launch the tribal mapping model and</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.679" end="01:44:48.560" style="s2">says this is a better</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.119" end="01:44:50.880" style="s2">model to understand human beings than</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.560" end="01:44:52.719" style="s2">going to individual psychology which</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.880" end="01:44:54.239" style="s2">makes no sense at all that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.719" end="01:44:55.920" style="s2">psychologists failed</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.239" end="01:44:57.440" style="s2">there are psychologists to realize this</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.920" end="01:44:58.639" style="s2">greg enriquez and america and some other</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.440" end="01:44:59.199" style="s2">psychologists doing great work at the</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.639" end="01:45:00.800" style="s2">moment and</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.199" end="01:45:02.400" style="s2">trying to revolutionize psychology</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.800" end="01:45:03.679" style="s2">because he got stuck in the individual&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.400" end="01:45:04.639" style="s2">paradigm where human beings should not</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.679" end="01:45:07.600" style="s2">be in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.639" end="01:45:08.960" style="s2">so travel mapping helps it also helps to</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.600" end="01:45:11.199" style="s2">sort out why</p>
<p begin="01:45:08.960" end="01:45:13.520" style="s2">the shamanic castes suddenly became rock</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.199" end="01:45:16.159" style="s2">stars and idols in a culture that had no</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.520" end="01:45:17.040" style="s2">other men especially or proper women to</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.159" end="01:45:18.560" style="s2">look up to</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.040" end="01:45:20.960" style="s2">we were missing the patriarchs and the</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.560" end="01:45:22.400" style="s2">matriarchs in a youth worshiping culture</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.960" end="01:45:23.840" style="s2">and what we learned from the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.400" end="01:45:24.880" style="s2">century is that when you go for youth</p>
<p begin="01:45:23.840" end="01:45:27.199" style="s2">worship instead of</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.880" end="01:45:28.000" style="s2">wisdom worship which is incredibly rare</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.199" end="01:45:30.239" style="s2">in history and</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.000" end="01:45:32.080" style="s2">very dangerous when you start worshiping</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.239" end="01:45:34.080" style="s2">youth you tend to worship youth when</p>
<p begin="01:45:32.080" end="01:45:34.960" style="s2">they behave in a shamanic or androgynous</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.080" end="01:45:36.880" style="s2">manner</p>
<p begin="01:45:34.960" end="01:45:39.040" style="s2">that&#39;s not for everybody the thing with</p>
<p begin="01:45:36.880" end="01:45:40.960" style="s2">androgynous cast that i celebrated but</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.040" end="01:45:42.639" style="s2">just like camille pogba said that</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.960" end="01:45:44.800" style="s2">yeah but androgynous characters are</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.639" end="01:45:46.400" style="s2">meant to be a minority and they&#39;re meant</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.800" end="01:45:48.239" style="s2">to be the go between between men and</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.400" end="01:45:49.119" style="s2">women and we need them precisely for</p>
<p begin="01:45:48.239" end="01:45:50.159" style="s2">that reason</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.119" end="01:45:52.400" style="s2">and that&#39;s also where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:45:50.159" end="01:45:55.440" style="s2">comfortable in any culture so i think</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.400" end="01:45:56.239" style="s2">getting the tribal map right is what we</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.440" end="01:45:57.760" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.239" end="01:46:00.719" style="s2">and i think it&#39;s up then to</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.760" end="01:46:03.119" style="s2">anthropologists and archetypologists</p>
<p begin="01:46:00.719" end="01:46:04.239" style="s2">to find the exact archetypes for people</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.119" end="01:46:07.040" style="s2">to identify with</p>
<p begin="01:46:04.239" end="01:46:10.840" style="s2">but that&#39;s deeper social scientific work</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.040" end="01:46:12.639" style="s2">that not necessarily philosophers should</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.840" end="01:46:15.840" style="s2">undertake all right</p>
<p begin="01:46:12.639" end="01:46:19.199" style="s2">i think we have a last question now from</p>
<p begin="01:46:15.840" end="01:46:21.520" style="s2">miran it reads since the techno</p>
<p begin="01:46:19.199" end="01:46:22.800" style="s2">uh since the technologic imperative is a</p>
<p begin="01:46:21.520" end="01:46:25.520" style="s2">driving force</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.800" end="01:46:27.360" style="s2">and technology is highly militarized and</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.520" end="01:46:30.400" style="s2">used as tool for conquering</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.360" end="01:46:32.000" style="s2">and control especially in a faustic in a</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.400" end="01:46:34.239" style="s2">fausti culture</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.000" end="01:46:35.520" style="s2">who could control the technicians will</p>
<p begin="01:46:34.239" end="01:46:38.239" style="s2">technicians hire</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.520" end="01:46:39.440" style="s2">their own priesthood holding them away</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.239" end="01:46:42.400" style="s2">from what you call</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.440" end="01:46:43.760" style="s2">the barrett absolute yeah it&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.400" end="01:46:45.040" style="s2">borrowed abstract it&#39;s actually constant</p>
<p begin="01:46:43.760" end="01:46:46.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the digital limited block</p>
<p begin="01:46:45.040" end="01:46:50.639" style="s2">we&#39;re exploring it for the next book</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.880" end="01:46:52.639" style="s2">so um the problem is whenever you ask</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.639" end="01:46:54.560" style="s2">somebody to control somebody else you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:46:52.639" end="01:46:56.320" style="s2">gonna go for authoritarianism in two</p>
<p begin="01:46:54.560" end="01:46:58.400" style="s2">seconds because otherwise how would they</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.320" end="01:47:01.600" style="s2">be controlled i don&#39;t think we can</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.400" end="01:47:03.119" style="s2">control the military through elections</p>
<p begin="01:47:01.600" end="01:47:05.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve learned that because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:47:03.119" end="01:47:06.960" style="s2">it falls apart we can also not control</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.440" end="01:47:10.159" style="s2">the military with other means</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.960" end="01:47:11.280" style="s2">it is a difficult institution but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.159" end="01:47:13.360" style="s2">an institution that</p>
<p begin="01:47:11.280" end="01:47:14.800" style="s2">should protect us from outside threats</p>
<p begin="01:47:13.360" end="01:47:16.560" style="s2">for example</p>
<p begin="01:47:14.800" end="01:47:18.080" style="s2">you can hold the military responsible</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.560" end="01:47:20.159" style="s2">for the failures when it comes to</p>

<p begin="01:47:36.080" end="01:47:39.520" style="s2">the military would get a you know give</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.080" end="01:47:41.520" style="s2">them something to do</p>

<p begin="01:47:45.600" end="01:47:48.880" style="s2">you give them a new responsibility they</p>

<p begin="01:47:55.520" end="01:47:59.600" style="s2">yes china and america are now so mad</p>
<p begin="01:47:58.159" end="01:48:00.800" style="s2">they could go to war with one another</p>

<p begin="01:48:20.639" end="01:48:24.159" style="s2">because the only way you get rid of a</p>

<p begin="01:48:24.800" end="01:48:29.280" style="s2">you get a north korean system and the</p>

<p begin="01:48:29.280" end="01:48:33.920" style="s2">was for communist china to turn into a</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.520" end="01:48:35.440" style="s2">massive huge communist north korea</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.920" end="01:48:37.600" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what china is heading</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.440" end="01:48:39.119" style="s2">today that&#39;s why the system is unstable</p>
<p begin="01:48:37.600" end="01:48:39.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s what&#39;s threatening to world</p>

<p begin="01:48:39.760" end="01:48:43.600" style="s2">the problem is that no matter who&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:48:41.360" end="01:48:45.840" style="s2">the white house if it gives in to the</p>

<p begin="01:48:45.840" end="01:48:48.880" style="s2">because it&#39;s corrupted by them</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.119" end="01:48:51.040" style="s2">or if you place around like a little boy</p>
<p begin="01:48:48.880" end="01:48:51.840" style="s2">with a bunch of toys like like uh donald</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.040" end="01:48:53.199" style="s2">trump would</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.840" end="01:48:54.960" style="s2">the problem is that any of these two</p>

<p begin="01:48:55.440" end="01:48:59.199" style="s2">that&#39;s how bad the situation is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.080" end="01:49:00.719" style="s2">very real</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.199" end="01:49:02.480" style="s2">because otherwise i would have said a</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.719" end="01:49:04.080" style="s2">few years ago that the real threat in</p>
<p begin="01:49:02.480" end="01:49:05.840" style="s2">the 21st century</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.080" end="01:49:07.679" style="s2">is that the atomic bomb gets spread</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.840" end="01:49:08.080" style="s2">across the planet and the people start</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.679" end="01:49:10.080" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:08.080" end="01:49:12.400" style="s2">innovative about it and then think they</p>
<p begin="01:49:10.080" end="01:49:15.040" style="s2">can create atomic bombs that only have</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.400" end="01:49:17.040" style="s2">local damage done and as soon as you</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.040" end="01:49:17.679" style="s2">create atomic bombs that only do local</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.040" end="01:49:20.239" style="s2">damage</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.679" end="01:49:21.920" style="s2">and you put them on a drone the military</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.239" end="01:49:24.000" style="s2">has got the new favorite weapon they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:49:21.920" end="01:49:26.239" style="s2">looking for which is ascend the drone</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.000" end="01:49:27.440" style="s2">and not sacrifice a single soldier&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.239" end="01:49:29.199" style="s2">life from their own army</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.440" end="01:49:30.719" style="s2">but actually send a drone into the</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.199" end="01:49:33.679" style="s2">community they&#39;re fighting and then kill</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.719" end="01:49:36.239" style="s2">tons of people with an atomic bomb</p>
<p begin="01:49:33.679" end="01:49:37.840" style="s2">the worst thing is though if you think</p>
<p begin="01:49:36.239" end="01:49:39.840" style="s2">of the recipes it takes to create an</p>
<p begin="01:49:37.840" end="01:49:41.599" style="s2">atomic bomb that iran saudi arabia and</p>
<p begin="01:49:39.840" end="01:49:42.239" style="s2">turkey are chasing probably from corrupt</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.599" end="01:49:44.080" style="s2">pakistan</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.239" end="01:49:46.000" style="s2">engineers at the moment meaning the tank</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.080" end="01:49:47.760" style="s2">bomb is very likely going to spread</p>
<p begin="01:49:46.000" end="01:49:49.679" style="s2">this is still to me and john a bigger</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.760" end="01:49:51.440" style="s2">threat to world peace than climate</p>
<p begin="01:49:49.679" end="01:49:53.280" style="s2">change the biggest threat is still</p>
<p begin="01:49:51.440" end="01:49:55.679" style="s2">the spreading of the nuclear bomb so</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.280" end="01:49:58.080" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a phallic pharmacome</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.679" end="01:49:59.599" style="s2">we both believe in nuclear power more</p>
<p begin="01:49:58.080" end="01:50:00.960" style="s2">than most people do when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:49:59.599" end="01:50:02.880" style="s2">solving the planet&#39;s issues</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.960" end="01:50:04.239" style="s2">we also think the spreading of nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.880" end="01:50:05.520" style="s2">bombs is a much bigger threat than</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.239" end="01:50:07.440" style="s2">people have realized</p>
<p begin="01:50:05.520" end="01:50:08.960" style="s2">so we&#39;re back at the 1980s and realized</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.440" end="01:50:09.760" style="s2">that nuclear bombs is the biggest threat</p>
<p begin="01:50:08.960" end="01:50:11.760" style="s2">of them all</p>
<p begin="01:50:09.760" end="01:50:13.199" style="s2">because if you make a nuclear bomb in</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.760" end="01:50:14.960" style="s2">the nearby future</p>
<p begin="01:50:13.199" end="01:50:16.880" style="s2">in a more smart technology than you have</p>
<p begin="01:50:14.960" end="01:50:18.159" style="s2">in the past and you put the nuclear bomb</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.880" end="01:50:21.280" style="s2">on a drone</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.159" end="01:50:21.599" style="s2">this is perfect for any terrorists to</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.280" end="01:50:23.360" style="s2">set</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.599" end="01:50:25.599" style="s2">up from anywhere in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.360" end="01:50:27.599" style="s2">straight into a community full of people</p>
<p begin="01:50:25.599" end="01:50:28.880" style="s2">and kick down not just skyscrapers but a</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.599" end="01:50:31.119" style="s2">whole city</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.880" end="01:50:31.920" style="s2">and then smither it all with nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.119" end="01:50:34.480" style="s2">material</p>
<p begin="01:50:31.920" end="01:50:36.080" style="s2">so i think that that threat is very real</p>
<p begin="01:50:34.480" end="01:50:37.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s one of the problems when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:36.080" end="01:50:39.280" style="s2">advocating anarchy and openness on the</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.920" end="01:50:40.400" style="s2">online world it&#39;s going to be that</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.280" end="01:50:40.719" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to fight these guys saying</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.400" end="01:50:42.159" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:50:40.719" end="01:50:43.760" style="s2">well if you openness of blood we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.159" end="01:50:45.360" style="s2">going to terrorist sex to create nuclear</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.760" end="01:50:48.080" style="s2">bombs on drones very soon</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.360" end="01:50:49.520" style="s2">i was like yeah so fortunately yeah</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.080" end="01:50:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a major problem</p>
<p begin="01:50:49.520" end="01:50:53.840" style="s2">one of the biggest problems of the next</p>
<p begin="01:50:50.880" end="01:50:53.840" style="s2">100 years</p>
<p begin="01:50:54.239" end="01:51:00.480" style="s2">all right so um one last question by</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.920" end="01:51:01.520" style="s2">aurelian but before that can you just</p>
<p begin="01:51:00.480" end="01:51:03.599" style="s2">for because nick</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.520" end="01:51:06.080" style="s2">had an additional question just in a</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.599" end="01:51:07.840" style="s2">couple of sentences could you expand and</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.080" end="01:51:11.280" style="s2">what you mean with the bad</p>
<p begin="01:51:07.840" end="01:51:12.960" style="s2">absolute the bard absolute okay the</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.280" end="01:51:17.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not barred like my name it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.960" end="01:51:19.920" style="s2">b-a-r-d it&#39;s b-a-r-r-e-d</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.040" end="01:51:21.360" style="s2">like enclosed okay the bard absolute</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.920" end="01:51:22.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s called because the</p>
<p begin="01:51:21.360" end="01:51:25.840" style="s2">opposite of that is the bard</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.800" end="01:51:28.400" style="s2">subject in lacan in psych analysis</p>
<p begin="01:51:25.840" end="01:51:31.040" style="s2">you don&#39;t have insight into yourself</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.400" end="01:51:33.280" style="s2">your subject is invisible to you</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.040" end="01:51:35.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s called the bard subject and the</p>
<p begin="01:51:33.280" end="01:51:37.280" style="s2">opposite of that is the part absolute so</p>
<p begin="01:51:35.040" end="01:51:39.360" style="s2">if you think of the bird subject</p>
<p begin="01:51:37.280" end="01:51:41.040" style="s2">then there must also be barred objects</p>
<p begin="01:51:39.360" end="01:51:43.040" style="s2">it&#39;s called the object</p>
<p begin="01:51:41.040" end="01:51:44.320" style="s2">in in psychoanalysis shackle khan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:43.040" end="01:51:46.320" style="s2">french meaning that</p>
<p begin="01:51:44.320" end="01:51:47.760" style="s2">the object is never accessible to you</p>
<p begin="01:51:46.320" end="01:51:49.280" style="s2">you chase it all the time</p>
<p begin="01:51:47.760" end="01:51:50.880" style="s2">this is the one obviously chase it could</p>
<p begin="01:51:49.280" end="01:51:52.480" style="s2">be another person you want to fall in</p>
<p begin="01:51:50.880" end="01:51:53.679" style="s2">love with somebody it could be an object</p>
<p begin="01:51:52.480" end="01:51:54.560" style="s2">you&#39;re obsessed with but you&#39;re always</p>

<p begin="01:51:54.560" end="01:51:57.840" style="s2">object an object that&#39;s prior to all</p>
<p begin="01:51:56.320" end="01:51:59.520" style="s2">other objects in your life</p>
<p begin="01:51:57.840" end="01:52:02.159" style="s2">so that&#39;s the part of it now if you just</p>
<p begin="01:51:59.520" end="01:52:03.440" style="s2">move that to the next phase then you get</p>
<p begin="01:52:02.159" end="01:52:05.280" style="s2">the barred absolute</p>
<p begin="01:52:03.440" end="01:52:07.280" style="s2">and what that means is that the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.280" end="01:52:09.040" style="s2">is the ultimate horizon</p>

<p begin="01:52:11.440" end="01:52:15.679" style="s2">people say god or something like that</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.880" end="01:52:18.960" style="s2">but if you think through it thoroughly</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.679" end="01:52:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s not to be god but the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:52:18.960" end="01:52:22.320" style="s2">absolute absolute ultimate arise of your</p>
<p begin="01:52:20.800" end="01:52:24.159" style="s2">life is called the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.320" end="01:52:26.239" style="s2">now imagine then that you live in a</p>
<p begin="01:52:24.159" end="01:52:28.080" style="s2">culture where the elderly tell you</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.239" end="01:52:30.159" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually have access to the</p>
<p begin="01:52:28.080" end="01:52:31.599" style="s2">bar to the absolute it&#39;s barred to you</p>
<p begin="01:52:30.159" end="01:52:33.520" style="s2">you cannot have access to it because</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.599" end="01:52:34.320" style="s2">your subjectivity is barred then one of</p>
<p begin="01:52:33.520" end="01:52:37.119" style="s2">the absolute</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.320" end="01:52:40.000" style="s2">and this is foundational for the</p>

<p begin="01:52:40.000" end="01:52:44.480" style="s2">whereas islamic christianity broke with</p>

<p begin="01:52:44.480" end="01:52:48.719" style="s2">the absolute is accessible to us we can</p>
<p begin="01:52:46.560" end="01:52:50.800" style="s2">all pray directly to god without going</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.719" end="01:52:53.760" style="s2">to any go betweens that also means god</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.800" end="01:52:55.760" style="s2">has absolute and direct access to us</p>
<p begin="01:52:53.760" end="01:52:57.679" style="s2">for good or bad i would say that islam</p>
<p begin="01:52:55.760" end="01:52:58.719" style="s2">is a religion where god has access to us</p>
<p begin="01:52:57.679" end="01:53:00.159" style="s2">and we have to behave</p>
<p begin="01:52:58.719" end="01:53:01.840" style="s2">and in christianity we have access to</p>
<p begin="01:53:00.159" end="01:53:03.440" style="s2">god at all times so we can always go to</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.840" end="01:53:03.920" style="s2">god and he will always be interested in</p>

<p begin="01:53:08.800" end="01:53:11.840" style="s2">god will sit there bored on his cloud</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.480" end="01:53:15.119" style="s2">looked down on us and said</p>

<p begin="01:53:17.119" end="01:53:20.880" style="s2">question god right so if you have the</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.560" end="01:53:22.880" style="s2">sort of vulgar idea of divine love</p>
<p begin="01:53:20.880" end="01:53:24.000" style="s2">then that is there&#39;s no absolute there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:53:27.119" end="01:53:30.719" style="s2">i think that is a dysfunctional idea of</p>

<p begin="01:53:30.719" end="01:53:33.840" style="s2">as a dysfunctional human beings operate</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.199" end="01:53:36.080" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.840" end="01:53:37.360" style="s2">when you&#39;re a child adulthood has to be</p>

<p begin="01:53:37.360" end="01:53:40.639" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly what we don&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.639" end="01:53:42.400" style="s2">pornography to kids so we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.639" end="01:53:43.920" style="s2">them to be thrown into battlefields with</p>
<p begin="01:53:42.400" end="01:53:45.119" style="s2">outer violence to kill people</p>
<p begin="01:53:43.920" end="01:53:47.599" style="s2">we don&#39;t want our children to become</p>
<p begin="01:53:45.119" end="01:53:49.119" style="s2">murderers and porn stars right</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.599" end="01:53:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s precisely because we keep them</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.119" end="01:53:51.520" style="s2">out of the pathic realm until they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:53:50.960" end="01:53:53.920" style="s2">grown up</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.520" end="01:53:54.560" style="s2">enough to understand what that is that</p>

<p begin="01:53:54.560" end="01:53:59.119" style="s2">that realm is barred that means the</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.360" end="01:54:00.960" style="s2">adulthood is barred for children it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:59.119" end="01:54:03.199" style="s2">something they look up to and aspire to</p>
<p begin="01:54:00.960" end="01:54:05.040" style="s2">and when they&#39;re ready for it they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.199" end="01:54:05.679" style="s2">allowed to write a passage in our</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.040" end="01:54:08.000" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="01:54:05.679" end="01:54:10.159" style="s2">to go from childhood into adulthood and</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.000" end="01:54:10.639" style="s2">the adulthood is no longer barred from</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.159" end="01:54:12.320" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:54:10.639" end="01:54:14.000" style="s2">but then when you&#39;re an adulthood</p>
<p begin="01:54:12.320" end="01:54:14.639" style="s2">there&#39;s certainly a lot of shamanic</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.000" end="01:54:16.239" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="01:54:14.639" end="01:54:18.320" style="s2">barred from you there&#39;s certain things</p>
<p begin="01:54:16.239" end="01:54:20.080" style="s2">you&#39;re not allowed to do enough grown up</p>
<p begin="01:54:18.320" end="01:54:22.239" style="s2">and they&#39;re for good reasons probably</p>
<p begin="01:54:20.080" end="01:54:23.760" style="s2">so the elders and the shamans do certain</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.239" end="01:54:24.800" style="s2">things you don&#39;t do as an adult and then</p>
<p begin="01:54:23.760" end="01:54:26.639" style="s2">you move on</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.800" end="01:54:27.840" style="s2">so the broad absolute is always what</p>
<p begin="01:54:26.639" end="01:54:29.360" style="s2">escapes you</p>
<p begin="01:54:27.840" end="01:54:32.000" style="s2">that you don&#39;t have the right to have</p>

<p begin="01:54:32.000" end="01:54:37.520" style="s2">for it in eastern philosophy it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.119" end="01:54:38.159" style="s2">sutra and tantra i think those terms are</p>
<p begin="01:54:37.520" end="01:54:39.840" style="s2">wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.159" end="01:54:41.840" style="s2">i think we need to introduce them to the</p>
<p begin="01:54:39.840" end="01:54:43.440" style="s2">west properly to understand the shift</p>
<p begin="01:54:41.840" end="01:54:47.119" style="s2">between the sutra and the tonjin but</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.440" end="01:54:47.119" style="s2">this all deals with the bird absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:54:47.280" end="01:54:52.159" style="s2">all right so now we got to the last</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.760" end="01:54:55.520" style="s2">question of this wonderful evening</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.159" end="01:54:56.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="01:54:55.520" end="01:54:59.440" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.400" end="01:55:00.880" style="s2">uh it lingered all the way through what</p>
<p begin="01:54:59.440" end="01:55:02.400" style="s2">you were saying and</p>
<p begin="01:55:00.880" end="01:55:04.639" style="s2">and it&#39;s beautifully expressed here</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.400" end="01:55:07.040" style="s2">postmodernism in the terminology of</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.639" end="01:55:10.000" style="s2">digital libido is a project of pure</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.040" end="01:55:12.080" style="s2">multidinal death worship this is</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.000" end="01:55:12.719" style="s2">antithetical to nietzsche&#39;s ideal of the</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.080" end="01:55:15.360" style="s2">strong</p>
<p begin="01:55:12.719" end="01:55:16.400" style="s2">and fearlessly independent men i guess</p>
<p begin="01:55:15.360" end="01:55:18.400" style="s2">postmodernism</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.400" end="01:55:19.760" style="s2">postmodernism often cites nietzsche as</p>
<p begin="01:55:18.400" end="01:55:22.480" style="s2">one of its most</p>
<p begin="01:55:19.760" end="01:55:23.520" style="s2">main inspirations but it seems he would</p>
<p begin="01:55:22.480" end="01:55:26.080" style="s2">never want to be</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.520" end="01:55:26.960" style="s2">associated associated with what they are</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.080" end="01:55:30.239" style="s2">selling</p>
<p begin="01:55:26.960" end="01:55:32.719" style="s2">so what exactly has happened here i</p>
<p begin="01:55:30.239" end="01:55:33.760" style="s2">agree strongly okay it&#39;s a great comment</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.719" end="01:55:36.159" style="s2">from meridian</p>
<p begin="01:55:33.760" end="01:55:36.880" style="s2">i i usually say that postmodernism this</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.159" end="01:55:38.560" style="s2">is this may</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.880" end="01:55:40.400" style="s2">might be vulgar version of it since</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.560" end="01:55:42.159" style="s2">nobody agrees over postmodernism is we</p>
<p begin="01:55:40.400" end="01:55:46.400" style="s2">could just use it that way but</p>
<p begin="01:55:42.159" end="01:55:47.119" style="s2">um hitler ein rund or post modernism who</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.400" end="01:55:48.880" style="s2">was the most</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.119" end="01:55:50.320" style="s2">vulgar misinterpreter of nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:55:48.880" end="01:55:51.679" style="s2">apparently nietzsche is a guide a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.320" end="01:55:53.280" style="s2">people misunderstand</p>
<p begin="01:55:51.679" end="01:55:54.800" style="s2">they also do that with hegel they also</p>

<p begin="01:55:54.800" end="01:55:58.960" style="s2">marks and i&#39;ve come to believe that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:57.119" end="01:56:00.719" style="s2">a sign of the grandness of this thinker</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.960" end="01:56:01.599" style="s2">that they&#39;re being so misunderstood by</p>
<p begin="01:56:00.719" end="01:56:03.119" style="s2">so many people because</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.599" end="01:56:04.800" style="s2">there&#39;s something incredibly glamorous</p>
<p begin="01:56:03.119" end="01:56:07.119" style="s2">about them because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.800" end="01:56:08.480" style="s2">amazingly smart and productive so</p>
<p begin="01:56:07.119" end="01:56:09.760" style="s2">they&#39;re great philosophers and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.480" end="01:56:12.719" style="s2">why they&#39;re being misunderstood</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.760" end="01:56:14.000" style="s2">yes what nietzsche meant with this</p>
<p begin="01:56:12.719" end="01:56:16.560" style="s2">relativism was</p>
<p begin="01:56:14.000" end="01:56:18.080" style="s2">that he started to move the world around</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.560" end="01:56:20.320" style="s2">so he started realizing that</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.080" end="01:56:22.960" style="s2">there are relations in the world and</p>
<p begin="01:56:20.320" end="01:56:25.520" style="s2">these relations actually dictate</p>
<p begin="01:56:22.960" end="01:56:27.280" style="s2">how you value things and prior to</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.520" end="01:56:29.040" style="s2">nietzsche leibniz did this</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.280" end="01:56:30.880" style="s2">loudness did this with physics and it</p>
<p begin="01:56:29.040" end="01:56:33.040" style="s2">did with biology this with the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:30.880" end="01:56:35.119" style="s2">libras was the guy who said there is no</p>
<p begin="01:56:33.040" end="01:56:37.119" style="s2">actual center to the world</p>
<p begin="01:56:35.119" end="01:56:38.639" style="s2">the world is not spatial in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:56:37.119" end="01:56:40.320" style="s2">there are distances between</p>
<p begin="01:56:38.639" end="01:56:41.760" style="s2">objects and depending on which object</p>

<p begin="01:56:41.760" end="01:56:45.760" style="s2">that will be the center of your study</p>
<p begin="01:56:43.840" end="01:56:46.320" style="s2">but there is no center per se in the</p>

<p begin="01:56:46.320" end="01:56:50.639" style="s2">that was actually leibniz&#39;s genial idea</p>
<p begin="01:56:48.960" end="01:56:51.920" style="s2">already in the 17th century</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.639" end="01:56:53.280" style="s2">and if you follow all the way through</p>
<p begin="01:56:51.920" end="01:56:54.480" style="s2">from loudness up to niche you realize</p>
<p begin="01:56:53.280" end="01:56:56.239" style="s2">that nietzsche takes that sort of</p>

<p begin="01:56:56.239" end="01:57:00.400" style="s2">and he then attacks christian protestant</p>

<p begin="01:57:05.920" end="01:57:09.280" style="s2">and he also wants to go after what he</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.599" end="01:57:10.000" style="s2">thinks is the mismanagement of that type</p>
<p begin="01:57:09.280" end="01:57:12.159" style="s2">of culture</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.000" end="01:57:13.520" style="s2">he wants to go after the sort of naive</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.159" end="01:57:15.280" style="s2">platonist</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.520" end="01:57:16.800" style="s2">we call this a peter pan syndrome</p>
<p begin="01:57:15.280" end="01:57:18.560" style="s2">directed culture that he finds</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.800" end="01:57:20.000" style="s2">and instead look for something much more</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.560" end="01:57:21.360" style="s2">lively and thriving</p>
<p begin="01:57:20.000" end="01:57:23.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s why he goes into the</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.360" end="01:57:25.679" style="s2">dimension as opposed to apollonian and</p>
<p begin="01:57:23.920" end="01:57:27.520" style="s2">he discusses donation apollonian</p>
<p begin="01:57:25.679" end="01:57:29.840" style="s2">in our work that&#39;s a split phallus the</p>
<p begin="01:57:27.520" end="01:57:30.880" style="s2">apollonian is then the priestly and then</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.840" end="01:57:32.960" style="s2">the dimension is</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.880" end="01:57:34.480" style="s2">chieftain so we have these roles as well</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.960" end="01:57:36.080" style="s2">to split phallus that nietzsche talks</p>
<p begin="01:57:34.480" end="01:57:37.360" style="s2">about and we then split them in smaller</p>
<p begin="01:57:36.080" end="01:57:39.040" style="s2">parts that nietzsche didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.360" end="01:57:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what we do in our work so i agree</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.040" end="01:57:44.880" style="s2">with you strongly nietzsche is heroic</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.960" end="01:57:46.000" style="s2">and that&#39;s why i would never believe in</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.880" end="01:57:47.520" style="s2">a culture</p>
<p begin="01:57:46.000" end="01:57:49.599" style="s2">that ultimately says there are only</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.520" end="01:57:51.440" style="s2">victims and this is just a race towards</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.599" end="01:57:53.119" style="s2">the bottom that would be the total</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.440" end="01:57:55.360" style="s2">opposite of everything nietzsche stood</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.119" end="01:57:56.159" style="s2">for nietzsche is heroic he believes in</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.360" end="01:57:58.880" style="s2">the ubermensch</p>
<p begin="01:57:56.159" end="01:57:59.520" style="s2">and the ubermensch sets the standard for</p>
<p begin="01:57:58.880" end="01:58:02.400" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.520" end="01:58:04.320" style="s2">else in nietzsche&#39;s universe so there is</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.400" end="01:58:06.159" style="s2">a fixed point in nietzsche&#39;s ideal</p>
<p begin="01:58:04.320" end="01:58:08.159" style="s2">and that is to be and stay within the</p>
<p begin="01:58:06.159" end="01:58:09.520" style="s2">heroic realm and stay here wrong no</p>
<p begin="01:58:08.159" end="01:58:11.199" style="s2">matter what happens to you</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.520" end="01:58:12.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly why the most heroic</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.199" end="01:58:13.199" style="s2">person is not the people born to be</p>
<p begin="01:58:12.560" end="01:58:15.040" style="s2">heroes</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.199" end="01:58:16.960" style="s2">these are people who fight and struggle</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.040" end="01:58:17.599" style="s2">their entire lives and against the</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.960" end="01:58:19.119" style="s2">elements</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.599" end="01:58:21.119" style="s2">they establish themselves as being</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.119" end="01:58:23.280" style="s2">heroic and this is where i&#39;m strongly</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.119" end="01:58:25.040" style="s2">needs him this was my opposition against</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.280" end="01:58:26.080" style="s2">black lives matter i&#39;m totally pro</p>
<p begin="01:58:25.040" end="01:58:28.000" style="s2">martin luther king</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.080" end="01:58:30.000" style="s2">i&#39;m against black meta i think the shift</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.000" end="01:58:30.560" style="s2">between these two guys is the same shift</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.000" end="01:58:32.800" style="s2">we did</p>
<p begin="01:58:30.560" end="01:58:35.119" style="s2">when the west in europe left marx and</p>
<p begin="01:58:32.800" end="01:58:36.880" style="s2">went for rosso the same shift again</p>
<p begin="01:58:35.119" end="01:58:38.560" style="s2">because it was difficult to stay in the</p>
<p begin="01:58:36.880" end="01:58:40.320" style="s2">heroic people became</p>
<p begin="01:58:38.560" end="01:58:41.760" style="s2">lazy and arrogant and went for</p>
<p begin="01:58:40.320" end="01:58:43.280" style="s2">victimhood cults</p>
<p begin="01:58:41.760" end="01:58:46.080" style="s2">the problem that the victim would call</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.280" end="01:58:47.520" style="s2">tear us apart and will destroy us</p>
<p begin="01:58:46.080" end="01:58:49.199" style="s2">so i want to finish this off by just</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.520" end="01:58:50.639" style="s2">saying that the ultimate argument</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.199" end="01:58:51.920" style="s2">against post-modernism is actually not</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.639" end="01:58:53.119" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s but it&#39;s the hegelian</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.920" end="01:58:56.320" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.119" end="01:58:56.960" style="s2">when post-modernism says that there must</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.320" end="01:58:59.599" style="s2">not be</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.960" end="01:59:01.760" style="s2">any single truth it has just declared</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.599" end="01:59:03.920" style="s2">itself as that single truth</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.760" end="01:59:08.159" style="s2">and that&#39;s when you should really watch</p>
<p begin="01:59:03.920" end="01:59:08.159" style="s2">out for the tyrant and this lynch mob</p>
<p begin="01:59:09.199" end="01:59:16.080" style="s2">all right well i think we</p>
