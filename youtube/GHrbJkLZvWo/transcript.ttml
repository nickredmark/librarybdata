<p begin="00:00:04.680" end="00:00:09.380" style="s2">I wish to quickly it&#39;s about five</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:13.370" style="s2">minutes and I post the first take</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.380" end="00:00:18.830" style="s2">I wanted to talk about social anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.370" end="00:00:22.140" style="s2">which I have and I&#39;ve realized the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.830" end="00:00:26.699" style="s2">solution for myself is radical</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.140" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">acceptance that I&#39;m awkward okay with</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.699" end="00:00:32.130" style="s2">that that I say the wrong thing at the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:34.140" style="s2">wrong time and I single-sided deafness</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.130" end="00:00:35.790" style="s2">makes me awkward because people talk to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.140" end="00:00:38.399" style="s2">me on one side I don&#39;t do well in large</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">social situations and I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.399" end="00:00:42.510" style="s2">much better not in that have to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:46.050" style="s2">better in social situations but that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.510" end="00:00:50.820" style="s2">gonna probably have but I&#39;ve been more</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.050" end="00:00:52.829" style="s2">accepting of myself so what used to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.820" end="00:00:55.680" style="s2">like weeks of me obsessing about</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.829" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">something I said is like a second so I</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.680" end="00:00:59.280" style="s2">feel that like icky feeling and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">you know at least that like you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.280" end="00:01:02.670" style="s2">need to pull onto that if you said</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:04.409" style="s2">something actually problematic can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.670" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">think you offended someone and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.409" end="00:01:08.580" style="s2">want to have offended someone then</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:12.360" style="s2">apologize otherwise let it go they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.580" end="00:01:14.070" style="s2">probably not thinking about it and part</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.360" end="00:01:15.720" style="s2">of that is I think we&#39;re all exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.070" end="00:01:17.009" style="s2">that we&#39;re supposed to be so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.720" end="00:01:20.130" style="s2">supposed to be socially awkward</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.009" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">I&#39;m very strongly feel that I&#39;m exactly</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.130" end="00:01:23.430" style="s2">who I&#39;m supposed to be to do what I need</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">to do on this planet and so is everybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.430" end="00:01:26.340" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:28.920" style="s2">and we need to embrace our weirdness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.340" end="00:01:30.450" style="s2">one of the things one of the parenting</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.920" end="00:01:32.909" style="s2">Facebook groups I&#39;m part of which is</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.450" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">amazing had someone talking about their</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.909" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">child and how they were socially awkward</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:40.470" style="s2">as a kid and overweight and they worry</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">about their kid having the same the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.470" end="00:01:45.090" style="s2">problems and I strongly believe we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">to change the world my child is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.090" end="00:01:48.390" style="s2">socially awkward to me she&#39;s four so</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">she&#39;s still learning a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.390" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">about boundaries and personal space and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:53.970" style="s2">consents and stuff but she makes friends</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">everywhere she goes because I&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.970" end="00:01:58.710" style="s2">gotten out of her way and haven&#39;t put on</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.090" style="s2">the same steak my parents maybe put on</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.710" end="00:02:01.409" style="s2">me of like well don&#39;t do that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.090" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">gonna make friends and don&#39;t do that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.409" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">just let her be her amazing self and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:08.429" style="s2">do we do talk about kindness and about</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:11.340" style="s2">inclusion and and helping other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.429" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">and how she&#39;s so social and makes</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.340" end="00:02:15.209" style="s2">friends so easily and other people</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:19.470" style="s2">don&#39;t so maybe she can reach out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.209" end="00:02:23.060" style="s2">those people and just be aware of it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.470" end="00:02:25.319" style="s2">I think the more people with socially</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.060" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">advanced it&#39;s wrong word but like</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.319" end="00:02:32.099" style="s2">socially advanced children the more were</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:33.780" style="s2">able to put out there make the world a</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.099" end="00:02:35.370" style="s2">better place I mean I don&#39;t want to beat</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.780" end="00:02:37.379" style="s2">my kid into a mold so they don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.370" end="00:02:41.299" style="s2">picked on I need her to be strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.379" end="00:02:43.769" style="s2">that she can be her true self and not</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.299" end="00:02:45.450" style="s2">care what the world says because you</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.769" end="00:02:46.769" style="s2">can&#39;t be liked by everyone you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.450" end="00:02:49.109" style="s2">really boring if you were liked by</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.769" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">everyone and it&#39;s taken me into my 30s</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.109" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">to realize that truly to truly get that</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:57.030" style="s2">at a soul level that to find my people</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:02:59.430" style="s2">to find my community to find my soul</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.030" end="00:03:01.799" style="s2">mate or soul mates I have to be me</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.430" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">because the good the bad all of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.799" end="00:03:06.930" style="s2">because there is no if you fake it if</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:08.640" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to be something you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.930" end="00:03:11.340" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly striving to be more</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.640" end="00:03:13.890" style="s2">and striving to be different you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.340" end="00:03:16.049" style="s2">being you we don&#39;t need any a world</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.890" end="00:03:17.669" style="s2">automatons that are all that are all</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.049" end="00:03:22.769" style="s2">exactly the same we need to accept</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.669" end="00:03:25.049" style="s2">people for for who they are and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.769" end="00:03:28.709" style="s2">my solution to social anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.049" end="00:03:32.459" style="s2">I think another piece of that is Trump</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.709" end="00:03:35.250" style="s2">and realizing I mean I really dislike</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.459" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">Trump but I also see him as possibly the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.250" end="00:03:38.099" style="s2">most positive thing to be happening on</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:39.660" style="s2">this planet at the moment not because</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.099" end="00:03:42.120" style="s2">he&#39;s positive he&#39;s doing horrible</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.660" end="00:03:43.470" style="s2">horrible things but the catalyst he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.120" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">being for change</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.470" end="00:03:49.410" style="s2">assuming he doesn&#39;t start a nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">with North Korea it&#39;s just so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.410" end="00:03:53.370" style="s2">driving so many people to come together</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.810" end="00:03:54.900" style="s2">and realize that we can&#39;t trust our</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.370" end="00:03:56.280" style="s2">governments in the way we maybe have up</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.900" end="00:04:00.660" style="s2">to this point and we can&#39;t trust the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.280" end="00:04:02.519" style="s2">systems and he&#39;s such a repulsive human</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.660" end="00:04:05.099" style="s2">being but he&#39;s exactly who he&#39;s supposed</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.519" end="00:04:06.629" style="s2">to be and maybe in the moment when I say</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.099" end="00:04:08.599" style="s2">something stupid and I might offend</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.629" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">someone and I trigger them and write</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.599" end="00:04:12.870" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s supposed to happen maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">I&#39;d miss me go up there and be a troll</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.870" end="00:04:17.090" style="s2">and do things horribly I always come try</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:19.349" style="s2">to come from a place of love and</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.090" end="00:04:20.760" style="s2">acceptance and understanding and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.349" end="00:04:25.590" style="s2">sometimes it doesn&#39;t come off that way</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.760" end="00:04:27.990" style="s2">and to still examine it but not</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.590" end="00:04:31.530" style="s2">to it and something I&#39;m working on on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.990" end="00:04:34.949" style="s2">regular basis but I feel more free now</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.530" end="00:04:37.290" style="s2">my anxiety has greatly reduced with just</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.949" end="00:04:39.840" style="s2">the acceptance the radical acceptance of</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.290" end="00:04:40.919" style="s2">all of my quirks and all of my stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.840" end="00:04:44.220" style="s2">definitely got triggered yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.919" end="00:04:47.370" style="s2">because I went to my child&#39;s new school</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.220" end="00:04:50.220" style="s2">and I know a lot of the parents that go</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.370" end="00:04:51.960" style="s2">there and their kids and it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.220" end="00:04:53.340" style="s2">don&#39;t do well in big loud environments</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.960" end="00:04:54.449" style="s2">and I always feel socially awkward</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.340" end="00:04:56.729" style="s2">because it&#39;s like I can&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.449" end="00:04:58.470" style="s2">conversation and get to know people or</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.729" end="00:04:59.970" style="s2">even talk to people I already know in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.470" end="00:05:03.210" style="s2">that situation so then I feel like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.970" end="00:05:04.320" style="s2">being snob it&#39;s a stop and or I say the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.210" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">wrong thing or I interrupt people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.320" end="00:05:08.130" style="s2">conversations or I&#39;m involved in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:09.540" style="s2">conversation maybe I shouldn&#39;t be or I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.130" end="00:05:12.540" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s just socially awkward</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.540" end="00:05:17.789" style="s2">and but I also realized the people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.540" end="00:05:19.830" style="s2">I know there are democratic school so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.789" end="00:05:21.690" style="s2">don&#39;t know how in charge anyone is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.830" end="00:05:23.070" style="s2">parent unit but they are they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.690" end="00:05:25.199" style="s2">people who are like running around doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.070" end="00:05:26.490" style="s2">stuff who were part of like sitting up</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.199" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">with the friends talking more about</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.490" end="00:05:32.580" style="s2">stuff 300 the six people that I know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:34.470" style="s2">then the other ones were also like more</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.580" end="00:05:36.300" style="s2">vocal at the meeting than other people</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.470" end="00:05:38.310" style="s2">that I was surrounded with myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.300" end="00:05:40.520" style="s2">without knowing it with the top well</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.310" end="00:05:43.110" style="s2">some of the top people at the school and</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.520" end="00:05:44.849" style="s2">I wonder how in my life I&#39;ve also maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.110" end="00:05:47.150" style="s2">done the same and not realized it that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.849" end="00:05:49.919" style="s2">do have people surrounding me that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.150" end="00:05:51.450" style="s2">they were amazing and sort of one</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.919" end="00:05:54.450" style="s2">compare myself to none probably isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.450" end="00:05:57.599" style="s2">great a great solution because I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.450" end="00:06:00.930" style="s2">gonna feel adequate and to that&#39;s</p>
