<p begin="00:07:40.520" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">worked on last week actually am</p>

<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:52.910" style="s2">been going through a series of speakers</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:54.980" style="s2">and then activities so we had Tom she I</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.910" end="00:07:57.680" style="s2">think a couple weeks back and he talked</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.980" end="00:07:59.330" style="s2">about rapid prototyping so even though</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.680" end="00:08:02.690" style="s2">I&#39;ve sort of been doing that all along I</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.330" end="00:08:05.060" style="s2">decided I would do more of it so I did a</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.690" end="00:08:07.430" style="s2">couple more things for the site but</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.060" end="00:08:10.340" style="s2">actually it was last weekend I think I</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.430" end="00:08:13.700" style="s2">attended another event online with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.340" end="00:08:15.710" style="s2">rebel wisdom or group and it was an</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.700" end="00:08:17.270" style="s2">all-day event and at the end we did this</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.710" end="00:08:20.060" style="s2">really interesting thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.270" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">offers and needs market so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.060" end="00:08:24.500" style="s2">if anyone&#39;s heard of that but I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.060" style="s2">really excited about it because that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.500" end="00:08:27.980" style="s2">one of the things that I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.060" end="00:08:30.230" style="s2">create one of the components or the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.980" end="00:08:35.960" style="s2">modules for the Commons is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.230" end="00:08:37.520" style="s2">time bank sharing of skills thing so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.960" end="00:08:39.979" style="s2">they actually did it but they did it on</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.520" end="00:08:41.900" style="s2">a spreadsheet so it was like cool and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.979" end="00:08:43.370" style="s2">happened within a full hour of course</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.900" end="00:08:45.950" style="s2">there was a lot of people attending so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.370" end="00:08:46.670" style="s2">that helped so I decided to do that</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.950" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.670" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">so what I did is I created a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:53.330" style="s2">used that template</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:55.339" style="s2">as my template for with a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.330" end="00:08:58.190" style="s2">that I set up and then I created a page</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.339" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">on my website and then I created a page</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.190" end="00:09:03.529" style="s2">on Facebook for the first time and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">I just started I invited people that I</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.529" end="00:09:09.110" style="s2">knew and also promoted it on Twitter so</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:11.950" style="s2">yeah what I need help with is if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.110" end="00:09:14.300" style="s2">wants to help me do the aux test on it</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.950" end="00:09:15.890" style="s2">give me some feedback as to whether or</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.300" end="00:09:19.790" style="s2">not they think that the process makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.890" end="00:09:22.520" style="s2">sense and and any help on the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.790" end="00:09:24.050" style="s2">offers and needs markets virtually I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:09:26.600" end="00:09:30.529" style="s2">I did see it work well online but there</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.029" end="00:09:33.500" style="s2">was a whole bunch of people there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.529" end="00:09:35.959" style="s2">like 65 people doing that at the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.500" end="00:09:37.970" style="s2">time so you know doesn&#39;t work when you</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.459" end="00:09:50.810" style="s2">all right thank you this is only the</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.940" end="00:09:52.550" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a few of these with other</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.810" end="00:09:54.410" style="s2">people joining it was the first time</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.550" end="00:09:55.970" style="s2">that we&#39;ve had as many people and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.410" end="00:09:59.060" style="s2">totally forgot to take notes on what</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.970" end="00:10:00.580" style="s2">everyone&#39;s ask is it everyone reiterate</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.060" end="00:10:04.220" style="s2">what they would like to get out of this</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.580" end="00:10:10.430" style="s2">noise and other things going on if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.220" end="00:10:14.779" style="s2">don&#39;t mind I&#39;m just I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.430" end="00:10:26.810" style="s2">everybody a crowd noise and you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.779" end="00:10:29.870" style="s2">talking okay I don&#39;t have any need at</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.810" end="00:10:32.600" style="s2">this at this point when it&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.870" end="00:10:34.790" style="s2">called it&#39;s more usable it would be nice</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.600" end="00:10:42.220" style="s2">to get some people to actually test it</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.790" end="00:10:47.720" style="s2">and see if yeah it&#39;s useful you know and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.220" end="00:10:51.110" style="s2">to improve the UX prompt and yeah some</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.720" end="00:10:53.060" style="s2">feedback generally got a question or</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.110" end="00:10:55.430" style="s2">were you the one who did it was is it a</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.060" end="00:10:57.709" style="s2">it&#39;s like one sheet and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.430" end="00:10:59.720" style="s2">scheduling like a conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.709" end="00:11:02.120" style="s2">gives me know if there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.720" end="00:11:04.579" style="s2">things it&#39;s like one&#39;s yours is it cool</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.120" end="00:11:05.150" style="s2">I didn&#39;t briefly look at it but I have</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.579" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.150" end="00:11:11.210" style="s2">use it or in budget I liked the idea was</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:13.100" style="s2">made though yeah it was ad hoc like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.210" end="00:11:15.590" style="s2">impulse coming because there is this</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.100" end="00:11:19.060" style="s2">idea and I thought okay let&#39;s see how</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.590" end="00:11:23.150" style="s2">long it would take to actually write it</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.060" end="00:11:35.090" style="s2">so I might start though at the current</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.150" end="00:11:37.430" style="s2">state it needs some improvement so I and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.090" end="00:11:39.260" style="s2">my project was for he election the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.430" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">things that I wouldn&#39;t help with would</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.260" end="00:11:44.270" style="s2">be I mean it&#39;s kind of an open one but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:46.730" style="s2">anything to do with marketing or sort of</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.270" end="00:11:50.180" style="s2">explaining the the product and I could</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.730" end="00:11:52.880" style="s2">probably use help with and then a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.180" end="00:11:55.910" style="s2">more sort of definitely need help in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.880" end="00:11:57.760" style="s2">near future basis we need to work with a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.910" end="00:12:00.170" style="s2">developer to actually build a prototype</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.760" end="00:12:02.660" style="s2">and then as well anybody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.170" end="00:12:05.390" style="s2">interested in discussing the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.660" end="00:12:08.540" style="s2">misinformation in either news science or</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.390" end="00:12:10.340" style="s2">politics took to attendee livestream on</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.540" end="00:12:14.050" style="s2">the given day just to discuss that topic</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.340" end="00:12:14.050" style="s2">and get feedback that kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.880" end="00:12:28.640" style="s2">thank you I&#39;m just gonna go mute my kid</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.100" end="00:12:31.790" style="s2">once I get so was oh can I hear you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.640" end="00:12:33.770" style="s2">you hear me Adrian yep so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.790" end="00:12:36.530" style="s2">ask what type of developer like what</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.770" end="00:12:38.810" style="s2">language what do you what&#39;s the platform</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.530" end="00:12:39.530" style="s2">what&#39;s the stack what do you do that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.810" end="00:12:42.140" style="s2">not sure yet</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.530" end="00:12:45.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t really I mean okay it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.140" end="00:12:47.420" style="s2">be some sort of database driven web</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.230" end="00:12:49.760" style="s2">application okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.420" end="00:12:53.660" style="s2">aside from that I mean I assume probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.760" end="00:12:55.940" style="s2">MS sequel for the database and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.660" end="00:12:57.860" style="s2">not thinking about the the front-end</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.940" end="00:12:59.420" style="s2">that there there should probably would</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.860" end="00:13:00.620" style="s2">be a conversation before the coding</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.420" end="00:13:02.420" style="s2">actually starts about what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.620" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">environment is and you know why you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.420" end="00:13:06.160" style="s2">choose one language over another</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.689" end="00:13:13.439" style="s2">but if there is it sort of a direct</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.610" end="00:13:15.329" style="s2">reach I&#39;ll probably just end up going</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.439" end="00:13:18.149" style="s2">through upwork and then that will be a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.329" end="00:13:20.129" style="s2">part of you know people&#39;s sort of quotes</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.149" end="00:13:22.879" style="s2">is here someone it&#39;ll cost and here&#39;s D</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.129" end="00:13:26.249" style="s2">languages that I would did develop it in</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.879" end="00:13:28.680" style="s2">like at least pinged those ideas off of</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.249" end="00:13:35.459" style="s2">a few developers I know but just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.680" end="00:13:37.470" style="s2">have time to work on a full project are</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.459" end="00:13:39.870" style="s2">you hard coding the whole thing are you</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.470" end="00:13:41.189" style="s2">working from some sort of content</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.870" end="00:13:43.709" style="s2">management system</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.189" end="00:13:46.470" style="s2">um there&#39;s already prototypes built in</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.709" end="00:13:48.749" style="s2">in knack so there&#39;s already sort of some</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.470" end="00:13:51.300" style="s2">basic ones online and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.749" end="00:13:56.069" style="s2">version of will be hard-coded so what</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.300" end="00:13:59.480" style="s2">snack what snack a Mac is kind of a roll</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.069" end="00:14:03.149" style="s2">your own like basic database-driven</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.480" end="00:14:05.309" style="s2">web portal type software it&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.149" end="00:14:08.850" style="s2">that I used to build the together tech</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.309" end="00:14:10.860" style="s2">rotor type that I&#39;ll be sharing in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.850" end="00:14:13.079" style="s2">game be project channel probably today</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.860" end="00:14:14.970" style="s2">to start sort of kidding since its</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.079" end="00:14:17.000" style="s2">feedback where it has a bit of the event</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.970" end="00:14:19.769" style="s2">booking it has a bit of an offers</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.000" end="00:14:21.269" style="s2">actually doesn&#39;t have it offers market</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.769" end="00:14:22.980" style="s2">yet but it does have any needs list</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.269" end="00:14:24.809" style="s2">where where projects can say what they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.980" end="00:14:26.759" style="s2">need help what and do people can see it</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.809" end="00:14:31.439" style="s2">but I do like the idea of adding and</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.759" end="00:14:33.389" style="s2">offers one so I&#39;m they do that after but</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.439" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you&#39;ve ever used Salesforce</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.389" end="00:14:36.089" style="s2">it&#39;s like a really basic version of</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">Salesforce where you can sort of add</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.089" end="00:14:41.309" style="s2">your own tables and then you know build</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:43.199" style="s2">your layouts and there&#39;s like a public</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.309" end="00:14:45.000" style="s2">version and then you a person where you</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.199" end="00:14:49.290" style="s2">can actually have members create users</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.000" end="00:14:56.959" style="s2">and login and interact that way is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.290" end="00:15:03.199" style="s2">NAC nak KN AZ ah sorry Kay and ACK okay</p>

<p begin="00:16:16.290" end="00:16:19.170" style="s2">happen and that&#39;s kind of the more</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.370" end="00:16:21.030" style="s2">timely based one but I would just</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.620" end="00:18:35.490" style="s2">different it&#39;s more peer-to-peer right</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.690" end="00:18:36.870" style="s2">now during this time crisis I understand</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.490" end="00:18:40.200" style="s2">we need to feed the hungry so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.870" end="00:18:42.269" style="s2">different dynamic but a obstacle which</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.200" end="00:18:44.010" style="s2">is like everybody has wishes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.269" end="00:18:45.419" style="s2">everybody has obstacles as to why you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.010" end="00:18:47.070" style="s2">doing it and the whole point is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.419" end="00:18:50.130" style="s2">each other solution to those obstacles</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.070" end="00:18:52.909" style="s2">right like whether it&#39;s an internal one</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.130" end="00:18:55.440" style="s2">or an external one someone else is much</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.909" end="00:18:57.179" style="s2">generally there it&#39;s easier for them to</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.440" end="00:18:59.850" style="s2">find a solution to your obstacle than</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.179" end="00:19:01.769" style="s2">their own obstacle and this is it like</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.460" end="00:19:09.000" style="s2">real concrete ways like oh I just want</p>

<p begin="00:22:02.590" end="00:22:07.480" style="s2">find it people are most capable of doing</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.680" end="00:22:10.059" style="s2">that when they actually believe in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.480" end="00:22:14.260" style="s2">side that they&#39;re doing it&#39;d be nice if</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.059" end="00:22:20.830" style="s2">we could all be completely rational and</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.309" end="00:22:38.110" style="s2">a breed-specific ban is not the worst</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.040" end="00:22:41.170" style="s2">thing in the world so yeah we need some</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.110" end="00:22:42.490" style="s2">like know what they&#39;re called like when</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.190" end="00:22:53.470" style="s2">generators for when although we did have</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.800" end="00:22:57.070" style="s2">some asks and we&#39;re just kind of talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.470" end="00:22:59.020" style="s2">about them Adriel how do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.070" end="00:23:00.820" style="s2">can get you guests for your with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.020" end="00:23:02.380" style="s2">election I don&#39;t think having the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.820" end="00:23:05.410" style="s2">person constantly I mean I&#39;m happy to do</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.380" end="00:23:07.059" style="s2">a week but I don&#39;t like happy um part of</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.410" end="00:23:09.370" style="s2">what I&#39;m hoping will do it as I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.059" end="00:23:12.850" style="s2">got the prototype that I&#39;m hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.370" end="00:23:14.380" style="s2">sort of get to a usable state and share</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.850" end="00:23:19.410" style="s2">with the game be projects group</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.380" end="00:23:23.890" style="s2">hopefully tit today knows</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.410" end="00:23:26.559" style="s2">and once that&#39;s online then part of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.890" end="00:23:28.420" style="s2">is for for projects to sort of be able</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.559" end="00:23:31.059" style="s2">to say hey here&#39;s what we help with and</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.420" end="00:23:32.860" style="s2">there is sort of that events scheduling</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.059" end="00:23:35.350" style="s2">tool where it does both kind of events</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.860" end="00:23:38.500" style="s2">it does events that projects are hosting</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.350" end="00:23:40.809" style="s2">manages does general discussions that</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.500" end="00:23:44.170" style="s2">sort of a have like a minimum threshold</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.809" end="00:23:44.590" style="s2">in order to actually happen if that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.170" end="00:23:46.570" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.590" end="00:23:47.830" style="s2">so part of it is I&#39;m hoping to build up</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.570" end="00:23:49.630" style="s2">that tool and then just being able to</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.830" end="00:23:51.520" style="s2">post it there and then then that shifts</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.630" end="00:23:53.080" style="s2">it to trying to get people to use that</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:54.850" style="s2">tool so they can go there and see what</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.080" end="00:23:56.559" style="s2">all the projects you need help with and</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.850" end="00:24:01.650" style="s2">then hoping that somebody says oh that</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.559" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">sounds neat and and contacts all right</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.650" end="00:24:05.290" style="s2">so they&#39;re already get interviews for</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:08.140" style="s2">what it was that the answer for getting</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.290" end="00:24:09.820" style="s2">interviews for wiki election first up to</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.140" end="00:24:10.929" style="s2">build an application for all projects</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.820" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">and isn&#39;t it always</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.929" end="00:24:14.380" style="s2">yeah the common infrastructure how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:17.680" style="s2">you figure out marketing</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.380" end="00:24:19.330" style="s2">finance for all of them well that is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.680" end="00:24:20.980" style="s2">something I can help with but I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.330" end="00:24:23.590" style="s2">someone else you can help with then</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.980" end="00:24:24.610" style="s2">knack looking at that about you Brad did</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.590" end="00:24:26.260" style="s2">you have I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.610" end="00:24:28.570" style="s2">computer difficulties it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.260" end="00:24:30.460" style="s2">frustrating but what is there was there</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.570" end="00:24:32.890" style="s2">your ask was there what was it you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.460" end="00:24:38.320" style="s2">wanted help with yeah so basically I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.890" end="00:24:43.810" style="s2">trying to open-source some information</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.320" end="00:24:45.640" style="s2">on how I can 3d print packaging for my</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.810" end="00:24:48.220" style="s2">produce they grow like strawberries</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.640" end="00:24:50.230" style="s2">raspberries things like that there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.220" end="00:24:52.360" style="s2">main methods that I want to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.230" end="00:24:55.600" style="s2">that&#39;s either growing mycelium in a mold</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.360" end="00:24:57.970" style="s2">or that&#39;s growing help and being able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.600" end="00:25:00.730" style="s2">use that in some way I know people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.970" end="00:25:02.650" style="s2">already using kelp for packaging that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.730" end="00:25:05.110" style="s2">you can compost and then put accomplice</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.650" end="00:25:07.090" style="s2">back on to like top dress for your</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.110" end="00:25:12.130" style="s2">plants I just don&#39;t know the actual</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.090" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">technical parts of of that so if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.130" end="00:25:15.160" style="s2">has any suggestions or knows any</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:21.250" style="s2">resources that would be helpful</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.160" end="00:25:25.030" style="s2">I do not know offhand any</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.250" end="00:25:27.940" style="s2">that but I think that is also something</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.030" end="00:25:32.530" style="s2">that together as humanity we have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.940" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">figure out is what material works for</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.530" end="00:25:35.290" style="s2">what thing and when someone comes up</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:37.750" style="s2">with something how do we propagate it</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.290" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">because yes I throw up so much freakin</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.750" end="00:25:42.760" style="s2">plastic for my produce and there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:44.710" style="s2">any kind of solution for that that works</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.760" end="00:25:46.570" style="s2">but I&#39;m guarantee you there&#39;s a solution</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.710" end="00:25:48.670" style="s2">for that that works that already exists</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.570" end="00:25:51.190" style="s2">right now but they and they the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.670" end="00:25:53.230" style="s2">who have the farms don&#39;t know about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.190" end="00:25:54.550" style="s2">and then the plastic people aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.230" end="00:25:56.290" style="s2">to help them know about it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.550" end="00:26:00.340" style="s2">cheaper and this is more plentiful and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.290" end="00:26:03.120" style="s2">so having a way to correct that with a</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.340" end="00:26:05.650" style="s2">system where any because the end</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.120" end="00:26:07.330" style="s2">material engineers aren&#39;t the people to</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.650" end="00:26:10.260" style="s2">be able to market that like they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.330" end="00:26:12.670" style="s2">thought and to know that these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.260" end="00:26:14.530" style="s2">like what you just said probably or</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.670" end="00:26:16.390" style="s2">exist that people have used mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.530" end="00:26:17.590" style="s2">mycelium to create it right and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.390" end="00:26:18.820" style="s2">everyone has to kind of reinvent the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.590" end="00:26:20.290" style="s2">wheel like you&#39;ve got to figure that out</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.820" end="00:26:22.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to figure and then when you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.290" end="00:26:23.320" style="s2">figure it out everyone else has to</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.300" end="00:26:25.240" style="s2">figure it out green bug the wheel</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.320" end="00:26:27.280" style="s2">because how do you propagate that how</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.240" end="00:26:28.120" style="s2">you actually get that up that is in no</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.280" end="00:26:30.160" style="s2">way a solution</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.120" end="00:26:34.870" style="s2">your problem Brad but an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.160" end="00:26:37.900" style="s2">solution is needed so how much research</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.870" end="00:26:39.730" style="s2">have you done on it so far I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.900" end="00:26:41.950" style="s2">enough to see that other people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.730" end="00:26:45.190" style="s2">doing it at big scales that they receive</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.950" end="00:26:47.920" style="s2">like a large amount of funding and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.190" end="00:26:51.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know how appropriate is for</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.920" end="00:26:53.290" style="s2">someone like me to do that so there are</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.430" end="00:26:55.990" style="s2">companies that have that are growing</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.290" end="00:26:57.670" style="s2">help at large scales they&#39;re currently</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.990" end="00:27:01.180" style="s2">using it in their boxes and they have</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.670" end="00:27:03.460" style="s2">special help lining so greasy foods and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.180" end="00:27:07.180" style="s2">other things just don&#39;t like melt into</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.460" end="00:27:12.070" style="s2">the actual packaging but they are like</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.180" end="00:27:13.840" style="s2">happening their stuff so I don&#39;t I just</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.070" end="00:27:17.620" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to get what&#39;s already in</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.840" end="00:27:19.470" style="s2">use to myself so the impure question I</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.620" end="00:27:22.210" style="s2">know that it exists I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.470" end="00:27:28.180" style="s2">the technical part because a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.210" end="00:27:29.230" style="s2">is proprietary information um you may</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.180" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">have already done this but have you</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.230" end="00:27:34.300" style="s2">looked into just like buying like sort</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:36.310" style="s2">of small orders of the packaging as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.300" end="00:27:37.530" style="s2">you know somebody who had stuff to ship</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.310" end="00:27:39.640" style="s2">might do like you know I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.530" end="00:27:41.320" style="s2">containers made out of corn and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.640" end="00:27:43.180" style="s2">kind of thing like the plastic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.320" end="00:27:44.920" style="s2">that eventually biodegrades the bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.180" end="00:27:48.100" style="s2">company just bought to offer their stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.920" end="00:27:50.560" style="s2">in yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s my fallback plan I</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.100" end="00:27:52.870" style="s2">do have companies in mind have purchased</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.560" end="00:27:55.660" style="s2">that where my mind is going though as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.870" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">dietician by trade and I always try to</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.660" end="00:27:59.800" style="s2">use every opportunity for education</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:02.680" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really make sense to put</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.800" end="00:28:05.980" style="s2">strawberries in the standard packaging</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.680" end="00:28:07.750" style="s2">of court or whatever it would also be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.980" end="00:28:10.150" style="s2">great opportunity for me to come up with</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.750" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">my own sort of packaging and maybe group</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.150" end="00:28:15.520" style="s2">them in actual fruit serving sizes so</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.870" style="s2">it&#39;ll be very intuitive when people buy</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.520" end="00:28:19.060" style="s2">strawberries like oh I know what a</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.870" end="00:28:21.610" style="s2">serving size of fruit would in relation</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.060" end="00:28:24.570" style="s2">to strawberries are but yeah I can use</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.610" end="00:28:27.100" style="s2">biodegradable or possible compostable</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.570" end="00:28:31.020" style="s2">containers already that are out there so</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.100" end="00:28:31.020" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of my fallback plan okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.640" end="00:28:39.220" style="s2">I feel like again not a solution to your</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.570" end="00:28:43.010" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.220" end="00:28:44.210" style="s2">like the supply and demand supply we</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.010" end="00:28:46.070" style="s2">need to mad like there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.210" end="00:28:48.110" style="s2">farmers you have the demand side of</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.070" end="00:28:50.570" style="s2">things you Kimble the supply side but</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.110" end="00:28:52.820" style="s2">it&#39;s priced at the point of like this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.570" end="00:28:56.690" style="s2">new and fun so you want to pay a premium</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.820" end="00:28:59.420" style="s2">to have kelp packaging as opposed to no</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.690" end="00:29:01.070" style="s2">we all need kelp packaging what scale do</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.420" end="00:29:04.040" style="s2">we need to produce it on so it is 10</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.070" end="00:29:06.110" style="s2">cents per container and let&#39;s create</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.040" end="00:29:07.370" style="s2">that like what do we need in place as</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.110" end="00:29:10.570" style="s2">opposed to I created it I have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.370" end="00:29:14.060" style="s2">proprietary solution now it costs $5 to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.570" end="00:29:15.470" style="s2">strawberry bundle to get it there anyway</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.060" end="00:29:20.120" style="s2">solutions on a grander scale</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.470" end="00:29:21.530" style="s2">let&#39;s if we do fine tune this though it</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.120" end="00:29:23.240" style="s2">would be a great opportunity for farmers</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.530" end="00:29:24.680" style="s2">who can grow their own health and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.240" end="00:29:27.020" style="s2">produce their own packaging and sell</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.680" end="00:29:29.990" style="s2">that packaging to other people that are</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.020" end="00:29:32.810" style="s2">not farmers that might need packaging</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.990" end="00:29:34.640" style="s2">like I need to take out business so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.810" end="00:29:37.700" style="s2">a good opportunity again to have</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.640" end="00:29:40.040" style="s2">multiple uses at the farm scale even a</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.700" end="00:29:42.830" style="s2">small scale so I think this is something</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.040" end="00:29:47.680" style="s2">that we as a farming community or even</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.830" end="00:29:47.680" style="s2">being the community need to try to solve</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.710" end="00:29:53.840" style="s2">do you have all of the expertise as far</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.570" end="00:29:55.850" style="s2">as like I guess what pieces of that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.840" end="00:29:58.070" style="s2">wondering if James Jones as a person to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.850" end="00:30:00.650" style="s2">talk to who is doing cube spawn because</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.070" end="00:30:02.570" style="s2">I know he is more about like the factory</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.650" end="00:30:05.930" style="s2">side of things and not necessarily that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.570" end="00:30:07.010" style="s2">material but he might have had I just</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.930" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">feel like James might have some</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.010" end="00:30:22.640" style="s2">solutions as to how to actually make</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:23.960" style="s2">yeah my Jones with cube spawn that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.640" end="00:30:25.580" style="s2">no idea if he be the person to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.960" end="00:30:27.590" style="s2">for it he&#39;s just cube spawn it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.580" end="00:30:29.840" style="s2">local manufacturing he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.590" end="00:30:31.730" style="s2">figure out how to like every block could</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.840" end="00:30:33.590" style="s2">have their own manufacturing that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.730" end="00:30:35.780" style="s2">versatile so whenever you need it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.590" end="00:30:37.460" style="s2">print and make it moves its pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.780" end="00:30:38.900" style="s2">makes it for you and so he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.460" end="00:30:40.670" style="s2">spending his life doing that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.900" end="00:30:41.690" style="s2">engineering it and putting his effort in</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.670" end="00:30:43.540" style="s2">that but I feel like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.690" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">there up if farmers are able to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.540" end="00:30:47.710" style="s2">they need a factory and they need he</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">might just be able to and he&#39;s in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.710" end="00:30:55.240" style="s2">space so he might know just more people</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:55.900" style="s2">to talk to about yeah I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.240" end="00:30:58.120" style="s2">very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.900" end="00:30:59.830" style="s2">and he&#39;s not the person who may know</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.120" end="00:31:02.020" style="s2">someone who is so as long as I can get</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.830" end="00:31:06.130" style="s2">on a trail and go down the right trail</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.020" end="00:31:09.310" style="s2">that I can do a warm introduction after</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.130" end="00:31:11.530" style="s2">all message both oh yeah you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.310" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">friends on Facebook though because</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.530" end="00:31:15.220" style="s2">you&#39;re disgusting we&#39;re talking on</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">Twitter so I do I know James Johnson</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.220" end="00:31:19.750" style="s2">I&#39;ll might know on Twitter in which case</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:22.540" style="s2">I&#39;ll figure in a home okay and Brad do</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.750" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">you have a 3d printer I don&#39;t have a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.540" end="00:31:27.190" style="s2">printer and it depends on which route we</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:30.580" style="s2">go if we do like mycelium molds I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.190" end="00:31:33.400" style="s2">need one I don&#39;t know the technical part</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.580" end="00:31:35.500" style="s2">of you know is this gonna get o me or</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.400" end="00:31:37.600" style="s2">not homie but a personal 3d printer I</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.500" end="00:31:40.300" style="s2">can use Kelvin because the ones that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.600" end="00:31:42.040" style="s2">buy don&#39;t support that material so I</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.300" end="00:31:45.160" style="s2">need to figure out what these companies</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.040" end="00:31:46.630" style="s2">are using actually I&#39;m not even dressed</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.160" end="00:31:48.280" style="s2">possible if they have if it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.630" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">proprietary information and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.280" end="00:31:52.750" style="s2">how they&#39;re really how open they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:55.870" style="s2">gonna be to sharing that with me but I</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.750" end="00:31:58.020" style="s2">just need to see like what what it takes</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.870" end="00:32:01.720" style="s2">for kelp that would be my ideal thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.020" end="00:32:05.320" style="s2">I&#39;d rather not use my psyllium but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.720" end="00:32:09.280" style="s2">do recommend so if you do the Cal is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.320" end="00:32:13.720" style="s2">that a 3d printed it&#39;s like you I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.280" end="00:32:17.620" style="s2">imagine it is but it has to be to some</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.720" end="00:32:19.720" style="s2">extent but again I need to find out more</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.620" end="00:32:23.500" style="s2">information it&#39;s just not readily</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.720" end="00:32:27.010" style="s2">available the reason I&#39;m asking is I</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.500" end="00:32:30.760" style="s2">work for a start-up once that did a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.010" end="00:32:33.010" style="s2">print network so the whole idea was to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.760" end="00:32:34.690" style="s2">network 3d printers so whatever your</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.010" end="00:32:36.730" style="s2">project was then you could tap it to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.690" end="00:32:40.870" style="s2">their network and have this printed you</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.730" end="00:32:43.600" style="s2">know at scale so yeah depending on what</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.870" end="00:32:50.610" style="s2">the financial end of the solution is I</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.600" end="00:32:53.380" style="s2">mean I owe you froze</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.610" end="00:32:56.650" style="s2">I&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see if s stable to come</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.380" end="00:32:58.440" style="s2">back sexy person talkie is the one who</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.650" end="00:33:00.760" style="s2">has the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.440" end="00:33:03.010" style="s2">be a potential just being seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.760" end="00:33:05.230" style="s2">useful like just being able to generate</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.010" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">a kelp base material for 3d printers</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.230" end="00:33:11.440" style="s2">would be super cool yeah put it into</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:12.760" style="s2">anything to make that material so you</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.440" end="00:33:15.159" style="s2">could print it into any shape it would</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.760" end="00:33:17.110" style="s2">be yes and I do think I hopefully Brad</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.159" end="00:33:22.090" style="s2">you can hear us if you can you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.110" end="00:33:24.070" style="s2">the rest but uh listen to our to our</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.090" end="00:33:27.460" style="s2">awesome ideas so you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.070" end="00:33:30.460" style="s2">respond I don&#39;t my awesome idea was</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.460" end="00:33:34.330" style="s2">probably to awesome about help as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.460" end="00:33:35.799" style="s2">material just as a material yeah into</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.330" end="00:33:39.970" style="s2">that there was there was another layer</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.799" end="00:33:41.830" style="s2">that oh oh that the proprietary that was</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.970" end="00:33:43.419" style="s2">what I was gonna say a lot of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.830" end="00:33:45.789" style="s2">right they might not be willing because</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.419" end="00:33:48.220" style="s2">its proprietary also though people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.789" end="00:33:50.500" style="s2">are here to do good in the world even if</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.220" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">they are forced to do game a make things</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.500" end="00:33:55.419" style="s2">patentable are sometimes a lot more open</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:56.980" style="s2">to yeah and I&#39;ll share it with you</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.419" end="00:33:59.200" style="s2">because what I want is the kelp made</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.980" end="00:34:01.210" style="s2">into plastic so there&#39;s less plastic if</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.200" end="00:34:03.370" style="s2">they&#39;re in it for purpose and not profit</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.210" end="00:34:04.780" style="s2">and there&#39;ll be someone who&#39;s in it for</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.370" end="00:34:06.250" style="s2">purpose is a non-profit so if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.780" end="00:34:09.399" style="s2">multiple people doing it in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.250" end="00:34:11.710" style="s2">materials somebody&#39;s there just to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.399" end="00:34:13.810" style="s2">propagate the idea and they will and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.710" end="00:34:16.389" style="s2">then they get to take over the entire</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.810" end="00:34:17.800" style="s2">market cuz there&#39;s a you know like if</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.389" end="00:34:20.649" style="s2">somebody it&#39;s open source and you now</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.800" end="00:34:22.210" style="s2">may have material to 3d print and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.649" end="00:34:23.889" style="s2">available to everyone and every farmer</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.210" end="00:34:25.179" style="s2">can print it we don&#39;t need the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.889" end="00:34:28.300" style="s2">proprietary ones you don&#39;t need those</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.179" end="00:34:31.060" style="s2">look exactly like if then keeping it</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.300" end="00:34:32.080" style="s2">proprietary technology forces someone to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.060" end="00:34:33.490" style="s2">go up make an open-source version</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.080" end="00:34:35.830" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna wish to they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.490" end="00:34:36.369" style="s2">license the proprietary version yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.830" end="00:34:38.500" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.369" end="00:34:40.780" style="s2">and what does licensee look like a 3d</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.500" end="00:34:43.359" style="s2">material because if you think like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.780" end="00:34:45.190" style="s2">thing the filament is the expensive part</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.359" end="00:34:46.750" style="s2">of 3d printing right if you have a kelp</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.190" end="00:34:48.250" style="s2">version of that that&#39;s both the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.750" end="00:34:51.639" style="s2">you print is more environmentally</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.250" end="00:34:54.730" style="s2">friendly and you can grow your ink like</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.639" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">that solves so much stuff for molds and</p>

<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:02.140" style="s2">the stuff in or what I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.869" end="00:35:05.410" style="s2">don&#39;t know but it&#39;s cool I like it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.140" end="00:35:06.580" style="s2">and I we&#39;ve been saying kelp but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.410" end="00:35:09.280" style="s2">not to say that it has to be killed for</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.580" end="00:35:11.080" style="s2">I&#39;m sure it could be torn or or corn</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.280" end="00:35:12.490" style="s2">husks or any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.080" end="00:35:13.900" style="s2">I thought this is what Brad was talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.490" end="00:35:15.430" style="s2">about when he was talking and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.900" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">think it actually was he was like I</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:25.380" style="s2">in corn and that um corn a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.990" end="00:35:28.420" style="s2">are allergic to corn and logic to kelp</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.380" end="00:35:29.260" style="s2">sorry even the husks are actually eating</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.420" end="00:35:31.120" style="s2">Oh</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.260" end="00:35:32.500" style="s2">but like it seems like I wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.120" end="00:35:34.420" style="s2">that to be done with peanuts</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.500" end="00:35:36.070" style="s2">so like corns in everything but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.420" end="00:35:37.570" style="s2">also in everything so why not make it</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.070" end="00:35:38.500" style="s2">out of it I&#39;m pretty sure most people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.570" end="00:35:40.900" style="s2">file</p>

<p begin="00:35:40.900" end="00:35:45.310" style="s2">with corn husks then I mean I have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.330" end="00:35:47.830" style="s2">different layer of like I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.310" end="00:35:49.600" style="s2">what that process is it turns that into</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.830" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">the corn husk because I want to arch</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.600" end="00:35:52.810" style="s2">sorry turns into material because I want</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:54.550" style="s2">to know if it&#39;s actually environmentally</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.810" end="00:35:55.480" style="s2">friendly like how much water much energy</p>

<p begin="00:36:03.550" end="00:36:07.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh very mentally friendly is</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.590" end="00:36:10.270" style="s2">it really if you&#39;re pouring arsenic into</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.180" end="00:36:11.740" style="s2">it or yeah sure that might come the wash</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.270" end="00:36:13.990" style="s2">if you&#39;re trying to license it you might</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.740" end="00:36:17.590" style="s2">know oh I don&#39;t want to use this this is</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.990" end="00:36:23.320" style="s2">the whole point so I&#39;m just going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.590" end="00:36:25.120" style="s2">unfortunately Brad it&#39;s mentioned in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.320" end="00:36:26.470" style="s2">not unfortunately unfortunately Brad&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:43.050" end="00:36:47.590" style="s2">companies listed in the article and yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">I would suggest that definitely contact</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:53.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll go I&#39;ve not looked at it if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.400" end="00:36:57.250" style="s2">a list of nobody he has definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.200" end="00:36:58.740" style="s2">contact them yeah there is a company</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.250" end="00:37:02.170" style="s2">called Lyle</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.740" end="00:37:05.890" style="s2">know lowly where seaweed-based straw</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.170" end="00:37:09.370" style="s2">company oh I know I can&#39;t figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.890" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">to take it off of there that was that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.370" end="00:37:13.690" style="s2">actually reminds me of the whole like</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:15.340" style="s2">paper straw debate that weirded me out</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.690" end="00:37:17.500" style="s2">that we went paper when there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.340" end="00:37:20.440" style="s2">like different kinds of biodegradable</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.500" end="00:37:22.420" style="s2">plastic and the paper straws are just</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.440" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">terrible so I&#39;m not sure why we tried</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.420" end="00:37:27.990" style="s2">like why there is such a hard</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:34.890" style="s2">which towards paper straws when paper</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.990" end="00:37:35.580" style="s2">lobbyists yeah true hemp straws yeah yep</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.890" end="00:37:37.020" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.580" end="00:37:38.760" style="s2">trick-or-treat hemp everywhere except</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.020" end="00:37:40.310" style="s2">also I have no idea what the process is</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.760" end="00:37:42.660" style="s2">to actually get it into all the things</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.310" end="00:37:45.630" style="s2">for eco packaging it&#39;s not a shadow</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.660" end="00:37:47.550" style="s2">chest I well we were talking typed that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.630" end="00:37:51.660" style="s2">up maybe hemp is a good material go back</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.550" end="00:37:52.500" style="s2">Jean yeah yeah and because Brad is near</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.660" end="00:37:57.210" style="s2">the coast</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.500" end="00:38:00.330" style="s2">seaweed makes sense mmm it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.210" end="00:38:03.450" style="s2">the cheapest to access even more than</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.330" end="00:38:05.370" style="s2">corn yeah true you know you can grow</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.450" end="00:38:06.750" style="s2">kelp accidentally like you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.370" end="00:38:14.460" style="s2">there&#39;s kelp over there alright that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.750" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">right yeah I mean ecosystem needs it see</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.460" end="00:38:20.850" style="s2">so that and there&#39;s that whole watershed</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:25.050" style="s2">thing if it grows in the watershed that</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.850" end="00:38:27.690" style="s2">we yeah and the strawberries are in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.050" end="00:38:33.450" style="s2">watershed it&#39;s much more you know what</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.690" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">supports the ecosystem of the water it</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.450" end="00:38:39.000" style="s2">sounds you know a wide variety of</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:40.110" style="s2">packaging needs like such come in you</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.000" end="00:38:41.850" style="s2">know should probably be able to package</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.110" end="00:38:43.920" style="s2">things that are dry and won&#39;t last that</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.850" end="00:38:45.600" style="s2">long things like that you might just be</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.920" end="00:38:47.730" style="s2">you know be able to use for example corn</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.600" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">husks themselves no processing it just</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.730" end="00:38:52.200" style="s2">wrap stuff in corn husks in your dock</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:55.800" style="s2">and then how do we handle wet things or</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.200" end="00:38:58.050" style="s2">like a liquid and and that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.800" end="00:39:00.180" style="s2">where I I think Brad mentioned that help</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.050" end="00:39:01.980" style="s2">was good for the greasy foods that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.180" end="00:39:08.910" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t sort of soak through it</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.980" end="00:39:11.880" style="s2">like it would with a shallow and I are</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.910" end="00:39:13.890" style="s2">just share brain it was like said him</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.880" end="00:39:15.360" style="s2">she was typing him and then I was like</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.890" end="00:39:20.060" style="s2">we can&#39;t take the seaweed out of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.360" end="00:39:20.060" style="s2">ocean it&#39;s same thing at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:25.380" style="s2">also both think we have solutions to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.830" end="00:39:28.860" style="s2">world so I think if you ever can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.380" end="00:39:29.850" style="s2">it will just bring in Shiloh if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.860" end="00:39:32.850" style="s2">make it if I can</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.850" end="00:39:35.550" style="s2">he&#39;s perfect although I think she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.850" end="00:39:37.940" style="s2">worsen doesn&#39;t stumble over as much you</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.550" end="00:39:37.940" style="s2">might do better</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.980" end="00:39:44.260" style="s2">having yeah there&#39;s a few like meta</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.040" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">projects one of which is material like</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.260" end="00:39:47.410" style="s2">just knowing where the materials come</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:49.090" style="s2">from so if you could turn corn into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.410" end="00:39:50.470" style="s2">material you could 3d print hemp into it</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.090" end="00:39:52.300" style="s2">knowing that what those processes are</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.470" end="00:39:54.100" style="s2">indeed do-it-yourself like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.300" end="00:39:56.020" style="s2">create this out of here without needing</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.100" end="00:39:59.320" style="s2">to get a mold made it and making a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.020" end="00:40:00.760" style="s2">million so it&#39;s cheap enough how can you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.320" end="00:40:02.619" style="s2">actually get this down there a lot</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.760" end="00:40:04.180" style="s2">there&#39;s tons I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.619" end="00:40:08.320" style="s2">written this down but it sounds like we</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.180" end="00:40:11.110" style="s2">need a solution raising on packaging as</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.320" end="00:40:13.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton there&#39;s no other and like</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.110" end="00:40:15.010" style="s2">personally I there&#39;s been quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.360" end="00:40:17.230" style="s2">things that I haven&#39;t bought because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.010" end="00:40:18.580" style="s2">packaging for is atrocious I&#39;m like all</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.230" end="00:40:20.470" style="s2">those cookies look good they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.580" end="00:40:21.250" style="s2">individually wrapped are you kidding me</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.470" end="00:40:25.390" style="s2">nevermind</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.250" end="00:40:27.310" style="s2">yeah like oh these are individually</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.390" end="00:40:29.860" style="s2">wrapped yeah you know you you you buy</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.310" end="00:40:31.750" style="s2">candies and each one has I think around</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.860" end="00:40:33.430" style="s2">it like oh my god I don&#39;t want this</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.750" end="00:40:36.850" style="s2">plastic tool to live on forever because</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.430" end="00:40:39.910" style="s2">I wanted a snack like ya know and it is</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.850" end="00:40:42.760" style="s2">I racing on packaging is actually pretty</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.910" end="00:40:44.380" style="s2">I don&#39;t and these are the best ones I</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.760" end="00:40:45.640" style="s2">don&#39;t know what the solution is for ten</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.380" end="00:40:49.060" style="s2">thousand people in a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.640" end="00:40:50.740" style="s2">dollars but there is one key start</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.060" end="00:40:52.330" style="s2">generating that there&#39;s ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.740" end="00:40:54.580" style="s2">the soft elastic how do we make it the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.330" end="00:40:56.320" style="s2">material and there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.580" end="00:40:57.790" style="s2">restaurant using reusable ones that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.320" end="00:40:59.080" style="s2">pay a deposit for and get it back but</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.790" end="00:41:01.000" style="s2">unless they&#39;re all using the same one</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.080" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">that&#39;s a whole other maybe not drink</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.000" end="00:41:06.280" style="s2">over nineteen but like other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:09.940" style="s2">because you do is like pre solutions now</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.280" end="00:41:12.070" style="s2">solutions later solutions which there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.940" end="00:41:15.220" style="s2">a decent chance that like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.070" end="00:41:18.670" style="s2">new norm like not to this extreme but</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.220" end="00:41:21.960" style="s2">you know that the the marbling of kovat</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.670" end="00:41:23.800" style="s2">nineteen response throughout society</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.960" end="00:41:27.210" style="s2">disposable stuff is probably just going</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.800" end="00:41:27.210" style="s2">to be more and more and more important</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.420" end="00:41:33.490" style="s2">no not at the em you can always shoot he</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.990" end="00:41:36.520" style="s2">could always post it on my offers in</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.490" end="00:41:40.840" style="s2">needs market mmm see where it goes over</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.520" end="00:41:43.090" style="s2">time not anything soon but what would</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.840" end="00:41:47.619" style="s2">the what would they need be to know like</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.090" end="00:41:49.869" style="s2">the well yeah to try to find that</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.619" end="00:41:50.710" style="s2">solution somehow if anybody knows</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.869" end="00:41:51.130" style="s2">anybody</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.710" end="00:41:53.770" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.130" end="00:41:57.580" style="s2">working in that field or you know might</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.770" end="00:42:00.550" style="s2">have some ideas around it mm-hmm and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.580" end="00:42:03.760" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the few ones that like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.550" end="00:42:06.790" style="s2">could also be just a game like you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.760" end="00:42:08.470" style="s2">develop the sort of technology in game B</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.790" end="00:42:10.330" style="s2">and licensing appropriately but then</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.470" end="00:42:12.790" style="s2">also you know just like make them and</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.330" end="00:42:14.680" style="s2">sell them to restaurants you have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.790" end="00:42:16.270" style="s2">capacity just to generate money itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.680" end="00:42:18.850" style="s2">to pay for itself to grow like a regular</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.270" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">company which is nice when that becomes</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.850" end="00:42:23.050" style="s2">an options notice that you have to but</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:26.890" style="s2">the fact that I can sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.050" end="00:42:28.420" style="s2">self-sufficient where like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.890" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">projects that we&#39;re talking about don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.420" end="00:42:32.860" style="s2">really have that option to the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:36.250" style="s2">extent as that as yeah I mean if it took</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.860" end="00:42:41.110" style="s2">off he gets under the entire part of his</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.250" end="00:42:43.720" style="s2">business with that is HUGE I mean being</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.110" end="00:42:46.750" style="s2">it anytime I think this is just my input</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.720" end="00:42:47.860" style="s2">my hypothesis but anytime you offer to</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.750" end="00:42:50.050" style="s2">the world something they can do</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.860" end="00:42:52.360" style="s2">themselves they don&#39;t actually do it</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.050" end="00:42:53.800" style="s2">themselves so offering it to free for</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.360" end="00:42:56.620" style="s2">free here&#39;s how you could do it yourself</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.800" end="00:42:59.380" style="s2">or we&#39;re mass producing them that cut</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.620" end="00:43:02.080" style="s2">costs plus 5% right and having it</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.380" end="00:43:04.450" style="s2">available but it both brings you</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.080" end="00:43:06.250" style="s2">marketing and you get innovation because</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.450" end="00:43:08.020" style="s2">people can do it themselves right</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.250" end="00:43:09.550" style="s2">they&#39;re like I tried it this way but</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.020" end="00:43:12.340" style="s2">most people don&#39;t like even if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.550" end="00:43:13.930" style="s2">super easy cleaner people buy it in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.340" end="00:43:19.110" style="s2">package rather than make it themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.930" end="00:43:22.770" style="s2">right and so I don&#39;t think we&#39;re such a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.110" end="00:43:28.020" style="s2">but that&#39;s the old model of convenience</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.770" end="00:43:28.020" style="s2">you have a lot of time on our hair yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.360" end="00:43:35.380" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a that&#39;s a bottle I mean</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:37.890" style="s2">that&#39;s very much like open source</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.380" end="00:43:40.660" style="s2">software you can often give it away and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.890" end="00:43:43.600" style="s2">and then you know do hosting and</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.660" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">enhancements it&#39;s a bit challenging what</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.600" end="00:43:49.390" style="s2">it does work I mean I haven&#39;t dabbled in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:52.540" style="s2">that for years I know that but have for</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.390" end="00:43:54.310" style="s2">likes hey you know open source but they</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.540" end="00:43:56.500" style="s2">still like they sold manuals they sell</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.310" end="00:43:59.320" style="s2">implementations and like they got pretty</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.500" end="00:44:01.990" style="s2">big yeah and then of course if the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.320" end="00:44:04.480" style="s2">offers in needs market was set up on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.990" end="00:44:04.829" style="s2">Commons and you had a lot of indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.480" end="00:44:06.900" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.829" end="00:44:08.459" style="s2">on the west coast I would be I would bet</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.900" end="00:44:10.380" style="s2">that they would have a solution they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.459" end="00:44:13.499" style="s2">already figured out how to wrap up stuff</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.380" end="00:44:16.589" style="s2">yeah but in some and probably even in</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.499" end="00:44:18.869" style="s2">seaweed right yeah and you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.589" end="00:44:22.469" style="s2">part of their culture any indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.869" end="00:44:26.099" style="s2">plant is used in in that culture right</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.469" end="00:44:28.709" style="s2">so yeah yeah and that be great to start</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.099" end="00:44:31.019" style="s2">incorporating those that wisdom back in</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.709" end="00:44:35.549" style="s2">two hours or yeah he might even go to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.019" end="00:44:37.769" style="s2">his the territory that he&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.549" end="00:44:39.719" style="s2">nations that live there and asked them</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.769" end="00:44:41.279" style="s2">if they had if they have any solution</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.719" end="00:44:44.279" style="s2">right that&#39;s real good as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.279" end="00:44:48.180" style="s2">going up into that getting a maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.279" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">know try the game see or whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.180" end="00:44:53.969" style="s2">that you know the original indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:56.339" style="s2">peoples did on their lands became a yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.969" end="00:44:58.589" style="s2">I think that&#39;s extra cool because then</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.339" end="00:45:00.660" style="s2">if it was something that was hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.589" end="00:45:03.599" style="s2">readily available to that tribe or that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.660" end="00:45:05.130" style="s2">community then all of a sudden if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.599" end="00:45:07.469" style="s2">talking about possibly like having a as</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.130" end="00:45:09.209" style="s2">a business that becomes oh hey if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.469" end="00:45:10.589" style="s2">can make the packaging then you can sell</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.209" end="00:45:13.559" style="s2">it and there&#39;s a business for your tribe</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.589" end="00:45:16.109" style="s2">sure yeah and then it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.559" end="00:45:18.420" style="s2">they&#39;ll hopefully do it like at a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.109" end="00:45:20.099" style="s2">respectable scale where like it&#39;s enough</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.420" end="00:45:21.599" style="s2">that they can sell but not too much</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.099" end="00:45:24.119" style="s2">where it&#39;s like all right pedal down</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.599" end="00:45:26.369" style="s2">like you know you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.119" end="00:45:29.519" style="s2">defeating the purpose here on demand so</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.369" end="00:45:31.079" style="s2">yeah yeah but then also having an upper</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.519" end="00:45:32.940" style="s2">limit right because if it&#39;s like sorry</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.079" end="00:45:35.160" style="s2">we ran out of that material and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.940" end="00:45:37.079" style="s2">no good way to get it talk to us in</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.160" end="00:45:39.479" style="s2">three months like and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.079" end="00:45:40.979" style="s2">we&#39;ll hopefully have three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.479" end="00:45:42.989" style="s2">tribes head up that way we&#39;re like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.979" end="00:45:45.269" style="s2">200 of them are making this fifty or</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.989" end="00:45:50.969" style="s2">doing that twenty are doing that here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.269" end="00:45:54.390" style="s2">the amounts that we have yeah mmm yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.969" end="00:45:58.349" style="s2">mean last night I saw or yesterday I saw</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.390" end="00:46:00.989" style="s2">great a mask must be in West Coast may</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.349" end="00:46:03.630" style="s2">be Haida out of cedar right so cedar is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.989" end="00:46:06.150" style="s2">sort of interrupt around so you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.630" end="00:46:09.150" style="s2">this is cedar strips right so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.150" end="00:46:12.269" style="s2">your o&#39;clock bask but it is a mask right</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.150" end="00:46:15.239" style="s2">so yeah no new materials that are there</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.269" end="00:46:16.830" style="s2">the plus cedar there has been prophecy</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.239" end="00:46:20.040" style="s2">from what I&#39;ve heard about</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.830" end="00:46:23.180" style="s2">this pandemic and part of what the first</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.040" end="00:46:26.580" style="s2">nations especially on the west coast are</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.180" end="00:46:29.150" style="s2">it&#39;s cedar cedar your shoot cedar in for</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.580" end="00:46:32.580" style="s2">this particular virus it&#39;s medicine</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.150" end="00:46:35.250" style="s2">happiness Peter mask is like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.580" end="00:46:39.420" style="s2">because it had a stent which has an oil</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">in it which is also antiviral yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.420" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">a lot of a lot of wisdom at the same</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:43.890" style="s2">time when USA met over the first nations</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:44.310" style="s2">my first was like but they&#39;re not gay</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.890" end="00:46:46.890" style="s2">Bay</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.310" end="00:46:48.270" style="s2">meaning that they eat like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.890" end="00:46:50.850" style="s2">wrapping the berries to eat them for the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.270" end="00:46:53.400" style="s2">next few days during you know for their</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.850" end="00:46:55.050" style="s2">tradition they&#39;re not mass producing</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.400" end="00:46:58.020" style="s2">packaging it so they can send it to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.050" end="00:46:59.460" style="s2">store so it can be sold but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.020" end="00:47:02.280" style="s2">still a wisdom there that might be able</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.460" end="00:47:04.980" style="s2">to do both or be able to say eat it with</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.280" end="00:47:07.860" style="s2">you wrap it in this and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.980" end="00:47:11.490" style="s2">package these things now want a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.860" end="00:47:14.130" style="s2">the puzzle the solution mm-hmm which I</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.490" end="00:47:16.470" style="s2">would prefer to have like personally</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.130" end="00:47:17.730" style="s2">suppliers that have that kind of a limit</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.470" end="00:47:20.190" style="s2">where they&#39;re willing to say like sorry</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.730" end="00:47:22.050" style="s2">we we aren&#39;t making those now because</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.190" end="00:47:23.340" style="s2">you know we ran out of d materials and</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.050" end="00:47:26.670" style="s2">it are think that we could do both us</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.340" end="00:47:30.900" style="s2">damaging some now although you do have</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.670" end="00:47:33.600" style="s2">to think about then what&#39;s I mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.900" end="00:47:35.220" style="s2">going to go food yeah you kind of do</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.600" end="00:47:37.950" style="s2">need and like our discussions about</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.220" end="00:47:39.870" style="s2">resiliency is that you do need kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.950" end="00:47:42.660" style="s2">backups in the system so we have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.870" end="00:47:45.270" style="s2">backup supply of plastic to use and in</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.660" end="00:47:47.760" style="s2">those situations or are there three or</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.270" end="00:47:48.780" style="s2">four different types of methods like you</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.760" end="00:47:51.720" style="s2">have the algae and then you have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.780" end="00:47:53.250" style="s2">mycelium in that way they you know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.720" end="00:47:56.540" style="s2">the chance of all three of them going</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.250" end="00:47:59.160" style="s2">out at the same time or reaching a max</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.540" end="00:48:02.100" style="s2">couldn&#39;t happen it&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.160" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">complex issue that would be good to work</p>

<p begin="00:49:19.350" end="00:49:24.570" style="s2">like that how much our farmers like</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.380" end="00:49:26.340" style="s2">selling the corn versus just you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.570" end="00:49:27.720" style="s2">they sell the court and the the husk is</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.340" end="00:49:28.710" style="s2">still attached so they&#39;re kind of giving</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.720" end="00:49:32.220" style="s2">the husk away for free to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.710" end="00:49:33.750" style="s2">throw out yeah yeah if there was a way</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.220" end="00:49:36.000" style="s2">to be like hey sell us this we&#39;ll pay</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.750" end="00:49:38.220" style="s2">you for the court and the husks which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.000" end="00:49:40.080" style="s2">also having the local production right</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.220" end="00:49:41.670" style="s2">like you&#39;d spawn or something where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.080" end="00:49:43.230" style="s2">even just the local farmers doing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.670" end="00:49:44.430" style="s2">that way in something like or shankha if</p>

<p begin="00:49:54.270" end="00:49:57.450" style="s2">using it to create packaging in my</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.920" end="00:49:58.560" style="s2">neighborhood and when I use paper it</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.450" end="00:49:59.790" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go in and recycle and it goes</p>

<p begin="00:56:52.350" end="00:56:56.400" style="s2">just a rapid prototype but like how</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.630" end="00:57:01.650" style="s2">would you actually do that in full</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.400" end="00:57:03.630" style="s2">full-on tech you know I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.650" end="00:57:05.610" style="s2">you would how you would do that either I</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.630" end="00:57:09.330" style="s2">haven&#39;t got one point yeah I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.610" end="00:57:13.590" style="s2">definitely take a look at that two</p>

<p begin="00:57:13.590" end="00:57:16.920" style="s2">what&#39;s the tool you were using to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.970" end="00:57:20.970" style="s2">quickly prototype something all right</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.920" end="00:57:22.980" style="s2">Mac neck and then I&#39;ve been using an</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.970" end="00:57:24.740" style="s2">affront and designer friend of mine or</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.980" end="00:57:29.220" style="s2">using</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.740" end="00:57:32.790" style="s2">bubble bubble yeah bubbles I think is</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.220" end="00:57:35.220" style="s2">slightly better than neck it makes great</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.090" end="00:57:46.680" style="s2">be I mean yeah although the bubble one</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.700" end="00:57:48.840" style="s2">may be sufficient for what you need and</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.680" end="00:57:51.480" style="s2">then the interface tweaks might be</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.840" end="00:57:53.340" style="s2">better so but yeah but take a look at</p>
