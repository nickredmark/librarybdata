<p begin="00:00:41.360" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">that is pervasive throughout psychology</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.920" end="00:00:47.680" style="s2">which is that psychology has no unified</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.520" end="00:00:55.120" style="s2">throughout this we will be talking about</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.039" end="00:00:57.520" style="s2">some of the most important philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.120" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">cognitive scientific and neuroscientific</p>

<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:02.399" style="s2">so i hope you&#39;ll join us through i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.039" end="00:01:04.879" style="s2">really excited about it i&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.399" end="00:01:05.840" style="s2">embodying my modeling of various things</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.879" end="00:01:07.840" style="s2">throughout</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.840" end="00:01:09.280" style="s2">in the last couple of weeks so you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.840" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve been i&#39;ve been feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.280" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">i&#39;m looking forward to the continuation</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:18.960" style="s2">so uh last time we did a very long</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:21.360" style="s2">uh analysis one of the few times i use</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.960" end="00:01:23.280" style="s2">slides i don&#39;t usually like to use them</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.360" end="00:01:25.200" style="s2">but we did an analysis of an argument</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.280" end="00:01:27.520" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been working with dan shapi</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.200" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">about the use of the rovers on mars and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.520" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">that was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:34.640" style="s2">basically a use that is a test case</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:35.439" style="s2">and as a vehicle for explicating uh the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.640" end="00:01:39.040" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.439" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">uh uh sorry first of all the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.040" end="00:01:42.320" style="s2">uh perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:43.280" style="s2">knowing and then the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.320" end="00:01:45.040" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.280" end="00:01:47.119" style="s2">we bring we brought in montague&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.040" end="00:01:47.680" style="s2">of mutual modeling and consciousness as</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.119" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.680" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">mutual modeling between participatory</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:52.799" style="s2">and perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">and so that&#39;s sort of where we&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.799" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">right now and what i&#39;d like to do now is</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:58.159" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:59.360" style="s2">the next step forward and set up a</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.159" end="00:02:01.520" style="s2">course of argument</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.360" end="00:02:03.280" style="s2">that will allow us to together you and i</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.520" end="00:02:04.000" style="s2">to enter into dialogue not only with</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.280" end="00:02:05.439" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.000" end="00:02:07.680" style="s2">but with some of the most prominent</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.439" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">theories of consciousness on the market</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.680" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:12.000" style="s2">on the psychological cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:14.560" style="s2">scientific and neuroscientific market</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.000" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">if i can put it that way so i have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.560" end="00:02:17.680" style="s2">proposal about how to do this and what i</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:19.200" style="s2">want to do is i want to propose a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.680" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">particular okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.200" end="00:02:22.959" style="s2">let me just pop in real fast so so as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.440" end="00:02:26.080" style="s2">metatheorist okay so</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.959" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">uh me you know i&#39;m really looking to see</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.080" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">how various frames assimilate and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.400" end="00:02:31.680" style="s2">integrate key insights from various</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:33.280" style="s2">models</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.680" end="00:02:34.879" style="s2">yeah and one of the things i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.280" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">attracted about this model</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.879" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">is that it seems to precisely do this</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:40.879" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re setting up from my vantage</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">point to my ear in part</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.879" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">is listen to the assimilation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:46.400" style="s2">integration capacity</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">and how it pulls the strengths of</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.400" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">various models together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:51.280" style="s2">generates coherence that&#39;s what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">often paying attention to and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.280" end="00:02:54.080" style="s2">what i</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">love so much about your formulation</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.080" end="00:02:56.959" style="s2">thank you greg that was very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">that was very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.959" end="00:03:00.159" style="s2">especially for the listener so thank you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">for that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.159" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">um that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly right um that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:07.680" style="s2">that&#39;s in a sense that&#39;s what i will be</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.280" style="s2">endeavoring to demonstrate as much as</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.680" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.280" end="00:03:13.120" style="s2">so i have a particular proposal about a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">particular strategy i want to you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:16.720" style="s2">i want to try to give a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.080" style="s2">scientific argument precisely because it</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.720" end="00:03:19.519" style="s2">does the thing that greg just said</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.080" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">cognitive sciences</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.519" end="00:03:22.640" style="s2">at least i argue for a version of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">cognitive science in which the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.640" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">this kind of meta theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:26.799" style="s2">integration is central to the practice</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.840" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.799" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">science because we&#39;re trying to bridge</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:34.239" style="s2">between work in artificial intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">neuroscience psychology and philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.239" end="00:03:38.319" style="s2">especially phenomenological philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.840" style="s2">about the nature and function of</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.319" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">consciousness so</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:44.840" style="s2">one of the strategies we use in</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">cognitive science that is different</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.840" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">from uh typically strategies that are</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:52.560" style="s2">used in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:55.760" style="s2">or in neuroscience um</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.560" end="00:03:57.200" style="s2">and it overlaps with strategies used in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.760" end="00:04:00.000" style="s2">artificial intelligence it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.200" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">design stance um and so the design</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.000" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">sense of this idea you try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:06.239" style="s2">what a phenomenon is</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:09.040" style="s2">by reverse engineering you try to figure</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.239" end="00:04:11.439" style="s2">out well if i had to build a machine</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.040" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">until recently this was not a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.439" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">people could generally use</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">right but now we&#39;re getting to the place</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:19.440" style="s2">where this is now becoming</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">a plausibly viable strategy so what what</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.440" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">i wanna i wanna get on this you know i</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:26.639" style="s2">wanna understand let&#39;s say intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">general intelligence so and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.639" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">project it&#39;s on right now</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:32.160" style="s2">my project is artificial general</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">intelligence i try to make</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.160" end="00:04:38.720" style="s2">a machine that has</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">that i try to design it and by doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.720" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:43.600" style="s2">i often have to wrestle with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">deepest and harder</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.600" end="00:04:46.800" style="s2">hardest problems of figuring out what</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:49.040" style="s2">the phenomena is</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.800" end="00:04:50.880" style="s2">and it gives me a new way of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.040" end="00:04:53.360" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.880" end="00:04:55.120" style="s2">that can be valuable to people in</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.360" end="00:04:57.040" style="s2">psychology who perhaps might be taking a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.120" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">more experimental approach</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.040" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">or neuroscience who are taking you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.840" style="s2">a more direct measurement approach of</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:05.039" style="s2">fmri and eeg etc and that</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.840" end="00:05:07.120" style="s2">so that&#39;s what i&#39;m going to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.039" end="00:05:09.520" style="s2">offer here because i think uh that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">allow us to powerfully bridge</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.520" end="00:05:15.039" style="s2">so yeah no i just it&#39;s a to me this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">again this is why we think so much alike</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.039" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">i mean i basically reverse engineering</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.479" style="s2">propositional knowing with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:22.960" style="s2">justification systems theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.479" end="00:05:24.000" style="s2">basically exactly and and that again</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.960" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">this is this big picture</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.000" end="00:05:27.600" style="s2">coherence capacity is when you reverse</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">engineer and all of a sudden you have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.600" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">design feature and you get a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:32.240" style="s2">lock key kind of relation potential and</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:33.840" style="s2">then you see things from different</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.240" end="00:05:36.000" style="s2">perspectives it deepens</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.840" end="00:05:36.960" style="s2">raises questions and also i think when</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.000" end="00:05:39.520" style="s2">it works</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.960" end="00:05:41.120" style="s2">gets that lock key correspondence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.520" end="00:05:42.720" style="s2">you know so yeah anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.120" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">no no that&#39;s that&#39;s well said that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.720" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">very well said</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:47.280" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to make i&#39;m going to make</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:49.440" style="s2">two what i think are plausible</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.280" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">presumptions in order to try and</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.440" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">take the design stance i&#39;m going to take</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:58.319" style="s2">um that agi is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.160" style="s2">progressive progressively successful</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.319" end="00:06:02.000" style="s2">project um</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.160" end="00:06:03.600" style="s2">i&#39;m not saying we&#39;ve made autonomous ai</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.000" end="00:06:05.360" style="s2">or anything ridiculous like that</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.600" end="00:06:07.280" style="s2">but i think a very reasonable conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.360" end="00:06:10.080" style="s2">to draw from the last</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.280" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">15 years is that this project is</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.080" end="00:06:12.639" style="s2">progressing</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:14.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even progressing in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.639" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">linear fashion it&#39;s progressing in a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.080" end="00:06:17.120" style="s2">non-linear fashion</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:18.800" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.120" end="00:06:20.319" style="s2">justification for that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.800" end="00:06:21.919" style="s2">basically the argument of something like</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.319" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">this if</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.919" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">we can&#39;t succeed in um coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:29.280" style="s2">intelligence out of the out of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:31.600" style="s2">physical</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.280" end="00:06:32.880" style="s2">then i think we&#39;re doomed in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.600" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">get the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.880" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">out of the physical so what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:40.960" style="s2">is it&#39;s plausible that this project</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">is progressing agi and if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.960" end="00:06:43.600" style="s2">succeed</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:45.759" style="s2">i think we&#39;re really doomed in trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.600" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">give an account of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.759" end="00:06:49.280" style="s2">that can fit into the scientific over</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:51.280" style="s2">oral view so those are my two</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.280" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">methodological presuppositions</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.280" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">and then what i want to do is i want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">say okay let&#39;s say we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.720" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">build a machine that had api and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:00.840" style="s2">here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:03.039" style="s2">here&#39;s another part of what i&#39;m arguing</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.840" end="00:07:05.599" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.039" end="00:07:07.520" style="s2">if we take the design stance we will be</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.599" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">always if this is what the design stance</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.520" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">it makes you always move between and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:12.800" style="s2">you alluded to this</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:14.560" style="s2">always move between and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.800" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">integrate the function issue in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.560" end="00:07:17.599" style="s2">nature issue</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:19.680" style="s2">and when i&#39;m trying to design something</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.599" end="00:07:21.759" style="s2">i&#39;m obviously trying to make it function</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.680" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">but if i&#39;m doing the genuine design</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.759" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">stance i&#39;m also trying to bring it into</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:26.000" style="s2">existence</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">so the design stance is linking the</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.000" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">design function</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">thing together and by trying to design</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">artificial</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:33.919" style="s2">general intelligence we&#39;re we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">to try and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.919" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">explicate and justify the intuition</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:41.440" style="s2">that there&#39;s deep connections the deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:42.080" style="s2">intuition that the deep connections</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.440" end="00:07:44.720" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.080" end="00:07:45.199" style="s2">intelligence and consciousness yes okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.720" end="00:07:48.560" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">yep that&#39;s sort of the methodological</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.560" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">uh just the sort of the justification of</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:54.560" style="s2">my method</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s a methodological justification</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.560" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">so what i want to start with</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.400" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">is the idea that what&#39;s at the core</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">of intelligence is a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:06.400" style="s2">uh for relevance realization and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.400" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">talked about this a lot i&#39;ve argued this</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.319" style="s2">in many places</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">elsewhere you&#39;ve and you published on it</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.319" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">you&#39;ve published particularly like</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.360" style="s2">so there&#39;s good i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:19.440" style="s2">recapitulate that argument it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.360" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">there there&#39;s a lot of material on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.440" end="00:08:22.479" style="s2">and we&#39;ve also touched on it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:25.599" style="s2">discussed it</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.479" end="00:08:27.120" style="s2">also at length here so i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.599" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">just gonna assume</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.120" end="00:08:30.879" style="s2">that that&#39;s one huge component of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">is needed</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.879" end="00:08:36.719" style="s2">in order to be in intelligent systems</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:38.560" style="s2">and when we say relevance realization i</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.719" end="00:08:40.479" style="s2">i sometimes want to put in a third r</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.560" end="00:08:42.159" style="s2">make it rr because we&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.479" end="00:08:43.039" style="s2">talking about a massively recursive</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.159" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">because we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.039" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">about that yep also throughout this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:48.880" style="s2">whole argument that&#39;s right massively</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.480" style="s2">recursive</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.880" end="00:08:52.160" style="s2">and then that&#39;s that&#39;s going to relate</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.480" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">to things like the uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:55.680" style="s2">dynamic interrelation of perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:58.800" style="s2">participatory modeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.680" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">yeah cross yes yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">exactly well said it&#39;s really good to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.600" end="00:09:07.279" style="s2">doing this with you man it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:08.240" style="s2">it&#39;s really good um like just that like</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.279" end="00:09:11.680" style="s2">you do those little</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.240" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">things and they just they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.680" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re wonderful they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:15.920" style="s2">they&#39;re seamless but they also tie</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">things together so</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.920" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">i just want to compliment you on that</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">because thank you friend appreciate that</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:26.800" style="s2">great it&#39;s fun fun to be here okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:30.160" style="s2">what uh what i want to do now is uh make</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.800" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">another step and this is there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.160" end="00:09:33.120" style="s2">in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t need to go into this in great</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.120" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">detail for the argument you and i are</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.440" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">going to explore today</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:41.519" style="s2">but i do want to indicate to people that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">the the deep version of this argument</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.519" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">is forthcoming and i want to i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:47.600" style="s2">on this argument right now with a former</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">student of mine and he&#39;s also a student</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.600" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">of andy cox</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:52.720" style="s2">mark miller and mark miller and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">another person i just met because he</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.720" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">reached out to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:57.920" style="s2">uh because of the awakening from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:09:58.399" style="s2">meeting crisis area brett anderson and</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.920" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.399" end="00:10:03.600" style="s2">we are we&#39;re really working on very hard</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.120" style="s2">is uh the idea that we could integrate</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.600" end="00:10:06.720" style="s2">relevance realization theory with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.120" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">predictive processing models</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.720" end="00:10:10.800" style="s2">especially that have come out you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:12.079" style="s2">around clark&#39;s work and friskin&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.800" end="00:10:12.399" style="s2">and i know you&#39;re very familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.079" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.399" end="00:10:16.959" style="s2">yep familiar with them too and then and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">then the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.959" end="00:10:21.120" style="s2">and then and the version of predictive</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:23.760" style="s2">processing that mark especially thinks</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.120" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">will help make this work is not so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.760" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">uh the standard computational one but</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:30.079" style="s2">very much of 4e</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">cognitive science where embodiment in</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.079" end="00:10:33.600" style="s2">action and all that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:35.920" style="s2">is the best interpretation of how it</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.600" end="00:10:39.279" style="s2">works that&#39;s super exciting</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.920" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">uh for me and my you know 30 000 uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.279" end="00:10:42.800" style="s2">foot view that i tend to take i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">thinking about what is information you</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.800" end="00:10:45.600" style="s2">know i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">information processing system that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.600" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">input recursive computation and output</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:53.040" style="s2">okay i talk about semantic information</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">and i talk about information theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.040" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">okay so now if we have relevance</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:58.320" style="s2">realization pulling information</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">processing and semantic</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.320" end="00:11:01.680" style="s2">and then we bloop it into information</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">thorough theoretic</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.680" end="00:11:05.040" style="s2">and the predictive capacity of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.079" style="s2">extracting you know and reducing</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.040" end="00:11:09.279" style="s2">uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.079" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">man you are pulling uh things yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.279" end="00:11:12.720" style="s2">so i think some of the most recent work</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">on uh integrating</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.720" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">uh the information theoretic approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">with the semantic information idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:21.519" style="s2">it is works exactly along these lines</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">um and perhaps that that&#39;s something we</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.519" end="00:11:25.200" style="s2">could get back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">but again assimilation integration and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.200" end="00:11:29.200" style="s2">connecting with coherence</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s all converging in that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.200" end="00:11:32.959" style="s2">way so one of the things well first of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:36.000" style="s2">all in place people are not aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.959" end="00:11:38.640" style="s2">like a very quick very quick primer</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.000" end="00:11:41.120" style="s2">on predictive processing and so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.640" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">the predictive processing model</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.120" end="00:11:44.560" style="s2">um is the idea that what the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:47.600" style="s2">primarily trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.560" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">is uh predict now notice how that</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:49.519" style="s2">immediately</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:51.600" style="s2">sounds like we&#39;re at the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.519" end="00:11:52.480" style="s2">level and that&#39;s why i took took time to</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.600" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">indicate that</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.480" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">you know where brett and where brent and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:12:00.160" style="s2">mark and i are working</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">is at a deeper level um</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.160" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">uh uh you know more at the perspective</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">but very much more at the perspective i</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">will participate</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">actually i shared on my list uh a little</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:14.399" style="s2">uh five minute uh clip of a spiderweb</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">and is it spiderweb an extension of its</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.399" end="00:12:18.959" style="s2">mind okay absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">and how it utilizes that to model and</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.959" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">and expand its sensory feedback oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">that&#39;s just cool that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">so we can you know make that yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:28.000" style="s2">talking about a level potentially a</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">spider here okay so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.000" end="00:12:31.839" style="s2">right not at narrative prediction</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.839" end="00:12:35.839" style="s2">no exactly exactly and at some point i</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:36.880" style="s2">want to talk to you about that when we</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.839" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">move to narrative</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.880" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">how that starts to afford the</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">justification problem but uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:44.959" style="s2">well again i&#39;ll take that one i&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">that one</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.959" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">too many candies okay so uh the basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">idea of the predictive processing model</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:54.160" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:56.000" style="s2">um is that what this brain is finally</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.160" end="00:12:57.680" style="s2">constantly trying to do is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.000" end="00:12:58.240" style="s2">predict its environment the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.680" end="00:13:00.560" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.240" end="00:13:02.000" style="s2">uh the idea is it can&#39;t really directly</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.560" end="00:13:04.079" style="s2">predict its environment</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.000" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">so what it can directly do is predict</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.079" end="00:13:08.560" style="s2">itself so the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">and so this is i think central to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.560" end="00:13:13.839" style="s2">it&#39;s making use of sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:16.959" style="s2">a bayesian idea of how you alter</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.839" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">um the uh assigned probability uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.959" end="00:13:20.959" style="s2">of a belief i don&#39;t like this language</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:22.240" style="s2">uh but based on evidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.959" end="00:13:23.519" style="s2">because it&#39;s all very propositional</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.240" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to thought below that level</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.519" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">so i&#39;m not going to keep saying that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:28.480" style="s2">i&#39;m just i&#39;m going to accept that people</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:29.040" style="s2">understand that we&#39;re just using these</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.480" end="00:13:31.920" style="s2">words</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.040" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">as stand-ins so the idea is what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.920" end="00:13:35.519" style="s2">brain does</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.880" style="s2">is higher levels of the brain so you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.519" end="00:13:38.880" style="s2">think of the brain as hierarchically</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.880" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">organized and great is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.880" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">you know emphasized this multiple times</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:44.639" style="s2">right now i think there&#39;s a very much a</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">consensus view about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.639" end="00:13:48.480" style="s2">right is that uh it&#39;s a neural network</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:49.920" style="s2">in which uh</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.480" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">here&#39;s the lowest level this is the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.920" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">level that&#39;s in direct sensory motor</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">contact with the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:57.040" style="s2">and then this level what it tries to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.120" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">is predict this level</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.040" end="00:14:00.079" style="s2">and then the idea is right and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:01.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a level</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.079" end="00:14:03.360" style="s2">above that that tries to predict that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.600" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">level and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.360" end="00:14:06.880" style="s2">yep and then the idea is by trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">reduce</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.880" end="00:14:10.639" style="s2">how surprised it is by what the lower</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">levels are doing</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.639" end="00:14:16.560" style="s2">indirectly it will start to predict</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">pat it will start to zero in and predict</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.560" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">the real patterns in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">is that fair enough so far greg</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:24.320" style="s2">absolutely and we&#39;re gonna let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">uh asterisk the word surprise there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.320" end="00:14:26.800" style="s2">yeah because then when you get surprised</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">you will then</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.800" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">pull and then there&#39;s gonna be energy to</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:33.839" style="s2">try to model that surprise</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">and then readjust right and so these are</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.839" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">these are places by the way where</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">relevance realization comes in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">because predictive processing talks</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:41.839" style="s2">about revising the model or making</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:44.639" style="s2">alternative models</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.839" end="00:14:45.519" style="s2">and that&#39;s actually an issue around</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.639" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">relevance</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.519" end="00:14:49.760" style="s2">um and relevance realization because</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:52.560" style="s2">what the system is also</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.760" end="00:14:53.600" style="s2">facing as a problem is uh it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.560" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">modeling</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.600" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">um the hidden causes in the world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:14:59.600" style="s2">what i mean by hidden causes it&#39;s trying</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.000" style="s2">to create</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.600" end="00:15:03.600" style="s2">by predicting what&#39;s going to happen at</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.000" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">the lowest level</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.600" end="00:15:06.720" style="s2">it&#39;s actually creating at least a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">procedural model</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.720" end="00:15:10.160" style="s2">of the causal patterns in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">are making those patterns</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.160" end="00:15:14.560" style="s2">on the in the sensory motor and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">system can adjust by altering its</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.560" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">predictions</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">or by altering the world to make them</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:20.639" style="s2">conform to the predictions and so there</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">if you can see how it right gets you</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.639" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">right into the sensory motor loop</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:29.519" style="s2">and then he wrote but the idea there is</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">okay but it&#39;s often having to predict</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.519" end="00:15:33.120" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:34.079" style="s2">at multiple temporal scales like right</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.120" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.079" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">like because the question of what should</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:38.880" style="s2">it model of course the relevance</p>

<p begin="00:15:38.880" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">yep what&#39;s happening right now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">happening a little deeper in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:49.040" style="s2">longitudinal and then the idea is there</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">the layers in some sense correspond</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.040" end="00:15:54.720" style="s2">to these temporal and spatial scopes</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:56.399" style="s2">and then what you&#39;re doing is this</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.720" end="00:15:59.600" style="s2">hugely dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.399" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">massively recursive uh uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.600" end="00:16:03.759" style="s2">process in which error signals from the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:06.480" style="s2">layers permeate</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.759" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">up and then correction signals or action</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.480" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">signals permeate down and now notice</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:11.360" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got greg</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:14.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve got what we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.360" end="00:16:15.519" style="s2">a lot right we&#39;ve got a machine that is</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.240" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">set up to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.519" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">an important kind of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">realization why because as it goes</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:24.079" style="s2">up it&#39;s doing data compression it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:26.160" style="s2">doing a massive data compression</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.079" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">as it comes down it&#39;s doing massive data</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.160" end="00:16:31.680" style="s2">particularization</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:34.639" style="s2">it&#39;s doing this in a hugely complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.680" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">process of dynamical self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.639" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">and what is it doing it&#39;s regulating</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">the sensory motor loop because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">updating its models but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.720" style="s2">changing the world with action</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:46.240" style="s2">and so you&#39;ve got this loop and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.720" end="00:16:47.600" style="s2">loop happen and so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.240" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m not going to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.600" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">technical details but you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">relevance realization theory and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">predictive processing theory just</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:58.480" style="s2">really go really really nicely together</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">you can just i mean for me at least you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.480" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">see the fractal line the fractal line</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">you know back and forth basically yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">well said and so what we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:09.679" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">it and i want to sort of say this</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.679" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">carefully i wrote it down because it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:16.319" style="s2">you can i&#39;m making uh like you said i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:18.079" style="s2">making an assimilation space</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.319" end="00:17:19.760" style="s2">for where the mutual modeling kind of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.079" end="00:17:22.559" style="s2">idea can come in but what we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.760" end="00:17:23.919" style="s2">notice how this the brain is actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.559" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">modeling itself</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.919" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">in this massively recursive manner in</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:30.559" style="s2">order to model the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">and in modeling the world it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.559" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">also modeling itself this goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:34.880" style="s2">work of hawaii</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:37.039" style="s2">and michaels and they work on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.880" end="00:17:38.080" style="s2">predictive processing models of the self</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.039" end="00:17:41.440" style="s2">and you and i are going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.080" end="00:17:43.600" style="s2">the self at some point too indeed</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.440" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">because they because one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.600" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">one of the error signals</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">i get right in the environment is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">precisely because of the way my body</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:53.679" style="s2">and my actions are altering my</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:54.400" style="s2">perception for example i&#39;m blinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.679" end="00:17:56.720" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.400" end="00:17:58.640" style="s2">okay so i have to my system has to learn</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.720" end="00:18:01.440" style="s2">to discount that i&#39;m a blinker</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.640" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">it has to learn to discount that i have</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.440" end="00:18:04.960" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">limited visual scope but that it can so</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.960" end="00:18:10.240" style="s2">what it does is it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.120" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">reciprocally modeling itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.240" end="00:18:14.559" style="s2">as it models the world so it&#39;s modeling</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:15.360" style="s2">itself in these layers but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.559" end="00:18:17.760" style="s2">creating a</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.360" end="00:18:18.640" style="s2">model of itself as it&#39;s modeling the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.760" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">world so you see</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.640" end="00:18:23.280" style="s2">massive mutual modeling going on here</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">it&#39;s gotta have a model so it can factor</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.280" end="00:18:26.160" style="s2">itself out as it shifts so that it</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:28.880" style="s2">maintains</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.160" end="00:18:30.880" style="s2">you know the signal uh you know relative</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.880" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">to the noise that&#39;s created by its own</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.880" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">shifts so you can think of it even</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:37.280" style="s2">having so</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:40.400" style="s2">while it is doing this massive recursive</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.280" end="00:18:44.080" style="s2">ma self like modeling it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.400" end="00:18:45.840" style="s2">modeling itself in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.080" end="00:18:47.840" style="s2">well this is why i often talk about</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.840" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">animal environment relation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.840" end="00:18:51.280" style="s2">between models</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">yeah animal environment relations model</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.280" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">you gotta model the animal</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:56.400" style="s2">modeling environment and then model the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:58.320" style="s2">dynamic relation and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.400" end="00:19:00.880" style="s2">in in order to maintain the control</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.320" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">necessary hierarchical control feedback</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.880" end="00:19:04.640" style="s2">systems across time those are the</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:06.720" style="s2">variables that definitely need</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.640" end="00:19:08.160" style="s2">exactly and so ultimately what is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.720" end="00:19:11.919" style="s2">constraining all of this</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.160" end="00:19:14.799" style="s2">is how again so that&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.919" end="00:19:15.840" style="s2">you know uh that doesn&#39;t completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.799" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.840" end="00:19:19.760" style="s2">like what is modeled and how is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:22.559" style="s2">modeled right it&#39;s ultimately about</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.760" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">how is it this notion of self-relevance</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:26.720" style="s2">how is it ultimately relevant</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.160" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">to an adaptive autonomous autopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.720" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">and again that&#39;s another place in which</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">the relevance realization machinery</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">comes in it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.160" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">technically more specifically with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:37.280" style="s2">way the predictive processing model</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:40.720" style="s2">talks about how attention</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.280" end="00:19:41.840" style="s2">uh is altering salience but i won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.720" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">into the details</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.840" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">right what we&#39;ve got is okay we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">already got</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:50.840" style="s2">you know massively recursive uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:52.080" style="s2">relevance realization predictive problem</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.080" end="00:19:55.520" style="s2">multi-layer and multi-dimensional mutual</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">modeling going on</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.520" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">is that okay so far um i&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:02.559" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s say we can we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:05.679" style="s2">got predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.559" end="00:20:06.720" style="s2">uh networks uh let&#39;s say the work that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.679" end="00:20:09.600" style="s2">i&#39;ve been doing over the</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.720" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">all these time all these years um we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.600" end="00:20:13.440" style="s2">got some</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">uh we&#39;ve got a naturalistic account of</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.440" end="00:20:17.440" style="s2">relevance realization so we could give</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:19.360" style="s2">everything i&#39;ve described so far could</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.440" end="00:20:20.240" style="s2">be given to a machine okay now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.360" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">ready to start</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.240" end="00:20:23.520" style="s2">is it can we just set the machine in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">world no because we&#39;re going to face</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.520" end="00:20:27.600" style="s2">some problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.880" style="s2">um now these problems it&#39;s not i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.600" end="00:20:29.840" style="s2">want to i&#39;m not trying to convey that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.880" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">people in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.840" end="00:20:32.960" style="s2">predictive processing are not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">these problems i&#39;m building this out</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.960" end="00:20:37.520" style="s2">step by step</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:40.559" style="s2">so we as a group you and i and potential</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.520" end="00:20:41.520" style="s2">uh viewers can contract the development</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.559" end="00:20:44.559" style="s2">of the argument</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.520" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">okay so what we we encounter this</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.559" end="00:20:48.480" style="s2">problem okay we&#39;ve got this system and</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:51.360" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be doing all this but</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.480" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">at some point it&#39;s taking in signal from</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.360" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">the world</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">at some point it&#39;s engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:58.720" style="s2">project like you&#39;ve said already</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">of taking information in the information</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.720" end="00:21:02.320" style="s2">theoretic sense and converting into</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:02.799" style="s2">something that is meaningful and useful</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.320" end="00:21:05.200" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">so at the very beginning we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.200" end="00:21:07.840" style="s2">problem that is called signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.159" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.840" end="00:21:11.039" style="s2">okay and and what we&#39;re gonna why i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.159" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">stopping here</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.039" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">is because one of the prominent theories</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">of consciousness the neuroscientific</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:19.679" style="s2">theories of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">runs directly off this signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.679" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:23.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why i&#39;m going to stop</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">at these certain roadblocks right every</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.120" end="00:21:27.039" style="s2">roadblock</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:28.480" style="s2">is associated with maybe roadblock is</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.039" end="00:21:30.640" style="s2">the right way but anyways</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.480" end="00:21:32.400" style="s2">it is associated with a guide post and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.640" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">then we want to stop and then organize</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:35.679" style="s2">this and this is the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:37.039" style="s2">uh that we can hone in on a pull from</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.679" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">assimilate and integrate</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.039" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">exactly exactly so what&#39;s the signal</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">detection problem the signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">problem is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:48.640" style="s2">that there&#39;s all the there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:50.080" style="s2">information i want there&#39;s information</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.640" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">that is some sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.080" end="00:21:54.000" style="s2">relevant to the organism but the problem</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:56.720" style="s2">with that because</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.000" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">information in the technical sense is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.720" end="00:21:59.120" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">co-variations between events in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.120" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">world right</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:04.559" style="s2">that the information i want is always</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">enmeshed and overlapped with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.559" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:08.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t want the way this is referred to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:11.679" style="s2">in the literature</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.640" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">is signal and noise noise doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.679" end="00:22:15.280" style="s2">just auditory noise</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">it means any event in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.280" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">anything that</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:19.600" style="s2">you are that you could potentially take</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">a signal</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.600" end="00:22:23.520" style="s2">but that you don&#39;t want let me give a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:27.039" style="s2">concrete example okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.520" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">so you&#39;re a gazelle right and you hear</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.039" end="00:22:33.919" style="s2">a noise in the bush okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:37.200" style="s2">now the problem facing you is this is</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.919" end="00:22:39.919" style="s2">that a signal for a leopard</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.200" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">that would be signal so does that noi</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:43.120" style="s2">does that sound i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:44.080" style="s2">use the word sound does that sound from</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.120" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">the bush</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">is that signal is that predicting that a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:49.520" style="s2">leopard is there</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.080" style="s2">remember the progressive processing</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.520" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">stuff yep or is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.080" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">being caused by the wind and all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">predicting is the wind is going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">continue to blow</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">now you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">right you can&#39;t tell so the idea is if</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">if this is the population of all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">signals</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:11.440" style="s2">it overlaps with all the population so</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of times and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.440" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">is a perennial problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">for us where we&#39;re facing this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">pollution of signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">by noise now what you can say is well</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">i&#39;ll what i&#39;ll do is i&#39;ll gather more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">information you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">but but the problem is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:26.159" style="s2">regresses as you try to gather more</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.159" end="00:23:29.200" style="s2">when you step back and try to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">information to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.200" end="00:23:32.880" style="s2">get certainty about the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">you&#39;ll encounter this same problem</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.880" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">again and again and again okay more</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:37.679" style="s2">noise comes along yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">exactly and in fact there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.679" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">versions of this where the noise expands</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:45.360" style="s2">exponentially as you try and explore for</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">for the signal that will initially</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.360" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">resolve</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:49.360" style="s2">your your primary signal you get a</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:51.919" style="s2">combinatorial explosion</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.360" end="00:23:52.799" style="s2">yeah exactly exactly so what does signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.919" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">detection</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.799" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">theory say we do so signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:23:59.679" style="s2">theory says</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:24:00.480" style="s2">we what we do is we set a criteria so</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.679" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">this is a top</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.480" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">down act what we do is i&#39;m going to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">to use anthropomorphic language</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">okay but that&#39;s because language is</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:09.520" style="s2">anthropomorphic so somehow the brain</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">decides</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.520" end="00:24:13.360" style="s2">right that it&#39;s going to kep it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:14.320" style="s2">let&#39;s say here&#39;s the two graphs</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.360" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.320" end="00:24:17.679" style="s2">it&#39;s going to set a criterion and what</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">it means by that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.679" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">it&#39;s going to count anything right below</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:23.919" style="s2">a certain threshold as</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.760" style="s2">noise and anything above a certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.919" end="00:24:27.600" style="s2">threshold as signal</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.760" end="00:24:28.799" style="s2">now let&#39;s take a look at the gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.600" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">the gazelle the the two errors the</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">gazelle can make are not</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.799" end="00:24:37.520" style="s2">equally in terms of their relevance to</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:40.720" style="s2">the gazelle</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.520" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">right so if the gazelle makes of this</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.720" end="00:24:46.480" style="s2">mistake</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:50.000" style="s2">it hears the sound</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.480" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">and takes it to be the wind</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.000" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s a leopard whoa that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">a very dangerous mistake you don&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">too many of those mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:02.720" style="s2">yeah right but there&#39;s another mistake</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:05.760" style="s2">it can make it could</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.720" end="00:25:06.480" style="s2">it could hear the sound predict a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.760" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">leopard</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.480" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">and it turns out to just be the wind but</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">now it&#39;s running around and all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:13.039" style="s2">other gazelles laugh at it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.480" style="s2">now it can&#39;t do this infinitely because</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.039" end="00:25:15.039" style="s2">it will burn up all of its caloric</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.480" end="00:25:17.279" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.039" end="00:25:18.240" style="s2">so it can&#39;t just say always run away</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.279" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">that won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.240" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">but what do gazelles do and again not</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">anthropomorphically even though the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:26.080" style="s2">language sounds that way</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">they set the criterion like really real</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.080" end="00:25:28.320" style="s2">depending on how you draw your graph</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:29.520" style="s2">i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.320" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">write i&#39;ll talk about it this way they</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.520" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">set the criteria very low which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:34.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll count</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.919" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">almost all of the sounds as signaling</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.960" end="00:25:39.360" style="s2">the leopard</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:41.120" style="s2">right because it&#39;s much more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:44.240" style="s2">for them to miss a leopard</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.120" end="00:25:46.559" style="s2">than to mistake the wind for a leopard</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.240" end="00:25:48.159" style="s2">but notice how this is a relevance</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.559" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">realization project</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.159" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">depending on the situation and depending</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">that can be completely inverted where a</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:58.640" style="s2">is much more worse for me much more</p>

<p begin="00:26:02.000" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">like here right you have to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.720" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">adjust</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">and move the criterion and you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">well i would argue of relevance</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.960" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">the comparative relevance of the two</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">risks this is known as error management</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">theory right right and sensitivity</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">specificity</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">yep yep all those things and so like</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">people even use error management theory</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:35.760" style="s2">and i think plausibly to try and explain</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">some of our cognitive biases</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.760" end="00:26:39.600" style="s2">why we&#39;re biased to make the things we</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:41.080" style="s2">do the kinds of mistakes we do</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.600" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">uh let me give one that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.080" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">non-controversial um</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.279" style="s2">you will you when things are approaching</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:49.360" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.279" end="00:26:50.480" style="s2">you see them approaching you uh in an</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.360" end="00:26:52.240" style="s2">illusory fashion</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.480" end="00:26:54.559" style="s2">you see them coming towards you much</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.240" end="00:26:56.320" style="s2">faster than they actually are</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.559" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">but when they&#39;re receding from you</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.320" end="00:27:00.400" style="s2">you&#39;re accurate it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">well why well because if i screw this</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">one up</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">it&#39;s very costly doc right yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:06.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:08.559" style="s2">so the idea is and you can see you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.799" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">even talk about like confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.559" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">and other biases in this term</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:15.679" style="s2">again those those heuristic functions</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">that help us with relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.679" end="00:27:19.679" style="s2">yep okay is this okay so far totally</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:21.840" style="s2">i&#39;ll just i&#39;ll throw in so</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.679" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">we got a dog named benji he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.840" end="00:27:25.440" style="s2">skittish okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:26.559" style="s2">so that basically every loud noise</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.440" end="00:27:28.960" style="s2">everything is then</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.559" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">very low threshold for the threat you</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.960" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">know so he&#39;s just like you know all of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:33.039" style="s2">sudden</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:34.000" style="s2">jump into to escape and run back up into</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.039" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">those underneath his bed</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.000" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">and hide okay so that&#39;s just whatever he</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:38.960" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen other dogs unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.960" end="00:27:42.480" style="s2">relaxed actually that gets into a</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:44.159" style="s2">tendency towards neuroticism at a</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.480" end="00:27:45.840" style="s2">dispositional level but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.159" end="00:27:47.679" style="s2">yeah but and we can talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.840" end="00:27:50.480" style="s2">about the degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.679" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">you know personality is a a very</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.480" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">longitudinal setting of of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:55.279" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.279" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">right yeah we&#39;ll flag that for later</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.279" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">yeah because well yeah let&#39;s just do</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:00.720" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:02.880" style="s2">let&#39;s just do it okay um so here&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.720" end="00:28:05.279" style="s2">we get a theory</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.880" end="00:28:06.399" style="s2">of consciousness actually on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.279" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">literature</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.399" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">um and it&#39;s by lao l-a-w</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:14.080" style="s2">and this goes to some work i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:16.559" style="s2">with richard wu especially richard wu</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.080" end="00:28:19.520" style="s2">but also anderson time</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.559" end="00:28:21.919" style="s2">and so what lao argues is that what any</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.520" end="00:28:23.600" style="s2">good theory of consciousness has to do</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">is to be able to tell you the difference</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:27.679" style="s2">between consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:29.840" style="s2">and blind sight so remember what blind</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.679" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">side is blindside is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.840" end="00:28:34.559" style="s2">where people can intelligently pick up</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">on the co-variations in the environment</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.559" end="00:28:37.600" style="s2">that they are phenomenologically blind</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:41.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.600" end="00:28:43.039" style="s2">they don&#39;t have any adjectival qualia</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.520" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">but you can like say you can do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.039" end="00:28:45.360" style="s2">like this you can put a stick in front</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:47.679" style="s2">of them and say</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.360" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">right and then and they&#39;ll say can you</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">see the stick and they&#39;ll say what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">wrong with you you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">i&#39;m blind you say black where do you</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:57.440" style="s2">think the stick is</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:58.320" style="s2">oh and you can oh it&#39;s there i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.440" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">guessing</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.320" end="00:29:02.320" style="s2">then you can even say well continue</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">guessing what angle do you think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.320" end="00:29:06.960" style="s2">stick is at</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:08.720" style="s2">45 degrees they can do stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.960" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.720" end="00:29:11.840" style="s2">wise france is the primary guy</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:12.880" style="s2">consciousness lost and found a really</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.840" end="00:29:16.000" style="s2">good book on that yep</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.880" end="00:29:16.799" style="s2">exactly so what lao proposes is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.000" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">following</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.799" end="00:29:20.559" style="s2">that right there&#39;s two things that go</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:22.240" style="s2">into signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.559" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">there&#39;s what he calls the sensitivity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.240" end="00:29:27.600" style="s2">the system that&#39;s just its ability to</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:28.240" style="s2">pick up on the co-variations right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.600" end="00:29:31.520" style="s2">he says</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.240" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what blindside is blindside is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.520" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">reliable picking up on the co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:37.840" style="s2">notice the language from descartes</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:39.760" style="s2">coming in here right away</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.840" end="00:29:40.960" style="s2">right right you&#39;re picking up on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.760" end="00:29:42.640" style="s2">co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.960" end="00:29:45.039" style="s2">but you don&#39;t actually have anything</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.640" end="00:29:48.159" style="s2">like a representation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.039" end="00:29:52.000" style="s2">right and so what laos says is</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.159" end="00:29:54.240" style="s2">what hap what what turns that blind side</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.000" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">detection of co-variation into</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.440" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">is the second part of signal detection</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.440" end="00:30:03.200" style="s2">which is setting the criteria</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">so when the brain sets the criterion</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.200" end="00:30:06.559" style="s2">this is think about this descartes would</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">love this this is a way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.559" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">covariations are being made</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">ready for reason because they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">sorted</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:15.440" style="s2">right in order to generate behavior that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.440" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">relevant to the organism isn&#39;t that i</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">mean that</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">descartes would go oh my gosh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">honestly</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:28.399" style="s2">and so the idea here is the the</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:31.760" style="s2">difference between consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.399" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">and um blind sight is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.760" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">the setting of the criterion that in</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:37.279" style="s2">some in an important way is now allowing</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">you to</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.279" end="00:30:42.880" style="s2">turn the right turn the co sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:44.640" style="s2">the co-variations you&#39;re doing a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.880" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">like i said looking through</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.640" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">the co-variations you&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">sort them in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">their behavioral uh and task relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:56.559" style="s2">right and so i i think that&#39;s beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.480" style="s2">now what lao</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.559" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t say i mean i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.480" end="00:31:02.559" style="s2">he thinks this is a comprehensive theory</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:04.720" style="s2">of consciousness he by the way thinks</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.559" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">that the setting of the criterion is</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:09.039" style="s2">remember we talked about rosenthal</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.000" style="s2">and the higher order he thinks that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.039" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.000" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">the higher order of action right then</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:17.919" style="s2">right that nicely that fits very nicely</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t think that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.919" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">comprehensive account of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:21.760" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t explain most of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">phenomenal properties</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.760" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">of consciousness or anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:27.840" style="s2">if we&#39;re going to no notice what</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.559" end="00:31:29.279" style="s2">happened we&#39;re just trying to make an</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.840" end="00:31:30.480" style="s2">organism intelligent we&#39;re just trying</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.279" end="00:31:33.440" style="s2">to give it the ability</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.480" end="00:31:35.039" style="s2">to do signal detection and already boom</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.440" end="00:31:36.799" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to have to bring in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.039" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">a lot of the machinery that is</p>

<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">with the function and perhaps even the</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.640" style="s2">nature of the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:46.159" style="s2">now here&#39;s here&#39;s the point that i make</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.640" end="00:31:49.600" style="s2">with the help of richard</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.159" end="00:31:52.399" style="s2">and uh and anderson is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.600" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">but lao does not give us any account of</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.399" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">how</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.039" style="s2">the criterion is set and remember the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:31:59.600" style="s2">setting of the criterion</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.039" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">is dynamic the criterion has to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.600" end="00:32:03.840" style="s2">constantly set</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:05.279" style="s2">and not only that the example right the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.840" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">way i&#39;m talking about this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.279" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">unit dimension i&#39;m talking about as if</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:11.120" style="s2">i&#39;m setting one</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:12.559" style="s2">criterion right what i&#39;m doing is a mult</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.120" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">i&#39;m setting criterion</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.559" end="00:32:16.000" style="s2">in for many different signals in terms</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.000" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">right so i&#39;m going to need that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">going to be needing to se i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">be needing to set this criterion</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">in a massively recursive right</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:30.480" style="s2">dynamic self-organizing manner go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:31.600" style="s2">so so essentially okay so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.480" end="00:32:34.000" style="s2">pull some</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.600" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">sensitivity and then pull in some</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.000" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">criteria that then it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">have a figure ground relation okay but</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:40.880" style="s2">then what are we going to ask specialize</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:42.480" style="s2">about the figure relative to the ground</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.880" end="00:32:43.679" style="s2">well that&#39;s going to change enormously</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.480" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">depending on a whole bunch of different</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.679" end="00:32:47.440" style="s2">kinds of context</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:48.240" style="s2">exactly exactly and you can see how what</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.440" end="00:32:49.200" style="s2">you&#39;re going to need</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.240" end="00:32:51.519" style="s2">is you&#39;re going to need relevance</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.200" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">realization within this</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.519" end="00:32:55.600" style="s2">you know this massively recursive</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:57.440" style="s2">processing model</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.600" end="00:32:59.440" style="s2">okay so already intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.440" end="00:33:01.760" style="s2">consciousness are already</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.440" end="00:33:03.519" style="s2">co-emerging together and i want to stop</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.760" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">and take note of that right at the very</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.519" end="00:33:07.120" style="s2">beginning of the project</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:08.080" style="s2">of trying to make a system give a system</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.120" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">agi</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.080" end="00:33:12.559" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to do that okay so now</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:14.640" style="s2">let&#39;s go into that idea of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.559" end="00:33:16.159" style="s2">prediction and let&#39;s talk about some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.640" end="00:33:18.240" style="s2">the stuff we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.159" end="00:33:19.679" style="s2">alluded to what we&#39;re actually talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.240" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">about i think this is a much better term</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.679" end="00:33:21.519" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:23.919" style="s2">is we&#39;re actually talking about</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.519" end="00:33:25.120" style="s2">anticipation we&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.919" end="00:33:28.640" style="s2">the system</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.120" end="00:33:32.080" style="s2">is in a highly integrated fashion</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.640" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">predicting the world predicting itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.080" end="00:33:35.600" style="s2">and predicting the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:36.640" style="s2">those that&#39;s really nice actually i</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.600" end="00:33:38.080" style="s2">hadn&#39;t heard that but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.640" end="00:33:39.919" style="s2">immediately resonates because it does</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.080" end="00:33:41.840" style="s2">get you out of your propositional</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.919" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">you know and get you into intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.840" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">perspectival participatory you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">much more than oh i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.600" style="s2">hypothesize and predict</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:51.440" style="s2">i mean at least just at an intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.600" end="00:33:52.799" style="s2">level it resonates more well no and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.440" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">i think it goes very well with your</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.799" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">behavioral investment theory and here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:58.240" style="s2">how i think so</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:59.840" style="s2">so the the system is like doing this</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.240" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">prediction and within that it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.840" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">doing we talk about it has to be setting</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:03.440" style="s2">the criteria and it&#39;s doing all this</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:06.720" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.440" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">right but it&#39;s also forming a model of</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.720" end="00:34:10.079" style="s2">itself it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:12.960" style="s2">and those are being right mutually</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.079" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2">modeled and notice what it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.960" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">we can think of prediction the</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">anticipation is made up of prediction</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:21.520" style="s2">which is actually picking up on these</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">patterns and then setting the criterion</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.520" end="00:34:24.720" style="s2">right right but we also can think of it</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:28.159" style="s2">and here&#39;s where i think it comes in</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.720" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">as preparation yes anticipation is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:31.599" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:33.599" style="s2">right preparation and preparation is not</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.599" end="00:34:36.639" style="s2">just to have a model of the self</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.599" end="00:34:38.159" style="s2">it is to use that model to shape how</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.639" end="00:34:40.560" style="s2">you&#39;re going to invest</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.159" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">your that&#39;s right right that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.560" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">and when you&#39;re actually engaged in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">investment what you&#39;re actually doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:47.359" style="s2">is you&#39;re breaking up little parts of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:48.240" style="s2">investment because a huge amount of what</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.359" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">your goals are</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.240" end="00:34:52.800" style="s2">often are nested hierarchies of goals</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:54.240" style="s2">exactly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.800" end="00:34:55.919" style="s2">and so then you have to anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.240" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s the immediate goal and</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.919" end="00:34:58.960" style="s2">then there&#39;s a mid-level goal there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">higher order goal and all of that&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.960" end="00:35:01.119" style="s2">to be sorted</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">and then you&#39;re organizing and</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.119" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">coordinating the pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:09.440" style="s2">dynamic investment relation</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:11.680" style="s2">excellent so let&#39;s take all of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.440" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve got is we&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.680" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">multi-scale doing exactly what greg just</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">said right and it&#39;s doing the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">realization the predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:24.640" style="s2">but also the criterion setting</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s all right did you drop signal</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.640" end="00:35:28.320" style="s2">there for a second</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.720" style="s2">i did no i&#39;m here okay i&#39;m fine so i</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.320" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.720" end="00:35:32.640" style="s2">i think we&#39;re okay okay okay so right</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.480" style="s2">you&#39;re doing all of that</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.640" end="00:35:36.000" style="s2">and so what we&#39;re basically doing is</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.480" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.000" end="00:35:42.640" style="s2">i&#39;ve already alluded to we&#39;re picking up</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">these these co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.640" end="00:35:46.800" style="s2">that are co-variations that are actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">picking up on affordances</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.800" end="00:35:50.800" style="s2">because they&#39;re not just predictions of</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:53.359" style="s2">the world they&#39;re anticipations</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.800" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">so this is picking up on co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.359" end="00:35:58.720" style="s2">that are affordances</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:36:01.359" style="s2">that my signal for you keeps dropping</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.720" end="00:36:02.800" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what but you&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.359" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">any problem on your end right actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.800" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">mine&#39;s been clear</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">so okay well i&#39;ll just assume that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">just something</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:11.440" style="s2">insignificant then and so notice what</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got co-variations that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.440" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">are actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">importances because we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">anticipation not just but a pure</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:20.480" style="s2">prediction</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">and then we&#39;re now doing this massively</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.480" end="00:36:25.280" style="s2">you know massively recursive process of</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">compressing and particularizing them</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.280" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">and that&#39;s constraining the sensory</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.320" style="s2">motor loop and i propose to you</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">that is a very powerful way in which</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.320" end="00:36:35.920" style="s2">we&#39;re doing what descartes wanted</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">right where we&#39;re doing some significant</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.920" end="00:36:39.119" style="s2">compression actually deep learning on</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:41.119" style="s2">the co-variations</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.119" end="00:36:42.320" style="s2">and we&#39;re detecting through them which</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.119" end="00:36:44.000" style="s2">is exactly what the predictive</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.320" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">processing model says we&#39;re detecting</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.000" end="00:36:45.760" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:48.160" style="s2">we&#39;re actually figuring out what the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.760" end="00:36:49.599" style="s2">deep causes are really</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.160" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">let&#39;s put it actually in the here and</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.599" end="00:36:54.240" style="s2">now so what you&#39;re as you track</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">the screen right you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.240" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">anticipations about what my movements</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">will be or what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:00.079" style="s2">what you&#39;re expecting and when it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.920" style="s2">freezes right then you get surprised</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.079" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">then you activate like well okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.920" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening you shift them</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.520" style="s2">free of reference right yeah because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:09.760" style="s2">because the scale modeling across the</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.520" end="00:37:11.520" style="s2">various perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.760" end="00:37:13.440" style="s2">is not as it gets off and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.520" end="00:37:15.280" style="s2">sudden you have to wait right right</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.440" end="00:37:18.400" style="s2">because i don&#39;t want to treat all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.280" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">surprises as equally salient or relevant</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.400" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">right that&#39;s important but you know if</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">your hair moves in a way that i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">really anticipate</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">because i didn&#39;t realize that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">a haircut right i don&#39;t go oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:31.680" style="s2">i mean i might if it&#39;s a particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">beautiful haircut but right you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.680" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to do much certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:37.920" style="s2">with me</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">so as as greg said a few minutes ago</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.920" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about how we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:42.440" style="s2">basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:43.680" style="s2">at least proto-aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.440" end="00:37:45.440" style="s2">proto-representation</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.680" end="00:37:47.200" style="s2">we&#39;re getting this process in which</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.440" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to do that whole process</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.200" end="00:37:49.760" style="s2">of sizing up</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:52.400" style="s2">we&#39;re starting to get the very</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.760" end="00:37:54.320" style="s2">beginnings of perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.400" end="00:37:55.839" style="s2">but notice how much of the mesh in</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.320" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.839" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">because the system models itself to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:02.000" style="s2">model the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:03.680" style="s2">and in modeling the world it models</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:08.400" style="s2">itself there is a deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.680" end="00:38:11.920" style="s2">knowing by conformity there amen</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.400" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">okay so now we get to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.920" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">the next theory because we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:18.320" style="s2">how this is so</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.119" end="00:38:20.480" style="s2">massively recursive and self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.320" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">which means it&#39;s inherently dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.480" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">which means it&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:25.280" style="s2">developmental it&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">developmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.280" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">as both the relevance realization theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">and the predictive processing theory</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:36.560" style="s2">are so this takes us to clearness</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:38.960" style="s2">and clear men&#39;s theory is probably the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.560" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">theory of consciousness that gives pride</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.960" end="00:38:42.800" style="s2">of place</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">to developmental explanation</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:46.240" style="s2">he has what he calls the radical</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">plasticity</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.240" end="00:38:52.320" style="s2">hypothesis where plasticity is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:54.000" style="s2">uh a system&#39;s capacity to literally</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.320" end="00:38:56.160" style="s2">redesign itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.000" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">reshape itself in order to make itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.160" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">more adaptively fit to the environment</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:02.400" style="s2">so there&#39;s been a lot over the last two</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">decades about how plastic the brain is</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.400" end="00:39:06.079" style="s2">brain plasticity and he&#39;s invoking them</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">and so he has an</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.079" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">idea he has an argument and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:12.800" style="s2">that many people the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">really where he thinks consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.800" end="00:39:16.560" style="s2">something that develops</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t think now where it begins a</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.560" end="00:39:19.520" style="s2">development of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t say and that of course</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.520" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">doesn&#39;t so it&#39;s not going to resolve any</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">of our</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">ethical issues uh about you know when</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">when does consciousness begin</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:29.520" style="s2">but what he says is that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:31.920" style="s2">is actually something you</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.520" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">learn to do which is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.920" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">that&#39;s very that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:35.920" style="s2">now this is the part where descartes is</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">going to get very start what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.920" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">all right how can you learn</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">consciousness as long as you have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">immaterial glue in your head you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">conscious and clearman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:46.400" style="s2">is saying well no what actually has to</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.400" end="00:39:50.320" style="s2">and think about what we said all this</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:53.040" style="s2">machinery has to train up</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.320" end="00:39:54.480" style="s2">and evolve before it&#39;s going to get some</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.040" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">of the capacities</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.480" end="00:39:58.079" style="s2">that are needed for consciousness so he</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:39:59.839" style="s2">like lao</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.079" end="00:40:01.280" style="s2">follows rosenthal that&#39;s why i spend so</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.839" end="00:40:04.000" style="s2">much time on roosevelt</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.280" end="00:40:05.359" style="s2">right and making the deep connections</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.000" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">between rosenthal&#39;s theory and</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.359" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">aspectualization</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">he says well and notice how this fits in</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">with the predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:15.760" style="s2">what&#39;s happening is right you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:17.680" style="s2">this training up and the higher levels</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.760" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">are learning to better represent the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.680" end="00:40:19.920" style="s2">lower levels</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:21.520" style="s2">we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have to be bound to</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.920" end="00:40:22.720" style="s2">that language because we can already use</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.520" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">this other language</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.720" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">and what&#39;s interesting about it he</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:29.440" style="s2">acknowledges</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:31.839" style="s2">he acknowledges that it&#39;s not enough for</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.440" end="00:40:33.680" style="s2">the upper levels to represent or even to</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.839" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">track the lower levels</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.680" end="00:40:37.280" style="s2">he says that what turns them into</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.280" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">is they they care about</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:46.480" style="s2">the lower levels right they right they</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">right there there there&#39;s an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.480" end="00:40:49.760" style="s2">or at least an</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">afternoon would appreciate that yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.760" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">thought you would</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">mark those too because mark thinks uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.280" style="s2">affective components within the</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">self-organization of predictive</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.280" end="00:41:00.079" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:01.200" style="s2">are doing a lot of the important work</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.079" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">yeah actually i</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.200" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">think i said heidegger would appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">it but i appreciate it also</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.960" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">because of course i follow dreyfus in</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.160" end="00:41:23.760" style="s2">arguing that heidegger&#39;s primordial</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">notion of care</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.760" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">is relevance realization yay right and</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:30.160" style="s2">often you who says</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">you know the difference between our</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.160" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">processing and the computers processing</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:36.240" style="s2">is that doesn&#39;t care about</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">the information right because it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.240" end="00:41:39.760" style="s2">have to take care of itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:40.960" style="s2">i was trying to show care by setting you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.760" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.960" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">you did it you did extremely well so as</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">soon as we get to this theory</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:49.359" style="s2">right and notice how it works because</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">the system is</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.359" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">like developmental development means a</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:54.319" style="s2">system is auto-poetic it&#39;s taking care</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:56.560" style="s2">of itself</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.319" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s making itself and that and because</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.560" end="00:42:00.240" style="s2">of that it</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:00.960" style="s2">cares for itself and higher levels of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.960" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">care about right and so you&#39;ve got right</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">relevance realization within</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:08.400" style="s2">that&#39;s affording relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.599" style="s2">without</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.400" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">and so yeah okay so yeah i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.599" end="00:42:15.680" style="s2">throw in a couple of uh so the last</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:17.040" style="s2">there are six principles of behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.680" end="00:42:19.200" style="s2">investment that organize it</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.040" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">uh principle four is our computational</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.200" end="00:42:23.920" style="s2">control principle which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">the hardware principle five is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.920" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">constant iterative learning process</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">yeah okay and principle six is the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:33.760" style="s2">lifespan developmental history process</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">yeah okay and uh you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.760" end="00:42:37.040" style="s2">example that i use in relationship to my</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.640" style="s2">own personal world they&#39;re sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.040" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">terms of reorganizing</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.640" end="00:42:42.880" style="s2">anybody that&#39;s been through adolescence</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.960" style="s2">may remember how you get reorganized so</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.880" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">when i was 11 i thought of the world in</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.960" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">one way and let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">say girls one way and then at 12 and 13</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:52.480" style="s2">i thought very differently as</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">some sort of reorganization of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.480" end="00:42:57.040" style="s2">realization happened</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:59.920" style="s2">in those two-year periods yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.040" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">how development and consciousness really</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.920" end="00:43:03.200" style="s2">yeah you put it in those terms you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.960" style="s2">realize how radically your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.200" end="00:43:06.480" style="s2">can shift depending on developmental and</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.960" end="00:43:08.400" style="s2">learning histories</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.480" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">excellent so notice again why did we</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.400" end="00:43:11.440" style="s2">have to bring in development because if</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:12.240" style="s2">we&#39;re going to make an intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.440" end="00:43:13.280" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.240" end="00:43:14.960" style="s2">we&#39;re going to give it relevant</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.280" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">recursive relevance realization we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.960" end="00:43:18.800" style="s2">going to give it deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:20.079" style="s2">in right hierarchical predictive</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.800" end="00:43:21.920" style="s2">processing networks</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.079" end="00:43:23.440" style="s2">and those are inherently self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.920" end="00:43:25.920" style="s2">inherently developmental</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.440" end="00:43:27.200" style="s2">et cetera et cetera autoplecis is</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.920" end="00:43:29.680" style="s2">inherently developmental</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.200" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got we just we we&#39;re giving it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.680" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">the basic machinery of intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:33.520" style="s2">relevance realization predictive</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">processing</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.520" end="00:43:36.640" style="s2">signal detection and the capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.560" style="s2">plasticity and development and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.640" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">just building in more and more of a case</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.560" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">for the machinery of consciousness yep</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:47.599" style="s2">okay so now let&#39;s go to the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">something we talked about last time</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.599" end="00:43:51.359" style="s2">which is you&#39;re starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">higher levels of coordination you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.359" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">trying to coordinate</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:58.720" style="s2">right all this processing</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">and i think we&#39;re now at a place where</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.720" end="00:44:02.960" style="s2">we can start talking about well you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:05.040" style="s2">got all this mutual modeling going on</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.960" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">but there&#39;s a sense in which you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.040" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">going to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:11.200" style="s2">very higher order sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:15.359" style="s2">so the mutual modeling is also going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.760" end="00:44:18.480" style="s2">lead to the abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.359" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">of a very generalized model of oneself</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.480" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">and the world a space if you allow me a</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:26.640" style="s2">metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:27.119" style="s2">that can be coordinated to at various</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.640" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.119" end="00:44:31.839" style="s2">degrees and and so this automatically</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">sets up and you know where this is going</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.839" end="00:44:34.560" style="s2">to go</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">this sets up the global workspace theory</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.560" end="00:44:39.760" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:42.720" style="s2">right the idea that consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.760" end="00:44:44.160" style="s2">a like your desktop of your computer and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.720" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">so what&#39;s the model here okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.160" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">model is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">you have all this processing going on</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:50.319" style="s2">think about all these layers right</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:51.520" style="s2">right and all these dimensions and most</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.319" end="00:44:53.920" style="s2">of that those</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.520" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">processing is unconscious like most of</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.920" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">the files in your computer are</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:58.800" style="s2">unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:01.040" style="s2">but what you can do is you can activate</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.800" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">them by bringing them on to your desktop</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.040" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">your desktop can</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:06.000" style="s2">potentially access all or at least most</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">of the files</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.000" end="00:45:10.800" style="s2">yep okay so you can access that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:14.079" style="s2">and then when you make it active what</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.200" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">can you do well</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.079" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">you you basically can make it interact</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:19.200" style="s2">and reintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:21.200" style="s2">with other pieces of information and</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.200" end="00:45:22.640" style="s2">then you can broadcast it back</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.200" end="00:45:25.440" style="s2">you can store it you can store it</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">multiple locations and so the idea is he</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.440" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">also uses the metaphor of a theater</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:32.319" style="s2">right consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">what consciousness is the stage is</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.319" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">working memory</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:38.079" style="s2">and then i don&#39;t like this model of</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:40.240" style="s2">attention but i can put it aside for now</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.079" end="00:45:42.530" style="s2">the spotlight of attention i don&#39;t mind</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.240" end="00:45:44.839" style="s2">it so i i&#39;ll take the spotlight a little</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.530" end="00:45:46.800" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.839" end="00:45:48.480" style="s2">bit no that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.800" end="00:45:50.160" style="s2">i think i think the model of attention</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.480" end="00:45:52.400" style="s2">that comes out of uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.160" end="00:45:54.079" style="s2">out of you know waltz and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.400" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">christopher mole has is much more about</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.079" end="00:45:57.839" style="s2">relevance realization and integration</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:46:00.160" style="s2">than just shining because i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.839" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">that sailing is shined i think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.160" end="00:46:02.319" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.560" style="s2">much more complex yeah my favorite</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.319" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">broadband and and the attentional filter</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.560" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">iterative process is anyway whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">can we can do</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">about that but we can come back anyway i</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:11.920" style="s2">think yeah we&#39;ll come back we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:14.400" style="s2">potentially come back to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.920" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">uh consciousness and attention later but</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.400" end="00:46:19.599" style="s2">let&#39;s go with so you have this model of</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">you know the people in the audience are</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.599" end="00:46:21.839" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">right unconscious and the people behind</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.839" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">the stage are like the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">but the stage people are more like the</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">top down processing</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">and the audience is more like the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.480" style="s2">up processing and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:33.920" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the stage of working memory</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.480" end="00:46:35.680" style="s2">and then the spotlight of attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.920" end="00:46:38.480" style="s2">shines on it</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.680" end="00:46:39.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s consciousness so the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.480" end="00:46:40.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.040" end="00:46:41.760" style="s2">right you have all your or to use the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.400" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">computer metaphor you have all your</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.760" end="00:46:46.400" style="s2">files they&#39;re the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:48.079" style="s2">you draw them into the desk space</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.400" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">and when you&#39;re manipulating them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.079" end="00:46:52.400" style="s2">shining the spotlight of attention</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">and read and restructuring them remember</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.400" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">that restructuring them</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">and then sending them back to memory</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:58.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what the function of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:02.000" style="s2">consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.800" end="00:47:03.040" style="s2">yep and this is really cool because uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.000" end="00:47:05.839" style="s2">obviously now they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.040" end="00:47:07.440" style="s2">and so the uh the originator of this</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.839" end="00:47:08.640" style="s2">theory is its current defender</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.440" end="00:47:10.720" style="s2">although there are many people who</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.640" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">defend it it&#39;s a very prominent theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.720" end="00:47:14.000" style="s2">is bernard bars it&#39;s called global</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:16.079" style="s2">workspace theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.000" end="00:47:17.440" style="s2">and he explicitly argues and i</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">demonstrated that the model that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.440" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">this terrific overlap</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">between working memory attention and</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">and what&#39;s okay so i want to pause right</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">here right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">why why is that part of this argument</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:34.480" style="s2">well what what do measures of what are</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:37.440" style="s2">working what are measures of working</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.480" end="00:47:40.079" style="s2">memory really highly correlated with</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.440" end="00:47:41.200" style="s2">measures of general intelligence yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.079" end="00:47:43.920" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.200" end="00:47:45.599" style="s2">and what does working memory do we used</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.920" end="00:47:46.960" style="s2">to think it was just a holding space and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.599" end="00:47:50.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.960" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">a bit on uh a bit conveyed by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.880" end="00:47:54.240" style="s2">the stage model but the work of my</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:56.559" style="s2">colleague</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.240" end="00:47:57.680" style="s2">uh really brilliant lynn hasher at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.559" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">university of toronto</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">is basically said no no that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">too simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:04.240" style="s2">what working memory is it&#39;s a higher</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">order filter</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.240" end="00:48:07.680" style="s2">for relevance and you know how you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:09.520" style="s2">that that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.680" end="00:48:11.040" style="s2">what working memory does because of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.520" end="00:48:12.559" style="s2">phenomena of chunking</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.040" end="00:48:13.920" style="s2">remember we&#39;ve talked about this if i</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.559" end="00:48:14.880" style="s2">give you a string of letters and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:16.960" style="s2">no pattern in it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.880" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">and there&#39;s like 12 of them and i ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.960" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">you to remember that string of letters</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:22.000" style="s2">and you turn and look you&#39;ll remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:24.480" style="s2">four or five but if i turn that string</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.000" end="00:48:27.520" style="s2">of uh 12 letters into four words like</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.480" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">pig and cat and dog</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.520" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">and sit then you can do it because</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:33.920" style="s2">they&#39;re chunked</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:35.599" style="s2">right and so chunking shows that what</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.920" end="00:48:37.760" style="s2">working memory is doing</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.599" end="00:48:40.559" style="s2">is it&#39;s some kind of higher order</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.760" end="00:48:42.480" style="s2">relevance filter</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.559" end="00:48:44.880" style="s2">so notice what we&#39;re getting this theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.480" end="00:48:47.760" style="s2">is deeply connecting</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.880" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">consciousness and intelligence together</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.760" end="00:48:53.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s doing it in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">a function strongly associated with</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.040" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">working memory which is relevance</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:48:58.559" style="s2">realization and</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">that is explicitly what bars says the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.559" end="00:49:16.400" style="s2">global workspace is set up to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:19.440" style="s2">greg are you still there</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.400" end="00:49:22.559" style="s2">are you back i did lose you there</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.440" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">that time my screen was fine</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.559" end="00:49:24.720" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">are we allowed to think looks like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:34.559" style="s2">stable how far did how far did you hear</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:35.440" style="s2">uh good question um relevance uh working</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.559" end="00:49:38.640" style="s2">memory</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.440" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">uh chunking into just that</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.640" end="00:49:42.319" style="s2">right yeah it was basically at the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">of chunking right</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.319" end="00:49:46.319" style="s2">so the point i&#39;m making is uh notice</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:48.960" style="s2">what we&#39;ve got in this theory</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.319" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a deep interconnection between</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.960" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:54.960" style="s2">and consciousness via working memory</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:49:57.839" style="s2">right and that&#39;s in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.960" end="00:49:58.800" style="s2">recursive relevance realization going on</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.839" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">at the level</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.800" end="00:50:03.200" style="s2">of working memory its capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">chunking and restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.200" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">right right and then bars and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.839" style="s2">also shanahan and bars have explicitly</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:13.200" style="s2">argued</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.839" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">that that is the function of the global</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.200" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">workspace they specifically</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:18.960" style="s2">argue that the function of the global</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">workspace is to solve the frame problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:25.040" style="s2">which shanahan has argued is</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.559" style="s2">is now it is basically like he</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.040" end="00:50:28.160" style="s2">specifically says this it is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.559" end="00:50:28.960" style="s2">relevance problem it is the deep problem</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.160" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.960" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">and they argue that the function of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:37.680" style="s2">global workspace</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:39.040" style="s2">is in fact to do relevant realization</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.680" end="00:50:40.960" style="s2">now i don&#39;t totally agree with their</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.040" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">solution uh but that&#39;s we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.960" end="00:50:44.160" style="s2">that right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">i just happen to have this on my desk so</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.160" end="00:50:47.760" style="s2">this is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:48.720" style="s2">global neuronal workspace okay so just</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.760" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">for people</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.720" end="00:50:52.960" style="s2">that so that linkage immediately then</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">gets into brain so what he does there</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.960" end="00:50:54.880" style="s2">some of the beautiful stuff that he does</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.880" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">is he he talks about the consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:00.559" style="s2">ignition</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">uh switch okay which is basically so he</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.559" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">does lots of subliminal</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">processing uh so if you give something</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:07.760" style="s2">about 200 milliseconds</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:08.880" style="s2">uh you start to get networking but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.760" end="00:51:10.559" style="s2">do not get</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.880" end="00:51:13.200" style="s2">you know criteria maybe relevance</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.559" end="00:51:15.520" style="s2">realization networks that thing right</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.200" end="00:51:17.359" style="s2">but at 300 milliseconds when you get</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.520" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">enough top down you get ignition switch</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.359" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">between parietal</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">and frontal lobe and that very much that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:24.240" style="s2">cascade</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:26.319" style="s2">very much corresponds to conscious</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.240" end="00:51:27.040" style="s2">access right where you can then say oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.319" end="00:51:29.200" style="s2">this is what</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.040" end="00:51:31.280" style="s2">i now have this on my screen this got</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.200" end="00:51:32.800" style="s2">into uh the stage</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">and and so now you get that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.800" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">lincoln excellent</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.280" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">excellent i&#39;m going to pause here</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">because you&#39;re frozen again greg</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.599" end="00:52:07.760" style="s2">yeah connection seems to be weak i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:10.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s on my end my signal looks</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.760" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">really good</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.160" end="00:52:14.000" style="s2">um i mean yeah maybe it&#39;s getting</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:16.000" style="s2">interference somewhere but i see we seem</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.000" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">to be back</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.000" end="00:52:20.160" style="s2">so the thing you just did i hope we got</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:20.800" style="s2">it all you brought into haiti and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.160" end="00:52:23.119" style="s2">brought in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.800" end="00:52:24.000" style="s2">you know the 200 millisecond 300</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.119" end="00:52:25.599" style="s2">milliseconds</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.000" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">get the consciousness ignition when you</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.599" end="00:52:29.760" style="s2">get the the prefrontal and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:32.160" style="s2">parietal the frontal the parietal</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.760" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">linking up i want to also again go the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.160" end="00:52:34.800" style="s2">other way</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">one of the most prominent theories of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.800" end="00:52:38.319" style="s2">general intelligence is the p</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">fit theory the you know the frontal</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.319" end="00:52:42.000" style="s2">parietal connection</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:43.280" style="s2">is what makes us intelligent uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.000" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">with g so again</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.280" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">the g machinery and the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:49.920" style="s2">machinery like this</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:51.440" style="s2">like this both at the level of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.920" end="00:52:55.119" style="s2">theory relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.440" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">and at the level of the anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.119" end="00:52:57.440" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.280" end="00:53:06.240" style="s2">okay so what we&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.800" end="00:53:09.200" style="s2">i want to just draw this out again</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.240" end="00:53:10.720" style="s2">where we&#39;re showing all the way through</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.200" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">as we&#39;re building intelligence the</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.720" end="00:53:16.000" style="s2">machinery of relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.119" end="00:53:17.280" style="s2">and the machinery of perspective and</p>

<p begin="00:53:17.280" end="00:53:20.400" style="s2">are coming along we&#39;re getting we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:22.319" style="s2">getting the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.400" end="00:53:24.079" style="s2">of consciousness the functionality and</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.319" end="00:53:25.359" style="s2">also some of the phenomenology is</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.079" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">emerging because we&#39;ve spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.359" end="00:53:27.440" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">showing how you can get a lot of the</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.800" end="00:53:33.119" style="s2">the adverbial quality of the</p>

<p begin="00:53:46.480" end="00:53:49.760" style="s2">hmm yeah we seem to be getting some</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.040" end="00:53:51.839" style="s2">intermittent</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.760" end="00:53:53.359" style="s2">interference here they&#39;re dead there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.839" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">definitely right</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.359" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">we&#39;re having trouble mutual modeling</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:54:00.720" style="s2">maintain the connection</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.920" style="s2">well no i think what it is is is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.720" end="00:54:03.040" style="s2">on the actual we&#39;re on the verge of</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.920" end="00:54:05.359" style="s2">solving this problem</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.040" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">right and nobody&#39;s tracking illuminati</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.359" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want us to know</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">don&#39;t have to figure out consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:16.240" style="s2">somebody interrupt the signal quick</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">okay so what i&#39;ll do is uh also because</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.240" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">i have a pretty hard out in about</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:21.760" style="s2">five minutes i want to do one more</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.040" style="s2">theory and then we&#39;ll stop there</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.760" end="00:54:25.440" style="s2">we&#39;re sort of halfway through this</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.040" end="00:54:26.720" style="s2">argument so the next theory a prominent</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.440" end="00:54:27.359" style="s2">theory of consciousness because it</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.720" end="00:54:30.640" style="s2">follows</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.359" end="00:54:30.960" style="s2">directly on this is work not by uh bars</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.640" end="00:54:34.559" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.960" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">bohr and seth and they basically argue</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.559" end="00:54:38.000" style="s2">uh that what what is conscious they do</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.200" end="00:54:40.480" style="s2">this thing about</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.000" end="00:54:42.400" style="s2">what is consciousness for and when do we</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.480" end="00:54:44.559" style="s2">need processes to be conscious</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.400" end="00:54:46.319" style="s2">and when do they move into unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.559" end="00:54:49.359" style="s2">and so they talk about well</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.319" end="00:54:50.160" style="s2">like they talk about the process of how</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.359" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">you make pro</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.160" end="00:54:54.079" style="s2">how you make your behavior automatic</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:56.319" style="s2">what they mean by automatic is</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.079" end="00:54:57.760" style="s2">things you can do without having any</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.319" end="00:55:00.799" style="s2">conscious awareness of it or</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.760" end="00:55:03.119" style="s2">are very minimal subsidiary awareness</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.799" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">like when you&#39;re typing right or you</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.119" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">know it can get very bad like highway</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:08.400" style="s2">hypnotism where you&#39;ve been driving oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">crap and you realize you haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.400" end="00:55:11.200" style="s2">paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:12.960" style="s2">or aware of the road at all you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.200" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">off and mind wandering</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.960" end="00:55:16.720" style="s2">who would have thought it but his army</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:17.119" style="s2">was doing a really good job keeping your</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.720" end="00:55:20.319" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.119" end="00:55:22.559" style="s2">right it&#39;s kept me alive so far john</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:24.480" style="s2">and so they talk about well what the</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.559" end="00:55:25.599" style="s2">evidence seems to converge on is we need</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.480" end="00:55:27.839" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.599" end="00:55:29.359" style="s2">so the opposite what&#39;s the uh so we</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.839" end="00:55:31.920" style="s2">don&#39;t need consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">when we can really proceduralize and</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.920" end="00:55:36.160" style="s2">make</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:38.079" style="s2">our interaction right automatic</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.160" end="00:55:39.440" style="s2">right so what&#39;s the opposite of that</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.079" end="00:55:40.799" style="s2">well we need consciousness where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.440" end="00:55:43.440" style="s2">high complexity</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.799" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">null novelty ill-definedness of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.440" end="00:55:46.160" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:49.200" style="s2">exactly the situations where you need a</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.160" end="00:55:52.000" style="s2">lot of what well relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.200" end="00:55:53.280" style="s2">and what do they say consciousness does</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.000" end="00:55:55.520" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.280" end="00:55:57.599" style="s2">again the fact that these are convergent</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.520" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">like they say the job of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.599" end="00:56:00.319" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:02.640" style="s2">restructuring it is doing that higher</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.319" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">order recursive relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.640" end="00:56:07.359" style="s2">because what that does is it enhances</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">your ability to sift through the data</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.359" end="00:56:11.040" style="s2">find the patterns do the deep learning</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:12.480" style="s2">so again</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.040" end="00:56:14.319" style="s2">what are they saying consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.480" end="00:56:16.160" style="s2">functions to do it&#39;s higher order</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.319" end="00:56:17.760" style="s2">recursive relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.160" end="00:56:19.200" style="s2">that allows us to do sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.760" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">problem solving makes us more</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.200" end="00:56:21.920" style="s2">intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">it&#39;s what areas of the brain oh look</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.920" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly frontal but it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">all this like convergence convergence</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:30.480" style="s2">total</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:31.040" style="s2">urgence convergence so i&#39;ll just to put</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.480" end="00:56:34.160" style="s2">this in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.040" end="00:56:36.640" style="s2">in real-world stuff so uh in my kitchen</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.160" end="00:56:38.079" style="s2">we had the silverware i don&#39;t think i</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.640" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">told the story of silverware</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.079" end="00:56:41.280" style="s2">uh in one drawer then we got a new</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:42.640" style="s2">dishwasher</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.280" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">and then it had a handle on it so we</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.640" end="00:56:45.359" style="s2">couldn&#39;t open that damn drawer anymore</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">so we had to move the silverware</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.359" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">took me like six months that you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">actually to uh because i&#39;d so</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:53.520" style="s2">procedurally habituated to go over to</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:55.520" style="s2">the silverware drawer</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.520" end="00:56:56.559" style="s2">was downloaded i knew you know my system</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.520" end="00:56:58.160" style="s2">knew how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.559" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">but then every time i&#39;d open the drawer</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.160" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">i&#39;d be like right i was like</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:03.440" style="s2">what are you gonna learn and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:05.599" style="s2">because the surprise</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.440" end="00:57:07.359" style="s2">of seeing the drawer empty you know and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.599" end="00:57:08.880" style="s2">then i had to rework it and now</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.359" end="00:57:10.960" style="s2">you know three years later i never go to</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.880" end="00:57:11.280" style="s2">that drawer anymore so uh that gives you</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.960" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:15.599" style="s2">frame about how that you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">next one and notice how</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.599" end="00:57:20.160" style="s2">more and seth feed back into clearman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">right and the whole developmental thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.160" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">you have to you have to re-learn to find</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:27.920" style="s2">it conscious</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:30.319" style="s2">right and so you can see the boring</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:33.599" style="s2">stuff also being very very</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.319" end="00:57:35.359" style="s2">um well consistent and coherent with</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.599" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">uh the clear means of the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:37.680" style="s2">and then that&#39;s also consistent as we</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:39.920" style="s2">said with this</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:41.839" style="s2">recursive relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.920" end="00:57:43.920" style="s2">massively hierarchical dynamically</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.839" end="00:57:46.240" style="s2">self-organizing predictive processing</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.920" end="00:57:47.040" style="s2">the anticipatory relationship and notice</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.240" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">we are getting</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.040" end="00:57:51.040" style="s2">so so much of the function of</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:54.400" style="s2">consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.040" end="00:57:56.720" style="s2">at least is converging on</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.400" end="00:57:57.760" style="s2">the idea of consciousness as relevance</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.720" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">realization</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.760" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">within predictive processing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:04.559" style="s2">notice how we aren&#39;t trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:06.559" style="s2">consciousness all we&#39;re trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.559" end="00:58:08.400" style="s2">make artificial general intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.559" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">but we keep building all the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.400" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">the functionality of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:14.640" style="s2">and we keep tapping into the same areas</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:17.359" style="s2">of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.640" end="00:58:18.319" style="s2">that are deeply associated with</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.359" end="00:58:21.520" style="s2">intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.319" end="00:58:23.040" style="s2">and behavioral flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.520" end="00:58:24.480" style="s2">and i have the intelligence to learn for</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.040" end="00:58:26.559" style="s2">our silverware drawers after three</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.480" end="00:58:28.720" style="s2">months</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.559" end="00:58:30.480" style="s2">and so i so i am conscious at some level</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.720" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">john that&#39;s good news</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.480" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">i&#39;m sure you are so what i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:35.680" style="s2">we&#39;ve covered off some of the main</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">theories</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.680" end="00:58:38.720" style="s2">next time i want to take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">last remaining</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.720" end="00:58:42.640" style="s2">uh theory and draw them all together</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:43.119" style="s2">which is finoni&#39;s integrated information</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.640" end="00:58:44.960" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.119" end="00:58:46.559" style="s2">i won&#39;t go into great detail i want to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.960" end="00:58:48.400" style="s2">mention a few ideas</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.559" end="00:58:50.240" style="s2">uh from the information closure theory</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.400" end="00:58:52.400" style="s2">but i think they gel very well</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.240" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">also with the model we&#39;re building here</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.400" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">um and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:57.359" style="s2">we will have done the canvassing and</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:59:00.160" style="s2">what the overall</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.359" end="00:59:00.640" style="s2">overall art art of this argument has</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.160" end="00:59:03.359" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.640" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">and you&#39;ve been helpful is it&#39;s how how</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.359" end="00:59:06.799" style="s2">we can draw</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:08.079" style="s2">all these things together in such a</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.799" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">coherent fashion</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.079" end="00:59:10.960" style="s2">and it&#39;s a completely naturalistic</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:12.160" style="s2">argument because we&#39;re doing it from the</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.960" end="00:59:14.160" style="s2">design stance</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.160" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">every step along the way this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.160" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">would add to the machine this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">would add to the machine this is what we</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">react to the machine</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">i want to now just take a moment and say</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:24.480" style="s2">one sort of final thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">that sort of helps also to bridge a bit</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.480" end="00:59:27.760" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:29.920" style="s2">the function and the phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.760" end="00:59:33.440" style="s2">because i would argue</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.920" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">that salience is relevant to the global</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.440" end="00:59:36.079" style="s2">workspace</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">they have all this relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.079" end="00:59:40.480" style="s2">going on but when</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">information is relevant to the global</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.480" end="00:59:42.960" style="s2">workspace</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:44.480" style="s2">such that it does the working memory</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.960" end="00:59:45.520" style="s2">processing it looks for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.480" end="00:59:48.640" style="s2">restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.520" end="00:59:51.680" style="s2">or it&#39;s potential it is a protect it it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.640" end="00:59:53.520" style="s2">potentially demands restructuring</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.680" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">within the global workspace i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.520" end="00:59:58.319" style="s2">that&#39;s when we&#39;re now talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="01:00:00.960" style="s2">salience and once we have that we now</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.319" end="01:00:03.119" style="s2">have the possibility like a</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.960" end="01:00:06.079" style="s2">demonstrative indexicalities salience</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.119" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">tangling all that stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.079" end="01:00:10.960" style="s2">now coming online that&#39;s a lot of pieces</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">it&#39;s coming together it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.960" end="01:00:17.040" style="s2">pieces coming together</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a bit more to go and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.040" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">um we will have sort of made</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll have some time to draw it</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:24.400" style="s2">all together then there&#39;s you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">to take over</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.400" end="01:00:27.119" style="s2">and you&#39;re going to make an important</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">argument again you&#39;re going to what did</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.119" end="01:00:31.520" style="s2">you say thirty thousand feet</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:32.079" style="s2">about thirty thousand feet then um and</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.520" end="01:00:34.079" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.079" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">and draw it all together again and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.079" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">we&#39;ll probably have one or two</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.880" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">around uh the relationship between this</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:44.000" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">and the heart problems of of meeting</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.000" end="01:00:49.119" style="s2">um the meaning crisis and and then and</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">then the relationship between that</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.119" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">problem and what you call the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:54.799" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:56.799" style="s2">we can come back to that trial and see</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.799" end="01:00:59.040" style="s2">what progress we made on it</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.799" end="01:01:00.160" style="s2">right so that that&#39;s our work for today</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.040" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s our work for today</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.160" end="01:01:03.440" style="s2">i i apologize for anybody watching it</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.440" end="01:01:09.280" style="s2">any of the little</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">pauses in the in the signal but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.280" end="01:01:12.319" style="s2">technology&#39;s the god of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:13.680" style="s2">that limps and of course our high god</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.319" end="01:01:16.079" style="s2">right now is the internet</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.680" end="01:01:17.119" style="s2">and high gods always um disappoint you</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.079" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">when you most need them</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.119" end="01:01:19.760" style="s2">so there you go</p>
