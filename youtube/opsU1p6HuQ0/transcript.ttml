<p begin="00:00:03.120" end="00:00:06.560" style="s2">my video from yesterday and it reminded</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.600" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">me of this video</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.560" end="00:00:09.599" style="s2">that i&#39;ve been meaning to make for a</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:11.759" style="s2">while which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.599" end="00:00:13.840" style="s2">the division that is on the left that</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.759" end="00:00:16.160" style="s2">does not exist on the right</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.840" end="00:00:17.520" style="s2">by the very definition of how we split</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.160" end="00:00:21.199" style="s2">the left and the right</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.520" end="00:00:24.480" style="s2">the right is generally thought of as</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.199" end="00:00:25.359" style="s2">a entity that wants things to remain the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.480" end="00:00:28.400" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.359" end="00:00:29.840" style="s2">or go back to the good old days they</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.400" end="00:00:31.119" style="s2">might not agree on when those good old</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.840" end="00:00:33.200" style="s2">days existed</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.119" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">so how far back we need to go but they</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.200" end="00:00:37.760" style="s2">want to go back</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.440" end="00:00:39.120" style="s2">there is one linear process to go back</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.760" end="00:00:41.600" style="s2">on even if we</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.120" end="00:00:43.520" style="s2">its history is a very gray area and we</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.600" end="00:00:45.760" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know we think we know</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.520" end="00:00:47.440" style="s2">so we&#39;ll go back to that time period or</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.760" end="00:00:50.079" style="s2">we will remain the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.440" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to keep society the same but</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.079" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to envision it staying the</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:54.719" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:56.239" style="s2">and as things change and you get used to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.719" end="00:00:59.920" style="s2">them they become</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.239" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">the current version of now and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.920" end="00:01:04.080" style="s2">what you&#39;re fighting to keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:05.199" style="s2">so as things change the right&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.080" end="00:01:07.280" style="s2">with the change</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.199" end="00:01:08.799" style="s2">stereotypically but once it happens we</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.280" end="00:01:10.240" style="s2">all get acclimatized to it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.799" end="00:01:12.640" style="s2">and then they want that to remain the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.240" end="00:01:14.560" style="s2">same the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.640" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">by the by definition because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.560" end="00:01:18.000" style="s2">just divided</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:19.600" style="s2">remain the same different there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.000" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">infinite ways to make our current</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.600" end="00:01:22.479" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:24.240" style="s2">different than it currently is going</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.479" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">backwards is a linear process going</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.240" end="00:01:29.280" style="s2">forwards is like all of the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">tendrils reaching out into infinite</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.280" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">infinity</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.200" end="00:01:34.560" style="s2">so you know even if you we could agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">that we want</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.560" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">universal healthcare what does universal</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.720" end="00:01:39.600" style="s2">healthcare look like</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:41.520" style="s2">because we don&#39;t currently have it in</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.600" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">the united states we have it in canada</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.520" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">we know what it looks like we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">it to go to what states is we would like</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:48.240" style="s2">it even more universal</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">um on the left on the right they want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.240" end="00:01:51.280" style="s2">go for it towards the states look at</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:54.399" style="s2">that beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.280" end="00:01:57.439" style="s2">beautiful option that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.399" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">the very tools that are used on the left</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.439" end="00:02:02.799" style="s2">don&#39;t work on the right the right can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:04.479" style="s2">be cancelled</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.799" end="00:02:05.840" style="s2">it can only kind of be cancelled with</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.479" end="00:02:08.800" style="s2">actual truth</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.840" end="00:02:10.000" style="s2">um and so people actually owning their</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.800" end="00:02:11.520" style="s2">own self and being like</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.000" end="00:02:13.040" style="s2">actually even though i was anti-gay my</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.520" end="00:02:14.879" style="s2">whole life i am now gay</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.040" end="00:02:17.120" style="s2">you can be canceled on the right but if</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.879" end="00:02:18.640" style="s2">you&#39;re anti-gay pro-family values your</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.120" end="00:02:20.959" style="s2">entire life and then are</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.640" end="00:02:22.879" style="s2">as a male politician and that are found</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.959" end="00:02:24.879" style="s2">with a male prostitute</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.879" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">you&#39;re good if you can apologize and say</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.879" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">that was a that was a problematic moment</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:30.160" style="s2">despite the fact you cheated on your</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">wife despite the fact it was with</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.160" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">another man despite the fact it was the</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">man you paid for</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:37.120" style="s2">that was illegal all of that&#39;s cool okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">and okay as long as you apologize</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.120" end="00:02:40.959" style="s2">the left has the opposite where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:42.560" style="s2">like one bad thing you said from three</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.959" end="00:02:44.560" style="s2">decades ago we&#39;re gonna dig that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.560" end="00:02:45.760" style="s2">puppy up and you&#39;re gonna be canceled</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.560" end="00:02:48.879" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.760" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">so the left is cannibalizing itself</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.879" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">and the left also like we cancel and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">we cancel differently the right buys</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">your and burns it which helps you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:01.200" style="s2">the left shows up at your speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:04.000" style="s2">engagements</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.200" end="00:03:05.760" style="s2">yelling speaking louder than you which</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.000" end="00:03:07.599" style="s2">just brings more attention and the best</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.760" end="00:03:09.519" style="s2">publicity that they can find so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.599" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">right runners can find those people</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.519" end="00:03:13.760" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh if the left isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:16.159" style="s2">protesting you we don&#39;t even want you</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.760" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">so i have less than two minutes left to</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.159" end="00:03:20.319" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">what i think is the road forward</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.319" end="00:03:26.319" style="s2">and it is that we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">disagree on why our current world is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.319" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">we just agree that it is broken because</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">to everyone whether you want it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:34.080" style="s2">remain the same</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:36.319" style="s2">or whether you want a beautiful future</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.319" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">the agreement that it is broken knowing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.400" end="00:03:40.159" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to agree on why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:42.159" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.159" end="00:03:43.599" style="s2">we can all have a beautiful future we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.159" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">are living into</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.599" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">your beautiful future can even include</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">one that completely counteracts fine</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:51.840" style="s2">only men and women are gonna get married</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">well how we&#39;re moving forward your</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.840" end="00:03:54.159" style="s2">vision of the future is never gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">seen</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.159" end="00:03:57.920" style="s2">um neither is my little gay queer utopia</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">probably so</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.920" end="00:04:01.120" style="s2">so you&#39;re good on my i&#39;m not having to</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:02.959" style="s2">live my future and i&#39;m good i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.120" end="00:04:04.480" style="s2">not having to live your future we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.959" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">disagree on what&#39;s broken in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.480" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">present we can disagree on our beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">utopian versions of the future</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:12.799" style="s2">all we have to do is agree on one step</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:14.319" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.799" end="00:04:15.680" style="s2">ten thousand people can get together and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.319" end="00:04:17.680" style="s2">figure out how they live their little</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.680" end="00:04:18.799" style="s2">heterosexual utopian life</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.680" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">and get to live that a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.799" end="00:04:21.759" style="s2">incrementally forward cool it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:22.720" style="s2">going to expand to the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.759" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">it&#39;s just not because it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.720" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">backwards</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:27.199" style="s2">um my little queertopia also probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">won&#39;t expand the whole world because the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.199" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">entire world&#39;s not queer</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">but having options you can have both of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">those things simultaneously because</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:37.840" style="s2">nobody with 10 000 people</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:39.280" style="s2">has the power to inflict that on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.840" end="00:04:40.720" style="s2">rest of the population just because they</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.280" end="00:04:42.320" style="s2">think it&#39;s a better way</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.720" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to agree on what&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.320" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">we don&#39;t have to agree with the full</p>
