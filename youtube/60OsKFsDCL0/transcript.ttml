<p begin="00:00:10.230" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">it seems to be to the tech world both</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.599" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">open-source and blockchain are very</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:20.640" style="s2">powerful tools I am behind I love them I</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:23.279" style="s2">also don&#39;t think in and of themselves</p>

<p begin="00:00:28.170" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">already like technology or seeking it</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.060" end="00:00:36.180" style="s2">out or trying to find the new innovative</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s not the masses it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:42.780" style="s2">masses it&#39;s already a barrier to entry</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:44.760" style="s2">to say you need to be this technological</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.780" end="00:00:47.309" style="s2">elite right to use open source that</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.760" end="00:00:49.950" style="s2">someone else has made to use WordPress</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.309" end="00:00:51.600" style="s2">this is it&#39;s user friendly enough but if</p>

<p begin="00:00:51.600" end="00:00:54.930" style="s2">much more to use WordPress than if</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.579" end="00:00:56.760" style="s2">you&#39;re someone who understands or like</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.930" end="00:01:00.660" style="s2">truly can get the office of open source</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.760" end="00:01:03.090" style="s2">benefits because you can code blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.660" end="00:01:04.680" style="s2">is similar in that the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.090" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">people keep pointing me towards whole</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.680" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">chain whole a chain and colony do seem</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:16.409" style="s2">to be blockchain solutions which because</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:18.360" style="s2">they have that as their sticking point</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:20.430" style="s2">that means that if you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.360" end="00:01:21.900" style="s2">solve a problem you first need to run it</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.430" end="00:01:24.420" style="s2">through blockchain as opposed to asking</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.900" end="00:01:27.630" style="s2">what&#39;s the best solution for this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.420" end="00:01:30.030" style="s2">the best switching for us as users and</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.630" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">how do we create that together that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.030" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">very different question than like it has</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:36.299" style="s2">to be blocked Jane if your only tool is</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">a Hammer Every Problem looks like a nail</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.299" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">and so needing it to first be blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:42.960" style="s2">is first you have to make every problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.950" end="00:01:44.880" style="s2">a nail and then we&#39;re allowed to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.960" end="00:01:46.710" style="s2">working on it as opposed to like no is</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.880" end="00:01:48.420" style="s2">it a nail is it a screw is it not any of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.710" end="00:01:50.640" style="s2">those things at all is it you know a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.420" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">bracket like we need a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.640" end="00:01:54.600" style="s2">strategy and if anyone can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:56.340" style="s2">that strategy if anyone can come be part</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.600" end="00:01:57.810" style="s2">of a conversation as to what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.340" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">working for them in their current life</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.810" end="00:02:01.259" style="s2">in the current world what don&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:03.659" style="s2">understand and how can we make it more</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.259" end="00:02:07.409" style="s2">clear what isn&#39;t easy and how can we</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.659" end="00:02:09.270" style="s2">make it more simple for them to do what</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.409" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">we are doing together is starting with</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.270" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">something and improving it I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:14.610" style="s2">improve holo chains</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:15.900" style="s2">because I don&#39;t own them I don&#39;t know in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.610" end="00:02:17.700" style="s2">the individual pieces I don&#39;t own the</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.900" end="00:02:20.190" style="s2">whole I don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.700" end="00:02:22.950" style="s2">and so the complicatedness of blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.190" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">itself that people don&#39;t understand it I</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.950" end="00:02:27.720" style="s2">understand it more than 90% of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.400" style="s2">average people out there I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.720" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">understand as much as the people working</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.400" end="00:02:33.210" style="s2">on blockchain I understand of YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">videos on it I&#39;m like every time like</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.210" end="00:02:37.800" style="s2">okay I think I got it it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:40.380" style="s2">no one&#39;s going to adopt a complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.800" end="00:02:41.820" style="s2">system they don&#39;t understand over one</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.380" end="00:02:44.190" style="s2">that&#39;s for profit when they don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.820" end="00:02:45.600" style="s2">the trust and they don&#39;t see the reason</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.190" end="00:02:47.820" style="s2">why you should trust this and on this</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:50.220" style="s2">because there&#39;s no ledger and it&#39;s sent</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.820" end="00:02:51.660" style="s2">well I don&#39;t cuz I own my own data that</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.220" end="00:02:52.890" style="s2">they can get then it&#39;s like but how do I</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.660" end="00:02:54.810" style="s2">trust you how do I know you&#39;re gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.890" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">here in six months I don&#39;t care about my</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.810" end="00:03:01.620" style="s2">dad if I don&#39;t get to keep it</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:03:03.240" style="s2">um there is maybe not as deeply as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.620" end="00:03:05.610" style="s2">want to be able to have access to it</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.240" end="00:03:08.630" style="s2">even if you go down right and blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.610" end="00:03:10.800" style="s2">can solve that but it can&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.630" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">convey that it solves it to the masses</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.800" end="00:03:13.710" style="s2">it&#39;s until the mass is already on board</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:15.270" style="s2">right oh it&#39;s so worried it&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.710" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">cloud the next project we only use your</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.270" end="00:03:18.720" style="s2">data wait it&#39;s the cloud thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">decentralized who&#39;s on your cloud</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.720" end="00:03:25.739" style="s2">whatever whatever it&#39;s on blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:27.570" style="s2">technology that we don&#39;t own together</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.739" end="00:03:30.140" style="s2">because it&#39;s literally like the point is</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.570" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">that the developer owns it and or like</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.140" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">how do we make money on it that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:35.610" style="s2">of we&#39;re not even part of that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:37.320" style="s2">discussion you get to state</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.610" end="00:03:39.060" style="s2">hello chain and colony you get to state</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.320" end="00:03:40.890" style="s2">how people make money on it and there</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.060" end="00:03:43.260" style="s2">might be a way to work on that together</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.890" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">but it&#39;s not designing together from the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.260" end="00:03:46.830" style="s2">ground up</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:48.360" style="s2">it can&#39;t be improved by us as easily as</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.830" end="00:03:49.680" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about we&#39;re literally</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.360" end="00:03:51.330" style="s2">starting with something and looking for</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.680" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">constantly how do we improve it to meet</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.330" end="00:03:55.709" style="s2">your needs it&#39;s not more powerful than</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">what we currently have on Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.709" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">Google so it&#39;s gonna be really hard to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:01.590" style="s2">out-compete Facebook and Google with</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:03.660" style="s2">their money and their power and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.590" end="00:04:05.130" style="s2">less risky developers still have to come</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.660" end="00:04:07.350" style="s2">on board put their time put their money</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.130" end="00:04:09.420" style="s2">into developing something and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.350" end="00:04:10.980" style="s2">unicorn in a Quincy a millions of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.420" end="00:04:12.390" style="s2">dollars or its crap and then we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.980" end="00:04:16.739" style="s2">trust the next one that comes on board</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.390" end="00:04:18.750" style="s2">so that&#39;s where I having a system</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.739" end="00:04:21.209" style="s2">whatever that system is to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.750" end="00:04:23.340" style="s2">come together and create solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.209" end="00:04:26.370" style="s2">together starting with technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.340" end="00:04:28.440" style="s2">because it is the most efficient it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.370" end="00:04:29.970" style="s2">how we get solutions to the most amount</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.440" end="00:04:33.120" style="s2">of people for the least amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.970" end="00:04:34.410" style="s2">and when you improve it it&#39;s everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.120" end="00:04:36.300" style="s2">you haven&#39;t improved you have a table</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.410" end="00:04:37.830" style="s2">and you improve it and everyone&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.300" end="00:04:39.479" style="s2">get a new table to improve it or get</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.830" end="00:04:42.570" style="s2">that new leg that got improved whatever</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.479" end="00:04:43.800" style="s2">it is with technology we can design it</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.570" end="00:04:45.990" style="s2">so that no you just get it in your new</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.800" end="00:04:47.790" style="s2">near next download probably came in to</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.990" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">sign actual hardware so that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.790" end="00:04:52.530" style="s2">interesting whatever swappable and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:57.479" style="s2">cradle-to-grave technology we&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.530" end="00:05:00.570" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at the needs of production</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.479" end="00:05:03.449" style="s2">and make it more efficient but able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.570" end="00:05:05.669" style="s2">have the tools to come together anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.449" end="00:05:07.710" style="s2">anywhere who wants to is able to come</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.669" end="00:05:10.949" style="s2">and say what&#39;s not working for them and</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.710" end="00:05:13.740" style="s2">work with a small group the large group</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.949" end="00:05:15.930" style="s2">themselves to form a solution that works</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.740" end="00:05:17.490" style="s2">for them and empowered that whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.930" end="00:05:19.680" style="s2">solution comes through there we already</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.490" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">own it together we already want it to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.680" end="00:05:22.590" style="s2">succeed and so we&#39;re gonna market it</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:24.570" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna fund it we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.590" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">problem-solve in a whole new way that we</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.570" end="00:05:29.070" style="s2">have ownership over it then when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.580" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">somebody else&#39;s project and all of the</p>

<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:36.810" style="s2">project and until we come up with a way</p>
