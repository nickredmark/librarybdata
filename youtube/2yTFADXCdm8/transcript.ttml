<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">or on continuum the into those two</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.360" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">poles interpenetrate mutually afford</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">mutually affect</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:45.440" style="s2">each other in powerful ways and so this</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:47.760" style="s2">is the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.440" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">excuse me cognition is not here</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.760" end="00:21:52.960" style="s2">monological</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s dialogical and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.960" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">of course untutored uh dialogue is</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.760" end="00:22:00.720" style="s2">better than no dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:02.640" style="s2">at all and we do so we do are in</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.720" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">constant dialogue with ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.640" end="00:22:06.080" style="s2">and again untutored is better than not</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:06.880" style="s2">having it at all because it gives us</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.080" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">powers</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.880" end="00:22:10.799" style="s2">of reflection and self-direction etc but</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:14.000" style="s2">we noted</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:16.159" style="s2">that um without the untutored uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.000" end="00:22:17.039" style="s2">dialogue you have problem of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.159" end="00:22:20.159" style="s2">bias</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.039" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">um and you have the problem of uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.159" end="00:22:23.919" style="s2">illumination things like that we talked</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.919" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">so that inner dialogue can generate bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">judgment</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">and judgment is a crucial idea uh for</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.960" style="s2">for uh the line coming out of intestines</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:37.360" style="s2">so we took a look at the cynics</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.960" end="00:22:39.919" style="s2">and we took a look at their diagnosis of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.360" end="00:22:41.679" style="s2">what was the nature of the bat judgment</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:44.480" style="s2">and their diagnosis was</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.679" end="00:22:46.640" style="s2">that we set our heart on the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.480" end="00:22:49.280" style="s2">we set our heart on the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.640" end="00:22:51.440" style="s2">um this relates to carol dweck&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.280" end="00:22:53.360" style="s2">recent work on mindset</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.440" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">if you want to take a look at that and</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.360" end="00:22:56.159" style="s2">we noted that this isn&#39;t a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">just believing</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.159" end="00:23:00.000" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know that the original meaning</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">of belief believing was to set your</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.000" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">heart</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">for something to be beloved to you and</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">so for the cynics</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">the cause of our problem is we set our</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">hearts and what is created by social</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:12.640" style="s2">convention</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">social construction rather than what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.640" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">natural or due to the natural or moral</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:20.000" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">so what did they practice they practice</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.000" end="00:23:22.799" style="s2">obviously social renunciation they</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:24.559" style="s2">rejected</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.799" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">the society that was the generator</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:28.720" style="s2">social convention social construction</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.400" style="s2">and they engaged in provocation to try</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.720" end="00:23:32.000" style="s2">and wake people up to</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.400" end="00:23:34.480" style="s2">that what they should set their hearts</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.000" end="00:23:36.320" style="s2">on are the patterns generated by natural</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.480" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">and moral law and we talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.320" end="00:23:40.000" style="s2">sort of existential reframing</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">we did the example of diogenes with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.000" end="00:23:45.679" style="s2">lamp etcetera</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">now the cynics are deeply influential on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.679" end="00:23:48.880" style="s2">the stoics but the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.279" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">basically came to the conclusion to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.880" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">summarize it they don&#39;t actually say</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:56.240" style="s2">this explicitly in any one place</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:58.640" style="s2">so i&#39;m summarizing it on their behalf</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.240" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">the the cynics paid too much attention</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.640" end="00:24:01.679" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:03.120" style="s2">object of judgment rather than to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.679" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">process of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.120" end="00:24:06.159" style="s2">and so the stoic zero in on the process</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.159" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">the process of judgment is and we talked</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:11.679" style="s2">about this before</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.919" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">when we did the meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.679" end="00:24:14.480" style="s2">contemplation course</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:16.240" style="s2">the process of judgment that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.480" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">talking about is the process</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.240" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">of co-identification it&#39;s existential</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:21.840" style="s2">mode</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">participation it&#39;s being in the having</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.840" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">mode being in the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:27.200" style="s2">uh the eye the it the eye though that</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.200" end="00:24:31.120" style="s2">and then we talked about an idea that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:33.039" style="s2">prom actually drew from the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.120" end="00:24:34.720" style="s2">and we talked about it before especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.039" end="00:24:37.039" style="s2">with relationship to contemplative</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.720" end="00:24:38.240" style="s2">practices like meta</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.039" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">it&#39;s going to be a vital event to a</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.240" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">contemplative practice we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:43.440" style="s2">together today the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">and this was the story for addressing</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.440" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">modal confusion</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">uh the confusion of the having mode and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">the b node mode</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:52.880" style="s2">specifically the attempt to satisfy</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">being needs</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.880" end="00:24:57.760" style="s2">within the having mode the starts go</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">very deep into this</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.760" end="00:25:02.080" style="s2">into discerning discerning that this the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:04.640" style="s2">discipline of discernment right</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.080" end="00:25:05.679" style="s2">discerning the modal confusion by</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.640" end="00:25:08.799" style="s2">practicing</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.679" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">reflecting continuously</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.799" end="00:25:13.520" style="s2">and in awareness not just in thought but</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:16.400" style="s2">you know where it&#39;s reflecting on</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">what is in your control and this is one</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.400" end="00:25:19.039" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:22.159" style="s2">one of the three great stoics that you</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.039" end="00:25:24.960" style="s2">need to read to practice stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.159" end="00:25:26.000" style="s2">epic fetus on his encuradon the manual</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.960" end="00:25:27.760" style="s2">for living</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.000" end="00:25:29.039" style="s2">the books i recommend is get the manual</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.760" end="00:25:31.520" style="s2">for living</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.039" end="00:25:32.799" style="s2">by epictetus at the meditations by</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.520" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">marcus aurelius</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:37.679" style="s2">and get the letters uh from the stoic uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:41.279" style="s2">by seneca</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.679" end="00:25:42.159" style="s2">so uh what do what does epictetus point</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.279" end="00:25:45.200" style="s2">out that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.159" end="00:25:46.320" style="s2">we are very confused about how much</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.200" end="00:25:48.799" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.320" end="00:25:49.760" style="s2">uh we exercise they point out that we</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.799" end="00:25:52.799" style="s2">have far</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.760" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">less control over the world than we</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.799" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">pretend</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:56.960" style="s2">there&#39;s a deep pretentiousness they want</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:25:58.720" style="s2">to challenge</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.960" end="00:26:00.080" style="s2">uh the two things they point out are</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.720" end="00:26:01.360" style="s2">what&#39;s called the proliferation of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.080" end="00:26:03.600" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.360" end="00:26:05.840" style="s2">that when i try to do good even when i</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.600" end="00:26:08.880" style="s2">completely honestly intend to do good</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.840" end="00:26:12.159" style="s2">uh there are all kinds of ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.880" end="00:26:15.039" style="s2">are the consequences open up um in ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.159" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">the side effects unanticipated by me um</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.039" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:21.840" style="s2">that can be very overwhelming the other</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:25.279" style="s2">is the fatality of all things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.840" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">the universe is 99.9 percent not</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.279" end="00:26:29.760" style="s2">hospitable to human beings it runs</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:32.400" style="s2">largely of its own accord</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.760" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">and that 90 so there&#39;s about a 99.9</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">percent of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:38.720" style="s2">it does not care about your narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">it does not and so um things are going</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.720" end="00:26:42.559" style="s2">to happen outside of our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">identity and our narrative</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.559" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">and the idea is that the proliferation</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">of consequences</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:49.679" style="s2">and the fatality of all things uh cause</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.000" style="s2">us fear</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.679" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">causes frustration tells us deep</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.000" end="00:26:54.799" style="s2">disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">so notice how the stoics have picked up</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.799" end="00:26:57.919" style="s2">from the cynics the idea that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">deeply disappointed because we set our</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.919" end="00:27:01.840" style="s2">hearts</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:03.200" style="s2">and right on the wrong things the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.840" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">say no but it&#39;s more that we set our</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.200" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">hearts in the wrong way</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.000" end="00:27:19.760" style="s2">not better sorry</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.520" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">i hope that were people still able to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.760" end="00:27:22.799" style="s2">hear yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">okay good so i don&#39;t have to repeat i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.799" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">sorry about that i didn&#39;t realize those</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:27.919" style="s2">i was brushing up against the mic</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:35.200" style="s2">very often uh so they&#39;ve picked up</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.600" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">uh from the cynics the idea of deep fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.200" end="00:27:39.520" style="s2">and frustration of disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:41.120" style="s2">uh because of heart setting um but</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.520" end="00:27:43.279" style="s2">unlike the cynics they don&#39;t put so</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.120" end="00:27:44.240" style="s2">as much emphasis they talk a bit about</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.279" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">the importance of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.240" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">object that you set a heart on but</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:51.039" style="s2">they&#39;re much more about how</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:53.039" style="s2">we are doing this and so they recommend</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.039" end="00:27:56.000" style="s2">that we pay attention to what is</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.039" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">actually in our control what is most in</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.000" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2">our control</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:00.320" style="s2">the stoics tend to talk about this as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">dichotomy i see it more</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.320" end="00:28:04.399" style="s2">as a continuum with one pole what is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.039" end="00:28:05.840" style="s2">most under control i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.399" end="00:28:06.880" style="s2">even completely in our control the way</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.840" end="00:28:08.480" style="s2">they sometimes claim</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.880" end="00:28:10.159" style="s2">but what is most in control is our</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">judgment and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.159" end="00:28:14.159" style="s2">right there are things right and then as</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">we move towards that aspect of the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.159" end="00:28:17.919" style="s2">that&#39;s completely beyond our control</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:19.600" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this sliding continuum</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.919" end="00:28:21.360" style="s2">but the idea is what is most in our</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.600" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">control is our judgment</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.360" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">judgment here again doesn&#39;t mean the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">right the um</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">just this making of statements it has</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:32.799" style="s2">much more to do with what we find</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:34.600" style="s2">relevant what we find salient how we</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.799" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">identify things how we do the</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.600" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">co-identification process how we set up</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:41.840" style="s2">that agent arena co-identification</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:45.039" style="s2">co-determination process</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.840" end="00:28:46.799" style="s2">and so the stoics talked about prososh</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.039" end="00:28:49.520" style="s2">which is very similar to buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.799" end="00:28:51.440" style="s2">notions of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.520" end="00:28:53.679" style="s2">this is paying attention to how you pay</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.440" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">attention because attention</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.679" end="00:28:57.360" style="s2">is where you&#39;re setting your heart on</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:59.840" style="s2">things in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.360" end="00:29:00.720" style="s2">how you are finding things relevant</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.840" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">salient</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.720" end="00:29:04.320" style="s2">how you&#39;re identifying them one way in</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:06.399" style="s2">which you right in which</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.320" end="00:29:07.679" style="s2">the stories are really zeroing in on one</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.399" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">way you identify</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.679" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">things and one and thereby make them</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">salient and relevant to you is</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:16.720" style="s2">your judgment about how much they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">under your control</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.720" end="00:29:22.880" style="s2">how much they are under your control</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">and the idea here is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.880" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">people need to realize</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">that they are deeply confused they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:32.640" style="s2">deeply confused</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:34.480" style="s2">because the judgments of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.640" end="00:29:35.840" style="s2">again not in the sense of a sentence but</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.480" end="00:29:37.679" style="s2">in terms of the relevance</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.840" end="00:29:38.960" style="s2">the salience and the identity the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">meaning of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.960" end="00:29:45.440" style="s2">is fused with the fact of the thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">and people confuse confuse</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.440" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">that because the meaning of a thing is</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:51.919" style="s2">largely</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:52.840" style="s2">uh something that&#39;s under their control</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.919" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">that they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:56.799" style="s2">control the thing but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:59.919" style="s2">distinguish the two</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.799" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">okay they misjudge that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.919" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">greater control</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">over things than they actually do</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:08.240" style="s2">now that that was only the things the</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:11.440" style="s2">stoics say that would be ah</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.240" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">but what they say is right if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.440" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:15.919" style="s2">pull them apart if you don&#39;t have them</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">any longer confused</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.919" end="00:30:19.520" style="s2">what you realize is you have much</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:21.520" style="s2">greater control</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.520" end="00:30:22.880" style="s2">over the meaning of things than you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.520" end="00:30:26.159" style="s2">previously realized</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.880" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">and most of your frustration</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.159" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">not all but most of your frustration</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:34.080" style="s2">fear and disappointment has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:35.679" style="s2">the meaning of events</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.080" end="00:30:37.200" style="s2">rather than the events themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.679" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">this is a central tenet</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.200" end="00:30:40.640" style="s2">of what&#39;s known as cognitive behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:42.720" style="s2">therapy one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.640" end="00:30:43.840" style="s2">most evidence-based therapies we have</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.840" end="00:30:48.000" style="s2">and what the stoics are trying to do is</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">get us into a state</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.000" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">where by exercising good judgment</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:55.520" style="s2">about the meaning of things we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:57.200" style="s2">afford reciprocal opening we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.520" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">remember the being mode</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.200" end="00:31:00.799" style="s2">we can afford reciprocal opening with</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">things and we can get</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.799" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">into what they call flowing with nature</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">the state of joy</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">joy is the most important emotion</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:12.880" style="s2">for stoicism and contrary to what people</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:15.919" style="s2">think stoicism is not about</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.880" end="00:31:19.360" style="s2">being dour and stiff upper lip just</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.919" end="00:31:21.840" style="s2">going on right the point about stoicism</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.360" end="00:31:23.279" style="s2">is to flow with nature and to experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.840" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">as much joy as possible</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.279" end="00:31:26.720" style="s2">joy is not the same thing as pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">there is that sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.720" end="00:31:32.480" style="s2">of being in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:34.080" style="s2">participating in reciprocal opening and</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.480" end="00:31:36.320" style="s2">coming into an ever deepening right</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.080" end="00:31:38.880" style="s2">relationship with yourself to others</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.320" end="00:31:40.000" style="s2">and to the world it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.880" end="00:31:43.200" style="s2">powerful thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.000" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">uh to uh to experience</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.200" end="00:31:48.240" style="s2">joy so this is another thing that</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:50.320" style="s2">we need to talk about briefly the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.240" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">make a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.320" end="00:31:57.120" style="s2">between passion</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">and emotion this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.120" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">these are modern terms these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:02.000" style="s2">exactly the terms the stomach use but</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">they&#39;re close to what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.000" end="00:32:04.480" style="s2">about here</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.720" end="00:32:08.480" style="s2">so they you they use the analogy of</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">walking down a hill</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.480" end="00:32:11.919" style="s2">so think of the word motion so when</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">you&#39;re walking downhill</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.919" end="00:32:18.640" style="s2">right that you&#39;re in motion and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:20.000" style="s2">if you are walking wisely you can flow</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.640" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">with the terrain</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.000" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">and you can actually get into enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">passion is like when you start running</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.080" end="00:32:30.720" style="s2">down the hill</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">we talk about the way our mind can run</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.720" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">away with itself or run away from us</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">right it&#39;s just my imagination once</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:40.480" style="s2">again running away right</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">song by the temptations so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.480" end="00:32:45.120" style="s2">running down a hill</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">you lose the capacity to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.120" end="00:32:48.799" style="s2">your right you fall into a process that</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:51.360" style="s2">is now</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.799" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">like taking away your ability to adjust</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.360" end="00:32:54.559" style="s2">and to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:56.000" style="s2">you fall out of sync with your terrain</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.559" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">and you&#39;re very very liable</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.000" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">to trip and fall and hurt yourself so</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:01.360" style="s2">the point is not to be emotionless to</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">have no</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.360" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">affect the point is to get into</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:10.559" style="s2">proper discernment proper judgment so</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:12.399" style="s2">that you are always experiencing emotion</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.559" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">rather than passion and that those</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.399" end="00:33:18.000" style="s2">emotions ultimately facilitate you</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:18.679" style="s2">flowing with nature and getting into two</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.000" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.679" end="00:33:24.640" style="s2">simultaneously enjoyment</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:28.799" style="s2">which isn&#39;t pleasure as i&#39;ve tried to</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.640" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">explain and encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.799" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">because the idea is if you have a true</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:35.919" style="s2">understanding what is in your control</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:37.840" style="s2">and what is not in your control then</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.919" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">that encourages you that gives you the</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.840" end="00:33:41.919" style="s2">courage to keep going</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">it gives you the resources to put to</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.919" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">deal with frustration</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:48.159" style="s2">and fear and disappointment so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">here is</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.159" end="00:33:53.440" style="s2">we want to train our relevance machinery</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:55.039" style="s2">our ability to determine what&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.440" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">sailing at the identity of things</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.039" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">so instead of it happening mindlessly</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:00.320" style="s2">automatically</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:01.760" style="s2">and reactively we want it to happen</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.320" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">reflectively</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.760" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">rationally and reliably</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">because we want uh what we find relevant</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.879" style="s2">and how we find it relevant</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:14.000" style="s2">to track what is real we want to walk</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.879" end="00:34:17.679" style="s2">down the hill</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.000" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">in flowing enjoyment rather than</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.679" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">run down the hill falling and falling</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">again and again</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:32.079" style="s2">so the idea here is we have to overcome</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.159" end="00:34:34.560" style="s2">self-deception because self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.079" end="00:34:35.280" style="s2">is primarily when our meaning making</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.560" end="00:34:39.839" style="s2">machinery</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.280" end="00:34:42.960" style="s2">is making things fall out of sync</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.839" end="00:34:44.879" style="s2">with nature where right out of sync with</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.960" end="00:34:46.480" style="s2">the patterns of intelligibility the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.879" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">patterns by which we make sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:49.599" style="s2">of the world ourselves and each other</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">and for the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.599" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">that involves three things logic</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">which basically this is the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:34:59.280" style="s2">disciplining judgment</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.040" end="00:35:00.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s not what we mean by formal logic</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.280" end="00:35:02.640" style="s2">although the stoics</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.880" end="00:35:06.160" style="s2">did some significant advances in formal</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.640" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">logic coming up with hypothetical</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.160" end="00:35:16.160" style="s2">ethics where ethics is the disciplining</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:19.440" style="s2">of impulse</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.160" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">and uh physics which</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.440" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">um is is what it overlaps with what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:27.359" style="s2">call physics</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">but it also overlaps um</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.359" end="00:35:33.839" style="s2">in in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:35.839" style="s2">getting very clear about pulling apart</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.839" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">how things are from how we desire them</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.839" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">so and the logic there is more like</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.839" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">psychological</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">it has to do with more figuring out the</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.680" end="00:35:54.000" style="s2">logos of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">and the idea here is that logos of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.000" end="00:35:58.960" style="s2">psyche is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">our inner dialogues our inner dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.960" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:03.760" style="s2">if we get better at managing that inner</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:05.920" style="s2">deal logos</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.760" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">we will better grasp the logos the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">organizing principles of the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">and then we can then use that to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">get a proper view of things so as to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:22.400" style="s2">properly discipline desire and we will</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">be able to deal with our impulses</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.400" end="00:36:26.400" style="s2">um in an appropriate manner through our</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">ethical training so these are the three</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.400" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">pillars</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">of stoic rationality the three pillars</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">of stoic rationality</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">so you primarily do this</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.480" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">by the practice of internalizing</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.400" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">internalizing socrates stoicism is</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:47.200" style="s2">basically the religion</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:49.839" style="s2">the philosophy of internalizing socrates</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:52.480" style="s2">in order to cultivate wisdom and virtue</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.839" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">each virtue is a way of being wise in</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.480" end="00:36:56.320" style="s2">this particular situation so there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:36:57.200" style="s2">components i talked about this yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.320" end="00:37:00.480" style="s2">of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.200" end="00:37:03.440" style="s2">this is sophia this is grasping</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.480" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">like grasping the logos this is grasping</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.440" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">the principles</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:10.560" style="s2">that organize and govern things and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">phromesis</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.560" end="00:37:23.520" style="s2">and we we say this but we forget how</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:27.119" style="s2">deep it is putting it into practice</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.520" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">virtue is the beauty of wisdom virtue it</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.119" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">so virtue is how</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">in this situation i very best</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:37.520" style="s2">do what is most wise so in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">situation to be wise in this situation</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.520" end="00:37:40.400" style="s2">is to be kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:42.240" style="s2">or to be honest or perhaps to be honest</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.400" end="00:37:44.880" style="s2">and kind perhaps to be courageous</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:46.240" style="s2">here perhaps to be you know uh resistant</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.880" end="00:37:49.280" style="s2">to evil here</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.240" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">right so what you&#39;re always trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.280" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">when you&#39;re internalizing socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:54.400" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to internalize these two</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">aspects so</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.400" end="00:37:58.160" style="s2">this is what we you know what we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:00.079" style="s2">cultivating</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.160" end="00:38:01.599" style="s2">in so far as we&#39;re being scientific in</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.079" end="00:38:03.440" style="s2">the very broad sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.599" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">and this is what we&#39;re cultivating when</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.440" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">we&#39;re being practical again in a much</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.640" style="s2">deeper sense than we normally</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:11.599" style="s2">mean day by day these are both terms for</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.640" end="00:38:14.320" style="s2">wisdom by the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.599" end="00:38:16.560" style="s2">both terms for wisdom so we internalize</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:19.359" style="s2">socrates</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.560" end="00:38:21.040" style="s2">and this is an inherently perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.359" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.040" end="00:38:25.040" style="s2">it&#39;s the process by which we put</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:27.920" style="s2">principles into practice</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.040" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">how does internalization look let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.920" end="00:38:31.599" style="s2">this again</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">here&#39;s some problem here&#39;s one of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.599" end="00:38:35.200" style="s2">sons when they&#39;re younger</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:36.800" style="s2">looking at the problem here i&#39;m an adult</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.200" end="00:38:40.320" style="s2">so remember</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.800" end="00:38:43.200" style="s2">as the child is to the adult</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.320" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">the adult is to the sage we&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.200" end="00:38:48.320" style="s2">talked about this but just reminding you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:51.040" style="s2">and i have a perspective on the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.320" end="00:38:52.720" style="s2">right that not only is on the problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.040" end="00:38:54.320" style="s2">but on my son&#39;s perspective</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.720" end="00:38:56.320" style="s2">this whole model of internalization</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.320" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">comes from vygotsky</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.320" end="00:39:00.560" style="s2">one of the greatest of the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">psychologists and what</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.560" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">my son does perhaps it was jason when he</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">was younger</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">is he imitates me</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">so in addition</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.599" end="00:39:15.920" style="s2">in addition imitates in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.320" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">trying to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.920" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">but jason is imitating me looking at him</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">and what he does is he keeps imitating</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">higher order perspective so here&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">first person perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:31.599" style="s2">to him for me it&#39;s first person but to</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.599" end="00:39:35.839" style="s2">it&#39;s a third person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.280" style="s2">so he keeps in right he keeps imitating</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.560" end="00:39:43.359" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.280" end="00:39:44.320" style="s2">imitating that and imitating that and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.359" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">imitating that</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.320" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">until eventually he can do it for</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:49.599" style="s2">himself without me being around</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">and he gets better and better and as</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:52.800" style="s2">he&#39;s doing it with me i correct him and</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">correct him until eventually</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.800" end="00:39:56.079" style="s2">he makes the ability to take that</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">perspective on</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.079" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">himself a property of his own cognition</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">this is how we get what&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.640" style="s2">metacognition</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.800" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">this is your ability to step back and</p>

<p begin="00:40:09.280" end="00:40:12.160" style="s2">we of course broaden it um when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.960" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">talking about it in cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.160" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">but that&#39;s not really relevant right now</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:20.200" style="s2">so what we want to do is</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.280" end="00:40:22.079" style="s2">we and this is really powerful this</p>

<p begin="00:40:28.480" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">meta perspectival ability right this is</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">features of wisdom why</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.680" end="00:40:39.119" style="s2">because this is this is how you afford</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:41.200" style="s2">self-transcendence when i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.119" end="00:40:43.359" style="s2">in this perspective i can&#39;t see the</p>

<p begin="00:40:43.359" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">and i also can&#39;t take on longer term</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:50.319" style="s2">goals that are fall outside the scope of</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.319" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">but by doing this i can see the biases</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.359" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">from a higher order perspective i can</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:59.599" style="s2">see the biases and the inadequacies</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">of a lower order perspective we</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.599" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">literally transcend</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:06.960" style="s2">ourselves by internalizing other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">so uh the person who put together the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.960" end="00:41:10.880" style="s2">task force ear broken</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:12.560" style="s2">has all this evidence for example if</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.880" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">people if you have people describe a</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.560" end="00:41:14.800" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">think about this think about this when</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.800" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">we do the view from above think about</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">what i&#39;m going to say when we do the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">view from above</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">right when you have people just send me</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">a problem like really emission and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:24.720" style="s2">will almost always describe it from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:26.480" style="s2">first person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.720" end="00:41:28.000" style="s2">and then you say okay now i want you to</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:29.920" style="s2">redescribe the problem</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">but from a third person perspective</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.920" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">somebody from the outside how somebody</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.280" style="s2">from the outside would describe it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">then when they do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.280" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">they go oh and they have insights and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">they have realization and they</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:43.040" style="s2">often find a way of breaking out they</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:46.079" style="s2">become wiser</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.040" end="00:41:49.200" style="s2">they see what needs to be done they</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.079" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">activate the appropriate virtue</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.200" end="00:41:52.480" style="s2">that needs to be uh brought in they</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:54.880" style="s2">start to see through</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.480" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">previous self-deception so we want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.880" end="00:41:58.240" style="s2">internalize</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">the sage and what that&#39;s going to give</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.240" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">us right is</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do perspectival practice</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.440" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">and when we do that we get</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:09.119" style="s2">self-knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:10.160" style="s2">which is not your autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:12.160" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.160" end="00:42:13.359" style="s2">it&#39;s not your autobiographical narrative</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.160" end="00:42:17.280" style="s2">self that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.359" end="00:42:21.040" style="s2">and uh right and i&#39;ll use these two</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.280" end="00:42:24.400" style="s2">axes to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.040" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">i&#39;m almost done and then we can go into</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.400" end="00:42:27.200" style="s2">the view from above</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:31.680" style="s2">your autobiographical this is your</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:34.400" style="s2">horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.680" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">sense of identity this is how you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.400" end="00:42:38.079" style="s2">pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:38.800" style="s2">fame and power which are largely</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.079" end="00:42:41.440" style="s2">pursuits</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.800" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">that confuse what&#39;s right the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.440" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">things with the thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:48.000" style="s2">and cause you to be self-deceived about</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:51.040" style="s2">how much control you can exercise</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.000" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">but when you pursue fame and power</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.040" end="00:42:54.880" style="s2">instead the kind of self-knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:57.839" style="s2">you get is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.880" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">vertical it&#39;s ontological it&#39;s right if</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.839" end="00:43:02.079" style="s2">your autobiography is a story</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:04.160" style="s2">the ontological the vertical is like the</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.079" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">owner&#39;s manual you&#39;re trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.160" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">uh the um the functions</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:13.040" style="s2">by which you&#39;re set you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">figure out the logos</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.040" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">of your psyche you&#39;re trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">out the functions the structural</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">functional organization</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">by which it works so what you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">here is this is largely the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:32.400" style="s2">project right of self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:34.319" style="s2">and so that brings us into the final</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.400" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">component of this</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.319" end="00:43:39.359" style="s2">the stoics ask well what should you</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">when you&#39;re transcending you&#39;re aspiring</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.359" end="00:43:42.640" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to become</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:44.240" style="s2">right something other than you are</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.640" end="00:43:46.640" style="s2">you&#39;re self-transcending</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.240" end="00:43:47.359" style="s2">you&#39;re internalizing the sage and of</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.640" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.359" end="00:43:51.040" style="s2">you&#39;re aspiring and in a certain manner</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:51.920" style="s2">but isn&#39;t that setting your heart on</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.040" end="00:43:54.480" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.920" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">you can hear like a cynic voice in there</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.480" end="00:43:58.560" style="s2">and so like the cynics the stoics do pay</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:01.760" style="s2">attention to the objects</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.560" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">right um of our aspiration the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.760" end="00:44:04.880" style="s2">object so that we set our heart so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:07.119" style="s2">setting our heart upon</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.880" end="00:44:08.800" style="s2">our future self isn&#39;t that dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.119" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">isn&#39;t that the person that&#39;s doing fame</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.800" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">doing the same thing and so how you set</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">how you set your heart right and in what</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:18.400" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:20.160" style="s2">you&#39;re setting your heart upon your</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.400" end="00:44:23.040" style="s2">future self are really crucial</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.160" end="00:44:24.000" style="s2">uh to the stoics so the stories say you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.040" end="00:44:25.680" style="s2">should always you should</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.000" end="00:44:28.079" style="s2">and then you can hear the cynics again</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.680" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">here you should always set your heart</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.079" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">on that which is always good</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">is pleasure always good no it can really</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:37.760" style="s2">screw you up badly</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:39.359" style="s2">fame always good no i&#39;m really messing</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.760" end="00:44:40.079" style="s2">up his power always good no it often</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.359" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">corrupts</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.079" end="00:44:44.079" style="s2">very often bad they even challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:44.800" style="s2">epicureans of it this is is friendship</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.079" end="00:44:47.280" style="s2">always good</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.800" end="00:44:48.400" style="s2">yeah there seems to be time when</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.280" end="00:44:51.440" style="s2">friendship can</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.400" end="00:44:54.319" style="s2">uh really go awry</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.440" end="00:44:55.839" style="s2">just friendship in a general sense and</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.319" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">so what the stoics uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.839" end="00:45:02.400" style="s2">say is well what is always good</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:05.040" style="s2">and they say well what&#39;s always good is</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.400" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">virtue and then you say about sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.040" end="00:45:07.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know which virtue</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">to apply and so they say yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.920" end="00:45:11.359" style="s2">right so what you really are saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:13.760" style="s2">is that you&#39;re pointing to the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">a virtue is always the beauty of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.760" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">that what what&#39;s always good is wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:23.359" style="s2">because wisdom is what will always</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:24.880" style="s2">help us to set our heart in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.359" end="00:45:26.079" style="s2">way and you see how this sort of circles</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.880" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">back on itself</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.079" end="00:45:29.200" style="s2">and what the stories are saying is set</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">your heart</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.200" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">on becoming the wisest person you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:36.240" style="s2">internalizing the sage because wisdom is</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:39.599" style="s2">always good</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.240" end="00:45:41.520" style="s2">because right being able to put</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.599" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">principles into practice in the best</p>

<p begin="00:45:46.640" end="00:45:49.920" style="s2">is always good doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s always</p>

<p begin="00:45:49.920" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">but pleasure isn&#39;t always good but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:55.920" style="s2">always good in that it is what is always</p>

<p begin="00:46:03.119" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">you know two core kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">practices one is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">uh practices of rational judgment</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:19.359" style="s2">and aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:20.839" style="s2">so you have to engage in some</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.359" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">fundamental practices of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.839" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">self-examination</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">and then practices of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.599" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">self-transformation</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.240" end="00:46:35.440" style="s2">so the biggest practice here we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">talked about this before is active</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.440" end="00:46:39.520" style="s2">open-mindedness</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">this is the practice i&#39;ll mention these</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.520" end="00:46:43.359" style="s2">again</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">get one or all of these books you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.359" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">this but i&#39;ll put this i will put the uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">it&#39;s in the description you want this</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">um or the 25 cognitive biases</p>

<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">and what i do is i try to start every</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">day after i&#39;ve done my practices i read</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">about a bias</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:09.599" style="s2">i reflect upon it i think about it i try</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">and remember times when i engaged in it</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.599" end="00:47:12.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">um and then throughout the day and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.640" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.079" end="00:47:19.520" style="s2">i have my journal and at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.480" end="00:47:22.079" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.520" end="00:47:25.119" style="s2">what i do is i do this i look for any</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.079" end="00:47:28.720" style="s2">vice that i committed any virtue that i</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.119" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">omitted any bias that i remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.720" end="00:47:32.880" style="s2">engaging in the confirmation bias or</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:35.200" style="s2">fundamental attribution error</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.880" end="00:47:36.000" style="s2">self-centeredness and then i also</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.200" end="00:47:39.359" style="s2">remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.000" end="00:47:42.240" style="s2">so copy i also remember</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.359" end="00:47:42.800" style="s2">any virtue that i clearly brought into</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.240" end="00:47:45.119" style="s2">play</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.800" end="00:47:46.160" style="s2">a situation where i was wiser than i</p>

<p begin="00:47:46.160" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">in any virtue i brought into play and do</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.599" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">that every day and every day and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:58.480" style="s2">slowly slowly this is called prochiron</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">this is keeping things ready to hand</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.480" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">this is you slowly slowly let this</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:05.520" style="s2">permeate and percolate</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.040" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">and more and more you start to notice</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.520" end="00:48:08.800" style="s2">the ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">in which you are engaging in</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.800" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">ways in which you&#39;re being foolish now</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">if you just did that that would be like</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:16.160" style="s2">oh</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.160" style="s2">right that&#39;d be like protestant guilt or</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.160" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">something that&#39;s why it&#39;s also important</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.160" end="00:48:21.200" style="s2">to do these practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">because these practices are your</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.200" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">response these are the practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:26.559" style="s2">that say to you right now this is what</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:28.720" style="s2">you can do</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.559" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">to get better so that you can aspire</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.720" end="00:48:32.319" style="s2">properly</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:33.359" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to use we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.319" end="00:48:35.520" style="s2">about five</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.359" end="00:48:36.559" style="s2">minutes or so right now of one of these</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.520" end="00:48:38.720" style="s2">practices</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.559" end="00:48:40.000" style="s2">so this is a practice that is designed</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.720" end="00:48:42.319" style="s2">to transform</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.000" end="00:48:43.680" style="s2">your you your perspective remember how</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.319" end="00:48:46.079" style="s2">internalization is a pes</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.680" end="00:48:47.359" style="s2">perspectival transformation if you get a</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.079" end="00:48:50.079" style="s2">chance i have a talk</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.359" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">on youtube called the view from above in</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.079" end="00:48:53.440" style="s2">which i go into this in greater detail</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">if you want sort of more of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.440" end="00:48:56.240" style="s2">the philosophy and the cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:57.599" style="s2">behind it but right now i&#39;m going to sit</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.240" end="00:48:58.559" style="s2">down jason&#39;s going to come and change</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.599" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">the camera again</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.559" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">and i&#39;m going to talk you through uh the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">view from above</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.680" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">so here the camera hang actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.280" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">actually works as i&#39;m doing the view</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.640" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">from above</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:30.240" style="s2">but you&#39;ll forget it&#39;s not good for me</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">with my ears to tilt my head up a lot so</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.240" end="00:49:33.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll try and keep it um straight</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:34.800" style="s2">throughout</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.280" end="00:49:36.480" style="s2">so what i want to do is we&#39;ll just take</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.800" end="00:49:39.680" style="s2">a minute or so</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.480" end="00:49:40.079" style="s2">quiet do a very brief but find the core</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.680" end="00:49:41.839" style="s2">four</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.079" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">like you&#39;ve been doing it long enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.839" end="00:49:44.319" style="s2">you should be able to get a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">being centered</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.319" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">uh have your basic root basic flow on</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">your focus</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.920" style="s2">take a minute or two we&#39;ll say we&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">in silence for a minute or two</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.920" end="00:49:56.319" style="s2">and then i&#39;m going to talk you through</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.480" end="00:49:59.040" style="s2">like walk you through</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.319" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">the view from above practice okay so a</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.040" end="00:50:13.839" style="s2">minute or two of silence first</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.839" end="00:50:41.839" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.960" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">while keeping your eyes closed imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.440" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly where you are the room</p>

<p begin="00:51:25.280" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">imagine that you&#39;re in exactly the place</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:37.760" style="s2">very gently imagine yourself at least</p>

<p begin="00:51:43.440" end="00:51:48.160" style="s2">becoming transparent and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.680" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">into that room from above perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.160" end="00:52:04.079" style="s2">still see your body</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:52:08.480" style="s2">sitting in the meditation posture</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.079" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">imagine yourself gently no fear</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.480" end="00:52:11.280" style="s2">rising higher</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.319" end="00:52:16.079" style="s2">you can see the entire city or</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.040" end="00:52:19.040" style="s2">countryside</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.079" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">where you&#39;re living you see the house or</p>

<p begin="00:52:40.400" end="00:52:50.640" style="s2">now rise up even higher very gently</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:53.839" style="s2">no jarring completely fine</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.640" end="00:52:54.960" style="s2">now you can see entire country that you</p>

<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:05.440" style="s2">take a moment to really dwell in this</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.079" end="00:53:09.119" style="s2">notice how your sense of what&#39;s salient</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.319" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">and relevant</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.119" end="00:53:28.160" style="s2">and what&#39;s important is shifting</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:31.680" style="s2">the sense of self is even shifting</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.160" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">now rise up gently</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.680" end="00:53:37.359" style="s2">no problem with any of this until you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:57:32.000" end="00:57:37.839" style="s2">now reimagine yourself where you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.359" end="00:57:39.119" style="s2">but remember what it was like to be no</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.839" end="00:57:42.400" style="s2">one</p>

<p begin="00:57:42.400" end="00:57:46.559" style="s2">try to integrate those two together feel</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.280" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">them deeply together</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.559" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">like stereoscopic vision one eye is</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:55.040" style="s2">seeing you</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">you hear now the other eye is seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.040" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">that no one nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:00.880" style="s2">no when</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.599" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">let them talk to each other let them</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.839" end="00:58:09.839" style="s2">dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.720" end="00:58:22.160" style="s2">okay slowly come out of your practice</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.640" end="00:58:24.000" style="s2">so you can do that a little bit longer</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.160" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">especially when you&#39;re sort of at the</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.000" end="00:58:27.280" style="s2">apex of the view from above you can hang</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:30.160" style="s2">out there longer</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.280" end="00:58:32.079" style="s2">but remember to right that that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.160" end="00:58:33.680" style="s2">gonna be not just doing the motion in</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.079" end="00:58:34.640" style="s2">the imagination it&#39;s much more important</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.680" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.640" end="00:58:38.559" style="s2">to use that as a platform by which you</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:41.920" style="s2">are becoming aware of and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.559" end="00:58:44.400" style="s2">training the transformation of judgment</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.920" end="00:58:46.480" style="s2">a perspectival judgment a perspective</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.400" end="00:58:48.319" style="s2">taking what you find relevant and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.480" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">salient the identities</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.319" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">that that are being assigned and assumed</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">and remember when you come back down to</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:58.319" style="s2">see that transformation in reverse</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">and then use that memory of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.319" end="00:59:01.359" style="s2">transformation up</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:02.960" style="s2">and the transformation down to create a</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.359" end="00:59:06.319" style="s2">stereoscopic vision</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.960" end="00:59:10.480" style="s2">of you so for me i hear now</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.319" end="00:59:13.520" style="s2">and no one nowhere</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.480" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">no when seeing the two together</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.520" end="00:59:16.960" style="s2">seeing the two together and that way you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:20.799" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.960" end="00:59:22.720" style="s2">getting this capacity to take a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.799" end="00:59:25.040" style="s2">powerful kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.720" end="00:59:26.720" style="s2">higher order perspective on yourself</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.040" end="00:59:27.599" style="s2">enhance your medical respective</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.720" end="00:59:29.720" style="s2">cognition</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.599" end="00:59:31.200" style="s2">and enhance your capacity for</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.720" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">self-transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.200" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">and learn it learning deeply</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">to discern the difference between things</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">and the narratives that we assigned</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:47.359" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re going to take about five</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:51.040" style="s2">minutes or so for a few questions</p>

<p begin="01:00:10.799" end="01:00:15.119" style="s2">which is a contemplative practice</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s very much like meta and that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.119" end="01:00:18.559" style="s2">reciprocal opening</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.640" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">uh process but it&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.559" end="01:00:21.839" style="s2">aspirational</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:23.520" style="s2">than that but both sides were very good</p>

<p begin="01:00:27.839" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">two of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:31.760" style="s2">on the way so far i think mark&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">referring to</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.760" end="01:00:35.760" style="s2">uh questions about the philosophical</p>

<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:49.760" style="s2">lots of groups i think four people</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:51.520" style="s2">committing to four rounds</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.760" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">is really quite optimal that&#39;s what i</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.520" end="01:00:55.200" style="s2">would recommend julian</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.359" end="01:03:06.799" style="s2">um so when the facilitator chooses who</p>

<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">a little bit of preliminary study this</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:16.240" style="s2">is something i hadn&#39;t mentioned before</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:18.079" style="s2">and i should have and that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.240" end="01:03:20.160" style="s2">on my part so thank you brett for</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.079" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">this correction it&#39;s very important to</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.160" end="01:03:23.680" style="s2">get some sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:26.079" style="s2">of the historical context like you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.680" end="01:03:29.200" style="s2">just a quick wikipedia scanning</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.079" end="01:03:30.000" style="s2">because again um that&#39;s the uh that</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.200" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">that&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.000" end="01:03:34.400" style="s2">helpful uh but trying to pick up on even</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">your intuitive sense of the person</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.400" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">uh from the text so relying on your</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:40.640" style="s2">intuition to try and get a sense</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">of what that person is like from the</p>

<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:44.960" style="s2">is also valuable so historical education</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:48.240" style="s2">online intuition</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.960" end="01:03:49.680" style="s2">and again that can you have to also rely</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.240" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">on the convergence of</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.680" end="01:03:52.799" style="s2">uh that different people bring to the</p>

<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:57.039" style="s2">for actually invoking the presence of</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.039" end="01:04:00.480" style="s2">uh marco feb i often say that stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.599" end="01:04:03.440" style="s2">gives us a how</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.480" end="01:04:04.079" style="s2">but know why most seem to agree comments</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.440" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.079" end="01:04:10.640" style="s2">so um like i tried to um say i think</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:12.799" style="s2">stoicism does give us the why um but</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.640" end="01:04:15.520" style="s2">it&#39;s often not well understood</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.799" end="01:04:16.319" style="s2">uh there&#39;s the the um the why of</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.520" end="01:04:19.520" style="s2">stoicism</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.319" end="01:04:22.319" style="s2">is enjoyment and encouragement and</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.520" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">flowing with nature and the idea is to</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.319" end="01:04:25.520" style="s2">live the kind of life</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:26.880" style="s2">that has the most of that which is</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.520" end="01:04:28.799" style="s2">always good</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.880" end="01:04:30.559" style="s2">so the stoic answers to what is what is</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.799" end="01:04:31.680" style="s2">the good life is very it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.559" end="01:04:33.039" style="s2">very simple answer but i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.680" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">very profound answer</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.039" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">the good life is the life that has the</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:38.720" style="s2">most in it of what is most often</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">reliably good</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.720" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">what is most often reliably good is</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:46.160" style="s2">wisdom where wisdom isn&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:48.799" style="s2">saying wise things are having advice</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.160" end="01:04:49.839" style="s2">but that discernment that puts us into</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.799" end="01:04:51.520" style="s2">enjoyment</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.839" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">that puts us into a right relationship</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.520" end="01:04:55.760" style="s2">with ourselves with each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:56.880" style="s2">and the world a rational in the broader</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.760" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">sense of rational</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.880" end="01:05:00.400" style="s2">right relationship that is enjoyed and</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:02.640" style="s2">not pleasured</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.400" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">but enjoyed for its own sake because</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.640" end="01:05:06.960" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:09.119" style="s2">the good life that&#39;s the why um</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.960" end="01:05:10.480" style="s2">so pleasure of doubt uh some have voiced</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.119" end="01:05:12.079" style="s2">the concern that the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.480" end="01:05:12.720" style="s2">fellowship practice is too advanced for</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.079" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">most people on</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.720" end="01:05:18.079" style="s2">discord that many haven&#39;t yet got down</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:19.440" style="s2">uh prerequisite skills one and two</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.079" end="01:05:20.559" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s probably conductive</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.440" end="01:05:21.920" style="s2">for those without an established</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.559" end="01:05:23.680" style="s2">practice and other skills you&#39;ve taught</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.920" end="01:05:26.400" style="s2">to move ahead with this news practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.680" end="01:05:27.440" style="s2">is there harm in just jumping in um so</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.400" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">what i&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.440" end="01:05:32.079" style="s2">i actually see that the concern that</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">people are voicing is a very legitimate</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.079" end="01:05:34.480" style="s2">serve</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:36.160" style="s2">for the practice of dialectic which is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.480" end="01:05:38.880" style="s2">neoplatonic practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.160" end="01:05:40.400" style="s2">uh lahav and i agree with him argues</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.880" end="01:05:42.480" style="s2">that philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.400" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">companionship can be started sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.480" end="01:05:46.160" style="s2">off the street all it requires is that</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:49.200" style="s2">people have</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.160" end="01:05:51.680" style="s2">good faith now that being said i do</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.200" end="01:05:52.720" style="s2">think having that you shouldn&#39;t do the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.680" end="01:05:55.359" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.720" end="01:05:56.720" style="s2">if you haven&#39;t had some experience with</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.359" end="01:05:58.400" style="s2">the core four</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.720" end="01:06:00.240" style="s2">of the mindfulness practice finding your</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.400" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">center root flow and focus</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.240" end="01:06:04.559" style="s2">and some basic practice with lectio</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">divina so i sort of split the difference</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.559" end="01:06:06.960" style="s2">with with</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:08.559" style="s2">the half i think you should have that</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.960" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">the core four of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.559" end="01:06:12.240" style="s2">and lexia davina in hand and then you</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:13.839" style="s2">can take up the philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.240" end="01:06:15.760" style="s2">contemplative companionship</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.839" end="01:06:16.960" style="s2">i would say that until you&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.760" end="01:06:18.960" style="s2">philosophical contemplative</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.960" end="01:06:20.000" style="s2">companionship you really shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.960" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">undertaking</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.000" end="01:06:23.920" style="s2">uh the practice of dialectic now i do</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:25.039" style="s2">things where i get people to practice</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.920" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">the dialectic</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.039" end="01:06:30.319" style="s2">and uh and that&#39;s still helpful</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:32.319" style="s2">um but those are much more like you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.319" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">the clinical trials in an experiment</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.319" end="01:06:35.680" style="s2">experimental clinical trials you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">trying to figure out um</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.680" end="01:06:38.880" style="s2">a practice i think when once you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:40.960" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.880" end="01:06:42.480" style="s2">existential frame that there should be a</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.960" end="01:06:43.920" style="s2">pedagogical program</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.480" end="01:06:45.920" style="s2">where you start with philosophical</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.920" end="01:06:47.920" style="s2">contemplative companionships</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.920" end="01:06:49.680" style="s2">and then you move into something um</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.920" end="01:06:50.720" style="s2">intermediate uh perhaps like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.680" end="01:06:52.799" style="s2">anti-debate</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.720" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">um and like which is a very stoic kind</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.799" end="01:06:56.400" style="s2">of thing to do and then we move into the</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:58.559" style="s2">neoplatonic practice</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.400" end="01:07:02.799" style="s2">of dialectic but there&#39;s more of that uh</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.559" end="01:07:04.720" style="s2">coming um i just wanted to remind people</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.799" end="01:07:07.039" style="s2">that just like i recommended a book on</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.720" end="01:07:08.079" style="s2">practice i recommend getting this book</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.039" end="01:07:10.880" style="s2">we&#39;re going to be going through this</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.079" end="01:07:12.880" style="s2">book so going forward on saturday sega</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.880" end="01:07:15.119" style="s2">as we continue the high school of</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.880" end="01:07:16.559" style="s2">stoicism we&#39;re then of course making use</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.119" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">of some of the suggestions in the clone</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.559" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">read mclean it&#39;s good it&#39;s helpful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.880" end="01:07:22.000" style="s2">valuable uh but</p>
