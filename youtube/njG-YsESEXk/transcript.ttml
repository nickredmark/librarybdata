<p begin="00:01:16.009" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">going to work is Michael will do about</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.920" end="00:01:24.290" style="s2">20 minutes of of talking about the</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.180" end="00:01:51.050" style="s2">look forward to the questions in</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.410" end="00:01:53.450" style="s2">discussion so the current crisis</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.050" end="00:01:55.430" style="s2">encompassing health economics politics</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.450" end="00:01:56.960" style="s2">and world order presents us with an</p>

<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:12.890" style="s2">on sense making I think the stoah you</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.760" end="00:02:15.050" style="s2">can see that here individuals groups</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.890" end="00:02:16.940" style="s2">info militias to use Jack Murphy&#39;s term</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.050" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">and others all have an opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.940" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">contribute to understanding interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:23.960" style="s2">and influencing what&#39;s going on beyond</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:26.480" style="s2">the constraints and limitations of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.960" end="00:02:27.890" style="s2">traditional channels so one group of</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.480" end="00:02:30.200" style="s2">people trying to make sense of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.890" end="00:02:32.570" style="s2">going on has tried to bring political</p>

<p begin="00:02:32.570" end="00:02:36.080" style="s2">area in which I was trained to bear on</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.940" end="00:02:39.020" style="s2">the interpretation of the current</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.550" end="00:02:45.290" style="s2">Montreal has argued that it was our</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.070" end="00:02:46.970" style="s2">false illusion of technical mastery over</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.290" end="00:02:50.390" style="s2">political affairs that lulled</p>

<p begin="00:02:51.740" end="00:02:55.370" style="s2">Machiavelli&#39;s teaching about Fortuna as</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.630" end="00:02:56.690" style="s2">a helpful corrective and frame of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:02:57.770" style="s2">reference for that analysis so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.690" end="00:03:00.739" style="s2">one example of the use of political</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.739" end="00:03:04.610" style="s2">Thomas Hobbes I&#39;ve also been invoked to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.320" style="s2">help us to reflect on the states of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.610" end="00:03:08.540" style="s2">emergency some governments have declared</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.320" end="00:03:10.660" style="s2">and on the reassertion of national</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.540" end="00:03:13.130" style="s2">sovereignty we seem to be witnessing as</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.660" end="00:03:15.920" style="s2">countries close their borders to travel</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.130" end="00:03:17.959" style="s2">and invoke special powers to irrigate</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.920" end="00:03:19.520" style="s2">protective personal equipment and other</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.959" end="00:03:22.250" style="s2">medical supplies for their doctors</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.520" end="00:03:24.350" style="s2">nurses and health care professionals so</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.250" end="00:03:26.420" style="s2">all such reflections are to my mind to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.350" end="00:03:27.980" style="s2">be welcomed and within the political</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.420" end="00:03:30.200" style="s2">theory tradition we should be prepared</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.980" end="00:03:32.090" style="s2">to listen thoughtfully not only to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.200" end="00:03:34.489" style="s2">Machiavelli Schmitt and Hobbes the three</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.090" end="00:03:37.280" style="s2">examples I just gave but also to Plato</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.489" end="00:03:39.380" style="s2">Aristotle in the Bible as well as jejak</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.280" end="00:03:41.209" style="s2">Derrida and doulas and I think you&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:03:41.209" end="00:03:44.780" style="s2">courtesy Arvin and others and short we</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.430" end="00:03:46.610" style="s2">should be willing to listen to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.780" end="00:03:48.440" style="s2">who&#39;s thinking about or has thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.610" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">about the foundations of human life and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.440" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">its spiritual political and social</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:54.079" style="s2">dimensions so that&#39;s the first point is</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:56.810" style="s2">that there&#39;s no problem keeping</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.079" end="00:03:58.430" style="s2">everything on the table for now</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.810" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">this isn&#39;t a talk about having only</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.430" end="00:04:03.140" style="s2">Heidegger and everybody else off to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:04.820" style="s2">side and yet what I&#39;d like to bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.140" end="00:04:06.650" style="s2">before you today is what seems to me to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.820" end="00:04:09.020" style="s2">be in general and neglected alternative</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.650" end="00:04:10.610" style="s2">when it comes to crisis sense making at</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.020" end="00:04:12.050" style="s2">least among political theorists and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.610" end="00:04:14.209" style="s2">political philosophers in the public</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.050" end="00:04:16.370" style="s2">sphere so besides the more familiar</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.209" end="00:04:18.049" style="s2">names I mentioned and other approaches</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.370" end="00:04:21.500" style="s2">and modalities we can consider during</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.049" end="00:04:24.020" style="s2">this time again many of which you can</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.500" end="00:04:25.700" style="s2">find at the stoah we should pay special</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.020" end="00:04:27.920" style="s2">attention to what German philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.700" end="00:04:30.290" style="s2">Martin Heidegger can teach us about how</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.920" end="00:04:32.270" style="s2">to interpret ourselves in our moment so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.290" end="00:04:34.070" style="s2">first as I&#39;m not claiming that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.270" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">talks about Heidegger I heard him</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.070" end="00:04:37.700" style="s2">brought up in a recent event here as</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:39.560" style="s2">someone who might help us to think about</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.700" end="00:04:42.380" style="s2">death and there&#39;s definitely something</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.560" end="00:04:44.060" style="s2">to that but some of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.380" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">things he gives us to think about are</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.060" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">often downplayed or ignored</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:50.090" style="s2">perhaps because they&#39;re seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">slippery slope to radical right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.090" end="00:04:53.450" style="s2">anti-liberal ism or</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:56.419" style="s2">or else they&#39;re misunderstood for other</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.450" end="00:04:58.850" style="s2">reasons the goal ultimately as I see it</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.419" end="00:05:01.160" style="s2">is not to talk about Heidegger for</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.850" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">instance with biographical curiosity</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.160" end="00:05:05.630" style="s2">about him as a figure of 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">intellectual history like his favorite</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.630" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">hat and you know how he got it you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:12.830" style="s2">really like for something like that or</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">even to trace influences but rather with</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.830" end="00:05:17.030" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s help to gain genuine access</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:18.500" style="s2">to ourselves and thereby a better</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.030" end="00:05:21.140" style="s2">understanding of the nature of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.500" end="00:05:23.150" style="s2">crisis broadly construed my claim here</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.140" end="00:05:26.390" style="s2">is that we should consider that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.150" end="00:05:28.310" style="s2">not only no way out of our crisis but</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.390" end="00:05:30.620" style="s2">also no possibility of understanding it</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.310" end="00:05:33.970" style="s2">for what it is without a foundation in</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.620" end="00:05:35.780" style="s2">heidecker&#39;s thaad so now a brief</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.970" end="00:05:38.390" style="s2">introductory comments on Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.780" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">himself Heidegger who was born in 1889</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.390" end="00:05:43.970" style="s2">and died in 1976 also addressed himself</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.840" style="s2">to a crisis so we&#39;re not the only people</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.970" end="00:05:46.640" style="s2">who have ever lived through what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.840" end="00:05:47.810" style="s2">think is a crisis in fact you might say</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.640" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">maybe some of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.810" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">thinking happens in the midst of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">crisis or maybe thinking itself always</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.090" style="s2">provokes a crisis if it if it breaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.950" style="s2">into the foundations of things but in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.090" end="00:06:01.460" style="s2">this case writing and being in time in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.950" end="00:06:04.070" style="s2">1927 a Heidegger discusses how there was</p>

<p begin="00:08:23.900" end="00:08:29.000" style="s2">who are we and whose are we and what is</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.510" end="00:08:44.450" style="s2">increase when we begin to think about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.719" end="00:08:46.100" style="s2">ourselves as meaning-making beings so</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.450" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">there&#39;s a complex of questions here you</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.100" end="00:08:50.120" style="s2">could say it lies a level deeper then</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.650" end="00:08:52.370" style="s2">the questions I take anything about</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.120" end="00:08:53.900" style="s2">meaning making for granted including as</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.370" end="00:08:56.150" style="s2">I said the issue who it is doing this</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.900" end="00:08:59.300" style="s2">activity is it consciousness the soul</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.150" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">the spirit the individual and we could</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.300" end="00:09:02.660" style="s2">easily multiply the list of possible</p>

<p begin="00:09:02.660" end="00:09:08.060" style="s2">action no bhai degrees suggesting let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.700" end="00:09:09.770" style="s2">not start with some posited as I say</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.060" end="00:09:12.339" style="s2">conscious and soul spirit but let&#39;s try</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.770" end="00:09:15.020" style="s2">to get a level deeper than that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.339" end="00:09:16.550" style="s2">so what distinguishes Heidegger from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.020" end="00:09:18.310" style="s2">other approaches is precisely his</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.550" end="00:09:21.140" style="s2">recourse through this deeper level of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.310" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">fundamental ontology where we&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.140" end="00:09:25.970" style="s2">questioning further into the concealed</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:28.310" style="s2">presuppositions of our thinking so for</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.970" end="00:09:30.470" style="s2">instance we could imagine a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.310" end="00:09:32.390" style="s2">about the contemporary situation that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.470" end="00:09:32.990" style="s2">relies on analysis in terms of something</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.390" end="00:09:35.000" style="s2">in Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.990" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">I have nothing against such an approach</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.000" end="00:09:40.190" style="s2">and I agree with Peter that if we learn</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:41.600" style="s2">to be performative lis agnostic and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.190" end="00:09:43.790" style="s2">maintain such a position experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.600" end="00:09:45.520" style="s2">without holding it ourselves we could</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.790" end="00:09:49.640" style="s2">learn important things and gain valuable</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.520" end="00:09:51.890" style="s2">insights nevertheless and Heidegger the</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.640" end="00:09:53.900" style="s2">question comes to the forefront as to</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.890" end="00:09:56.660" style="s2">how the interpretation of being and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.900" end="00:09:59.060" style="s2">human being is grounded in this case and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.660" end="00:10:00.860" style="s2">in fact Heidegger shows that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.060" end="00:10:02.750" style="s2">interpretation of being as will to power</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.860" end="00:10:05.480" style="s2">for instance to take a fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.750" end="00:10:07.070" style="s2">machen notion is a distorted</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.480" end="00:10:09.770" style="s2">interpretation of being in a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.070" end="00:10:11.450" style="s2">precise sense so let me add though that</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.770" end="00:10:13.430" style="s2">he also considered the careful study of</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.450" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">nature to be indispensable and has four</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.170" end="00:10:23.390" style="s2">well will to power is a distorted</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.920" end="00:10:24.920" style="s2">interpretation of being you gotta also</p>

<p begin="00:10:24.920" end="00:10:28.820" style="s2">Nietzsche but nevertheless he did show</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.420" end="00:10:31.040" style="s2">that you can&#39;t just operate with</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.820" end="00:10:32.209" style="s2">Nietzsche notions because ultimately I</p>

<p begin="00:10:34.820" end="00:10:37.440" style="s2">issue of whether an interpretation is</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.200" end="00:10:39.810" style="s2">well grounded remains</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.440" end="00:10:41.900" style="s2">we start not with the will to power but</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.810" end="00:10:46.710" style="s2">with any such concept like consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.900" end="00:10:48.000" style="s2">or life or race or any definition of the</p>

<p begin="00:16:26.100" end="00:16:32.489" style="s2">long time but Heidegger exhorts us</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:35.009" style="s2">instead or ambition to remember being</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.009" end="00:16:39.720" style="s2">aspects of our problem a pure most</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.649" end="00:16:41.850" style="s2">urgent and as death makes itself felt</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.720" end="00:16:45.389" style="s2">not to fail to think about the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.850" end="00:16:46.160" style="s2">of our own being towards death so the</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.160" end="00:16:50.639" style="s2">interpreting collapsing everything into</p>

<p begin="00:16:58.439" end="00:17:04.350" style="s2">beginning so just a side note here</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.289" end="00:17:05.970" style="s2">basically there are two problems one is</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.350" end="00:17:07.829" style="s2">our entanglement in the world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.970" end="00:17:09.409" style="s2">where we get caught up with things but</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.829" end="00:17:12.480" style="s2">another one is our entanglement in</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.419" end="00:20:19.559" style="s2">itself and inaugurating a new era a new</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.520" end="00:20:21.150" style="s2">history of philosophy and he uses this</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.559" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">image that philosophies are like peaks</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:25.350" style="s2">philosophies are like peaks in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.340" end="00:20:26.940" style="s2">mountain range they configure the height</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.350" end="00:20:29.520" style="s2">the depth and the breadth of the</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.520" end="00:20:33.750" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t just be another mountain like</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.260" end="00:20:38.790" style="s2">descartes and the rest of them it would</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.750" end="00:20:41.190" style="s2">be a new range a a new space time for</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.190" end="00:20:44.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s kind of hard to convey not using</p>

<p begin="00:20:44.760" end="00:20:48.240" style="s2">the Heidegger&#39;s way of speaking but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.160" end="00:20:51.559" style="s2">idea of a philosophy of a new beginning</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.240" end="00:20:53.610" style="s2">is supposed to be something like that so</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.559" end="00:20:55.070" style="s2">two more quick comments and I&#39;ll stop</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.610" end="00:20:57.360" style="s2">I&#39;ve gone over time I know</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.070" end="00:20:59.070" style="s2">according to Heidegger which transformed</p>

<p begin="00:21:34.640" end="00:21:39.299" style="s2">what I wanted to say in closing here is</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.300" end="00:25:59.370" style="s2">sign I saw in Corita Heidegger would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.670" end="00:26:01.200" style="s2">what he calls da sign for the formation</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.370" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">of the word is sort of like da has a</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.200" end="00:26:06.840" style="s2">spatial component of there and sign is</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:09.510" style="s2">really the like to be so you are a place</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.840" end="00:26:13.470" style="s2">where being happens or you are the</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.510" end="00:26:14.040" style="s2">localization of being so that sign is</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.470" end="00:26:18.120" style="s2">you got a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.040" end="00:26:19.740" style="s2">don&#39;t say like like that it&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.120" end="00:26:21.270" style="s2">are underneath yourself interpretations</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.740" end="00:26:25.650" style="s2">that can give you access to being itself</p>

<p begin="00:26:25.650" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">helpful that word for so long I do want</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.610" end="00:26:40.620" style="s2">to open up questions to everybody in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:41.850" style="s2">group so just make sure that I just add</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.620" end="00:26:45.180" style="s2">one thing again for the benefit of</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.850" end="00:26:47.820" style="s2">people who may so one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.180" end="00:26:49.560" style="s2">Heidegger um you know defines or expands</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.820" end="00:26:52.530" style="s2">on the notion of a sign in being a time</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.560" end="00:26:54.810" style="s2">is he says who you are is being in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.530" end="00:26:56.850" style="s2">world by being in the world as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.810" end="00:27:00.420" style="s2">composite entity so you are always</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.850" end="00:27:04.110" style="s2">already together with world it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.420" end="00:27:06.570" style="s2">like in here is a subject oh there is</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.110" end="00:27:09.840" style="s2">the world and I must build a bridge from</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.570" end="00:27:11.610" style="s2">my inside to the outside and the whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.840" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">problem of bridge building therefore it</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.610" end="00:27:17.910" style="s2">becomes somatic you see it it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:21.120" style="s2">those things are always given together</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.910" end="00:27:23.490" style="s2">and composite so we are always already</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.120" end="00:27:25.860" style="s2">Co constituted by an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.490" end="00:27:28.110" style="s2">what world is again understanding means</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.860" end="00:27:30.420" style="s2">just initial we may not have turned it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.110" end="00:27:31.860" style="s2">over and over to make it clear but we</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.420" end="00:27:34.800" style="s2">always have some understanding of world</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.860" end="00:27:37.130" style="s2">and of beings in the world so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.800" end="00:27:40.230" style="s2">another way you know that gives a rich</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.130" end="00:27:42.960" style="s2">set of things that you could look at</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.230" end="00:27:45.210" style="s2">like what is being in for example so</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.960" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">he&#39;s Heidegger says a cup okay take a</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.210" end="00:27:49.920" style="s2">bowl you know I put I put a pebble in a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.370" end="00:27:52.050" style="s2">bowl the pebble is in the bowl in one</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.920" end="00:27:54.180" style="s2">way its mode of being in is like being</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.050" end="00:27:56.040" style="s2">inside of a container but the way we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.180" end="00:27:59.730" style="s2">in the world is not as something inside</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.040" end="00:28:02.550" style="s2">a container we&#39;re in the world as Co</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.730" end="00:28:05.040" style="s2">constituted with the world so he begins</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.550" end="00:28:07.860" style="s2">to examine all of these components of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.040" end="00:28:10.160" style="s2">our everyday understanding that we take</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.860" end="00:28:13.110" style="s2">for granted and deepens them to their</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.160" end="00:28:14.730" style="s2">underlying structure through their what</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.110" end="00:28:20.100" style="s2">he calls their existential the</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.730" end="00:28:21.510" style="s2">structures of our being okay yeah great</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.100" end="00:28:25.350" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got some questions coming in</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.510" end="00:28:27.090" style="s2">and so Peter you have a question here</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.350" end="00:28:27.690" style="s2">would you like to ask Michael your</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.090" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.690" end="00:28:33.340" style="s2">so Mikey no I got a double click on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:35.740" style="s2">mimetic mediator drop there mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.340" end="00:28:38.110" style="s2">drop so you have any additional thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.740" end="00:28:41.410" style="s2">on how Heidegger may help with the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.110" end="00:28:44.590" style="s2">mimetic mediation process so I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.410" end="00:28:47.400" style="s2">that if if he&#39;s right that somehow the</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.590" end="00:28:49.750" style="s2">basic concepts or units of analysis are</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.400" end="00:28:51.220" style="s2">modes of die science itself</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.750" end="00:28:54.070" style="s2">interpretation or modes of some more</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.220" end="00:28:55.750" style="s2">fundamental underlying you see so if if</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.070" end="00:28:57.820" style="s2">we were to treat the high daguerreian</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.750" end="00:29:00.220" style="s2">alternative as one of a number of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.820" end="00:29:01.570" style="s2">memetic tribes which it could be you</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.220" end="00:29:03.670" style="s2">know at some extent could be the height</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.570" end="00:29:05.980" style="s2">against whose yeah on and on about being</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.670" end="00:29:07.300" style="s2">you know and they ignore race or</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.980" end="00:29:09.340" style="s2">whatever else or you know however you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.300" end="00:29:12.850" style="s2">might set them alongside the others that</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.340" end="00:29:15.640" style="s2">is probably something to that but if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.850" end="00:29:17.050" style="s2">also were to take you know put all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.640" end="00:29:19.140" style="s2">them in medic tribes horizontally for</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.050" end="00:29:21.910" style="s2">example in your imagination right and</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.140" end="00:29:25.150" style="s2">with lions going down to this da sign</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.910" end="00:29:27.370" style="s2">and sure what is the what existential</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.150" end="00:29:30.430" style="s2">structures that Heidegger has identified</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.370" end="00:29:32.880" style="s2">like moans of authenticity modes of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.430" end="00:29:35.290" style="s2">inauthenticity modes of temporality</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.880" end="00:29:38.260" style="s2">projections of past present and future</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.290" end="00:29:40.930" style="s2">you know what is decided on as the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.260" end="00:29:42.340" style="s2">existential moment which I think did you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.930" end="00:29:44.470" style="s2">have a talk somehow having to do with</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.340" end="00:29:45.850" style="s2">different modes of time earlier in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.470" end="00:29:49.780" style="s2">day but if we take that down to</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.850" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">Heidegger&#39;s methodological tools I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.780" end="00:29:56.980" style="s2">we would be able to say to each of</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:58.540" style="s2">memetic tribes how and basically</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.980" end="00:30:01.900" style="s2">remember he comes a lot of the times</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.540" end="00:30:04.090" style="s2">he&#39;s getting to the foundation by asking</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.900" end="00:30:05.830" style="s2">the right kinds of questions so he shows</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.090" end="00:30:10.300" style="s2">us for example to his own contemporaries</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.830" end="00:30:13.660" style="s2">that both the Communists and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.300" end="00:30:16.780" style="s2">liberals and the Nazis and Christians</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.660" end="00:30:18.010" style="s2">you know each have presupposed some</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.780" end="00:30:20.500" style="s2">basic concept that they themselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.010" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">cannot account for and somehow there may</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.500" end="00:30:24.580" style="s2">be a potential such Socratic type</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:27.160" style="s2">potential to lead each of the mimetic</p>

<p begin="00:30:30.430" end="00:30:33.610" style="s2">necessarily from the point of view of</p>

<p begin="00:30:33.610" end="00:30:38.140" style="s2">but from a methodological II you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.620" end="00:30:40.540" style="s2">triangulated position one dimension</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.140" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">below so that was my intuition like I</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.540" end="00:30:43.150" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:45.460" style="s2">he&#39;s doing something similar in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.150" end="00:30:47.350" style="s2">with his own alternatives by showing</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.460" end="00:30:48.640" style="s2">that they share a route and not just by</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.350" end="00:30:52.030" style="s2">showing it but by giving methodological</p>

<p begin="00:30:52.030" end="00:30:54.670" style="s2">and deconstruction and again</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.710" end="00:30:56.920" style="s2">deconstruction has the positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.670" end="00:30:58.600" style="s2">significance of bringing to light what</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.920" end="00:31:00.370" style="s2">the foot what the guiding horizons are</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.600" end="00:31:03.100" style="s2">so that chart the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.370" end="00:31:05.470" style="s2">Tribes chart is very helpful I think in</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.100" end="00:31:08.260" style="s2">indicating like the key players the key</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.470" end="00:31:10.750" style="s2">concepts some key notions right what</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.260" end="00:31:14.590" style="s2">even uh even like their bumper sticker</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.750" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">slogans but as I say if we can bring all</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.590" end="00:31:18.220" style="s2">of that down to the existential zuv</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:19.480" style="s2">design and show them as modes of</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.220" end="00:31:22.690" style="s2">interpretation it just seemed to me like</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.480" end="00:31:25.720" style="s2">there could be something there sparking</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.690" end="00:31:28.150" style="s2">a lot of thoughts the other question I</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.720" end="00:31:30.340" style="s2">had to pivot to Dugan Hey</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.150" end="00:31:34.090" style="s2">another Dugan drop and then just leave</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.340" end="00:31:35.170" style="s2">it off so what the yeah you said he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.090" end="00:31:39.240" style="s2">the only one who&#39;s taking up this</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.170" end="00:31:41.560" style="s2">process yeah as far as I know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.240" end="00:31:42.670" style="s2">did write on his topic for my</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.560" end="00:31:43.840" style="s2">dissertation at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.670" end="00:31:45.340" style="s2">Toronto it&#39;s gonna be coming over as a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.840" end="00:31:47.200" style="s2">book and I did look to see you know I</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.340" end="00:31:48.250" style="s2">read a lot about high degree in</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.200" end="00:31:50.770" style="s2">political theory high degree in</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.250" end="00:31:52.210" style="s2">political philosophy compares a</p>

<p begin="00:31:52.210" end="00:31:57.760" style="s2">Heidegger so I looked at French the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.130" end="00:31:59.260" style="s2">American German and I think that largely</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.760" end="00:32:01.990" style="s2">the interpretation of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.260" end="00:32:04.870" style="s2">philosophy has stood in the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.990" end="00:32:06.490" style="s2">his involvement with the Nazis which I</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.870" end="00:32:09.630" style="s2">mean you can understand that to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.490" end="00:32:12.460" style="s2">certain extent the concern that I he</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.630" end="00:32:14.950" style="s2">never denounced as openly or as</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.460" end="00:32:18.070" style="s2">vigorously or as publicly as expressly</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.950" end="00:32:20.410" style="s2">or as contritely as his critics and even</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.070" end="00:32:22.090" style="s2">some of his erstwhile supporters might</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.410" end="00:32:24.700" style="s2">have liked you know his involvement with</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.090" end="00:32:27.190" style="s2">the Nazis or his support however I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.700" end="00:32:30.040" style="s2">qualified in my abend for the Nazis so</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.190" end="00:32:31.390" style="s2">somehow I think there was a concern this</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.040" end="00:32:33.540" style="s2">is and this is also interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.390" end="00:32:36.790" style="s2">it shows you the geo cultural</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.540" end="00:32:39.580" style="s2">geopolitical aspect of philosophy you</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.790" end="00:32:43.030" style="s2">see that aspects of heidegger&#39;s thinking</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.580" end="00:32:44.740" style="s2">were left off the table and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.030" end="00:32:46.720" style="s2">even in some cases systematically</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.740" end="00:32:49.240" style="s2">purposefully either repressed they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.720" end="00:32:52.390" style="s2">distorted because it was thought that</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.240" end="00:32:54.909" style="s2">they are how would you put it like</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.390" end="00:32:57.669" style="s2">isomorphic or functionally analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.909" end="00:33:00.190" style="s2">you know support for Nazism so if you</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.669" end="00:33:02.919" style="s2">think that his being historical</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.190" end="00:33:07.749" style="s2">narrative of the trajectory towards</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.919" end="00:33:09.669" style="s2">nihilism is leaves you with no moral</p>

<p begin="00:33:09.669" end="00:33:12.519" style="s2">between let&#39;s say totalitarian and non</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.289" end="00:33:13.210" style="s2">totality and regimes or something</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.519" end="00:33:16.119" style="s2">because he thinks they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.210" end="00:33:17.259" style="s2">totalitarian you know so somehow like</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.119" end="00:33:20.739" style="s2">the friend I let me put it to you this</p>

<p begin="00:33:50.889" end="00:33:55.059" style="s2">that basically all of French philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.080" end="00:33:57.190" style="s2">is completely dominated by Heidegger his</p>

<p begin="00:34:01.330" end="00:34:04.629" style="s2">something like that five steps behind</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.629" end="00:34:11.619" style="s2">there&#39;s Heidegger thinking up on the you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.330" end="00:34:13.059" style="s2">know he&#39;s a giant giant force over many</p>

<p begin="00:34:14.529" end="00:34:18.879" style="s2">it but it&#39;s happened that his influence</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.659" end="00:34:22.389" style="s2">has been mostly either the rejection of</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.879" end="00:34:24.279" style="s2">Heidegger by liberal centrists or the</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.339" end="00:34:34.299" style="s2">they thought were like grand narratives</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.909" end="00:34:35.770" style="s2">or so look if they say there&#39;s no truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.299" end="00:34:37.389" style="s2">with a capital T that&#39;s it kind of</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.299" end="00:34:47.289" style="s2">metaphysics were stable structures that</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.210" end="00:35:00.190" style="s2">Providence or something but no they</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.250" end="00:35:01.809" style="s2">would say these are all contingent they</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.190" end="00:35:03.670" style="s2">can be deconstructed and you can shown</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.309" end="00:35:08.680" style="s2">sense the left category ins accepted his</p>

<p begin="00:35:10.750" end="00:35:14.589" style="s2">destabilized the traditional</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.589" end="00:35:20.890" style="s2">but they left out of the picture this</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.730" end="00:35:22.900" style="s2">massively essential part of his project</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.890" end="00:35:25.270" style="s2">which is the possibility of another</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.900" end="00:35:26.890" style="s2">beginning I mean it&#39;s more nuanced</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.270" end="00:35:28.510" style="s2">to a certain extent and he had some very</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.890" end="00:35:31.690" style="s2">good readers on on the Left including</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.510" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">Derrida but roughly the idea of another</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.690" end="00:35:35.680" style="s2">beginning was not picked up by anybody I</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:39.400" style="s2">think largely for political purposes</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.680" end="00:35:41.650" style="s2">Dugan is writing outside in a way of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.400" end="00:35:43.420" style="s2">context of Western European history</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.650" end="00:35:46.020" style="s2">after the Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.420" end="00:35:50.109" style="s2">he&#39;s less constrained in terms of his</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.020" end="00:35:51.790" style="s2">interpretive resources than the French</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.109" end="00:35:55.240" style="s2">the Americans and the Germans for sure</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.790" end="00:35:56.589" style="s2">so partially the fact that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.240" end="00:35:59.770" style="s2">Russian reception of Heidegger is</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.589" end="00:36:01.780" style="s2">already a factor in why they can think</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.770" end="00:36:04.059" style="s2">about a new beginning all the more so</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.780" end="00:36:05.980" style="s2">when it seems from many geographical and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.059" end="00:36:07.839" style="s2">geopolitical points with you I should</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.980" end="00:36:10.990" style="s2">say geopolitical points of view that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.839" end="00:36:12.309" style="s2">West is indeed going over some sort of</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.309" end="00:36:18.579" style="s2">so and there are things that high-degree</p>

<p begin="00:36:20.710" end="00:36:24.760" style="s2">many many factors that line up and Dugan</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.690" end="00:36:27.460" style="s2">has also intellectual interests that</p>

<p begin="00:36:41.020" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">they basically won&#39;t even acknowledge it</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.119" end="00:36:53.319" style="s2">he&#39;s got great relevance for us in</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.559" end="00:36:54.549" style="s2">giving us access to Heidegger and to the</p>

<p begin="00:36:54.549" end="00:36:59.319" style="s2">potentials and Heidegger&#39;s thought right</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.770" end="00:37:02.530" style="s2">right cool yeah I got a good do good on</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.319" end="00:37:05.020" style="s2">the stone I&#39;m stoked it cool thanks man</p>

<p begin="00:37:05.020" end="00:37:08.770" style="s2">mean I just let me just only just add</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.059" end="00:37:11.530" style="s2">one thing to that makes Dugan</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.770" end="00:37:13.960" style="s2">interesting as a reader of Heidegger so</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.530" end="00:37:15.730" style="s2">he&#39;s not just saying let&#39;s look at you</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.210" end="00:37:22.390" style="s2">read Heidegger but he actually extends</p>

<p begin="00:37:27.569" end="00:37:33.160" style="s2">there&#39;s not just the sign but taking his</p>

<p begin="00:38:00.099" end="00:38:04.839" style="s2">of a multipolar world so he&#39;s taking</p>

<p begin="00:38:06.640" end="00:38:10.980" style="s2">complicit in him and he&#39;s very much</p>

<p begin="00:38:10.980" end="00:38:16.900" style="s2">cross-pollination &#39;he&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.869" end="00:38:18.039" style="s2">combination superimpositions and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.900" end="00:38:23.619" style="s2">pretty interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.039" end="00:38:26.950" style="s2">so excellent great thank you so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.619" end="00:38:31.619" style="s2">gonna move to key if you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.950" end="00:38:31.619" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.609" end="00:38:41.529" style="s2">sure hi thank you for going into detail</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.170" end="00:38:45.220" style="s2">about this topic that was completely new</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.529" end="00:38:49.480" style="s2">to me so I appreciated the way that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.220" end="00:38:51.549" style="s2">explained it um logically and so here is</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.480" end="00:38:54.160" style="s2">the question you kind of brushed over</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.549" end="00:38:55.809" style="s2">regimes of being as curious about what</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.160" end="00:38:57.759" style="s2">you have to say about that but I also</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.809" end="00:39:01.440" style="s2">just wanted to say yay for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.759" end="00:39:05.950" style="s2">existential plural ooh existential</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:06.339" style="s2">plurality of design so um that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.950" end="00:39:09.460" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.339" end="00:39:10.869" style="s2">okay thanks yeah I you know Dugan has</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.460" end="00:39:12.549" style="s2">this passage in the fourth political</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.869" end="00:39:14.619" style="s2">theory where he says I don&#39;t know why it</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.549" end="00:39:16.150" style="s2">is that when I just take a step back for</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.619" end="00:39:18.730" style="s2">a minute the idea of a fourth political</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.150" end="00:39:22.059" style="s2">theory that he has says neither liberal</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.730" end="00:39:23.829" style="s2">nor communist nor fascist therefore</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.059" end="00:39:26.890" style="s2">we&#39;re going to carve out an alternative</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.829" end="00:39:28.990" style="s2">that rejects all of them as inauthentic</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.890" end="00:39:30.759" style="s2">versions of human existence constructed</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.990" end="00:39:32.829" style="s2">on the horizon for modernity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.759" end="00:39:34.210" style="s2">interesting because usually it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.829" end="00:39:36.640" style="s2">know if you&#39;ve encountered this for me</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.210" end="00:39:39.130" style="s2">it was in my face Alfred</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.640" end="00:39:40.920" style="s2">the assumption is that if you are not a</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.130" end="00:39:43.690" style="s2">liberal and you&#39;re not to the left of</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.920" end="00:39:46.270" style="s2">liberalism you can only be a fascist</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.690" end="00:39:48.280" style="s2">there&#39;s no other terminological category</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.270" end="00:39:50.770" style="s2">now things have become I probably more</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.280" end="00:39:52.809" style="s2">complex to a certain extent maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.770" end="00:39:55.210" style="s2">especially after Trump&#39;s victory where</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.809" end="00:39:57.579" style="s2">all of these other phenomena had to be</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.210" end="00:40:01.079" style="s2">accounted for somehow but Dugan marks of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.579" end="00:40:04.539" style="s2">this this fourth political theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.079" end="00:40:06.579" style="s2">territory and when he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.539" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">this existential multiple see of that</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.579" end="00:40:12.250" style="s2">side it&#39;s it&#39;s of a piece in that theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.420" style="s2">and he writes in the book called the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.250" end="00:40:14.589" style="s2">fourth local theory when people hear</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.420" end="00:40:16.119" style="s2">about it I&#39;m surprised that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.589" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">open a bottle of champagne and celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.119" end="00:40:19.000" style="s2">because the possibilities are so</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:21.039" style="s2">exciting so that&#39;s when I hear the yay</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.000" end="00:40:23.020" style="s2">for existential plurality I hear</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.039" end="00:40:24.809" style="s2">excitement about possible ways of</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.020" end="00:40:27.640" style="s2">thinking that may not necessarily be</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.809" end="00:40:28.960" style="s2">customary or obvious where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.640" end="00:40:31.180" style="s2">already predict what all the outcomes</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.960" end="00:40:32.230" style="s2">will be so I share that I share the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.180" end="00:40:35.470" style="s2">excitement for the possibilities of</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.230" end="00:40:39.099" style="s2">thinking as far as the regime&#39;s of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.470" end="00:40:40.779" style="s2">so I wanted to have again strokes on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.099" end="00:40:42.910" style="s2">record because he&#39;s a helpful corrective</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.779" end="00:40:46.329" style="s2">to Heidegger in some way but the basic</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.910" end="00:40:48.369" style="s2">analogy was that a regime of being would</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.329" end="00:40:50.470" style="s2">be like a stage in what Heidegger called</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.369" end="00:40:53.410" style="s2">the history of being a phase and era and</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.470" end="00:40:55.210" style="s2">epoch where being had been there had</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.410" end="00:40:58.240" style="s2">been some essential transformation in</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.210" end="00:41:01.210" style="s2">our understanding of being and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.240" end="00:41:03.400" style="s2">ourselves are interpreted as a flipside</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.210" end="00:41:07.089" style="s2">of that understanding of being so for</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.400" end="00:41:10.089" style="s2">example this is uh you know he would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.089" end="00:41:11.470" style="s2">that when modern subjectivity was</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.089" end="00:41:12.730" style="s2">constituted in the philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.470" end="00:41:14.289" style="s2">Descartes and we don&#39;t have to go</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.730" end="00:41:16.150" style="s2">obviously into the details of how that</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.289" end="00:41:18.940" style="s2">happened it&#39;s not just the new</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.150" end="00:41:20.829" style="s2">understanding of being which it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.940" end="00:41:24.670" style="s2">also a new understanding of human being</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.829" end="00:41:26.230" style="s2">so my analogy was just like in Plato as</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.670" end="00:41:28.809" style="s2">brought out by strokes but also in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.230" end="00:41:31.240" style="s2">Aristotle the political regimes produce</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.809" end="00:41:33.609" style="s2">a political anthropological type like</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.240" end="00:41:35.170" style="s2">Liberal Democratic type for the Liberal</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.609" end="00:41:36.640" style="s2">Democratic regimes soviet-type through</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.170" end="00:41:39.730" style="s2">the Soviet regime fascist fight for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.640" end="00:41:42.490" style="s2">fascist regime and so on so on collage</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.730" end="00:41:43.930" style="s2">eclis there&#39;s like the will to power and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.490" end="00:41:45.849" style="s2">the anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.930" end="00:41:49.930" style="s2">version of the will to power there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.849" end="00:41:52.150" style="s2">mathematical rationality and the as</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.930" end="00:41:53.650" style="s2">definition of being but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.150" end="00:41:55.690" style="s2">also the mathematically rational human</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.650" end="00:41:58.300" style="s2">being you know so that&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.690" end="00:41:59.050" style="s2">regimes of being that there&#39;s this two</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.300" end="00:42:02.350" style="s2">sides of the coin</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.050" end="00:42:03.550" style="s2">how we interpret being as such shines a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.350" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2">light on how we interpret the human</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.550" end="00:42:07.690" style="s2">being and if there&#39;s a history to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:10.120" style="s2">as Heidegger claimed and if that history</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.690" end="00:42:12.790" style="s2">is not just arbitrary but actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.120" end="00:42:14.710" style="s2">represents a falling away from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.790" end="00:42:17.920" style="s2">original experience of being or an</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.710" end="00:42:20.500" style="s2">alienation of being or forgetting a</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.920" end="00:42:21.760" style="s2">being then it&#39;s very important and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.500" end="00:42:23.560" style="s2">you can say that you know Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.760" end="00:42:25.450" style="s2">observation that the last man</p>

<p begin="00:42:48.520" end="00:42:51.580" style="s2">another beginning then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.870" end="00:42:53.800" style="s2">going to be the political anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.580" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">of another beginning and Duggan&#39;s worked</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.800" end="00:42:57.160" style="s2">on that a little bit I have some</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:42:58.900" style="s2">thoughts mostly just following his</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.160" end="00:43:01.090" style="s2">experiments and not for now but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.900" end="00:43:04.980" style="s2">really what I mean by regimes of regimes</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.090" end="00:43:04.980" style="s2">of being could you go into that then</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.160" end="00:43:13.000" style="s2">that&#39;s okay well into the anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.550" end="00:43:14.560" style="s2">of another beginning or so I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.000" end="00:43:17.020" style="s2">starting this the starting point if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.560" end="00:43:20.200" style="s2">follow which is follow Heidegger here</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.020" end="00:43:21.490" style="s2">would be let&#39;s begin with science so</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.200" end="00:43:24.310" style="s2">weird again we&#39;re no longer talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.490" end="00:43:26.230" style="s2">about the individual or the community</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.310" end="00:43:27.460" style="s2">that&#39;s a false dichotomy okay in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.230" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">sense cuz that sign you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.460" end="00:43:30.940" style="s2">interpret one way or another yet or</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:32.800" style="s2">about the race or about the nation or</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.940" end="00:43:35.110" style="s2">with the state or conscious spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.800" end="00:43:37.030" style="s2">rise on all of the potential things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.110" end="00:43:38.410" style="s2">you can interpret start with a sign and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.030" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">we would follow Heidegger in his</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.410" end="00:43:45.070" style="s2">existential analysis where he says okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:46.600" style="s2">so we are being being in the world so we</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.070" end="00:43:48.430" style="s2">have a specific mode of being in you</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.600" end="00:43:50.470" style="s2">have a specific mode of being with being</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.430" end="00:43:52.930" style="s2">with each other being with others right</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.470" end="00:43:56.290" style="s2">and our being is also as he puts it</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.930" end="00:43:57.970" style="s2">always already ahead of itself caring</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.290" end="00:43:59.710" style="s2">for things in the world so this defines</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.970" end="00:44:01.820" style="s2">our structure it&#39;s not just something we</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.710" end="00:44:04.550" style="s2">do sometimes not all the times</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.820" end="00:44:07.390" style="s2">to be the being that we are is always</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.550" end="00:44:10.280" style="s2">already to be ahead of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.390" end="00:44:13.460" style="s2">projecting having projects and to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.280" end="00:44:16.700" style="s2">been thrown into existence together with</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.460" end="00:44:19.610" style="s2">the world so Dugan for example he has</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.700" end="00:44:20.810" style="s2">has a lecture on design politics where</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.610" end="00:44:23.200" style="s2">first you presents</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.810" end="00:44:26.540" style="s2">you could stay the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.200" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">Neoplatonic version of politics as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.540" end="00:44:33.740" style="s2">reflection of the city and speech the</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.880" end="00:44:36.770" style="s2">perfect City as imagined by the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.740" end="00:44:39.830" style="s2">philosopher let&#39;s say and no that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.770" end="00:44:41.570" style="s2">accurate but basically the Platonic city</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.830" end="00:44:44.510" style="s2">that&#39;s built on the model of excellence</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.570" end="00:44:46.910" style="s2">from the top down and then a Haida</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.510" end="00:44:50.000" style="s2">garyun city that&#39;s built on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.910" end="00:44:52.580" style="s2">existential foundation from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.000" end="00:44:54.770" style="s2">up and he sort of does this mapping of</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.580" end="00:44:56.330" style="s2">one on to the other you know in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.770" end="00:44:58.310" style="s2">how they see the future whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.330" end="00:45:00.370" style="s2">open or not and all of that so it would</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.310" end="00:45:03.230" style="s2">require getting into some methodological</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.370" end="00:45:07.910" style="s2">nuance of terminology illogical and so</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.230" end="00:45:10.130" style="s2">on but even how we think about space so</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.910" end="00:45:11.990" style="s2">about how we think about our about</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.130" end="00:45:14.360" style="s2">spaciality you know about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.990" end="00:45:16.670" style="s2">relationship between language existence</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.360" end="00:45:21.500" style="s2">and territory all of that basically</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.670" end="00:45:24.170" style="s2">Heidegger we fashions all of that for us</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.500" end="00:45:25.930" style="s2">or to use Danna to use maybe a image</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.170" end="00:45:29.390" style="s2">that may be familiar to you from</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.930" end="00:45:31.070" style="s2">philosophy Plato&#39;s Republic where you</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.390" end="00:45:32.810" style="s2">have the person who&#39;s in the cave he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.070" end="00:45:34.190" style="s2">chained you can&#39;t turn his head he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:45:35.720" end="00:45:39.290" style="s2">they are shadows he just treats them as</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.760" style="s2">reality it&#39;s only once he&#39;s seen</p>

<p begin="00:45:40.760" end="00:45:46.340" style="s2">shadows well everything looks different</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.520" end="00:45:48.140" style="s2">when in the spot where you are you</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.340" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">accomplish a revolution of your soul</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.140" end="00:45:51.410" style="s2">because when you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.520" end="00:45:54.080" style="s2">shadows that&#39;s one mode of existence</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.410" end="00:45:56.450" style="s2">when you have performed a revolution of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.080" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">your soul that&#39;s another mode of</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.450" end="00:46:00.050" style="s2">existence in other words when you</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">undergo the turning around that takes</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.050" end="00:46:05.750" style="s2">you from what is ordinary and everyday</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:07.490" style="s2">and customary to the possibility of a</p>

<p begin="00:46:07.490" end="00:46:11.240" style="s2">everything changes and it&#39;s similar in</p>

<p begin="00:46:27.079" end="00:46:33.319" style="s2">word about this if you say nietzsche has</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.810" end="00:46:35.450" style="s2">been relevant to political practice to a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.319" end="00:46:38.150" style="s2">certain extent because he offers a non</p>

<p begin="00:46:46.420" end="00:46:52.730" style="s2">completely Roman Lee his understanding</p>

<p begin="00:46:52.730" end="00:46:56.630" style="s2">misses the mark and he doesn&#39;t just say</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.680" end="00:46:59.180" style="s2">it I mean in my view he demonstrates it</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.630" end="00:47:03.640" style="s2">as softly as can be done so what this</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.180" end="00:47:06.170" style="s2">really opens up is a whole realm of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.640" end="00:47:09.380" style="s2">possibilities for interpreting ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.170" end="00:47:11.480" style="s2">and the world therefore also political</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.380" end="00:47:13.250" style="s2">life which is ourselves in the world</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.480" end="00:47:14.569" style="s2">right is a certain specific type of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.250" end="00:47:16.220" style="s2">projection of being with others in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.569" end="00:47:18.230" style="s2">world opens up a whole new set of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.220" end="00:47:20.500" style="s2">possibilities and what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.230" end="00:47:22.430" style="s2">beautiful if I was right about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.500" end="00:47:25.359" style="s2">what&#39;s beautiful about this set of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.430" end="00:47:27.890" style="s2">possibilities is that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.359" end="00:47:29.660" style="s2">constructed on the sands of something</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.890" end="00:47:31.400" style="s2">else that has been constructed on the</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.660" end="00:47:34.069" style="s2">sands of something else that lacks</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.400" end="00:47:36.680" style="s2">foundation and that can just be another</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.069" end="00:47:39.140" style="s2">you know bubble in the foam bubbling up</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.680" end="00:47:40.430" style="s2">and you know popping and going back down</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.140" end="00:47:42.109" style="s2">to so for something like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.430" end="00:47:44.630" style="s2">supposed to be if Heidegger&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.109" end="00:47:50.300" style="s2">about ourselves in our interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.630" end="00:47:52.190" style="s2">being and time this is rootedness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.300" end="00:47:54.440" style="s2">not in up rootedness you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.190" end="00:47:58.810" style="s2">understanding of ourselves as we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.440" end="00:48:00.890" style="s2">truly it would see him and not as we are</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.810" end="00:48:05.569" style="s2">seeing through glass darkly</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.890" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">okay well something like that excellent</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.569" end="00:48:09.950" style="s2">thank you uh Rachel would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:11.930" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.950" end="00:48:15.650" style="s2">oh yeah so I just had another question</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.930" end="00:48:17.000" style="s2">come up after the last discussion but</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.650" end="00:48:19.940" style="s2">I&#39;m curious about design</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.000" end="00:48:21.260" style="s2">if aura would be a modern human</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.940" end="00:48:23.960" style="s2">interpretation of it what are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.260" end="00:48:27.530" style="s2">differences on where essence would come</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.960" end="00:48:28.430" style="s2">so I think that thinking about ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.530" end="00:48:31.340" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.430" end="00:48:33.470" style="s2">of auras in terms of chakras in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.340" end="00:48:36.280" style="s2">terms of the richly elaborated system of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.470" end="00:48:38.990" style="s2">human being available in some systems of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.280" end="00:48:40.700" style="s2">you know of yoga one of the best books I</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.990" end="00:48:42.590" style="s2">read a year or two ago on throughly</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.700" end="00:48:44.750" style="s2">Neoga had very interesting account of</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.590" end="00:48:47.180" style="s2">the chakras and how they configure our</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.750" end="00:48:48.260" style="s2">personalities and all of that I returned</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.180" end="00:48:49.640" style="s2">to my initial comments where I said</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.260" end="00:48:51.200" style="s2">everything should be on the table so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.640" end="00:48:53.210" style="s2">do think that that interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.200" end="00:48:55.700" style="s2">political life and of human life should</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.210" end="00:48:58.160" style="s2">be on the table in fact I mentioned even</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.700" end="00:48:59.420" style="s2">in my dissertation defendants back in</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:01.250" style="s2">the university days that I think there</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.420" end="00:49:03.110" style="s2">should be more political philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.250" end="00:49:04.640" style="s2">the chakras like thing and they let me</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.110" end="00:49:06.350" style="s2">get away with it which I was a little</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.640" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">surprised by but I do think so</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.350" end="00:49:10.850" style="s2">however it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the way that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.820" style="s2">Heidegger would think about that sign</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.850" end="00:49:17.750" style="s2">because it&#39;s still it&#39;s still looking at</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.820" end="00:49:20.180" style="s2">some like mechanical or organic or</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.750" end="00:49:22.940" style="s2">biological or psychobiological you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.180" end="00:49:26.150" style="s2">or even however you put it it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.940" end="00:49:28.580" style="s2">for example if you say that it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.150" end="00:49:30.170" style="s2">still is in the realm it&#39;s the one</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.580" end="00:49:32.360" style="s2">interpretation of ourselves taken from</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.170" end="00:49:34.700" style="s2">the realm of beings and not from being</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.360" end="00:49:36.950" style="s2">as such so he&#39;s really not looking for</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.700" end="00:49:39.530" style="s2">any like you know this is your subtle</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.950" end="00:49:42.290" style="s2">body type interpretation right</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.530" end="00:49:43.490" style="s2">and those marbles can get complicated</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.290" end="00:49:46.340" style="s2">and they&#39;re very interesting like I said</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.490" end="00:49:49.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s different it&#39;s you could ask</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.340" end="00:49:51.770" style="s2">about the astral body you can ask about</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.340" end="00:49:53.120" style="s2">the being itself of the astral body so</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.770" end="00:49:54.320" style="s2">there you already see a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.120" end="00:49:57.470" style="s2">right between the interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.320" end="00:49:59.690" style="s2">ourselves as or astral body shocker and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.470" end="00:50:01.550" style="s2">so on and the domain that asks about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.690" end="00:50:04.220" style="s2">being of that so his emphasis is really</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.550" end="00:50:06.680" style="s2">on how do we constitute an understanding</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.220" end="00:50:08.990" style="s2">of the being as such of anything whether</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.680" end="00:50:11.870" style="s2">it&#39;s you know the our neuronal activity</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.990" end="00:50:16.340" style="s2">our or ik activity our psychic activity</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.870" end="00:50:18.470" style="s2">our you know gastronomic activity right</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.340" end="00:50:19.850" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want to reduce interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.470" end="00:50:22.490" style="s2">of the human being to any one of those</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.850" end="00:50:24.290" style="s2">regions or slices however important is</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.490" end="00:50:25.970" style="s2">and he doesn&#39;t deny as you have to eat</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.290" end="00:50:29.270" style="s2">and walk and you fall in love and all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.970" end="00:50:33.590" style="s2">that but nevertheless he thinks what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.270" end="00:50:35.930" style="s2">most fundamental and applied by all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.590" end="00:50:38.120" style="s2">these is that somehow we think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.930" end="00:50:40.220" style="s2">them that they are and take their being</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.120" end="00:50:42.260" style="s2">for granted they&#39;re forced and in some</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.220" end="00:50:43.730" style="s2">pre understood notion of being</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.260" end="00:50:45.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s the domain that he wants to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.730" end="00:50:49.490" style="s2">clarify it so you could you I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.920" end="00:50:52.850" style="s2">imagine you know some in some distant</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.490" end="00:50:54.680" style="s2">future the question imagine you could</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.850" end="00:50:57.080" style="s2">put on a pair of glasses and see a</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.680" end="00:50:58.550" style="s2">person&#39;s aura and see their chakras how</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.080" end="00:51:00.470" style="s2">they&#39;re spinning how they look what</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.550" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">color they are other inner interacting</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.470" end="00:51:03.620" style="s2">with other people&#39;s chakras it would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.380" style="s2">genuinely very interesting to me</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.620" end="00:51:09.620" style="s2">personally to know how does self</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.380" end="00:51:12.710" style="s2">interpretation of the regime&#39;s of being</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.620" end="00:51:14.900" style="s2">and human being look from that point of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.710" end="00:51:16.670" style="s2">view you know I think that that&#39;s fair</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.900" end="00:51:19.400" style="s2">to ask and I even have some thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.670" end="00:51:21.770" style="s2">about how that might work but but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.400" end="00:51:24.440" style="s2">not that&#39;s that would be our expansion</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.770" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">of Heidegger&#39;s methodology into a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.440" end="00:51:30.520" style="s2">set of questions and possibilities but</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:33.340" style="s2">it&#39;s not how she interprets that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.520" end="00:51:35.930" style="s2">nice kind of follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.340" end="00:51:40.220" style="s2">okay circle I feel like you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.930" end="00:51:42.350" style="s2">about a my slave genetic occultism sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.220" end="00:51:44.740" style="s2">of like in the realm of someone like</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.350" end="00:51:47.840" style="s2">your other Yaqui but with more of a</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.740" end="00:51:50.060" style="s2">scientific explanation is is that right</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.840" end="00:51:51.530" style="s2">or am i misinterpreting you I still</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.060" end="00:51:53.570" style="s2">think it&#39;s too much on a level of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.530" end="00:51:55.520" style="s2">Heidegger would say beings because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.570" end="00:51:57.560" style="s2">not it&#39;s not genetic in the terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.520" end="00:52:02.780" style="s2">genes and it&#39;s not scientific in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.560" end="00:52:03.890" style="s2">terms of the study of realities or as I</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.780" end="00:52:05.990" style="s2">mean there&#39;s not a better word for doubt</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.890" end="00:52:08.780" style="s2">say than beatings he&#39;s saying all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.990" end="00:52:10.820" style="s2">that take beings as a whole everything</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.780" end="00:52:13.130" style="s2">that that is everything about it that</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.820" end="00:52:16.520" style="s2">you can say that it is whether it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.130" end="00:52:18.740" style="s2">gene or anything else okay he says that</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.520" end="00:52:21.800" style="s2">takes the whole domain of beings as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.740" end="00:52:25.370" style="s2">whole and distinct from beings as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.800" end="00:52:28.310" style="s2">whole is being as such because all of</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.370" end="00:52:30.320" style="s2">these beings they are in being somehow</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.310" end="00:52:31.790" style="s2">that&#39;s the fact that they are in being</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.320" end="00:52:33.020" style="s2">is already distinct from the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.790" end="00:52:36.310" style="s2">they&#39;re beings you see what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.020" end="00:52:41.180" style="s2">so it takes it takes it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.310" end="00:52:43.100" style="s2">okay I can remember very clearly where I</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.180" end="00:52:45.020" style="s2">was and what I was doing and what I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.100" end="00:52:48.200" style="s2">thinking and how the world spun for me</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.020" end="00:52:51.170" style="s2">so to speak the moment when I myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.200" end="00:52:52.850" style="s2">conducted des cartes meditation on First</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.170" end="00:52:54.170" style="s2">Philosophy okay where you doubt</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.850" end="00:52:55.840" style="s2">everything and you get to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.170" end="00:52:58.300" style="s2">unshakable certainty of your</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.840" end="00:53:01.480" style="s2">self it&#39;s not like it&#39;s actually it</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.300" end="00:53:03.010" style="s2">requires like the ice breaks moment or</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.480" end="00:53:07.690" style="s2">the penny drops moment it&#39;s really not</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.010" end="00:53:09.990" style="s2">just it&#39;s a total like initiation sort</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.690" end="00:53:12.520" style="s2">of or transformation or break</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.990" end="00:53:14.440" style="s2">reconfiguration so something like that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.520" end="00:53:16.840" style="s2">think is helpful in getting this</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.440" end="00:53:19.300" style="s2">ontological difference between beings</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.840" end="00:53:23.080" style="s2">and being because I can see you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.300" end="00:53:25.090" style="s2">already tempted to take being into</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.080" end="00:53:28.360" style="s2">beings is it the aura is it the genes</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.090" end="00:53:29.200" style="s2">you know this is it that it&#39;s not any</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.360" end="00:53:31.420" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.200" end="00:53:33.820" style="s2">and it&#39;s not even the totality of things</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.420" end="00:53:38.200" style="s2">it&#39;s this ontological distinction</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.820" end="00:53:40.600" style="s2">between beings and being and all I can</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.200" end="00:53:43.090" style="s2">do is indicate it all Heidegger could do</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.600" end="00:53:46.090" style="s2">is indicated and in his lecture for</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.090" end="00:53:47.350" style="s2">example on Plato&#39;s cave a Ligurian on</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.090" end="00:53:49.780" style="s2">the essence of truth he says at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.350" end="00:53:52.270" style="s2">beginning to his students he says you</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.780" end="00:53:54.070" style="s2">don&#39;t need to be able to speak Greek or</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.270" end="00:53:56.400" style="s2">read Greek you don&#39;t need to have an</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.070" end="00:53:58.390" style="s2">excellent mastery of the tradition of</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.400" end="00:54:01.750" style="s2">philosophy that we&#39;re looking at here</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.390" end="00:54:03.340" style="s2">all that you need at any moment in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.750" end="00:54:06.610" style="s2">lecture and he says this elsewhere - is</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.340" end="00:54:10.090" style="s2">a readiness sort of - on-the-spot</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.610" end="00:54:12.130" style="s2">undergo this conversion experience you</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.090" end="00:54:14.470" style="s2">know so somehow all that I&#39;m reading</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.130" end="00:54:16.180" style="s2">Heidegger and I am I believe this is</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.470" end="00:54:18.760" style="s2">true from his earliest - his latest</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.180" end="00:54:21.160" style="s2">writings reading Heidegger is being</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.760" end="00:54:22.330" style="s2">prepared for a conversion experience but</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.160" end="00:54:23.890" style="s2">it&#39;s a conversion experience of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.330" end="00:54:26.830" style="s2">particular kind it&#39;s not conversion</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.890" end="00:54:28.780" style="s2">experience into one thing or another</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.830" end="00:54:30.850" style="s2">it&#39;s really conversion into this domain</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.780" end="00:54:38.110" style="s2">that&#39;s demarcated by the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.850" end="00:54:42.010" style="s2">between beings and being hmm great it</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.110" end="00:54:44.950" style="s2">was a great place to end may this be the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.010" end="00:54:46.420" style="s2">origin of a kind of new being for the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.950" end="00:54:50.170" style="s2">people here who have been exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.420" end="00:54:52.540" style="s2">Heidegger right now well Michael thank</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.170" end="00:54:54.580" style="s2">you for such a stimulating talk there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.540" end="00:54:55.900" style="s2">so much so much here to dig into and I</p>

<p begin="00:54:59.170" end="00:55:05.050" style="s2">and maybe the possibility space that he</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.230" end="00:55:08.430" style="s2">brings to us in terms of thinking and in</p>
