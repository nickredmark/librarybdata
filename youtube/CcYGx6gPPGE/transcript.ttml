<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:11.219" style="s2">I have to start somewhere and I am lost</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.500" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">stuck on being able to explain this idea</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.219" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">this concept I think can save our planet</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:23.010" style="s2">and humanity but it&#39;s complex and I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:24.590" style="s2">to be able to do it in five minutes and</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.010" end="00:00:31.560" style="s2">explain it and that&#39;s just not possible</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.590" end="00:00:34.469" style="s2">so where I&#39;m at is there and I just need</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.560" end="00:00:36.630" style="s2">to start explaining it so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.469" end="00:00:42.030" style="s2">keep explaining it in five minute videos</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.630" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">until I figure it out so join my channel</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.030" end="00:00:50.610" style="s2">subscribe to my channel join me in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:54.090" style="s2">journey towards saving the world today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.610" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">video is the attempting to explain it I</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:01:04.350" style="s2">think there is a lot of power in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:09.659" style="s2">ownership and in capitalism where the 1%</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.350" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">own half the wealth that&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.659" end="00:01:14.430" style="s2">that&#39;s not capitalism it&#39;s not designed</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:18.119" style="s2">to be efficient it&#39;s not designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.430" end="00:01:21.630" style="s2">sustainable and I mean it has pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.119" end="00:01:25.680" style="s2">it it is designed to be monetarily</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.630" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">sustainable and efficient that the money</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.680" end="00:01:30.810" style="s2">you make but it&#39;s not designed for the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">resources to be sustainable so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.810" end="00:01:34.970" style="s2">little more about the problem which I</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">don&#39;t really want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.970" end="00:01:42.570" style="s2">ownership in communism is everything is</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:44.750" style="s2">owned by the government which</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.570" end="00:01:46.740" style="s2">theoretically is working for the people</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.750" end="00:01:48.600" style="s2">so if we said that it&#39;s owned by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.740" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">people but really it&#39;s not it&#39;s central</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.600" end="00:01:54.890" style="s2">planning and there&#39;s still the people in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">power who have control over everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.890" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">and there&#39;s beautiful things of</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">communism but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:06.210" style="s2">of them I think that we can create a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:08.940" style="s2">world where we the people everyone not</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.210" end="00:02:12.540" style="s2">the 99% not the 1% a hundred percent of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.940" end="00:02:17.939" style="s2">people own what we&#39;ve created together</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.540" end="00:02:21.799" style="s2">and we don&#39;t take it by force we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.939" end="00:02:24.780" style="s2">take it but we just create it together</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.799" end="00:02:29.819" style="s2">through collaboration and cooperation</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.780" end="00:02:32.940" style="s2">and being able to collaborate on</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.819" end="00:02:34.799" style="s2">projects and figure out the problems and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.940" end="00:02:38.190" style="s2">not just leave it up to our governments</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.799" end="00:02:40.230" style="s2">to decide on how we&#39;re gonna solve the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:44.730" style="s2">climate crisis and how we&#39;re gonna not</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.230" end="00:02:46.680" style="s2">go to war constantly we the people have</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.730" end="00:02:48.810" style="s2">those discussions and yes we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.680" end="00:02:50.549" style="s2">power at the moment and that is for one</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.810" end="00:02:52.250" style="s2">person and ten people and a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.549" end="00:02:55.170" style="s2">people different things open up to us</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.250" end="00:02:58.769" style="s2">the one were a million people a billion</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.170" end="00:03:03.150" style="s2">people six billion people we change the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.769" end="00:03:05.069" style="s2">world that way and there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.150" end="00:03:06.959" style="s2">possibility and so many ideas I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.069" end="00:03:09.329" style="s2">here but it can&#39;t be explained in a five</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.959" end="00:03:12.810" style="s2">minute video but we&#39;re able to share</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.329" end="00:03:14.970" style="s2">knowledge and resources we share power</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.810" end="00:03:17.639" style="s2">and when people unite there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.970" end="00:03:19.709" style="s2">they can&#39;t do and I think we have more</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.639" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">in common than we have that separates us</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.709" end="00:03:22.230" style="s2">and there are things that separate us</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:23.970" style="s2">and we&#39;re gonna have to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.230" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">stuff out to live peacefully and allow</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.970" end="00:03:29.819" style="s2">people to be individuals and not be</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:34.379" style="s2">dictated by the mass to do things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.819" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">aren&#39;t um unless they&#39;re unethical that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.379" end="00:03:39.560" style="s2">they hurt other people the environment</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.599" end="00:03:50.760" style="s2">idea but that&#39;s it that we we create</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:54.959" style="s2">everything together and own it all</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.760" end="00:03:56.489" style="s2">together and especially in the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.959" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">I totally get that it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.489" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">cup of tea I&#39;m looking for the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:04.709" style="s2">this excites them or they can see this</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:08.400" style="s2">vision of the future a world with zero</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.709" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">poverty where everyone&#39;s able to live</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">their best life because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:13.199" style="s2">worried about the stress of putting food</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.729" style="s2">on the table and a roof over their head</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.199" end="00:04:17.459" style="s2">that we&#39;re able to solve those problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.729" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">together and it&#39;s not gonna be solved</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:21.810" style="s2">overnight but we have to look at where</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:24.300" style="s2">we are and where we&#39;re gonna be the path</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.810" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">to get there and that means figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.300" end="00:04:27.300" style="s2">how to feed yourself and your family and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:30.349" style="s2">your community in your neighborhood and</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.300" end="00:04:34.740" style="s2">then be able to share that information</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.349" end="00:04:37.289" style="s2">being able to learn permaculture</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.740" end="00:04:38.849" style="s2">together learn how to do vertical bar</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.289" end="00:04:39.870" style="s2">being different solutions are gonna work</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.849" end="00:04:41.430" style="s2">for different people and different</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.870" end="00:04:44.250" style="s2">places on this planet that aren&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.430" end="00:04:47.430" style="s2">work for every where and that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.250" end="00:04:50.450" style="s2">think communism is too uniform and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.430" end="00:04:52.889" style="s2">central ownership leads to corruption</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.450" end="00:04:56.700" style="s2">where when we own it all together and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.889" end="00:04:57.930" style="s2">you can be part of every everything that</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.700" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">means something to you can be part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.930" end="00:05:02.070" style="s2">that discussion as much a part of that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:03.479" style="s2">discussion as you want you can trust the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.070" end="00:05:05.190" style="s2">mass and just kind of step back and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.479" end="00:05:08.180" style="s2">allow other people to to make the</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.190" end="00:05:10.680" style="s2">decisions or you can be your voice and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.180" end="00:05:13.440" style="s2">or give your vote to someone else and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.680" end="00:05:16.529" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s complex the idea I have is</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.440" end="00:05:20.279" style="s2">both simple cuz the idea of that we all</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.529" end="00:05:21.930" style="s2">own everything that we create not just</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.279" end="00:05:25.320" style="s2">everything we don&#39;t just own everything</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.930" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">one day but as we create it we add it to</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.320" end="00:05:31.020" style="s2">this global cooperative there&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:33.090" style="s2">much beauty and potential there and this</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.020" end="00:05:35.969" style="s2">video is now five minutes in 30 seconds</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.090" end="00:05:38.159" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna stop it here and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.969" end="00:05:40.440" style="s2">not tomorrow cuz it&#39;s the weekend but</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.159" end="00:05:42.750" style="s2">it&#39;s on Monday I will be posting another</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.440" end="00:05:46.110" style="s2">video that explains another piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.750" end="00:05:48.409" style="s2">and hopefully the right people and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.110" end="00:05:51.029" style="s2">hopefully the right people will watch it</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.409" end="00:05:52.620" style="s2">when I explain it in the right way at</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.029" end="00:05:56.039" style="s2">the right time the right people will</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.620" end="00:05:56.860" style="s2">come and it&#39;s hard to trust an app when</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.039" end="00:06:01.090" style="s2">I have</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.860" end="00:06:03.610" style="s2">this idea for when I see the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.090" end="00:06:05.669" style="s2">all of the most of that let&#39;s not say</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.610" end="00:06:09.909" style="s2">all of them most of the misery and</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.669" end="00:06:12.219" style="s2">inequality and it&#39;s hard to have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.909" end="00:06:15.189" style="s2">solution and not be able to just poof</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.219" end="00:06:17.139" style="s2">make it happen but this is me making it</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.189" end="00:06:18.759" style="s2">happen from where I am and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.139" end="00:06:20.860" style="s2">capable of doing right now which isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.759" end="00:06:23.830" style="s2">even edited editing a video it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.860" end="00:06:28.919" style="s2">posting it as it is that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.830" end="00:06:28.919" style="s2">and I&#39;ll keep on keep it on thanks</p>
