<p begin="00:18:43.380" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">part of your practice sorry for that bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.290" end="00:18:50.720" style="s2">of disruption there there was a</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.610" end="00:18:55.220" style="s2">technical problem but it&#39;s been resolved</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.720" end="00:18:59.790" style="s2">alright we have time for a few questions</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.220" end="00:19:01.230" style="s2">this is from Andre there are when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.790" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">going through the five stages of the new</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.230" end="00:19:04.320" style="s2">practice I&#39;m supposed to use self</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:05.970" style="s2">talking example I notice there&#39;s a pain</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.320" end="00:19:07.950" style="s2">in my shoulder i reframe it as painting</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.970" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">and so to ask what does my body into</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.950" end="00:19:11.730" style="s2">mine do and then I&#39;m supposed to answer</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:13.380" style="s2">these questions I&#39;m asking to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.730" end="00:19:15.180" style="s2">I could really easily get any stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.380" end="00:19:17.910" style="s2">overanalyzing over stuck in my thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.180" end="00:19:23.580" style="s2">mind so you do need to do the inner</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.910" end="00:19:25.830" style="s2">coaching and that might need some inner</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.580" end="00:19:29.370" style="s2">speech as I said but tree gutters the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.830" end="00:19:32.130" style="s2">raft think about the fact that suppose</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.370" end="00:19:33.720" style="s2">you&#39;re driving along and you notice</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.130" end="00:19:35.610" style="s2">you&#39;re a gas you don&#39;t have to actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.720" end="00:19:38.790" style="s2">say to yourself oh I might have gas you</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.610" end="00:19:40.140" style="s2">can just notice it or you come into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:42.000" style="s2">kitchen and you notice that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.140" end="00:19:43.380" style="s2">chairs is not not that you might say</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.000" end="00:19:45.840" style="s2">that to yourself but you you say that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.380" end="00:19:48.180" style="s2">because you already noticed or think of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.840" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">all of the things that babies and small</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.180" end="00:19:52.350" style="s2">children are capable of learning before</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:55.110" style="s2">they can talk to themselves okay so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.350" end="00:19:57.090" style="s2">have a tremendous capacity so use what</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.110" end="00:19:59.370" style="s2">inner coaching you need but try to keep</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.090" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">it to a minimum maybe just you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.370" end="00:20:06.990" style="s2">maybe just say you know in a body heart</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:09.960" style="s2">mind and then try not to verbalize any</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.990" end="00:20:13.410" style="s2">answers just try to see what new thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.960" end="00:20:16.020" style="s2">comes up in your awareness as you</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.410" end="00:20:17.400" style="s2">articulate those so what you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.020" end="00:20:19.230" style="s2">the inner coaching so there&#39;s some inner</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.400" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">speech but you&#39;re trying to minimize it</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.230" end="00:20:24.690" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to gradually reduce and</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:26.760" style="s2">reduce it so you don&#39;t need it all and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.690" end="00:20:29.370" style="s2">you don&#39;t answer verbally you answer</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.760" end="00:20:31.170" style="s2">observational you answer by seeing what</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.370" end="00:20:33.090" style="s2">is revealed by you</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.170" end="00:20:35.700" style="s2">actually directing your attention that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.090" end="00:20:37.860" style="s2">way but eventually you&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.700" end="00:20:40.080" style="s2">write intentionally direct your intent</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.860" end="00:20:41.610" style="s2">your attention like you do what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.080" end="00:20:43.320" style="s2">doing right now without having to speak</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.610" end="00:20:47.490" style="s2">to yourself you&#39;re not saying oh look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.320" end="00:20:49.320" style="s2">the TV screen okay so yes but you right</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.490" end="00:20:52.110" style="s2">from the very beginning you use frame</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.320" end="00:20:55.140" style="s2">this says I&#39;m using this as minimally as</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.110" end="00:20:57.900" style="s2">I can in order to do the practice and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.140" end="00:21:01.650" style="s2">am not generating verbal responses I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.900" end="00:21:03.920" style="s2">generating observational attention what</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.650" end="00:21:06.350" style="s2">comes out what is new what do I see</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.920" end="00:21:10.680" style="s2">because of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.350" end="00:21:11.850" style="s2">next is Herman Ballack re what are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.680" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">similarities and differences between</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.850" end="00:21:19.020" style="s2">flow and the past metal as we practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:20.280" style="s2">them here so I&#39;m not sure if you when</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.020" end="00:21:21.870" style="s2">you&#39;re referring to flow you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.280" end="00:21:23.700" style="s2">about finding your flow or you talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.870" end="00:21:27.000" style="s2">about the flow phenomena in general I</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.700" end="00:21:30.120" style="s2">would say the flow phenomena in general</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.000" end="00:21:32.100" style="s2">is a state that people universally can</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.120" end="00:21:34.620" style="s2">get into when there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.100" end="00:21:36.390" style="s2">characteristics met when the demands of</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.620" end="00:21:40.080" style="s2">the situation slightly exceed people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.390" end="00:21:43.080" style="s2">skills when there is clear and tightly</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.080" end="00:21:45.270" style="s2">coupled feedback and when error makes a</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.080" end="00:21:48.330" style="s2">difference and we&#39;re trying when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.270" end="00:21:50.370" style="s2">trying to find flow in our breathing</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.330" end="00:21:52.050" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is trying to set up</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.370" end="00:21:54.120" style="s2">those kinds of conditions so we get into</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.050" end="00:21:57.920" style="s2">a flow state because the closed state is</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.120" end="00:21:59.940" style="s2">one of optimal attention absorption and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.920" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">engagement is how we get coupled</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.940" end="00:22:05.340" style="s2">interesa how we get coupled in a dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:07.050" style="s2">fashion to an unfolding reality we want</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.340" end="00:22:10.440" style="s2">to cultivate that skill so we can bring</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.050" end="00:22:15.120" style="s2">it into our life in general so in</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.440" end="00:22:18.300" style="s2">general the pass on ax is much more</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.120" end="00:22:20.580" style="s2">focused on coordinating a kind of</p>

<p begin="00:27:20.470" end="00:27:24.190" style="s2">that you want employ your dose but if</p>

<p begin="00:27:24.190" end="00:27:28.539" style="s2">mouth because your nose keeps stuffing</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.499" end="00:27:30.369" style="s2">up now what you do is you putting it wet</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.539" end="00:27:32.700" style="s2">your tongue and put your tongue on your</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.369" end="00:27:35.740" style="s2">palate where you would say it&#39;s like dog</p>

<p begin="00:27:35.740" end="00:27:39.789" style="s2">over your tongue and kind of keep your</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.509" end="00:27:41.259" style="s2">tongue as moist as possible because that</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.789" end="00:27:46.499" style="s2">way you could moisten the air coming in</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.259" end="00:27:48.940" style="s2">and still get to any breathing cipriani</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.499" end="00:27:50.679" style="s2">you said yesterday I think that you want</p>

<p begin="00:27:56.009" end="00:28:01.149" style="s2">the goal of this practice is not to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.509" end="00:28:04.210" style="s2">achieve contentedness because very often</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.149" end="00:28:06.549" style="s2">contentedness is not appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.210" end="00:28:08.379" style="s2">so instead what&#39;s being sawn up there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.549" end="00:28:10.629" style="s2">not a sense of connected contentedness</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.379" end="00:28:13.029" style="s2">but what&#39;s called equanimity equanimity</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.629" end="00:28:16.389" style="s2">is the ability to remain centered and</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.029" end="00:28:21.490" style="s2">rooted and flowing in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.389" end="00:28:22.990" style="s2">because you are appropriately in contact</p>

<p begin="00:28:26.830" end="00:28:32.169" style="s2">and conception and so we&#39;re not trying</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.649" end="00:28:34.779" style="s2">to be content sometimes the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.169" end="00:28:36.730" style="s2">thing to be is to be as all set is to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.779" end="00:28:40.720" style="s2">angry sometimes the appropriate thing to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.730" end="00:28:45.129" style="s2">be is to be sad right that the point is</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.720" end="00:28:48.129" style="s2">again not to deify or demonize any state</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.129" end="00:28:50.789" style="s2">or faculty but instead the thing that we</p>
