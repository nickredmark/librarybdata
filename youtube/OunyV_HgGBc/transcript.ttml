<p begin="00:00:12.240" end="00:00:14.840" style="s2">because what you&#39;re seeing is the reality instead of the map</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.330" end="00:00:18.200" style="s2">you&#39;re gaining access to the real information that&#39;s in the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.200" end="00:00:21.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not prepackaged information, because that can be false</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.800" end="00:00:24.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the real information flowing out from the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.760" end="00:00:28.680" style="s2">and if you pay attention to that, it will help you move towards the goals</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.680" end="00:00:33.880" style="s2">that you&#39;ve already established for yourself as a good citizen, that are part of the inbuilt value structure</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.880" end="00:00:38.060" style="s2">that you&#39;ve adopted. But at the same time it will do something else it will lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.080" end="00:00:44.260" style="s2">transform the nature of those goals because as you pursue the thing that guides your interest and</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.260" end="00:00:51.080" style="s2">more and more information is revealed then by absorbing that Information which is learning essentially</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.620" end="00:00:56.980" style="s2">you build yourself into a different person a stronger and more Informed person and a more</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:02.040" style="s2">intact person a person with more integrity and with more strength and with more direction</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.040" end="00:01:06.520" style="s2">and at the same time you differentiate your map and so you&#39;re living more and more in the real world</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.520" end="00:01:10.700" style="s2">so as you approach your specific goal even if it&#39;s a culturally conditioned goal</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.700" end="00:01:15.760" style="s2">the learning that you do along the way transforms you and it transforms the nature of your goal.</p>
