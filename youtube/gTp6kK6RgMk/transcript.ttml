<p begin="00:00:01.560" end="00:00:06.010" style="s2">so today the book that I want to share</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.180" end="00:00:08.980" style="s2">with you that can help you be a better</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.010" end="00:00:11.230" style="s2">culture designers this one media virus</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.980" end="00:00:13.209" style="s2">by Douglas rushkoff now this book came</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.230" end="00:00:15.699" style="s2">out in the early 90s but it&#39;s still very</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.209" end="00:00:18.250" style="s2">relevant today because it helps us</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.699" end="00:00:21.280" style="s2">better understand the way that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.250" end="00:00:24.730" style="s2">patterns can arise from and spread</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.280" end="00:00:26.860" style="s2">across media communication systems so</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.730" end="00:00:29.610" style="s2">specifically what Doug rushkoff does in</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.860" end="00:00:32.439" style="s2">media virus is he explores the way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.610" end="00:00:34.210" style="s2">ideas can become what are called memes</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.439" end="00:00:35.560" style="s2">which is basically structured</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.210" end="00:00:37.990" style="s2">information that can spread from one</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.560" end="00:00:40.600" style="s2">person to another and then can become</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.990" end="00:00:43.270" style="s2">stereotypical stories or behaviors that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.600" end="00:00:45.640" style="s2">go viral or spread the way that a virus</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.270" end="00:00:47.260" style="s2">does as an epidemic now in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.640" end="00:00:50.320" style="s2">biological sense the same can happen</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.260" end="00:00:52.390" style="s2">with media information in communications</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.320" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">across the society so one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.390" end="00:00:56.170" style="s2">about this book that is so important for</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:00:58.870" style="s2">culture designers is that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.170" end="00:01:01.210" style="s2">understand how perceptions are shaped</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.870" end="00:01:02.800" style="s2">and how shared narratives and shared</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.210" end="00:01:05.440" style="s2">language are formed within communities</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.800" end="00:01:07.930" style="s2">so that we can work with the media</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.440" end="00:01:10.090" style="s2">content that is able to spread to help</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.930" end="00:01:12.070" style="s2">the ideas that are needed to spread and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.090" end="00:01:14.350" style="s2">succeed so what I love about this book</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.070" end="00:01:16.960" style="s2">is that Doug rushkoff takes the approach</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.350" end="00:01:20.170" style="s2">of being a technologist and media</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:23.830" style="s2">analyst so he looks at the way that the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.170" end="00:01:26.530" style="s2">social dimension of new technology can</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.830" end="00:01:29.350" style="s2">help shape how information is spread now</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.530" end="00:01:30.880" style="s2">the book being written in the 1990s does</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.350" end="00:01:35.380" style="s2">use a lot of examples that are a bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.880" end="00:01:37.210" style="s2">older so it looks at things like the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.380" end="00:01:40.510" style="s2">beating of rodney king in los angeles</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.210" end="00:01:42.400" style="s2">that led to the LA riots and the media</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.510" end="00:01:44.830" style="s2">echo chamber that enabled had to happen</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.400" end="00:01:46.810" style="s2">how that story kind of took control and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.830" end="00:01:48.880" style="s2">spread in a way that no one quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.810" end="00:01:51.130" style="s2">understood was going to happen I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.880" end="00:01:53.770" style="s2">quite surprising when it did or it could</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.130" end="00:01:57.659" style="s2">be other things like um he looks at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.770" end="00:02:01.900" style="s2">Simpsons and other popular pop culture</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.659" end="00:02:03.790" style="s2">TV shows that were able to encapsulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.900" end="00:02:06.340" style="s2">ideas and spread them from one genre to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.790" end="00:02:08.200" style="s2">another and what makes this book so</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.340" end="00:02:11.230" style="s2">important for culture designers is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.200" end="00:02:13.989" style="s2">we really need to understand how media</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.230" end="00:02:14.230" style="s2">propagation happens how an idea can get</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.989" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.230" end="00:02:19.930" style="s2">to the cultural space of a discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:22.150" style="s2">then rise to prominence or spread widely</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.930" end="00:02:24.400" style="s2">enough that it becomes normalized and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.150" end="00:02:26.709" style="s2">then becomes a part of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.400" end="00:02:28.540" style="s2">lexicon of communication now culture</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.709" end="00:02:30.670" style="s2">design in many ways is about figuring</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.540" end="00:02:32.680" style="s2">out how to spread information more</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.670" end="00:02:34.510" style="s2">effectively so that&#39;s exactly what this</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.680" end="00:02:37.209" style="s2">is about and so for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.510" end="00:02:39.459" style="s2">want to understand the way that media</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.209" end="00:02:41.790" style="s2">content is created and propagated and</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.459" end="00:02:44.620" style="s2">how culture itself is actually</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.790" end="00:02:47.049" style="s2">constituted by this process of sharing</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.620" end="00:02:49.360" style="s2">media information then Doug rush coughs</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.049" end="00:02:51.099" style="s2">book the media virus is really a must</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.360" end="00:02:53.739" style="s2">read and something that will give you a</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.099" end="00:02:56.620" style="s2">lot of theoretical understanding as well</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.739" end="00:02:58.840" style="s2">as concrete case study examples of how</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.620" end="00:03:01.329" style="s2">to do both the analysis and the design</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.840" end="00:03:02.920" style="s2">work so there you go go get media virus</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.329" end="00:03:05.349" style="s2">if you want to know how to shape</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.920" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">cultural discourse and the spreading of</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.349" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">ideas</p>
