<p begin="00:02:00.640" end="00:02:03.439" style="s2">i can&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.000" end="00:02:06.159" style="s2">the stuff we wrote and that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.439" end="00:02:07.200" style="s2">accepted just so stupid it&#39;s so funny</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.159" end="00:02:09.679" style="s2">some of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.200" end="00:02:12.800" style="s2">so yeah that was that was i mean it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.679" end="00:02:15.760" style="s2">a it was hard it was really difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.800" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">to learn that stuff kind of in real time</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.760" end="00:02:18.239" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:19.280" style="s2">none of us have a real background in any</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.239" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">of that crap</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.280" end="00:02:22.319" style="s2">and so we had to learn that stuff in</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:24.480" style="s2">real time and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.319" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">face the reality of what it says which</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.480" end="00:02:27.680" style="s2">is depressing when you start to realize</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.280" style="s2">these people actually mean it</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.680" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing to make it as jokes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.280" end="00:02:32.080" style="s2">another thing when these you realize</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:32.560" style="s2">that the people doing this really mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.080" end="00:02:34.239" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.560" end="00:02:36.400" style="s2">and then of course we tried to make them</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.239" end="00:02:37.840" style="s2">funny so there was a lot of laughing i</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.400" end="00:02:40.000" style="s2">mean i remember getting on the phone and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.840" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">talking either with peter or with helen</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.000" end="00:02:45.360" style="s2">to try to come up with ideas and just</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">laughing ourselves kind of sick</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.360" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">with stuff we might might try to write</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:52.480" style="s2">about it was a good time</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:53.440" style="s2">i just say both humorous and depressing</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.480" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.440" end="00:02:57.599" style="s2">did i recall that you wrote 20 and like</p>

<p begin="00:04:30.720" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">see today</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">in the public sphere it&#39;ll be out at the</p>

<p begin="00:05:54.080" end="00:05:57.280" style="s2">whole lot more fair than i</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">was kind of afraid we were taking some</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.280" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">some swings toward the fences but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.800" end="00:06:03.280" style="s2">like wow this is really fair</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:05.120" style="s2">yeah i was surprised frankly based on</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.280" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">some of the you say on your tweet</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.120" end="00:06:07.600" style="s2">stream right</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">that you were just going to skewer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.600" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2"> on relentlessly but you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:12.319" style="s2">were actually very fair</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">no the goal was actually to give it a</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.319" end="00:06:16.080" style="s2">very scholarly treatment and to explain</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">it to people in a very fair and clear</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.080" end="00:06:19.199" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:20.000" style="s2">twitter&#39;s the arena but you know books</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.199" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">and publications</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.000" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">are another another matter you got to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:24.880" style="s2">more serious uh twitter is good for</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:26.479" style="s2">screwing around</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.880" end="00:06:27.919" style="s2">plus i took the gloves off on twitter</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.479" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">and the path you know they started</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.919" end="00:06:30.960" style="s2">setting cities on fire and saying that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:33.120" style="s2">that&#39;s okay because whiteness is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.960" end="00:06:35.360" style="s2">property and i was like okay gloves off</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.120" end="00:06:37.520" style="s2">but we wrote the book before before they</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.360" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">started setting cities on fire so</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.520" end="00:06:41.039" style="s2">um the gloves were still on a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">when we wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.039" end="00:06:45.120" style="s2">it&#39;s probably good in in the in the long</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">run because it does need to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.120" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">treated fairly so that people will see</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:51.759" style="s2">that we&#39;re not misrepresenting</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:54.479" style="s2">the that they actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.759" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">which is which is so insane that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.479" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">almost impossible to believe that they</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.120" style="s2">really think that</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">and we&#39;ll get into that you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.120" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">actually insane or how the hell is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">that people come to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:05.120" style="s2">horseshit</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.800" style="s2">and do they actually right before we dig</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.120" end="00:07:08.000" style="s2">into the meat of the matter</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.800" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">and i know you do talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.000" end="00:07:12.960" style="s2">throughout the book i think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:14.319" style="s2">useful to lay out the alternative to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.960" end="00:07:16.720" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.319" end="00:07:17.919" style="s2">social justice quote unquote and all</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.720" end="00:07:20.400" style="s2">that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.919" end="00:07:21.840" style="s2">you know what you and helen lay out it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.400" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">kind of interwoven throughout the book</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.840" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">and there&#39;s a strong</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">argument about it at the end is that</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">is the alternative right philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">liberalism and this is from your</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">philosophical liberalism is opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:38.800" style="s2">authoritarian movements of</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">all types be they left-wing right-wing</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.800" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">secular or</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:43.599" style="s2">theocratic why don&#39;t you talk a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">bit about that alternative because you</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.599" end="00:07:47.759" style="s2">know it is true we still do have</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:49.120" style="s2">issues that need to be resolved you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.759" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">there really is still</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.120" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">racism there really still is anti-gay</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:56.960" style="s2">bigotry</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:58.160" style="s2">women have not reached full operational</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.960" end="00:07:59.680" style="s2">equality in the world</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.160" end="00:08:01.840" style="s2">and though in the west we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.680" end="00:08:03.120" style="s2">closer but there&#39;s another way to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.840" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">there rather than this</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.120" end="00:08:06.879" style="s2">homo horse so maybe you could talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:07.919" style="s2">just a little bit about the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.879" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.919" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t fight for increased social</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">justice</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:15.039" style="s2">uncapitalized but the way to do it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.039" end="00:08:19.599" style="s2">liberalism yeah that&#39;s right our</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:22.160" style="s2">argument is ultimately about methods</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.599" end="00:08:23.039" style="s2">uh we care if we have to use big words</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.160" end="00:08:25.840" style="s2">we care about</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.039" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">the approach uh with with regard to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.840" end="00:08:29.919" style="s2">epistemology and ethics</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:31.280" style="s2">and we try to make the sustained case</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.919" end="00:08:33.120" style="s2">that the liberal approach</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.280" end="00:08:34.399" style="s2">in the philosophical sense which is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.120" end="00:08:35.839" style="s2">same philosophy that wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.399" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">declaration of independence in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.839" end="00:08:41.839" style="s2">constitution of the us for example</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">that approach is the best we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.839" end="00:08:46.480" style="s2">for doing epistemology and ethics</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">correctly so social justice is an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.480" end="00:08:48.560" style="s2">and a lot of people don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:50.880" style="s2">this because</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.560" end="00:08:52.720" style="s2">the the freaking movement that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.880" end="00:08:54.000" style="s2">ascendant right now doesn&#39;t want anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.720" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">to know it or doesn&#39;t want anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.000" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">to remember it social justice is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">something that has been of interest</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">to most societies throughout all of</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:03.600" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.519" style="s2">except maybe totalitarian ones it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.600" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">certainly something that has been part</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.519" end="00:09:07.839" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.399" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">say american experiment from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.839" end="00:09:10.880" style="s2">beginning and then that&#39;s also imported</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:12.640" style="s2">through most of</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.880" end="00:09:14.160" style="s2">all of the rest of the advanced</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.640" end="00:09:16.959" style="s2">democracies of the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.160" end="00:09:19.040" style="s2">and so social justice has a as an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.959" end="00:09:20.399" style="s2">just means a fairer more just society</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.040" end="00:09:21.519" style="s2">and then the question becomes how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.399" end="00:09:23.279" style="s2">try to achieve it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.519" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">and what we wanted to try to show people</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.279" end="00:09:26.560" style="s2">is that there are lots of ways there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.240" style="s2">lots of approaches there are religious</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.560" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">ideas about social justice you can go</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.240" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">back to walter rauschenbusch</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">we don&#39;t mention that in the book</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">specifically but you can you can go back</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:36.959" style="s2">to walter rauschenbusch</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">turn of the 20th century and he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.959" end="00:09:40.959" style="s2">trying to push the social gospel from a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">uh baptist perspective so there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.959" end="00:09:45.040" style="s2">religious approaches the term social</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:46.800" style="s2">justice was invented by a jesuit priest</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.040" end="00:09:48.959" style="s2">as a matter of fact so there were there</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.800" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">are religious approaches</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.959" end="00:09:53.600" style="s2">there are liberal approaches obviously</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">that we argue for but there are also</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.600" end="00:09:56.640" style="s2">communist approaches there are socialist</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">approaches there are materialist</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.640" end="00:09:59.519" style="s2">approaches there are</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">lots and lots and lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.519" end="00:10:02.160" style="s2">approaches even some conservative</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">approaches</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">can be seen as trying to establish a</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">more fair society</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">so there are lots of approaches so what</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">we want to try to do is take away the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:13.200" style="s2">illusion</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:15.200" style="s2">that the current movement calling itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.200" end="00:10:16.000" style="s2">social justice is the only way to go</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.200" end="00:10:18.160" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.000" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">it uses a very specific method which is</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">critical theory infused with</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">post-modern epistemology and ethics and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.120" end="00:10:26.720" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">we say no to that we say let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.720" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">other ideas so the liberal method</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:33.200" style="s2">for us is superior as we make in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">case in the last chapter</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.200" end="00:10:36.560" style="s2">because it works because it is a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:38.720" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.560" end="00:10:40.959" style="s2">what it&#39;s accused of being it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.720" end="00:10:42.880" style="s2">actually even necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.959" end="00:10:44.399" style="s2">as much a political philosophy as people</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.880" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">think it is it is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.399" end="00:10:50.959" style="s2">a method of resolving conflicts</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">between people in societies so if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.959" end="00:10:54.160" style="s2">look at capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">what you have is people with property</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.160" end="00:10:58.959" style="s2">rights once those are</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:00.000" style="s2">enshrined that&#39;s a liberal philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.959" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">position is that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.000" end="00:11:04.079" style="s2">have property rights once people have</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">property rights liberalism says well you</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.079" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">can do with your own property what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">want and you can work it out and you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">trade</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">pieces of your property for other pieces</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:13.519" style="s2">of other people&#39;s property</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">and capitalism becomes the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.519" end="00:11:16.160" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">approach or economic approach and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.160" end="00:11:19.440" style="s2">you can look at it in politics well you</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:20.720" style="s2">get your vote everybody else gets their</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.440" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">votes so we&#39;re going to now use a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.720" end="00:11:23.600" style="s2">democratic way to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">authenticate who our leaders are we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.600" end="00:11:27.120" style="s2">not going to rely on the divine right of</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.880" style="s2">kings anymore we&#39;re not going to rely on</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.120" end="00:11:30.480" style="s2">who the warlord was that was able to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.880" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">knock everybody down and they become the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.480" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">leader</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:35.839" style="s2">that&#39;s not how we do we&#39;re going to ask</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:37.680" style="s2">the public and let the public decide and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.839" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">democracy becomes the liberal approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.680" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">to resolving political conflict</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:43.040" style="s2">if it&#39;s all written in the constitution</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:44.880" style="s2">if you want to redress the government</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.040" end="00:11:46.720" style="s2">for your grievances you can petition you</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.880" end="00:11:48.160" style="s2">can peacefully protest you can always</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.720" end="00:11:50.959" style="s2">peacefully assemble these</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.160" end="00:11:51.440" style="s2">first you know these are core amendments</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.959" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.440" end="00:11:55.360" style="s2">core foundational principles of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.519" end="00:11:56.720" style="s2">liberal democracy that works</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.360" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">and then when it comes to understanding</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.720" end="00:11:59.600" style="s2">ideas say if you and i have a different</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.600" end="00:12:02.639" style="s2">and we wanted to say well you say i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">right and and</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.639" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">you know you say you say you&#39;re that</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:07.360" style="s2">you&#39;re right and i say that i&#39;m right</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">and so we both believe that we&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.360" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">we have to have a means of settling that</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:13.519" style="s2">conflict and liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:15.200" style="s2">offers a means it says let&#39;s go ask the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.519" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">world or let&#39;s see who can give the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.200" end="00:12:18.240" style="s2">better</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.200" style="s2">more reasoned argument if we can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.240" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.200" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t say whose feelings are hurt</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:27.839" style="s2">then that&#39;s why it&#39;s so difficult</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">for people to accept because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.839" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">the truth hurts and sometimes life isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">fair</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">and it can be very difficult to accept</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">but the liberal approach to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:39.120" style="s2">making sense of the world is of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">that we can we can still be aware of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.120" end="00:12:41.440" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.000" style="s2">that there are realities of hurting</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.440" end="00:12:45.200" style="s2">people or things being unfair that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.000" end="00:12:47.839" style="s2">don&#39;t want to see</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.200" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">and liberal ethics uphold that but at</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.839" end="00:12:50.560" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:52.320" style="s2">we say look we&#39;re going to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:54.560" style="s2">evidence and the evidence can include</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.320" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">that hurt feelings are bad and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.560" end="00:12:58.160" style="s2">going to look at</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.279" style="s2">the the best arguments and we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.160" end="00:13:00.800" style="s2">just going to give in</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.279" end="00:13:02.959" style="s2">because somebody&#39;s making a demand or</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.800" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">somebody&#39;s claiming offense</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.959" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">or or whatever else we actually have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:07.600" style="s2">make reasoned arguments we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">to appeal to the evidence</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.600" end="00:13:11.040" style="s2">and so we have these different methods</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">to try to resolve</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.040" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">conflicts between individuals that come</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.560" style="s2">up within a society</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:19.279" style="s2">and our case is that if we want a more</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.560" end="00:13:21.600" style="s2">fair more just socially just society</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.279" end="00:13:22.720" style="s2">we need liberalism to keep making the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.600" end="00:13:25.360" style="s2">gains that it&#39;s made</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.720" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">for the past several centuries rather</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.360" end="00:13:27.760" style="s2">than</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">saying oh wow we&#39;re actually achieving</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.760" end="00:13:30.480" style="s2">real progress now so let&#39;s abandon the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:33.120" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.480" end="00:13:34.000" style="s2">that got us there which is what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.120" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">current movement is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.000" end="00:13:37.600" style="s2">asking us to do it wants to throw away</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:40.560" style="s2">liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.600" end="00:13:40.959" style="s2">and use its own radical approach which</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.560" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.959" end="00:13:43.920" style="s2">i mean we don&#39;t get into it deeply in</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">the book but it&#39;s actually known as</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.920" end="00:13:48.160" style="s2">liberationism</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">or liberation philosophy which comes out</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.160" end="00:13:50.480" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:52.560" style="s2">the frankfurt school of uh critical</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.480" end="00:13:55.199" style="s2">theory which is neo-marxism if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.560" end="00:13:56.240" style="s2">if you must know yeah marcus and those</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.199" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2">assholes right</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.240" end="00:14:00.880" style="s2">yeah marcus in particular um you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:02.480" style="s2">you can dip into stuff that adorno</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.880" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">wrote and of course max horkheimer&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:06.000" style="s2">relevant you can dip into these guys</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:08.000" style="s2">but marcusa was actually extremely</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.000" end="00:14:09.279" style="s2">relevant to what we&#39;re seeing today</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.000" end="00:14:11.199" style="s2">a lot of people don&#39;t realize this but</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.279" end="00:14:13.360" style="s2">we all know who these these antifa</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.199" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">assholes are running around and these</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.360" end="00:14:16.720" style="s2">antifa guys</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:18.880" style="s2">well they are basically if you take</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.720" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">herbert marcuso&#39;s philosophy especially</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.880" end="00:14:21.680" style="s2">on repressive tolerance and franz</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:23.519" style="s2">fannin&#39;s ideas</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.680" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">he&#39;s a french psychoanalyst that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.519" end="00:14:27.519" style="s2">studying the uh colonial condition</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:29.040" style="s2">if you take those two people and you mix</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.519" end="00:14:30.880" style="s2">them together you get antifa that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.040" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">it is that&#39;s where their ideas come from</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.880" end="00:14:33.760" style="s2">that&#39;s why they think they&#39;re justified</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">in behaving in the world but the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.760" end="00:14:38.079" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:39.519" style="s2">so marcusa is definitely his presence is</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.079" end="00:14:42.079" style="s2">definitely felt</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.519" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">uh throughout the world and it&#39;s last</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.079" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">time he had a massive following was in</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:47.600" style="s2">the mid-1960s he wrote repressive</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.399" style="s2">tolerance in 1965</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.600" end="00:14:52.480" style="s2">lo and behold 1967 and 1968 we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.399" end="00:14:54.320" style="s2">massive riots including race riots</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.480" end="00:14:55.519" style="s2">that end up you know wrecking american</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.320" end="00:14:58.800" style="s2">cities for example</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.519" end="00:15:01.120" style="s2">even detroit hasn&#39;t even recovered from</p>

<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:01.759" style="s2">they wish</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">to join groups say religious groups but</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.759" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">those are a matter of their</p>

<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:09.839" style="s2">volition and so they cannot be compelled</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.839" end="00:17:11.360" style="s2">by the power say of the state to have</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.839" end="00:17:12.400" style="s2">certain beliefs and that we call that</p>

<p begin="00:17:12.400" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">and so these views were literally</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">and some of them did better than others</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.840" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">to understand that each person has their</p>

<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:25.760" style="s2">you started to see massive advances in</p>

<p begin="00:19:00.320" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">like that liberalism just showed up on</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:05.919" style="s2">and then bam everything&#39;s liberal</p>

<p begin="00:19:12.799" end="00:19:16.640" style="s2">so it would be ridiculous to think oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:17.840" style="s2">well people thought of liberalism now</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.840" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">and that&#39;s sort of the way the critics</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:24.160" style="s2">and say well look at how how badly it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:20:18.799" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">but that&#39;s the whole point you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:25.440" style="s2">that liberalism actually only works</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s willing to take criticism</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">the ideals got written down all men are</p>

<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">start living up to it with abolition and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.240" style="s2">then later on you hear martin luther</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.720" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">constitution and said where is it if we</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">show us that promise and then people did</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">ten years later they did</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:20.480" style="s2">and then martin luther king stands up in</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:22.159" style="s2">the early 1960s and he says</p>

<p begin="00:21:24.799" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">and a few years later the civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.240" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">act was passed in other words</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">we did we started to live up to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:35.120" style="s2">promise but that promise had to be there</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:35.760" style="s2">it had to be made uh stable and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.120" end="00:21:38.320" style="s2">something to be</p>

<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">is what enabled us to make progress</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">would say so at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.400" end="00:22:18.240" style="s2">look at the 20th century the three big</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.840" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">rather than illiberalism more generally</p>

<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">but in the scope of a book you do have</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">to have</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:19.039" style="s2">something to focus upon and you should</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">we were genuinely expert in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.159" end="00:23:29.039" style="s2">particular aspect of illiberalism the</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.320" end="00:23:36.640" style="s2">we had to talk about our expertise and</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.159" end="00:23:37.760" style="s2">the thesis that we wanted the thesis is</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.640" end="00:23:40.480" style="s2">actually quite narrow</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.760" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">of the book the thesis is that</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.919" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">you know we had to pick a focus and we</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.520" end="00:23:55.840" style="s2">wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:57.679" style="s2">wrote to that focus also our feeling is</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:23:59.200" style="s2">as we we explained and i think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.679" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">introduction to the book but it may be</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.200" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">in the last chapter we</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">we feel like the the left has</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:07.120" style="s2">abandoned its principle of liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:10.240" style="s2">whereas conservatism has</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.120" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">always kind of dithered about its</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.240" end="00:24:15.520" style="s2">commitment to liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:19.279" style="s2">and so we feel as denizens of the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.520" end="00:24:21.200" style="s2">also being relevant but we we feel that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.279" end="00:24:22.880" style="s2">the left in the sense that it has</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.200" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">abandoned what it</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.880" end="00:24:26.240" style="s2">should have been standing for has</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:28.960" style="s2">committed a sin</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.240" end="00:24:30.480" style="s2">that needs to be addressed and in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.960" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">would insist it</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.480" end="00:24:33.760" style="s2">while it&#39;s all complicated in its</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:36.080" style="s2">reciprocal and everything else that</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.760" end="00:24:38.400" style="s2">the stuff from the left is driving a</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.080" end="00:24:39.440" style="s2">great deal of the reactionary side from</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.400" end="00:24:41.440" style="s2">the right</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.440" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">and that if the left cleans its house up</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.440" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">and sanity prevails on the broad left</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:46.400" style="s2">with of course everybody having their</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:48.080" style="s2">lunatic fringe</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.400" end="00:24:50.559" style="s2">that a lot of the tensions of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:50.559" end="00:24:54.799" style="s2">so we we set our sights on the left</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.360" end="00:24:56.559" style="s2">because we&#39;re there because we know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.799" end="00:24:57.840" style="s2">better because we need a specific focus</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.559" end="00:24:59.600" style="s2">and because</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.840" end="00:25:01.600" style="s2">while donald trump for example is an</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.600" end="00:25:03.200" style="s2">enormous irritant and i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.600" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">right wing has been doing a bunch of</p>

<p begin="00:25:11.440" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">is a genuine</p>

<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:18.880" style="s2">exists in the world today</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:21.440" style="s2">also they&#39;ve stolen our academies and as</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.880" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">academics we&#39;re pretty pissed about that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.440" end="00:25:24.559" style="s2">all right you open up the book with</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:26.799" style="s2">talking a fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.559" end="00:25:28.000" style="s2">about the history of post-modernism now</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.799" end="00:25:29.440" style="s2">frankly i think that</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.000" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting to read but i</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.440" end="00:25:32.559" style="s2">don&#39;t want to go into copious detail on</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:34.640" style="s2">it here but</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.559" end="00:25:36.559" style="s2">for our audience give enough of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.640" end="00:25:38.559" style="s2">history of post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.559" end="00:25:40.799" style="s2">to go forward and then we&#39;ll talk a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.559" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">little bit about your two principles and</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.799" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">four themes</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:47.279" style="s2">okay great yeah so post-modernism is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">movement that actually kind of arose in</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.279" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">art and literature</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:51.919" style="s2">maybe the 1940s and it started to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:53.279" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.919" end="00:25:55.840" style="s2">i guess the best way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.279" end="00:25:57.120" style="s2">is i started to question the the rigid</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.840" end="00:25:58.880" style="s2">structure and rules</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.120" end="00:26:00.559" style="s2">that would construct art if you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.880" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">to get into the proper history of it</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.559" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">so you&#39;d see people doing experimental</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">nonsense like taking a book</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">and then taking every noun that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:08.720" style="s2">come across in the book and replacing it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:11.600" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">the the next noun uh in that dictionary</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.600" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">and then trying to extract meaning out</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:16.880" style="s2">of whatever</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:18.640" style="s2">results this is a postmodern art project</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.880" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">on literature for example</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.640" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">or you would see people with music</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:22.880" style="s2">saying oh well you&#39;re supposed to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">this kind of a thing with this</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.880" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">musical scales so we&#39;re going to invert</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.840" style="s2">that so you&#39;d often see people</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.520" style="s2">this is key to the idea inserting</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.840" end="00:26:33.440" style="s2">arbitrary rules</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.520" end="00:26:34.559" style="s2">that would be normally considered out of</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.440" end="00:26:36.400" style="s2">bounds</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.559" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">specifically to point out the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.400" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">rules are arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:44.640" style="s2">and so that&#39;s sort of the the the ethos</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:46.159" style="s2">of post-modern thought that led it to</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.640" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">challenge boundaries and challenge</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.159" end="00:26:50.320" style="s2">expectations</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">so then in the 1960s or really in 1950s</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.320" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">into the 1960s you had this</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:55.840" style="s2">spate of french philosophers who were</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">very caught up in structuralism</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.840" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">as a way of understanding the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">which has been since discredited</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:02.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea essentially that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">language and the way we use language</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.240" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">structures</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:06.960" style="s2">how we think and therefore structures</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">all of society it doesn&#39;t quite work</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.960" end="00:27:10.080" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.919" style="s2">but uh they got very invested in</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.080" end="00:27:14.720" style="s2">studying the way that language</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.919" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">and power are interrelated with one</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.720" end="00:27:17.279" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:18.880" style="s2">and they became very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.279" end="00:27:21.679" style="s2">seeing the way that the culture</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.880" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">is produced through uses of language</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.679" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">representation</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">imagery power and again started to want</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:30.320" style="s2">to show that the rules</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:32.640" style="s2">are a arbitrary and b</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.320" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">that they actually contain the seeds of</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:36.720" style="s2">structural oppressions that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">appear in society so you had big</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.720" end="00:27:40.480" style="s2">thinkers like</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">jack derida the famous post-structural</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.480" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">linguist</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:45.919" style="s2">and you had michel foucault who claimed</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">he was something like a historian</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.919" end="00:27:50.159" style="s2">but what he really did was archaeologies</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:50.720" style="s2">as he called them in genealogies where</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.159" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">he tore</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.720" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">up history to show how thought had</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:58.559" style="s2">kind of big regimes of truth he called</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">them or epistemes</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.559" end="00:28:02.080" style="s2">and these things dictated how people</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:03.520" style="s2">would think and then look how</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.080" end="00:28:05.120" style="s2">wrong they were and look how terrible</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.520" end="00:28:08.399" style="s2">all of these things led to</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.120" end="00:28:10.640" style="s2">you know in in practice and so the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.399" end="00:28:12.480" style="s2">conclusion of these guys would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.640" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">well how could we possibly think that</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.480" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">we&#39;re right now and how could we</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">possibly think that our words have</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:19.679" style="s2">genuine meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.440" style="s2">that anybody can understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.679" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">author can have intent</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.440" end="00:28:25.600" style="s2">and it&#39;s kind of this whole mind-blowing</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:27.600" style="s2">mind-expanding</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.600" end="00:28:29.039" style="s2">way as foucault would have put it it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.600" end="00:28:31.919" style="s2">about expanding</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.039" end="00:28:32.320" style="s2">the potentialities of being so meaning</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.919" end="00:28:34.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.320" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">you know if you if you break the rules</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.480" end="00:28:37.200" style="s2">of how you think you&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.520" style="s2">think about the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.200" end="00:28:40.640" style="s2">if you deconstruct them by showing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.520" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">they&#39;re arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:44.799" style="s2">and that there are other alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:46.880" style="s2">then you can live in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.799" end="00:28:47.919" style="s2">that the current rules of society don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.880" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.919" end="00:28:52.240" style="s2">which if you&#39;re gay or into rough sex</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:54.799" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.240" end="00:28:56.320" style="s2">foucault was there&#39;s some credit to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.799" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2">to be given to that claim but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.320" end="00:28:58.960" style="s2">talking about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">potentialities of</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.960" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">being being limited by gravity um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:06.159" style="s2">not so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.799" style="s2">but they uh to kind of wrap up used all</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.159" end="00:29:09.840" style="s2">of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.799" end="00:29:11.520" style="s2">this thinking this dissatisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.840" end="00:29:12.960" style="s2">with how the world was going and we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.520" end="00:29:14.640" style="s2">talk about that historically too because</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.960" end="00:29:17.200" style="s2">it&#39;s actually interesting in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.640" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">but they used it to forward the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.200" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">important idea that they have is that</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:24.320" style="s2">all knowledge all claims to truth</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">are ultimately the result of political</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.320" end="00:29:28.720" style="s2">processes and therefore are actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:29.840" style="s2">means of forwarding power politics and</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.720" end="00:29:31.440" style="s2">not means of</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.840" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">trying to describe what&#39;s real in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.440" end="00:29:34.720" style="s2">world whatsoever</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:38.240" style="s2">interesting yeah confess until recently</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.679" end="00:29:40.440" style="s2">i had</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.240" end="00:29:41.600" style="s2">not paid too much attention to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.440" end="00:29:44.240" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.600" end="00:29:46.000" style="s2">mostly for that reason especially its</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.240" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">denigration of science i go what the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.000" end="00:29:49.120" style="s2"> assholes right</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:51.520" style="s2">if you can&#39;t see that science is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.120" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">fundamentally different way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.520" end="00:29:55.919" style="s2">than anything that came before it</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:57.279" style="s2">and is qualitatively different then</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.919" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">whatever it is you&#39;re thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.279" end="00:30:01.520" style="s2">obviously horseshit right</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">and so this theory that there is no</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.520" end="00:30:04.240" style="s2">objective knowledge there is no</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:06.399" style="s2">objective truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.240" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">while it&#39;s funny i sympathize with it at</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.399" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">one level because even my beloved</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:11.039" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:13.200" style="s2">those of us have dug into the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.039" end="00:30:13.840" style="s2">of science know that it goes down wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.200" end="00:30:16.480" style="s2">roads</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.840" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">it does various things that it shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.480" end="00:30:18.880" style="s2">but it</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:21.039" style="s2">has a built-in intersubjective and</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.880" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">inter-objective mechanism for</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.039" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">reconverging to what is correct and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">seems that these clowns miss that</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:30.080" style="s2">somehow i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a really good summary of</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.080" end="00:30:34.320" style="s2">it i can tell you how</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">it&#39;s that they well there&#39;s a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.320" end="00:30:36.880" style="s2">reasons if we can get into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">psychological side which is i think that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.880" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:41.840" style="s2">legitimately were just jealous of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">prestige and power of science</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.840" end="00:30:46.080" style="s2">and they used that jealousy to do as</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:48.240" style="s2">foucault called them archaeologies and</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.080" end="00:30:50.080" style="s2">genealogies where they nitpicked it like</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.240" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">oh look here&#39;s a failure oh look here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.080" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">a failure</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:54.720" style="s2">so where you say that you can sympathize</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">and they you can see where the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.720" end="00:30:58.399" style="s2">of science has done this wrong</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">it&#39;s got that wrong they they cherry</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.399" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">pick that heart</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.640" style="s2">that part and then they skip the part</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.640" end="00:31:06.559" style="s2">it reconverges entirely because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">not useful to complaining about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.559" end="00:31:10.399" style="s2">thing that they&#39;re jealous of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">and angry at the other the more</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.399" end="00:31:15.039" style="s2">theoretically grounded reason that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:16.080" style="s2">express in their writing is that they</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.039" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">believe that well</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.080" end="00:31:19.760" style="s2">they look at the sociology of science</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:21.519" style="s2">and they say well obviously this is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.760" end="00:31:23.440" style="s2">social process that decides which</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.519" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">methods are are valid and which methods</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.440" end="00:31:26.000" style="s2">are not</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">which truths are valid which truths are</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.000" end="00:31:30.000" style="s2">not since that&#39;s a social process and</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:32.399" style="s2">you can see what a dirty social process</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.000" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">it&#39;s been especially historically it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.399" end="00:31:35.440" style="s2">must be just</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:37.679" style="s2">dirty power politics that decided which</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.440" end="00:31:39.679" style="s2">methods and so foucault&#39;s point for</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">specific to be specific was</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.679" end="00:31:42.799" style="s2">that whether or not a claim about</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">objective truth is</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.799" end="00:31:48.080" style="s2">actually true doesn&#39;t matter he</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">didn&#39;t say that it&#39;s not he said that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.080" end="00:31:51.600" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter if it is or not because</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:53.519" style="s2">it ignores the more relevant point that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.600" end="00:31:55.440" style="s2">the politics of how we decided it or</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.519" end="00:31:58.480" style="s2">what we need to put our focus on</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.440" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">and so they had this very nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.480" end="00:32:03.120" style="s2">despairing kind of perspective</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">where they&#39;re you know sort of woe is me</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.120" end="00:32:06.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:08.399" style="s2">um everything must be politics because</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.640" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">i think honestly because their politics</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.399" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">weren&#39;t working out these were marxists</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">who were staring upon the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.559" style="s2">failures of marxism throughout the world</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:19.120" style="s2">they were staring at the failures</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.559" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">of communism to to affect good things</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.120" end="00:32:23.519" style="s2">they&#39;re looking at the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">deaths the genocides the reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.519" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">pushbacks that led to fascism and</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:27.760" style="s2">they&#39;re just seeing that the communist</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:29.440" style="s2">revolutions weren&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.760" end="00:32:32.080" style="s2">they did have a soft spot in their heart</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.440" end="00:32:33.440" style="s2">for for mao they were big fans of mao</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.080" end="00:32:35.279" style="s2">occasionally and sometimes they would</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.440" end="00:32:37.039" style="s2">change their mind and not be you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.279" end="00:32:38.080" style="s2">being in the 1950s and getting into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.039" end="00:32:40.000" style="s2">1960s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.080" end="00:32:41.279" style="s2">uh their buddy pol pot was hanging out</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.000" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">with them there in the sarbane and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.279" end="00:32:44.480" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of like the culture</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">that they had happening and then he went</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.480" end="00:32:49.440" style="s2">back to cambodia that went real well</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2"> and so yeah they had this</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.440" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">whole view that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:56.399" style="s2">truth and falsity don&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:32:57.919" style="s2">the politics of determining what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.399" end="00:32:58.399" style="s2">and false are the really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.919" end="00:32:59.919" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.399" end="00:33:01.519" style="s2">and of course when you start looking at</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.919" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">it and you start feeding that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.519" end="00:33:04.640" style="s2">crap to activists and</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">and people who frankly don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.640" end="00:33:10.000" style="s2">chops to do science because it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:10.880" style="s2">uh to do science you give them a tool</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.000" end="00:33:12.320" style="s2">that&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.880" end="00:33:14.399" style="s2">you know the best thing ever if they</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.320" end="00:33:16.000" style="s2">want to start chopping down at the field</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.399" end="00:33:18.720" style="s2">that&#39;s taken seriously where their</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.000" end="00:33:20.559" style="s2">fields are not taken as seriously</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.720" end="00:33:22.000" style="s2">contextually the humanities had been</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.559" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">losing a lot of ground</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.000" end="00:33:26.399" style="s2">in terms of being like real academia as</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">science really rose to prominence and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.399" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">through the you know the logical</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:31.120" style="s2">positivism movement</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:33.200" style="s2">you can think back to the 1950s and all</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.120" end="00:33:34.640" style="s2">of those tv shows you know so we will</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.200" end="00:33:36.399" style="s2">change the world with science and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.640" end="00:33:38.559" style="s2">have that very you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.399" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">voice we would associate with just being</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.559" end="00:33:42.880" style="s2">you know promotional crap now</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">and so they they were in that meloo</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.880" end="00:33:46.640" style="s2">reacting against that</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.960" style="s2">thinking well what about this nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.640" end="00:33:50.960" style="s2">we do why is it why are we not important</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.960" end="00:33:52.559" style="s2">can&#39;t get lost on you how often foucault</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.960" end="00:33:52.960" style="s2">pointed out that one of his points was</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.559" end="00:33:54.720" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.960" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">an intellectual rock star in the french</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.720" end="00:33:58.880" style="s2">tradition and to do what he did to</p>

<p begin="00:33:58.880" end="00:34:03.840" style="s2">and he said it more than once so um</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.919" end="00:34:05.760" style="s2">you know there was this whole edgy</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.840" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">avant-garde let&#39;s break down the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.760" end="00:34:09.119" style="s2">establishment</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">mentality that was just happening and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.119" end="00:34:13.359" style="s2">they get caught up in it</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:14.639" style="s2">how people decided to pick it up envy i</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">can&#39;t i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.639" end="00:34:18.000" style="s2">figure out another reason they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">envious of the sciences saw tools to</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.000" end="00:34:22.240" style="s2">tear them apart</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:23.760" style="s2">off to the races interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.240" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">good point about the fact that it was in</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.760" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">the face of the decline of marxism i</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:29.919" style="s2">don&#39;t remember who said it was one of my</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">favorite quotes is that by the</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.919" end="00:34:33.359" style="s2">early 1990s the last marxists on earth</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:35.119" style="s2">were the</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.359" end="00:34:37.040" style="s2">members of the english departments of</p>

<p begin="00:34:37.040" end="00:34:40.399" style="s2">that&#39;s right and most of them were</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.399" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">feminists and that&#39;s actually key right</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.399" end="00:34:43.119" style="s2">because that&#39;s who picked this stuff up</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">and ran with it it was feminists who</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.119" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">were trying to blame</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:48.560" style="s2">capitalism for the patriarchy you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">we&#39;re talking feminists in like the</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.560" end="00:34:52.079" style="s2">1970s</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:53.839" style="s2">and so on as you&#39;re saying oh these</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.079" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">these kind of very marxist feminists</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:57.200" style="s2">were starting to pick up these</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.040" end="00:34:58.880" style="s2">post-modern ideas because</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">many of their attempts to deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.880" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">gender and even to poke biological sex</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:04.720" style="s2">were just getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:06.079" style="s2">railroaded by biology they just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.720" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">out of touch with reality social</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.079" end="00:35:09.359" style="s2">constructivism</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">is a thing but it only goes so far and</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.359" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">they want it to go 100</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:14.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s that doesn&#39;t work and so they</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:15.920" style="s2">started to pick this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:17.520" style="s2">up and it started to get more and more</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.920" end="00:35:19.359" style="s2">radical with the w</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.520" end="00:35:20.720" style="s2">with what they&#39;re trying to attempt and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.359" end="00:35:22.160" style="s2">science wasn&#39;t having it</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.720" end="00:35:24.400" style="s2">you started to have people coming up in</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.160" end="00:35:26.640" style="s2">the 70s and 80s with stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.400" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">um strong objectivity that was sandra</p>

<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:38.320" style="s2">excluded and it&#39;s just when you start</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.440" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">doing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.320" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">science becomes your enemy and you need</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">a tool to deconstruct it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">uh as they would say it&#39;s hegemony and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.160" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">there&#39;s post-modernism laying there</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">one truth is as good as any other and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:51.119" style="s2">every truth is political and if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">been excluded</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.119" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">that means it&#39;s problematic and it needs</p>

<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:57.359" style="s2">perfect fit for these radical feminists</p>

<p begin="00:35:57.359" end="00:36:01.839" style="s2">then imported this idea that they really</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.320" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">should have left</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.839" end="00:36:04.960" style="s2">left on the on the cutting room floor of</p>

<p begin="00:36:04.960" end="00:36:07.359" style="s2">because the french didn&#39;t take this</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.079" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">stuff up the french were like what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.359" end="00:36:11.119" style="s2">this crap</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">no yeah interesting yeah i think you</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.119" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">just hit on it in passing but i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:15.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:16.880" style="s2">call it out because it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.280" end="00:36:19.359" style="s2">you say yeah it has something</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.880" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">of merit to it but they go too far 100</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.359" end="00:36:22.240" style="s2">percent</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.960" style="s2">you know language i like to use is both</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.240" end="00:36:26.640" style="s2">and right it is true that the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.960" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">of science is important</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.640" end="00:36:30.720" style="s2">it is true that the decisions we make</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:31.599" style="s2">and the institutional mechanisms we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.720" end="00:36:34.400" style="s2">put in place</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.599" end="00:36:36.320" style="s2">for the allocation of dollars to</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.400" end="00:36:39.440" style="s2">different research disciplines</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.320" end="00:36:42.160" style="s2">how careers are had in science what are</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.440" end="00:36:42.800" style="s2">the barriers to the access to scientific</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.160" end="00:36:46.560" style="s2">careers</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.800" end="00:36:50.160" style="s2">are all important questions but but</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.560" end="00:36:53.280" style="s2">the inner core of the scientific engine</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.160" end="00:36:54.000" style="s2">to my mind is really sound yes we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.280" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">improve a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.000" end="00:36:57.359" style="s2">bit the engine but there&#39;s a big big</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">difference to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.359" end="00:37:01.280" style="s2">the control mechanisms around science</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:04.440" style="s2">and the inner engine</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.280" end="00:37:05.680" style="s2">of tentative step-by-step based on</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.440" end="00:37:09.040" style="s2">falsifiability</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.680" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">of theories backed up by data and or</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.040" end="00:37:13.520" style="s2">experiment etc</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">that is unchallenged to my mind i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.520" end="00:37:17.599" style="s2">seen no challenge that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:19.280" style="s2">while the issues of sociology of science</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.599" end="00:37:22.480" style="s2">and indeed the power</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.280" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">relationships and politics around what</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.480" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">science chooses to study and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:27.520" style="s2">particularly how money flows</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">are indeed important so what we really</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.520" end="00:37:31.280" style="s2">need to do is keep both</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">in our minds not go to this nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.280" end="00:37:35.920" style="s2">crazed view that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">that it&#39;s all power because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.920" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">that&#39;s right yeah both the the critical</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.839" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">theory tradition and the post-modern</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:44.320" style="s2">uh have have ways to confuse people</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">about this and of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.320" end="00:37:46.880" style="s2">feminists would have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.839" style="s2">been aware following marcus in</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.880" end="00:37:51.200" style="s2">particular of the critical theory</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.839" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">tradition uh much of the marxist thought</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.200" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">of the time which</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">feminism had taken up a lot of was was</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:58.480" style="s2">infused with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:38:00.400" style="s2">and so it would say well you have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.480" end="00:38:02.320" style="s2">look at what&#39;s hegemonic and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.400" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">what people are creating the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.320" end="00:38:04.560" style="s2">hegemony what ideologies are they</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:05.839" style="s2">pushing</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.560" end="00:38:08.160" style="s2">and so then they would do these same</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.839" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">kind of archaeological or genealogical</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.160" end="00:38:10.720" style="s2">digs and say hey</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">look well you know the people who used</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:14.720" style="s2">to explore the arctic and find out</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:16.720" style="s2">information about the arctic these these</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.720" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">geographers had to be manly tough men</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.720" end="00:38:19.440" style="s2">and that we really did make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:22.720" style="s2">you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.440" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">late 19th century about truth about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.720" end="00:38:26.079" style="s2">arctic based on how studly the person</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:27.359" style="s2">was and how many you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.079" end="00:38:29.119" style="s2">you know how many polar bears they could</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.359" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">kill or some stupid thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.119" end="00:38:33.200" style="s2">before anybody had any idea of how to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">how to make scientific determinations</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.200" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">about the world</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:37.040" style="s2">and then they just import that forward</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:39.599" style="s2">and say well that must have set up a</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.040" end="00:38:42.320" style="s2">hegemony that&#39;s kept women out all along</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.599" end="00:38:43.760" style="s2">because you know on some level it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.320" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">used as a justification</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.760" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">and on other levels it was one we were</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">chipping away at but if you only look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">the dark side of it you get mad</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:52.400" style="s2">and with the postmodern thought the idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:54.480" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.400" end="00:38:55.520" style="s2">following for example either foucault or</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.480" end="00:38:57.040" style="s2">derrida there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.520" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">constructions that get you there that</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.040" end="00:39:00.960" style="s2">they both get you there the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:02.800" style="s2">the discourse is constructed</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.960" end="00:39:04.720" style="s2">around a thing so the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.800" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">enterprise are constructed by the people</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.720" end="00:39:08.160" style="s2">who create them</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:09.440" style="s2">and that their political biases are what</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.160" end="00:39:11.359" style="s2">create</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.440" end="00:39:14.160" style="s2">how those discourses work and thus the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.359" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">power dynamics within that sociology so</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.160" end="00:39:17.200" style="s2">they would say from a postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">perspective that</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.200" end="00:39:20.480" style="s2">if there is some problem in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">sociology</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.480" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">of science say sexism or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.880" style="s2">it must come from the science itself</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:29.119" style="s2">because the discourses of the science</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.880" end="00:39:30.720" style="s2">are what are structuring that sociology</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.119" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">because of that french structuralism</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.720" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">and so the point of post-modernism being</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">post-structuralist is to tear down</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:40.240" style="s2">those power dynamics you know they look</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:41.839" style="s2">at the power dynamic and the sociology</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.240" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">they say it must be coming from all of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.839" end="00:39:44.880" style="s2">the relevant discourses that inform that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:46.079" style="s2">sociology</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.880" end="00:39:48.320" style="s2">therefore you have to start tearing</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.079" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">those apart and deconstructing them to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.320" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">get rid of the power so they think that</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:52.480" style="s2">the way people talk about the actual</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.480" end="00:39:57.040" style="s2">it&#39;s a confusion makes the sociology of</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:58.640" style="s2">that relevant science</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.040" end="00:40:00.320" style="s2">a problem which is why you see people</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.640" end="00:40:00.720" style="s2">liking computers saying well we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.320" end="00:40:03.119" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:04.160" style="s2">you know phrases like master slave or</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.119" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">whatever you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.160" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">blacklist and whitelist things because</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">that language gives a subtle thing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">makes people uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:13.280" style="s2">of different races or sexes or genders</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:14.720" style="s2">or sexualities or whatever so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.280" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">be very careful with our language</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.720" end="00:40:16.880" style="s2">because the language is going to</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:18.960" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.880" end="00:40:20.560" style="s2">how the sociology is and that sociology</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.960" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">is therefore becomes kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.560" end="00:40:25.040" style="s2">the e-meter that lets you figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">the language</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.040" end="00:40:28.400" style="s2">the discourses themselves are poisoned</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a very stupid way to think</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.400" end="00:40:31.599" style="s2">it&#39;s really a very it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.560" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">insulting too</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.599" end="00:40:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s insulting that&#39;s actually because</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:36.160" style="s2">it assumes everybody&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.040" end="00:40:38.400" style="s2">of pussies right</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.160" end="00:40:39.359" style="s2">with false consciousness yeah all</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.400" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">that right</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.359" end="00:40:43.040" style="s2">and we&#39;ll get to that later especially</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.040" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">when we talk about critical race theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">but you know i believe that this whole</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.480" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">approach has done a huge disservice for</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:51.040" style="s2">the so-called marginal folks right</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">this isn&#39;t how you solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.040" end="00:40:55.040" style="s2">becoming neurotic and</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:56.800" style="s2">seeing boogeyman every where but</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.040" end="00:40:57.359" style="s2">let&#39;s wrap up the history part a little</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.800" end="00:41:00.240" style="s2">bit by</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.359" end="00:41:01.440" style="s2">doing a relatively brief review of your</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.760" style="s2">two principles</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.440" end="00:41:04.960" style="s2">and your four themes and then let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.760" end="00:41:06.720" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.960" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">right so we kind of condensed all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.720" end="00:41:11.520" style="s2">that history into identifying two</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">core principles of postmodern thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.520" end="00:41:14.400" style="s2">the first is that knowledge is socially</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">constructed</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.400" end="00:41:19.200" style="s2">generally in service of power and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:21.440" style="s2">second goes into that power aspect</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.200" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">more specifically and says that dominant</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.440" end="00:41:24.240" style="s2">groups within society have had the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:26.560" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.240" end="00:41:27.520" style="s2">construct knowledge and therefore their</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.560" end="00:41:29.760" style="s2">own power</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.520" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">and so there&#39;s an ethical imperative to</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.760" end="00:41:33.280" style="s2">take apart powerful discourses so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">called the first of those that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.280" end="00:41:36.800" style="s2">no access to objective truth and</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:39.040" style="s2">knowledge is just socially constructed</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.800" end="00:41:40.480" style="s2">the post-modern knowledge principle we</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.040" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">call the second one</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.480" end="00:41:44.880" style="s2">that there&#39;s a political power valence</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:47.119" style="s2">to the whole project that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.880" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">unmade the post-modern political</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.119" end="00:41:50.800" style="s2">principle</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:52.800" style="s2">so those two core principles kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.800" end="00:41:53.920" style="s2">define what post-modern thought is and</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.800" end="00:41:55.520" style="s2">we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.920" end="00:41:58.000" style="s2">to narrow it down to that so we could</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.520" end="00:41:59.280" style="s2">see in future generations of thought</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.000" end="00:42:01.040" style="s2">that those principles are still</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.280" end="00:42:03.920" style="s2">consistently showing up</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:04.800" style="s2">we identify four core themes of</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.920" end="00:42:07.520" style="s2">postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.800" end="00:42:09.040" style="s2">thought and application and those if i</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.520" end="00:42:12.000" style="s2">can name them all in one go</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.040" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">those are the blurring of boundaries so</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.000" end="00:42:14.720" style="s2">trying to take any categories that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.720" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">be able to think of whether it&#39;s man and</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:19.359" style="s2">woman whether it&#39;s knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">storytelling</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.359" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">and blur the boundaries between them so</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">that everything kind of becomes the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:28.400" style="s2">second one is the almighty power of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">language or an exaggerated focus on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.400" end="00:42:32.160" style="s2">power of language we just described</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">that the the belief that words almost</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.160" end="00:42:35.760" style="s2">work like magic spells to structure the</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">sociology of a thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.760" end="00:42:40.400" style="s2">a third one would be cultural relativism</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:42.720" style="s2">which would be both in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.400" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">morals so ethical relativism moral</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.720" end="00:42:45.760" style="s2">relativism as you&#39;d hear you can&#39;t judge</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">one culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.760" end="00:42:49.359" style="s2">there&#39;s ethics from the position of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:52.079" style="s2">another culture which it imported from</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.359" end="00:42:52.960" style="s2">some of the early moves in anthropology</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.079" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.960" end="00:42:56.960" style="s2">also epistemological relativism that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:58.000" style="s2">can&#39;t judge one knowledge system from</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.960" end="00:43:00.000" style="s2">within another knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.000" end="00:43:01.680" style="s2">system so as they phrase it though ways</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.000" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">of knowing one way of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.680" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">like science can&#39;t bear upon the</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.400" end="00:43:07.440" style="s2">validity of another way of knowing like</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:09.040" style="s2">witchcraft</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.440" end="00:43:10.640" style="s2">uh because they&#39;re they&#39;re relative and</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.040" end="00:43:12.720" style="s2">that they&#39;re products of their</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.640" end="00:43:14.079" style="s2">their distinct cultures and so the one</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.720" end="00:43:16.000" style="s2">can&#39;t speak to the other</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.079" end="00:43:17.839" style="s2">and then the fourth is the dissolution</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.000" end="00:43:19.680" style="s2">so we talked earlier about liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.839" end="00:43:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a dissolution of the belief in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.680" end="00:43:22.720" style="s2">universal humanity</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.200" end="00:43:24.560" style="s2">and the dissolution of the belief in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.720" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">autonomous individual people are</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.560" end="00:43:29.040" style="s2">products of their social groups and holy</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:30.880" style="s2">products of their social groups</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.040" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">and so it comes down to defining how</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.880" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">those social groups are defined with the</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:34.960" style="s2">original post-modernist it would have</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:37.760" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.960" end="00:43:38.480" style="s2">particular time and place and culture so</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.760" end="00:43:40.800" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.480" end="00:43:42.480" style="s2">france 1960 would have been maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.800" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">thing or france and the late medieval</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.480" end="00:43:45.599" style="s2">period</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:47.280" style="s2">would have been a thing and this over</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.599" end="00:43:49.680" style="s2">time has evolved to where your</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.280" end="00:43:51.599" style="s2">uh cultural groups have now been wedged</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.680" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">into identity categories</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.599" end="00:43:54.560" style="s2">though the original post-modernist</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:55.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have thought that way but the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.560" end="00:43:57.839" style="s2">point was that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.520" end="00:43:59.760" style="s2">you&#39;re not an individual you&#39;re a french</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.839" end="00:44:01.520" style="s2">person in the medieval period</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.760" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">and that&#39;s how you think like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.520" end="00:44:05.839" style="s2">this consciousness that goes with being</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:08.079" style="s2">in which culture at what time you happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.839" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">to be and then there&#39;s no universal</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.079" end="00:44:11.040" style="s2">humanity because</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:12.319" style="s2">one group can&#39;t genuinely understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.040" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">each other because they have completely</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.319" end="00:44:14.079" style="s2">different ethics and completely</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.079" end="00:44:17.119" style="s2">epistemologies so they can&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:19.200" style="s2">properly speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.119" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">to one another so there&#39;s this erasure</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.200" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">of all of the fundamental principles</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">of liberalism like understanding the</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:27.760" style="s2">world clearly</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:30.960" style="s2">uh universal principles of of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.760" end="00:44:32.640" style="s2">and viewing people as individuals and</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.960" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">saying that yeah we can make some</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.640" end="00:44:35.280" style="s2">universal judgments about right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:36.960" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.280" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">and no you know we don&#39;t have to get</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.960" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">tricked by word games there is a</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:41.520" style="s2">fundamental reality beneath it all that</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:44.720" style="s2">we can understand</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.520" end="00:44:46.960" style="s2">and talk about on shared terms</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">very good i often will describe it as</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.960" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">people claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">both witch doctors and johns hopkins</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:54.240" style="s2">hospital are equally good at curing</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:56.400" style="s2">cancer you know what the right</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.240" end="00:44:57.520" style="s2">how do people believe that horseshit but</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.400" end="00:44:59.280" style="s2">as you say in the book</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.520" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">eventually kind of the internal</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.280" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">contradictions of</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:05.119" style="s2">this abstract french theory driven</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:07.119" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">started to wind down you know people</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.119" end="00:45:10.960" style="s2">eventually said all right maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:11.359" style="s2">intellectually cute and curious to probe</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.960" end="00:45:13.520" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.359" end="00:45:14.880" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really lead anywhere useful</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.520" end="00:45:17.040" style="s2">and then you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.880" end="00:45:19.119" style="s2">what you call the post-modernism&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.040" end="00:45:22.240" style="s2">applied turn</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.119" end="00:45:24.560" style="s2">where it was reformed in various ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.240" end="00:45:26.160" style="s2">and simplified i would say in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.560" end="00:45:26.960" style="s2">and then move forward so let&#39;s move</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.160" end="00:45:30.800" style="s2">quickly here</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.960" end="00:45:32.560" style="s2">to the post-modernism&#39;s applied term</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.800" end="00:45:33.920" style="s2">yeah so that really happened and if you</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.560" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">want to throw earmarks on it you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.920" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">say that post-modernism was 1970</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">and the applied turn was 1990. a lot</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:43.280" style="s2">happened in the mid and late 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">and what happened ultimately was that</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.280" end="00:45:47.839" style="s2">the remnants of the radical activists</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">from the 60s and 70s these marcusian</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.839" end="00:45:51.680" style="s2">activists the critical theorists</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:54.000" style="s2">liberation black power</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.680" end="00:45:55.760" style="s2">radical feminists they had lost a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.000" end="00:45:57.359" style="s2">their clout and they had lost a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.760" end="00:45:58.800" style="s2">their ability to argue because people</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.359" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">just kind of got tired with the whole</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.800" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">power dynamic thing all the time</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:06.079" style="s2">and they found post-modern tools and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">you had a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.079" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">a couple of thinkers prominently in the</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">late 1980s or mid-1980s who started to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">figure out</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">well if we say that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:17.920" style="s2">deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:19.280" style="s2">the experience of oppression but if you</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.920" end="00:46:20.079" style="s2">start using post-modern tools to</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.280" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">deconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.079" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">power now we have a very actionable</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:26.560" style="s2">understanding of both post-modern theory</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:27.520" style="s2">and critical theory that we can put into</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.560" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">application</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.520" end="00:46:30.560" style="s2">and they explicitly did that they</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:33.839" style="s2">combined that</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.560" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">very radical uh critical approach</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.839" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">with postmodern tools by setting aside</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">the idea of universal deconstruction and</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">saying no</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">the experience of oppression is real and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:44.960" style="s2">only somebody with privilege could</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:47.680" style="s2">possibly deconstruct it</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.960" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">so let&#39;s simplify post-modernism down to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.680" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2">deconstructing those</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:52.720" style="s2">powers that create oppression and we</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">take oppression off the table</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.720" end="00:46:56.160" style="s2">so now you can&#39;t deconstruct race</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.160" end="00:47:00.720" style="s2">race is a site of oppression and so now</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:03.680" style="s2">you start to see this identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.720" end="00:47:04.480" style="s2">very explicitly becoming the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.680" end="00:47:07.119" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.480" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">that are relevant to the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.119" end="00:47:10.319" style="s2">principles and themes</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the world we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.319" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">living in now right the supplied</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">post-modernist epoch or at least this</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:16.960" style="s2">disease that seems to be rampant in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.960" end="00:47:20.960" style="s2">so let&#39;s now move on to where you start</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">to dig into the first of these</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.960" end="00:47:24.240" style="s2">applied post-modernist theories which is</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:26.720" style="s2">post-colonial</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.240" end="00:47:28.079" style="s2">theory and early in that chapter you</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.720" end="00:47:28.880" style="s2">make a very key distinction which</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.079" end="00:47:30.800" style="s2">frankly</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.880" end="00:47:32.559" style="s2">i was not aware of so it was a good</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.800" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">education for me too</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.559" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">which is the identity politics when</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">looked at deeply from</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:40.559" style="s2">theory is actually deeply cynical it</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">appears</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.559" end="00:47:44.400" style="s2">you can correct me if i&#39;m wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:44.960" style="s2">this that the postcolonialists and</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.400" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">critical</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.960" end="00:47:49.839" style="s2">race theory people don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">believe in identity essentialism</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.839" end="00:47:54.160" style="s2">you discovered that they used a term</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:56.480" style="s2">called strategic essentialism</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.160" end="00:47:58.079" style="s2">which strikes me as a very cynical way</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.480" end="00:47:59.359" style="s2">to have proceeded</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.079" end="00:48:01.440" style="s2">could you perhaps you know either</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.359" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">correct me and or expand</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.440" end="00:48:05.119" style="s2">on this concept of strategic</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:08.400" style="s2">essentialism</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.119" end="00:48:10.400" style="s2">as one of the base concepts of applied</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.400" end="00:48:12.240" style="s2">post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.400" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">sure yeah i mean there&#39;s a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.240" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">correct in a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:17.599" style="s2">to say that you&#39;ve got correct already</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">and expand upon</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.599" end="00:48:22.400" style="s2">so the idea of strategic essentialism i</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:22.880" style="s2">mean it&#39;s a useful concept it&#39;s a useful</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.400" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">tool</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.880" end="00:48:26.720" style="s2">uh to fight against power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:29.359" style="s2">basically controlling you</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.720" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">and so it means to adopt the negative</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.359" end="00:48:33.040" style="s2">stereotypes</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">about yourself that some powerful group</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.040" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">is applying to you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:38.480" style="s2">and to do so in a self-aware which means</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.640" end="00:48:40.960" style="s2">slightly ironic way</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.480" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">to use it as a weapon of resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.960" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">that power</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:46.400" style="s2">so you could imagine for example we</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:46.960" style="s2">could flash back to the 1950s and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.400" end="00:48:49.599" style="s2">have the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.960" end="00:48:50.880" style="s2">you know stereotypical 1950s white boss</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.599" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.880" end="00:48:54.960" style="s2">however about how he thinks black people</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">are stupid and lazy or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.960" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">and then he tells his black employee to</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">go do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">job go sweep the floor you know or</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">whatever and then the black person</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.839" end="00:49:05.040" style="s2">responds well i don&#39;t know boss i&#39;m too</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">stupid and lazy</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.040" end="00:49:09.760" style="s2">and so that would be an example of using</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:11.040" style="s2">strategic essentialism to fight</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.760" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">power and i think there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.040" end="00:49:13.760" style="s2">legitimacy to it because it calls people</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">out on</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.760" end="00:49:18.480" style="s2">on applying unjust stereotypes like</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:21.599" style="s2">everything it can go too far</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.480" end="00:49:22.800" style="s2">so the idea really got defined by a</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.599" end="00:49:25.839" style="s2">postcolonial theorist</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.800" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">named gayatri spivak in the mid-1980s</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.839" end="00:49:31.920" style="s2">and spivak was a uppercast indian woman</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:35.280" style="s2">who decided to start writing about how</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.920" end="00:49:38.240" style="s2">horrendous colonialism was and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.280" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">um really took a lot i mean she cites</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.240" end="00:49:43.280" style="s2">foucault on nearly every page of her</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:45.359" style="s2">of her work also draws very heavily on</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.280" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">derrida and derrida is more relevant for</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.359" end="00:49:47.920" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">strategic essentialism because the idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.920" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">is oh well there&#39;s binary</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:54.400" style="s2">hierarchies of power and everything that</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:56.559" style="s2">that we encounter in life</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.400" end="00:49:57.520" style="s2">and so what strategic essentialism is is</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.559" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to now</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.520" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">preserve those hierarchies but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">going to reverse the power</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:04.079" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to flip it backwards</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">that&#39;s the way that spivak</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.079" end="00:50:08.640" style="s2">characterized the idea and took it</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">further and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.640" end="00:50:12.960" style="s2">now for example if you say well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">a power dynamic between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.960" end="00:50:16.559" style="s2">that you know men are dominant over</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">women she would say well we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.559" end="00:50:19.119" style="s2">preserve that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:20.319" style="s2">hierarchy that men and women are</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.119" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">different but we&#39;re going to reverse the</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.319" end="00:50:24.640" style="s2">power so now it&#39;s girl power</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:25.359" style="s2">now now now women are the ones that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.640" end="00:50:27.520" style="s2">are to have</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.359" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">power women domination is great and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.520" end="00:50:31.040" style="s2">can do this with whatever</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">set of identity factors or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.040" end="00:50:35.280" style="s2">you want to do so it became this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:36.640" style="s2">site upon which they had to do two</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.280" end="00:50:37.599" style="s2">things and the cynical part that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.640" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">pointing at</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.599" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">is that they wanted to preserve the</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">existing hierarchy where</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:45.280" style="s2">if we compare that to liberalism the</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">point is to chip away at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.280" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">meaningfulness of that hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.200" end="00:50:50.880" style="s2">they want to preserve the hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:51.760" style="s2">then they want to try to reverse the</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.480" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.760" end="00:50:56.160" style="s2">of of power in it and this actually in</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.480" end="00:50:57.760" style="s2">some sense is why</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.160" end="00:50:59.839" style="s2">as many people have noticed and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.760" end="00:51:02.000" style="s2">pardoned my frustration with it but</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.839" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">the the the kind of social justice</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.000" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">activists get literally</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">everything backwards</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:08.079" style="s2">and it&#39;s because they&#39;re preserving the</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:10.240" style="s2">hierarchies and reversing the power but</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.079" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">the problem is that the hierarchy itself</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.240" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">is the issue and you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:16.400" style="s2">arbitrarily reverse every bit of power</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">and create you know the change that you</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.400" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">so with the post-colonial theorists what</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.640" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">they do is they said well that the west</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:25.359" style="s2">used to say we&#39;re we&#39;re great and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">barbarous we&#39;re smart and you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.359" end="00:51:27.680" style="s2">we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:29.359" style="s2">scientific and you&#39;re superstitious the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.680" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">west is better than the east and so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.359" end="00:51:33.200" style="s2">west constructs itself as superior and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">the east is inferior and this could be</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.200" end="00:51:38.319" style="s2">extended to the global south as well</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:39.599" style="s2">and then liberalism said hey maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.319" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">should think of people as people</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.599" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">wherever they live</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:45.280" style="s2">and try to work from there and this this</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:46.640" style="s2">apparently was intolerable to these</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.280" end="00:51:48.319" style="s2">radical activists who wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.640" end="00:51:50.079" style="s2">strategically essentialize</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.319" end="00:51:51.599" style="s2">and they said no let&#39;s reconstruct it</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.079" end="00:51:55.040" style="s2">that the east is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.599" end="00:51:56.960" style="s2">the the poor oppressed entity by the</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.040" end="00:51:58.800" style="s2">west and that the west is actually evil</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.960" end="00:52:00.559" style="s2">colonizers but let&#39;s establish that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.800" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">west did use science and it is the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.559" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">property of the west and let&#39;s get this</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:05.760" style="s2">backwards completely</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">so we can say oh they use their science</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.760" end="00:52:09.119" style="s2">to destroy africa which</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">if anybody has any sense in their</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.119" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">freaking head if you want to get like</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:13.839" style="s2">working wells and you want to get a city</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:15.520" style="s2">up and operating you&#39;ve got to use</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:17.599" style="s2">science so you&#39;re not helping freaking</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.520" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">africa by saying it&#39;s white stuff to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.599" end="00:52:20.720" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:22.240" style="s2">um but that&#39;s where it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.720" end="00:52:23.040" style="s2">preserve the hierarchy and flip the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.240" end="00:52:25.359" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.040" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">which is strategic essentialism uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.359" end="00:52:30.800" style="s2">thanks to gayatri spivak</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:32.559" style="s2">yeah interesting what a weird move and</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.800" end="00:52:35.200" style="s2">it&#39;s so strange that people</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.559" end="00:52:37.119" style="s2">buy this stuff right it&#39;s like what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.200" end="00:52:38.280" style="s2">also talked in that section of the book</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.119" end="00:52:41.280" style="s2">about how</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.280" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">decolonizing fears or they are now</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.280" end="00:52:45.040" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">have decided that philosophy is</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.040" end="00:52:48.559" style="s2">bad because it gives a special place to</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:51.359" style="s2">reason</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.559" end="00:52:52.000" style="s2">could you talk about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.359" end="00:52:54.720" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.000" end="00:52:55.200" style="s2">the idea is that they they genuinely</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.720" end="00:52:56.960" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.200" end="00:52:58.400" style="s2">that everything is a property of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.960" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">culture that invented it</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.400" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">and so when you say that the</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">enlightenment took place in the european</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.599" end="00:53:07.040" style="s2">for whatever set of historical</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:07.839" style="s2">contingencies that led to that fact of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.040" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.839" end="00:53:11.599" style="s2">you say the enlightenment took place in</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">in we the elevation of reason the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.599" end="00:53:14.640" style="s2">development of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:17.520" style="s2">reasoning all happened in the european</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.640" end="00:53:19.119" style="s2">context mostly by white people mostly by</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.520" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">men because of the other historical</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.119" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">contingencies around</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:23.839" style="s2">those decisions they they believe that</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">that locks</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.839" end="00:53:28.480" style="s2">white western maleness into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:30.079" style="s2">scientific and reason-bearing or</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.480" end="00:53:32.160" style="s2">philosophical processes</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.079" end="00:53:34.079" style="s2">and therefore those are the property of</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.160" end="00:53:37.599" style="s2">white western men and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.079" end="00:53:40.319" style="s2">the property of say black africans or</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.599" end="00:53:44.160" style="s2">indigenous people in in south america or</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.319" end="00:53:47.119" style="s2">whatever else and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.160" end="00:53:47.680" style="s2">therefore those those are properties</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.119" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.680" end="00:53:52.559" style="s2">are tied to a specific culture and for</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:54.160" style="s2">it&#39;s so hard to even freaking explain</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.559" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">this it&#39;s so stupid</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.160" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">and so for say people to go to africa or</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">to south america or to anywhere in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">world that doesn&#39;t have science and try</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:05.760" style="s2">to teach them science</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:07.760" style="s2">is literally a colonial act of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.760" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">change their culture to value white and</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.760" end="00:54:11.119" style="s2">western things</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:12.800" style="s2">rather than just trying to teach them</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.119" end="00:54:13.520" style="s2">very effective methods to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.800" end="00:54:15.440" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.520" end="00:54:18.160" style="s2">coming to africa to teach them to rely</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.440" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">on reason if that&#39;s what it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.160" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">would be seen as an act of colonial</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">aggression that tries to erase</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:24.880" style="s2">african cultures that have always</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">thought differently it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.880" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">in some sense in that way very</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:30.160" style="s2">conservative because it&#39;s like no leave</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:32.319" style="s2">the noble savages</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.160" end="00:54:33.839" style="s2">alone don&#39;t change anything about them</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.319" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">even if it would be to their benefit you</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.839" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">can&#39;t change that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">because that&#39;s as they say colonialism</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s so mental that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.079" end="00:54:43.920" style="s2">impossible to talk about without kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.680" end="00:54:46.160" style="s2">just getting pissed off</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.920" end="00:54:48.160" style="s2">i understand that exactly and of course</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.160" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">what i love about it is how ignorant</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.160" end="00:54:51.599" style="s2">some of the assumptions are even you</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.079" style="s2">know that reason</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.599" end="00:54:55.920" style="s2">is white right anyone who knows anything</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.079" end="00:54:56.880" style="s2">about the history of greek philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.920" end="00:54:59.920" style="s2">knows that it is</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.880" end="00:55:02.880" style="s2">believed with some reason that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.920" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">antecedents of greek philosophy or</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.880" end="00:55:06.400" style="s2">reason was finally</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:08.160" style="s2">defined at least in such a way that it</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.400" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">came into the western tradition</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:12.079" style="s2">actually came from egypt right at least</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:12.880" style="s2">so it appears and so it&#39;s actually an</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.079" end="00:55:15.760" style="s2">egyptian</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.880" end="00:55:16.160" style="s2">invention that was refined and written</p>

<p begin="00:55:16.160" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">essentially by the greeks and further</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.720" end="00:55:22.480" style="s2">for a long time it was essentially the</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">property of the greeks and then to a</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.480" end="00:55:25.680" style="s2">lesser degree the romans but there are</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">lots of white people who had never had</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.680" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">any exposure to this kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:30.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:32.799" style="s2">the britons the celts the vikings they</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.799" end="00:55:35.040" style="s2">never heard any of this horse until</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.799" end="00:55:37.280" style="s2">much later you know 1000 a.d perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.040" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">that aristotelian philosophy slowly</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.280" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">start to penetrate</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:43.599" style="s2">europe so it came from egypt it was</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">processed by the greeks it was refined a</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.599" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">bit by the romans though not very much</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:48.640" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:49.440" style="s2">was carried forth in a kind of flattened</p>

<p begin="00:55:52.880" end="00:55:56.319" style="s2">expanded around into allegedly the white</p>

<p begin="00:55:56.319" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">so and then it expanded to the rest of</p>

<p begin="00:56:24.240" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">described is absolutely correct</p>

<p begin="00:56:46.640" end="00:56:50.319" style="s2">applies</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.280" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">only in the current system which is post</p>

<p begin="00:58:41.520" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">and then satellite internet</p>

<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.280" style="s2">here&#39;s another one of my thoughts a</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.680" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">little bit about neocolonialism</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.280" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">colonialism theory whatever the hell it</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:57.280" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:58.640" style="s2">the brits england was the great</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.280" end="00:59:00.480" style="s2">colonizing power</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.640" end="00:59:02.480" style="s2">right everybody likes to criticize the</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.480" end="00:59:04.400" style="s2">english but hey what happened to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.480" end="00:59:06.720" style="s2">english right they had the brightons way</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.400" end="00:59:08.799" style="s2">back yonder who were attacked and almost</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.720" end="00:59:11.040" style="s2">exterminated by the celts</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.799" end="00:59:13.119" style="s2">who were invaded by the romans when the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.040" end="00:59:14.640" style="s2">romans started to collapse and withdraw</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.119" end="00:59:16.400" style="s2">in 400 a.d</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.640" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">soon thereafter the angles and the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.400" end="00:59:21.119" style="s2">saxons from lowland germany attacked and</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:24.000" style="s2">substantially took over</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.119" end="00:59:24.400" style="s2">england the danes came down and captured</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.000" end="00:59:27.280" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.400" end="00:59:28.559" style="s2">northern third of england dean law for a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.280" end="00:59:30.720" style="s2">couple hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.559" end="00:59:32.799" style="s2">then the normans came in and imposed a</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.720" end="00:59:34.960" style="s2">truly hideous occupation</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.799" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">and built a whole new aristocracy that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.960" end="00:59:39.280" style="s2">suppressed the out of the english</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:41.359" style="s2">and so the history of england has been</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.280" end="00:59:45.040" style="s2">wave after wave after wave of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.359" end="00:59:46.640" style="s2">colonization suppression domination etc</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.040" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">and yet they seem to come out all right</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.640" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">out of it</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">it took me a long time to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:54.400" style="s2">these people think it really took me a</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">long time to figure out this mystery</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.400" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">and the the answer is is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">all of that stuff doesn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:03.200" style="s2">systemic power</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:05.200" style="s2">in the modern era hadn&#39;t been invented</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.200" end="01:00:07.440" style="s2">yet they really think that they</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.200" end="01:00:09.200" style="s2">only care like the world the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.440" end="01:00:10.480" style="s2">of time for them and sometimes i see</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.200" end="01:00:12.240" style="s2"> they post on</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.480" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">instagram these kind of memes and</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.240" end="01:00:16.240" style="s2">they post really they</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:17.760" style="s2">say words like the since the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.240" end="01:00:18.720" style="s2">of time white people have had all the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.760" end="01:00:21.280" style="s2">power in the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.720" end="01:00:22.319" style="s2">so they literally think that the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.280" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">beginning of time</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.319" end="01:00:26.400" style="s2">was the enlightenment in the the</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:27.839" style="s2">beginnings of the scientific revolution</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.400" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">and the development of philosophy so</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.839" end="01:00:31.839" style="s2">anything that happened before that</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:33.520" style="s2">might have been like colonization but it</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.839" end="01:00:34.880" style="s2">wasn&#39;t real colonization because it</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.520" end="01:00:36.559" style="s2">wasn&#39;t systemic</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.880" end="01:00:38.000" style="s2">and they actually think this way because</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.559" end="01:00:39.920" style="s2">the only thing they give a about is</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.000" end="01:00:42.799" style="s2">the prevailing social order</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.920" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">and for them that is the entire world</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.799" end="01:00:45.280" style="s2">nothing else has any meaning so they</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:46.720" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.280" end="01:00:48.480" style="s2">they would they would take things like</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.720" end="01:00:50.559" style="s2">that and twist them around and have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.480" end="01:00:52.480" style="s2">weird explanation for them if challenged</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.559" end="01:00:54.160" style="s2">like for example with the greeks well if</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.480" end="01:00:54.960" style="s2">the greeks developed reason and they got</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.160" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">it from</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.960" end="01:00:58.319" style="s2">the egyptians and then white people had</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:00:59.920" style="s2">it white people must have stolen it</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.319" end="01:01:02.079" style="s2">that would be the way that they would</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:05.280" style="s2">would look at that rather than in any</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.079" end="01:01:06.559" style="s2">any purpose cases view of how</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.280" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">things actually happen throughout</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.559" end="01:01:09.520" style="s2">history and how cultures actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:12.720" style="s2">interact</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.520" end="01:01:14.960" style="s2">they can&#39;t therefore understand that the</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.720" end="01:01:16.640" style="s2">norms of human history have been</p>

<p begin="01:03:08.000" end="01:03:12.480" style="s2">medieval catholicism where you know to</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.480" end="01:03:16.079" style="s2">or to bring evidence in any way is</p>

<p begin="01:03:16.079" end="01:03:20.480" style="s2">and to my mind that strikes me as the</p>

<p begin="01:03:20.480" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">thing about this phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.200" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">it is it&#39;s a it&#39;s a renewal of i mean</p>

<p begin="01:03:29.760" end="01:03:33.440" style="s2">could call this neo-medievalism</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:35.440" style="s2">it is an attempt to return to</p>

<p begin="01:03:35.440" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">so it&#39;s an attempt to reverse the course</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.599" end="01:03:41.839" style="s2">of the last 500 years</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:43.039" style="s2">and it is hermetically sealed in the</p>

<p begin="01:03:43.039" end="01:03:46.880" style="s2">because it thinks in terms only of these</p>

<p begin="01:06:32.960" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">we&#39;re you know we&#39;re reading milton</p>

<p begin="01:06:37.680" end="01:06:41.680" style="s2">um all of these white western men who</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.000" end="01:06:43.680" style="s2">who are the educated</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.680" end="01:06:45.680" style="s2">people and the aristocrats i guess in</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.680" end="01:06:46.720" style="s2">some sense i had the time and energy to</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.680" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">write</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.720" end="01:06:50.240" style="s2">if that&#39;s even the right way to put it</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:52.720" style="s2">and so they</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.240" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">they say that that unfairly biases all</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.720" end="01:06:56.319" style="s2">of our knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:58.079" style="s2">in the scholarly canon to white western</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.319" end="01:06:59.599" style="s2">people so obviously their politics must</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.079" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">be baked into it because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.599" end="01:07:02.240" style="s2">fundamental assumption behind the whole</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:03.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.240" end="01:07:06.160" style="s2">so what we need to do now is we need to</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.920" end="01:07:07.280" style="s2">fix that so we need to stop citing any</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.160" end="01:07:09.839" style="s2">white western men</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.280" end="01:07:11.520" style="s2">we need to cite black women in</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.839" end="01:07:14.640" style="s2">particular and lots of them</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:15.520" style="s2">we need to cite marginalized voices we</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.640" end="01:07:18.720" style="s2">need to stop</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.520" end="01:07:20.319" style="s2">teaching from white curricula white</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.720" end="01:07:22.480" style="s2">western curricula we need to</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.319" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">insert more materials from other</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.480" end="01:07:25.280" style="s2">contexts</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:28.000" style="s2">and in fact we need to minimize the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.280" end="01:07:29.599" style="s2">amount of white western materials as</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.000" end="01:07:30.400" style="s2">they define it so that we can make up</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.599" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.400" end="01:07:35.599" style="s2">and so you should only cite again black</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:37.200" style="s2">scholar here&#39;s an example an explicit</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.599" end="01:07:39.119" style="s2">example of citing that they said that</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.200" end="01:07:41.039" style="s2">patricia hill collins</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.119" end="01:07:42.240" style="s2">formulation in black feminist thought in</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.039" end="01:07:44.079" style="s2">1990</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.240" end="01:07:46.480" style="s2">relies very heavily on foucault&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.079" end="01:07:48.400" style="s2">concepts of power but it would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.480" end="01:07:50.160" style="s2">against research justice or against</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.400" end="01:07:51.839" style="s2">intersectionality specifically</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.160" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">to cite michelle foucault when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.839" end="01:07:54.400" style="s2">now a black woman who you could cite</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:56.319" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.400" end="01:07:57.920" style="s2">and so you have to cite the black woman</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.319" end="01:08:01.039" style="s2">so one&#39;s identity now</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.920" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">becomes the site for creating citations</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.039" end="01:08:03.200" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">and what you&#39;re going to read what</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.200" end="01:08:05.520" style="s2">you&#39;re going to teach what you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:07.680" style="s2">to put in the curriculum</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.520" end="01:08:09.280" style="s2">and you can see what&#39;s going on because</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.680" end="01:08:10.960" style="s2">all of those create professional</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.280" end="01:08:12.160" style="s2">opportunities for people oh my papers</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.960" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">have been cited this many times my</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.160" end="01:08:14.079" style="s2">papers have not been cited that many</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.079" end="01:08:18.080" style="s2">and so the it isn&#39;t a deliberate attempt</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.960" end="01:08:20.640" style="s2">to cook the books</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">such that the activists because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.640" end="01:08:24.400" style="s2">going to be any black people don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:25.920" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t be confused any black women</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.400" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">any black woman who disagrees is not</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.920" end="01:08:29.920" style="s2">getting cited let me tell you right now</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a deliberate attempt to cook</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.920" end="01:08:33.279" style="s2">the academic books and to skew the</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.679" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">academic canon so that the</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.279" end="01:08:36.400" style="s2">activists who have these identity</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:39.679" style="s2">markers</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.400" end="01:08:40.560" style="s2">um get more reputational standing within</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.679" end="01:08:43.600" style="s2">scholarship</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.560" end="01:08:45.040" style="s2">whereas everybody else gets less uh and</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.600" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">you can you can imagine why they would</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.040" end="01:08:48.319" style="s2">want to do that because that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">turn to to understand the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.319" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">we say oh is there a study i keep</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:52.880" style="s2">getting asked now</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:54.400" style="s2">is there a study showing that their</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.880" end="01:08:56.400" style="s2">scholar that their their</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.400" end="01:08:57.839" style="s2">diversity programs don&#39;t work like are</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.400" end="01:09:01.040" style="s2">you kidding me of course there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.839" end="01:09:03.520" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to publish that</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.040" end="01:09:04.799" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s very interesting and on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.520" end="01:09:07.520" style="s2">other hand as we know</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.799" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">the legacy effects of systemic racism</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.520" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">which is real have</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:12.719" style="s2">you know limited to a significant degree</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:15.120" style="s2">certain minority groups</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.719" end="01:09:16.719" style="s2">from participating in the game of</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.120" end="01:09:18.480" style="s2">science and it&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.719" end="01:09:20.480" style="s2">and you know i&#39;m involved in some boards</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.480" end="01:09:21.839" style="s2">of advisors at academic institutions we</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.480" end="01:09:23.839" style="s2">spent a lot of time thinking about how</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.839" end="01:09:24.880" style="s2">to recruit underrepresented minorities</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.839" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.880" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">but to stipulate it as a law as a rule</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:30.960" style="s2">that you must only quote</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:33.120" style="s2">people it&#39;s nuts right it&#39;s like how the</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.960" end="01:09:35.920" style="s2">hell does anybody believe that</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.120" end="01:09:38.560" style="s2">it&#39;s particularly bad in the sciences or</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.920" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">in my own field of mathematics where</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.560" end="01:09:42.560" style="s2">in math it&#39;s the proof is the proof</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:43.920" style="s2">that&#39;s it that&#39;s the whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.560" end="01:09:45.600" style="s2">if you have the proof it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.920" end="01:09:47.120" style="s2">who you are it doesn&#39;t actually matter</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.600" end="01:09:48.480" style="s2">if a computer came up with it</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.120" end="01:09:50.080" style="s2">if you have the proof the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.480" end="01:09:51.120" style="s2">proved and whoever proved it proved it</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.080" end="01:09:53.600" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.120" end="01:09:55.199" style="s2">and that&#39;s the basis of you know the</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.600" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">getting say an academic paper in</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.199" end="01:09:58.320" style="s2">mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:09:59.840" style="s2">in science it&#39;s the same thing it&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.320" end="01:10:00.880" style="s2">you have the result or don&#39;t you have</p>

<p begin="01:10:00.880" end="01:10:05.520" style="s2">and to say that you know well now we</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.520" end="01:10:06.560" style="s2">have to start skewing this inciting by</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.520" end="01:10:10.400" style="s2">race</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.560" end="01:10:12.800" style="s2">or by gender starts to massively</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.400" end="01:10:14.159" style="s2">undermine that principle that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.800" end="01:10:16.080" style="s2">whether or not you have the proof it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:10:16.080" end="01:10:19.679" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t matter who got the proof and</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.920" end="01:10:20.960" style="s2">because the proof is true independently</p>

<p begin="01:10:20.960" end="01:10:24.320" style="s2">or that the uh that the result is</p>

<p begin="01:10:42.320" end="01:10:45.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not hit research mathematics yet</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.040" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">though i</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.520" end="01:10:49.520" style="s2">started to see the calls for it it has</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:53.520" style="s2">hit mathematics education</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.520" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">hard very hard there are actual programs</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.520" end="01:10:57.280" style="s2">in i hear from teachers all the time in</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:58.239" style="s2">my email but there are actually programs</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.280" end="01:11:00.840" style="s2">that have been</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.239" end="01:11:02.000" style="s2">installed under under the heading of</p>

<p begin="01:11:05.840" end="01:11:09.600" style="s2">but also now i just was talking with</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.000" end="01:11:11.600" style="s2">somebody this morning that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.600" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">be all throughout unless it gets stopped</p>

<p begin="01:11:13.840" end="01:11:17.920" style="s2">that there&#39;ll be the requirement to put</p>

<p begin="01:11:17.920" end="01:11:22.239" style="s2">in math education and it says things</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.719" end="01:11:24.080" style="s2">like that the point is going to be to</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.239" end="01:11:26.159" style="s2">make math less individualistic and more</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.080" end="01:11:27.920" style="s2">collectivist how do you how do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.159" end="01:11:29.199" style="s2">determine what&#39;s a right answer in math</p>

<p begin="01:11:29.199" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">determine it</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.920" end="01:11:33.360" style="s2">there was even an outcry on twitter last</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:35.199" style="s2">week with a bunch of freaking math</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.360" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">educators and professionals and even</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.199" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">scholars</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:39.679" style="s2">trying to argue that two plus two</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:42.239" style="s2">doesn&#39;t equal four because it subjects</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.679" end="01:11:43.360" style="s2">other ways other possible values to</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.239" end="01:11:46.239" style="s2">exclusion</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.360" end="01:11:46.719" style="s2">and i&#39;m not exaggerating that you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.239" end="01:11:48.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.719" end="01:11:50.800" style="s2">what the are you people doing and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.880" end="01:11:52.239" style="s2">the the vector was pure post-modernism</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.800" end="01:11:54.159" style="s2">too if you want to know they said well</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.239" end="01:11:56.480" style="s2">if you look in base three that you would</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.159" end="01:11:59.520" style="s2">write two plus two equals one one</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.480" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">in base three but one one in base three</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.520" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">what we would read is eleven doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.760" end="01:12:06.400" style="s2">mean ten plus one</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:08.080" style="s2">or eleven it means three plus one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.400" end="01:12:09.679" style="s2">what base three means</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.080" end="01:12:12.080" style="s2">and so it&#39;s like it&#39;s literally they</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.679" end="01:12:13.920" style="s2">trick themselves with a pun</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.080" end="01:12:15.360" style="s2">on two different ways to write the</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.920" end="01:12:17.040" style="s2">number four</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.360" end="01:12:18.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re like that means there are</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.040" end="01:12:21.760" style="s2">other possible values</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.560" end="01:12:23.199" style="s2">i wish i was making that up i&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.760" end="01:12:25.120" style="s2"> mad about that that</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.199" end="01:12:26.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like i can&#39;t linger on it too long</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.120" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">because i just start swearing at random</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.880" end="01:12:29.199" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:30.960" style="s2">it&#39;s like i can&#39;t believe these are</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.199" end="01:12:32.719" style="s2">people with master&#39;s degrees</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.960" end="01:12:34.640" style="s2">teaching mathematics and designing</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.719" end="01:12:36.880" style="s2">mathematics curricula that our states</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.640" end="01:12:38.719" style="s2">and cities are actually implementing</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.880" end="01:12:40.400" style="s2">and then i get these messages like i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.719" end="01:12:42.080" style="s2">junior high math teacher and i keep</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.400" end="01:12:44.000" style="s2">getting these directives we have to put</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.080" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">social justice into the core of our math</p>

<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:49.199" style="s2">so yeah math then i see these</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">mathematicians and i&#39;m not exaggerating</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.199" end="01:12:51.679" style="s2">this and the</p>

<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:12:59.600" style="s2">writing like</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:01.440" style="s2">oh well if there&#39;s a problem in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.600" end="01:13:02.800" style="s2">community around mathematics or if</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.440" end="01:13:04.719" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem in mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.800" end="01:13:06.080" style="s2">education maybe we should be asking the</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.719" end="01:13:07.600" style="s2">question if the problem&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.080" end="01:13:09.280" style="s2">coming from math itself</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.600" end="01:13:10.719" style="s2">and how we engage with math itself and</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.280" end="01:13:12.480" style="s2">what we consider to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.719" end="01:13:14.080" style="s2">objectivity in math and then there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.480" end="01:13:15.760" style="s2">these articles out there now about</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.080" end="01:13:17.440" style="s2">we need to get away from the presumed</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.760" end="01:13:19.920" style="s2">objectivity of mathematics</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.440" end="01:13:21.199" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s not in like research math</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.920" end="01:13:23.520" style="s2">now but it&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.199" end="01:13:24.560" style="s2">and it will because it poisons</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.520" end="01:13:25.840" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.560" end="01:13:28.400" style="s2">if they&#39;re questioning two plus two</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.840" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">equals four with master&#39;s degrees</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.400" end="01:13:32.880" style="s2">like i don&#39;t even know where you go from</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:34.080" style="s2">there that&#39;s a pretty good one</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.880" end="01:13:36.400" style="s2">if you could send me a link to that</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.080" end="01:13:38.400" style="s2">tweet i&#39;d love to follow up on that</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.400" end="01:13:39.840" style="s2">at a later date i&#39;m going to interject</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.400" end="01:13:41.120" style="s2">this here again it&#39;s later in my list</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.840" end="01:13:43.120" style="s2">but we&#39;re getting short on time</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.120" end="01:13:44.480" style="s2">i think this is a hugely important topic</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.120" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">and i&#39;m really interested in your</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.480" end="01:13:48.480" style="s2">thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:49.360" style="s2">on this how many of the people out there</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.480" end="01:13:51.840" style="s2">that are</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.360" end="01:13:52.560" style="s2">mouthing these things do you think</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.840" end="01:13:55.679" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.560" end="01:13:57.120" style="s2">have the disease versus those who feel</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.679" end="01:14:00.719" style="s2">compelled</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.120" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">by the bureaucratic power held by the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.719" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">disease</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:08.400" style="s2">to pretend or act as if they</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:09.600" style="s2">believe it so we have to separate the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.400" end="01:14:11.120" style="s2">world into the p</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.600" end="01:14:12.560" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like i guess a</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.120" end="01:14:14.560" style="s2">tautology as you can see into the people</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.560" end="01:14:16.640" style="s2">who are the scholars of this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.560" end="01:14:18.159" style="s2">and the real activists so the ones who</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.640" end="01:14:19.280" style="s2">believe it and i think that nearly all</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.159" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">of them believe it</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.280" end="01:14:23.280" style="s2">and then the people who are being you</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:25.040" style="s2">know broader academics so i get emails</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.280" end="01:14:26.480" style="s2">from academics literally every day and i</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.040" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">mean lots of them</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.480" end="01:14:32.080" style="s2">most days saying i agree with you</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:33.760" style="s2">and your take and i just wanted to let</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.080" end="01:14:35.360" style="s2">you know i support you but i have to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.760" end="01:14:36.320" style="s2">so in private because i have to keep my</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.360" end="01:14:39.280" style="s2">head down so i</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.320" end="01:14:40.960" style="s2">you know i play the part i do my act i</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.280" end="01:14:42.400" style="s2">pretend that i support this stuff when</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.960" end="01:14:42.800" style="s2">i&#39;m at work so i don&#39;t lose my job</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.400" end="01:14:44.800" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.800" end="01:14:46.800" style="s2">you know i have somebody has to be there</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.800" end="01:14:49.120" style="s2">for the kids or somebody has to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.800" end="01:14:50.880" style="s2">there for my kids you know i have to</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.120" end="01:14:53.040" style="s2">keep my job so there&#39;s a lot of people</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.880" end="01:14:55.280" style="s2">out there who are actually pretending</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.040" end="01:14:56.560" style="s2">who are not actually activists and they</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.280" end="01:14:57.760" style="s2">just kind of go along with it i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.560" end="01:14:59.120" style="s2">think you&#39;ll find them being very</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.760" end="01:15:01.360" style="s2">strident very often</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.120" end="01:15:02.560" style="s2">as for the scholars themselves the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.360" end="01:15:03.600" style="s2">scholars themselves believe this</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.560" end="01:15:05.760" style="s2">wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.600" end="01:15:07.440" style="s2">um just like a long time ago christopher</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.760" end="01:15:09.280" style="s2">hitchens was asked how many of these</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.440" end="01:15:10.800" style="s2">pastors do you really think believe all</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.280" end="01:15:12.560" style="s2">this crazy jesus stuff</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.800" end="01:15:13.840" style="s2">that they&#39;re saying and christopher</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.560" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">hitchens said you know there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.840" end="01:15:18.000" style="s2">some grifters</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:18.400" style="s2">there&#39;s always some but that said as a</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.000" end="01:15:20.080" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.400" end="01:15:22.239" style="s2">and talking in averages these are the</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.080" end="01:15:24.480" style="s2">most painfully sincere people i think</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.239" end="01:15:26.159" style="s2">i&#39;ve ever heard of him or met in my life</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.480" end="01:15:27.600" style="s2">and that&#39;s true here these people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.159" end="01:15:29.120" style="s2">even have a sense of humor they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.600" end="01:15:30.480" style="s2">laugh about anything they think laughing</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.120" end="01:15:32.719" style="s2">at things is wrong</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.480" end="01:15:34.400" style="s2">and so these people are painfully</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.719" end="01:15:35.840" style="s2">sincere like so if you ask me about any</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.400" end="01:15:37.520" style="s2">of the big ones out there that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.840" end="01:15:38.400" style="s2">making mad money off of this like robin</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.520" end="01:15:41.440" style="s2">d&#39;angelo</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.400" end="01:15:42.560" style="s2">or uh ibram candy their best seller</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.440" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">books right now</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.560" end="01:15:46.239" style="s2">do they believe it i&#39;m like yo yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.400" style="s2">100 percent they they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.239" end="01:15:50.320" style="s2">they are all in on this this is their</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.400" end="01:15:51.679" style="s2">faith this is their world view this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.320" end="01:15:52.480" style="s2">their core of how they think about</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.679" end="01:15:54.560" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.480" end="01:15:56.239" style="s2">you can see when they they they butt up</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.560" end="01:15:57.360" style="s2">against reality and their eyes kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.239" end="01:15:58.880" style="s2">cross a little bit and they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.360" end="01:16:01.040" style="s2">how to handle it so you can tell that</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.880" end="01:16:02.640" style="s2">they&#39;re grappling with the fact</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.040" end="01:16:04.400" style="s2">that the thing that they believe doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.640" end="01:16:06.000" style="s2">quite work and um</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.400" end="01:16:07.920" style="s2">you see this a lot so the people who are</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.000" end="01:16:10.159" style="s2">actually activists and scholars in this</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.920" end="01:16:11.760" style="s2">believe it wholeheartedly but a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.159" end="01:16:13.280" style="s2">people probably the majority of people</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.760" end="01:16:16.159" style="s2">supporting it fall into one</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.280" end="01:16:18.080" style="s2">one of two groups one is like i describe</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.159" end="01:16:19.280" style="s2">those academics who are too afraid to</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.080" end="01:16:21.920" style="s2">disagree</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.280" end="01:16:23.360" style="s2">so they pretend and another is kind of</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.920" end="01:16:26.000" style="s2">uninformed people like</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.360" end="01:16:27.120" style="s2">some friends of my kids that have said</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.000" end="01:16:29.120" style="s2">things like</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.120" end="01:16:31.280" style="s2">yeah you know i&#39;m sharing the hashtags</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.120" end="01:16:32.400" style="s2">and the reason is because everybody does</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.280" end="01:16:34.159" style="s2">they don&#39;t have the slightest idea what</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.400" end="01:16:34.800" style="s2">any of it means but you gotta say defund</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.159" end="01:16:36.239" style="s2">the police</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.800" end="01:16:38.080" style="s2">and it&#39;s like well everybody&#39;s saying it</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.239" end="01:16:40.080" style="s2">and there&#39;s a lot of people who are just</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.080" end="01:16:41.120" style="s2">not critically thinking about what the</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.080" end="01:16:43.520" style="s2"> they&#39;re saying and</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.120" end="01:16:44.560" style="s2">just saying this stuff and carrying</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.520" end="01:16:46.719" style="s2">water for</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.560" end="01:16:48.000" style="s2">uh extremely radical people thinking</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.719" end="01:16:50.000" style="s2">that it&#39;s generally</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.000" end="01:16:51.360" style="s2">good the third category actually should</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.000" end="01:16:53.199" style="s2">add is people who think it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.360" end="01:16:54.159" style="s2">possibly be as bad as the things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.199" end="01:16:56.800" style="s2">actually saying</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.159" end="01:16:58.400" style="s2">they can&#39;t actually mean it so i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.800" end="01:17:00.000" style="s2">give it a lot of charity i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.400" end="01:17:01.679" style="s2">reinterpret it for them and say oh well</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.000" end="01:17:02.320" style="s2">they just mean this much more sensible</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.679" end="01:17:03.920" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.320" end="01:17:05.199" style="s2">that is not what they mean and they say</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.920" end="01:17:06.080" style="s2">over and over again that it&#39;s not what</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.199" end="01:17:08.000" style="s2">they mean</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.080" end="01:17:09.280" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of people who support</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.000" end="01:17:12.880" style="s2">it because they are</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.280" end="01:17:15.280" style="s2">unable to take them at their word</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.880" end="01:17:16.800" style="s2">at all even though they say you know on</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.280" end="01:17:18.719" style="s2">like almost every page everything they</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.800" end="01:17:20.880" style="s2">write how they hate the system</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.719" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">the system systemic power comes from the</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.880" end="01:17:22.800" style="s2">system and the system needs to be torn</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:24.400" style="s2">down and</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.800" end="01:17:26.560" style="s2">we need to have a revolution i even saw</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.400" end="01:17:28.640" style="s2">a video for like teachers</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.560" end="01:17:31.360" style="s2">today that like the first thing that it</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.640" end="01:17:32.640" style="s2">showed was how do we start a revolution</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.360" end="01:17:34.080" style="s2">in teaching it&#39;s like they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.640" end="01:17:36.640" style="s2">they&#39;re calling for revolution in</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.080" end="01:17:39.440" style="s2">everything they do they mean it</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.640" end="01:17:40.640" style="s2">yep they are true anti-liberals right</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:43.520" style="s2">and if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.640" end="01:17:44.640" style="s2">we believe that we&#39;re fools frankly</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.520" end="01:17:45.920" style="s2">we&#39;ll talk a little bit later about what</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.640" end="01:17:48.080" style="s2">we might be able to do about it</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.920" end="01:17:49.600" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to your next topic but in</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.080" end="01:17:50.480" style="s2">the interest of time let&#39;s try to hit it</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.600" end="01:17:52.800" style="s2">quickly</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.480" end="01:17:53.760" style="s2">and that&#39;s queer theory i&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.800" end="01:17:56.239" style="s2">say that</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.760" end="01:17:58.000" style="s2">the liberation of homosexuals is</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.239" end="01:18:00.480" style="s2">actually one of the great wins from</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.000" end="01:18:02.320" style="s2">liberalism i recall i grew up as a</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.480" end="01:18:04.320" style="s2">working class kid my dad</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.320" end="01:18:05.920" style="s2">dropped out of high school after ninth</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.320" end="01:18:07.040" style="s2">grade my mother left home when she was</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.920" end="01:18:10.320" style="s2">14</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.040" end="01:18:12.800" style="s2">and i had the usual illiberal views</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.320" end="01:18:14.560" style="s2">about homosexuality growing up you</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.800" end="01:18:16.719" style="s2">didn&#39;t almost need to speak about it it</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.560" end="01:18:18.640" style="s2">was unspeakable almost right</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.719" end="01:18:20.880" style="s2">but i had the good luck to go to work</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.640" end="01:18:21.679" style="s2">for a publishing company in the bay area</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.880" end="01:18:23.920" style="s2">as a young man</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.679" end="01:18:24.960" style="s2">met a bunch of gay folks actually became</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.920" end="01:18:27.280" style="s2">friends with him</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.960" end="01:18:28.960" style="s2">marched in the second gay pride parade</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.280" end="01:18:31.920" style="s2">in san francisco</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.960" end="01:18:32.640" style="s2">and at a very young age overthrew my</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.920" end="01:18:35.679" style="s2">legacy</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.640" end="01:18:38.080" style="s2">homophobia and said it&#39;s ridiculous</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.679" end="01:18:39.920" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a violation of liberal</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.080" end="01:18:40.560" style="s2">universalism i didn&#39;t have those words</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.920" end="01:18:42.719" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.560" end="01:18:44.080" style="s2">gay people should have all rights of</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.719" end="01:18:46.080" style="s2">everybody else and</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.080" end="01:18:47.760" style="s2">they&#39;re just fine what the and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.080" end="01:18:49.520" style="s2">clear to me that they&#39;re the way they</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.760" end="01:18:53.280" style="s2">are because that&#39;s the way they are</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.520" end="01:18:55.679" style="s2">right and yet that seeming triumph</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.280" end="01:18:57.199" style="s2">of universal liberalism which happened</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.679" end="01:18:59.760" style="s2">remarkably quickly from</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.199" end="01:19:02.000" style="s2">stonewall to gay marriage being</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.760" end="01:19:04.480" style="s2">legalized was only 30 years</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.000" end="01:19:06.080" style="s2">somehow all that has morphed into this</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.480" end="01:19:07.520" style="s2">crazy</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.080" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">well the crazy shit&#39;s always kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.520" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">been there a lot of people don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:13.280" style="s2">that the queer theorists actually</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:15.600" style="s2">opposed gay marriage from the beginning</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.280" end="01:19:19.040" style="s2">and they saw it as a huge</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.600" end="01:19:20.719" style="s2">loss for their cause um so you can see</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.040" end="01:19:22.719" style="s2">again how they get everything backwards</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.719" end="01:19:24.880" style="s2">like i was saying about the colonials</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.719" end="01:19:27.360" style="s2">so the deal with with queer theory is</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.880" end="01:19:29.280" style="s2">that anything that&#39;s normal or normative</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.360" end="01:19:31.280" style="s2">must be constraining people and holding</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.280" end="01:19:32.320" style="s2">them down in some bad way so you have to</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.280" end="01:19:35.360" style="s2">get rid of it</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.320" end="01:19:36.000" style="s2">so if you make gay marriage legal now</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.360" end="01:19:38.000" style="s2">being gay</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.000" end="01:19:39.920" style="s2">is more normative than it was before so</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.000" end="01:19:42.080" style="s2">gay people aren&#39;t radical</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.920" end="01:19:44.000" style="s2">uh divergent things from society any</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.080" end="01:19:45.679" style="s2">longer and you take away the radical</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.000" end="01:19:47.440" style="s2">power and you sweep them up into the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.679" end="01:19:48.800" style="s2">normative side of society and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.440" end="01:19:51.679" style="s2">failure and it&#39;s a loss</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.800" end="01:19:53.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s a radical rejection of anything</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.679" end="01:19:55.199" style="s2">being allowed to be considered</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.040" end="01:19:57.440" style="s2">normal and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a radical</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.199" end="01:19:59.520" style="s2">rejection of the idea that categories</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.440" end="01:20:00.960" style="s2">can be defined as being stable so to</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.520" end="01:20:02.960" style="s2">queer something is to make the</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.960" end="01:20:05.360" style="s2">categories around it seem unstable</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.960" end="01:20:06.880" style="s2">and laughable so in this case you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.360" end="01:20:09.199" style="s2">you could say the category of</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.880" end="01:20:10.480" style="s2">woman so you could look at lesbians for</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.199" end="01:20:12.880" style="s2">example who are in the l</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.480" end="01:20:13.679" style="s2">the l of the lgbt thing you could say</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.880" end="01:20:15.679" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.679" end="01:20:17.199" style="s2">lesbians are women who are attracted to</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.679" end="01:20:19.120" style="s2">women so you have to have a stable</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.199" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">category of woman for lesbian to make</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.120" end="01:20:21.280" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:23.280" style="s2">and the queer people would say no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.280" end="01:20:25.600" style="s2">not right uh you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.280" end="01:20:27.120" style="s2">stable category of woman you have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.600" end="01:20:28.639" style="s2">break that all down and it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.120" end="01:20:30.159" style="s2">everybody is a person and everybody can</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.639" end="01:20:32.239" style="s2">do whatever they want and</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.159" end="01:20:34.239" style="s2">so you can see it&#39;s like the thing you</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.239" end="01:20:36.239" style="s2">just said made it work oh well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.239" end="01:20:38.239" style="s2">they are people who happen to be how</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.239" end="01:20:39.679" style="s2">they are and that&#39;s fine and so some</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.239" end="01:20:41.199" style="s2">people are gay get over it</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.679" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">no big deal it&#39;s ridiculous to think</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.199" end="01:20:43.920" style="s2">otherwise queer theory gets that</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:45.920" style="s2">backwards too</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.920" end="01:20:47.600" style="s2">because that would make it normal and</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.920" end="01:20:49.199" style="s2">normative and that&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.600" end="01:20:51.280" style="s2">they have to make it everything has to</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.199" end="01:20:53.360" style="s2">say queer and weird or else it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.280" end="01:20:55.199" style="s2">acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.360" end="01:20:56.719" style="s2">interesting and then of course the most</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.199" end="01:20:58.159" style="s2">recent manifestation i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.719" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">far back this goes</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.159" end="01:21:04.639" style="s2">is this literally insane view that</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:07.199" style="s2">sex itself is not real</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.639" end="01:21:08.239" style="s2">what a judith butler said quoted you</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.199" end="01:21:10.560" style="s2">quoted in the book</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.239" end="01:21:12.639" style="s2">if the immutable character of sex is</p>

<p begin="01:21:16.960" end="01:21:20.800" style="s2">and perhaps indeed it was always already</p>

<p begin="01:21:20.800" end="01:21:24.800" style="s2">it was always already gender anyway</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.800" end="01:21:28.639" style="s2">it&#39;s so hard to read judith</p>

<p begin="01:21:28.639" end="01:21:31.679" style="s2">what the hell right my head hurts from</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.560" end="01:21:33.360" style="s2">reading it but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.679" end="01:21:34.800" style="s2">basically bottom line she&#39;s claiming</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.360" end="01:21:36.960" style="s2">well maybe sex itself</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.800" end="01:21:38.719" style="s2">is as socially constructed as gender</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.960" end="01:21:40.400" style="s2">roles i mean who could believe such</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.719" end="01:21:43.120" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.400" end="01:21:44.960" style="s2">right so the that&#39;s the idea so the</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.120" end="01:21:46.880" style="s2">feminists really wanted to deconstruct</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.960" end="01:21:48.400" style="s2">the idea of gender roles being tied so</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.880" end="01:21:49.120" style="s2">there&#39;s maybe some women don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.400" end="01:21:52.560" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.120" end="01:21:54.000" style="s2">female gender roles okay fine whatever</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.560" end="01:21:56.320" style="s2">but then they went further and said so</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.000" end="01:21:57.679" style="s2">gender itself has nothing to do with sex</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.320" end="01:22:00.000" style="s2">and we&#39;re going to completely say that</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.679" end="01:22:02.719" style="s2">gender is 100 social constructed</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.000" end="01:22:04.320" style="s2">and that&#39;s already you&#39;re like um</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.719" end="01:22:06.159" style="s2">something&#39;s getting a bit weird</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.320" end="01:22:07.600" style="s2">and then these queer theorists kind of</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.159" end="01:22:08.880" style="s2">starting with judith butler with that</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.600" end="01:22:11.040" style="s2">question we quoted</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.880" end="01:22:12.639" style="s2">started to say well maybe if we really</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.040" end="01:22:14.239" style="s2">want to break down the idea of gender</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.639" end="01:22:16.080" style="s2">roles and we really want to break down</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.239" end="01:22:18.000" style="s2">the idea that gender has any</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.080" end="01:22:19.679" style="s2">concrete meaning what we really need to</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.000" end="01:22:21.040" style="s2">do is break down the idea that sex has</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.679" end="01:22:24.000" style="s2">any meaning at all</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.040" end="01:22:25.120" style="s2">other than the imposition say of some</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.000" end="01:22:27.440" style="s2">medical</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.120" end="01:22:28.960" style="s2">terminology that the doctors put on</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.440" end="01:22:32.080" style="s2">people&#39;s birth certificates</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.960" end="01:22:33.520" style="s2">and so yeah it&#39;s this this move it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.080" end="01:22:36.159" style="s2">like this progressive move from</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.520" end="01:22:37.440" style="s2">gender roles being socially constructed</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.159" end="01:22:38.960" style="s2">to gender itself being socially</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.440" end="01:22:39.520" style="s2">constructed to having to get more and</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.960" end="01:22:41.520" style="s2">more and more</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.520" end="01:22:43.520" style="s2">radical to break down any normative</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.520" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">categories to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:43.520" end="01:22:49.440" style="s2">sex itself is socially constructed</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:50.719" style="s2">and maybe that&#39;s how it really works and</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.440" end="01:22:52.560" style="s2">you can like you know you can picture</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.719" end="01:22:55.280" style="s2">your mind exploding like wow</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.560" end="01:22:56.159" style="s2">maybe that is what a what a radical idea</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.280" end="01:22:58.320" style="s2">whoa</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.159" end="01:22:59.360" style="s2">and meanwhile the lesbians are over here</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.320" end="01:23:01.120" style="s2">like what the</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.360" end="01:23:03.120" style="s2">we&#39;re women who like women and you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.120" end="01:23:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;re losing us here and so</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.120" end="01:23:06.480" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s queer theory man that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.560" end="01:23:07.600" style="s2">queer theory just make anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.480" end="01:23:10.239" style="s2">normal like</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.600" end="01:23:11.440" style="s2">bust it up make it weird yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.239" end="01:23:13.360" style="s2">weird i mean again</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.440" end="01:23:16.000" style="s2">at one level i sympathize a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.360" end="01:23:17.760" style="s2">with we need room for diversity of ways</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.000" end="01:23:19.840" style="s2">of being in the world</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.760" end="01:23:21.080" style="s2">but how is it that people get to these</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.840" end="01:23:23.360" style="s2">insane</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.080" end="01:23:25.360" style="s2">extrapolations well they believe that</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.360" end="01:23:26.880" style="s2">the ideas themselves have lots of power</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.360" end="01:23:28.719" style="s2">that structure society again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.880" end="01:23:30.080" style="s2">that deep vein of structuralism and</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.719" end="01:23:33.199" style="s2">post-structuralism that</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.080" end="01:23:34.960" style="s2">fed into the postmodern way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.199" end="01:23:36.560" style="s2">and they also take a lot from the</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.960" end="01:23:38.719" style="s2">critical theory view that there&#39;s these</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.560" end="01:23:40.159" style="s2">hegemonic forces that are tied up in it</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.719" end="01:23:41.120" style="s2">so in other words our post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.159" end="01:23:43.840" style="s2">political and</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.120" end="01:23:45.679" style="s2">uh knowledge principles come into into</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.840" end="01:23:48.400" style="s2">bearing so they believe that</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.679" end="01:23:50.080" style="s2">if we had say biological science saying</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.400" end="01:23:51.840" style="s2">that there are actually men and women</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.080" end="01:23:53.199" style="s2">and that they&#39;re physiologically</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.840" end="01:23:55.120" style="s2">different from one another so in other</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.199" end="01:23:56.880" style="s2">words biological sex is real</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.120" end="01:23:58.960" style="s2">some asshole could use that to justify</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.880" end="01:24:00.719" style="s2">sexism so because some asshole could use</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.960" end="01:24:02.800" style="s2">it to justify sexism you have to get rid</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.719" end="01:24:03.520" style="s2">of it it contains the seeds of hegemonic</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.800" end="01:24:05.199" style="s2">power</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.520" end="01:24:06.880" style="s2">so it&#39;s bad so we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.199" end="01:24:08.400" style="s2">believe that then you have this whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.880" end="01:24:09.760" style="s2">rash in the early queer theory</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.400" end="01:24:10.880" style="s2">literature and some of the feminist</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.760" end="01:24:12.320" style="s2">literature around it</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.880" end="01:24:14.400" style="s2">as queer theory was kind of becoming</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.320" end="01:24:15.040" style="s2">ascendant saying that what we really</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.400" end="01:24:16.960" style="s2">have to do</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.040" end="01:24:18.400" style="s2">is get away from the ideas of true and</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.960" end="01:24:19.360" style="s2">false even though it&#39;s easier to</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.400" end="01:24:21.280" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.360" end="01:24:23.280" style="s2">and start going into this very queer</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.280" end="01:24:24.639" style="s2">direction because it&#39;s more politically</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.280" end="01:24:26.400" style="s2">actionable and that&#39;s what we need to</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.639" end="01:24:27.920" style="s2">focus on is what&#39;s politically useful</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.400" end="01:24:30.560" style="s2">for our cause</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.920" end="01:24:31.920" style="s2">how cynical as you say right before we</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.560" end="01:24:32.239" style="s2">move on from this topic i&#39;d like to</p>

<p begin="01:26:37.199" end="01:26:42.080" style="s2">consider to be a bit of an emergency</p>

<p begin="01:26:48.159" end="01:26:51.120" style="s2">of give a very short history we traced</p>

<p begin="01:26:51.120" end="01:26:54.960" style="s2">of critical race theory it began from</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.199" end="01:26:57.040" style="s2">the claim that in the late</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.960" end="01:26:58.960" style="s2">16th century going forward that these</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.040" end="01:27:00.159" style="s2">biological notions of race and this new</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.960" end="01:27:02.159" style="s2">definition of race</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.159" end="01:27:04.239" style="s2">came into the world specifically in</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.159" end="01:27:05.920" style="s2">order to do racism and slavery and</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.239" end="01:27:09.040" style="s2">colonialism and this is true</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.920" end="01:27:10.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s it&#39;s just true uh the way we</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.040" end="01:27:12.960" style="s2">thought of race kind of in that racist</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.960" end="01:27:15.760" style="s2">past you were just talking about</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.960" end="01:27:16.800" style="s2">did come into the picture at that point</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.760" end="01:27:18.719" style="s2">and it was</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.800" end="01:27:21.360" style="s2">a social construction of race that was</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.719" end="01:27:24.239" style="s2">backed up by the authority of bogus</p>

<p begin="01:27:24.239" end="01:27:28.320" style="s2">were white supremacists in nature</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.159" end="01:27:30.239" style="s2">and so the summary of that is that you</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.320" end="01:27:32.239" style="s2">can say that these people who wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.239" end="01:27:33.520" style="s2">do slavery and colonialism using</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.239" end="01:27:36.639" style="s2">whatever tools they had</p>

<p begin="01:27:42.639" end="01:27:47.280" style="s2">ratcheting it out click click click</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.679" end="01:27:48.960" style="s2">click you know one turn of the ratchet</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.280" end="01:27:49.679" style="s2">after another let&#39;s take social</p>

<p begin="01:27:49.679" end="01:27:52.960" style="s2">out of racial categories until we</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.280" end="01:27:54.719" style="s2">finally get to the point</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.960" end="01:27:57.040" style="s2">where we can say things like this is</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.719" end="01:27:58.880" style="s2">this is a person who happens to be black</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.040" end="01:28:00.960" style="s2">this is a person who happens to be</p>

<p begin="01:28:03.840" end="01:28:07.840" style="s2">anymore so we&#39;re reducing</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.679" end="01:28:09.760" style="s2">the social significance in racial</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.840" end="01:28:10.960" style="s2">categories which we generally would call</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.760" end="01:28:12.719" style="s2">color blindness</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.960" end="01:28:14.719" style="s2">when martin luther king said that he</p>

<p begin="01:28:14.719" end="01:28:17.440" style="s2">a dream</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.360" end="01:28:21.920" style="s2">but by the contents of their characters</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.800" end="01:28:24.960" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.920" end="01:28:27.360" style="s2">removing the social significance from</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.960" end="01:28:28.000" style="s2">racial categories and then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.360" end="01:28:29.600" style="s2">sudden you have these</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.000" end="01:28:31.760" style="s2">identity politicians who are of course</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.600" end="01:28:34.800" style="s2">active in parallel to</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.760" end="01:28:37.120" style="s2">uh king the the black power movement</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.800" end="01:28:37.760" style="s2">malcolm x etc that were pushing this</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.120" end="01:28:40.800" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.760" end="01:28:42.239" style="s2">positive black identity with a capital b</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.800" end="01:28:44.159" style="s2">who wanted to keep the social</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.239" end="01:28:47.440" style="s2">significance in race and reverse</p>

<p begin="01:28:47.440" end="01:28:51.120" style="s2">keep that there and so and then in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.360" end="01:28:52.560" style="s2">1990s you have these people that picked</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.120" end="01:28:53.840" style="s2">up post-modern theory specifically</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.560" end="01:28:55.760" style="s2">kimberly crenshaw</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.840" end="01:28:57.840" style="s2">and she has in a paragraph in her most</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.760" end="01:29:00.000" style="s2">famous paper called mapping the margins</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.840" end="01:29:02.080" style="s2">that we have to take an identity first</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.000" end="01:29:04.159" style="s2">approach there&#39;s something more powerful</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.080" end="01:29:04.960" style="s2">and more meaningful to the sentence i am</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.159" end="01:29:06.960" style="s2">black</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.960" end="01:29:08.239" style="s2">than to the sentence i am a person who</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.960" end="01:29:10.000" style="s2">happens to be black</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.239" end="01:29:11.920" style="s2">because of that second sentence puts</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.000" end="01:29:13.520" style="s2">their universal humanity first rather</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.920" end="01:29:15.199" style="s2">than their identity which is not useful</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.520" end="01:29:15.840" style="s2">for identity politics of the radical</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.199" end="01:29:17.360" style="s2">sort</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.840" end="01:29:19.120" style="s2">she then finishes that paper by saying</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.360" end="01:29:19.840" style="s2">we&#39;re going to link that to post-modern</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.120" end="01:29:22.480" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.840" end="01:29:24.239" style="s2">to do deconstruction of the power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.480" end="01:29:27.440" style="s2">oppressing black people</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.239" end="01:29:29.760" style="s2">so what you have then in the long arc is</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.440" end="01:29:30.639" style="s2">a history where racial categories were</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.760" end="01:29:32.639" style="s2">invented</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.639" end="01:29:34.159" style="s2">social significance was put into them in</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.639" end="01:29:36.719" style="s2">order to do racist</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.159" end="01:29:37.840" style="s2">things liberalism ratcheted that out</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.719" end="01:29:39.920" style="s2">over a long</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.840" end="01:29:42.080" style="s2">and painful history and then you have</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.920" end="01:29:43.360" style="s2">these idiot activists come along and say</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.080" end="01:29:44.480" style="s2">you know what let&#39;s put social</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.360" end="01:29:46.560" style="s2">significance back</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.480" end="01:29:48.480" style="s2">into racial categories and see what</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.560" end="01:29:49.840" style="s2">happens that&#39;s how we&#39;re really going to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.480" end="01:29:53.199" style="s2">get liberation</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.840" end="01:29:56.239" style="s2">and here we are</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.199" end="01:29:58.960" style="s2">yeah i&#39;ve been long arguing</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.239" end="01:30:00.000" style="s2">that america missed a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.960" end="01:30:03.679" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.000" end="01:30:07.120" style="s2">in the late 60s to unravel our</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.679" end="01:30:09.360" style="s2">uniquely bad black white problems</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.120" end="01:30:11.199" style="s2">you know martin luther king actually was</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.360" end="01:30:12.080" style="s2">on the right track he argued for</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.199" end="01:30:15.840" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.080" end="01:30:18.320" style="s2">the gradual growing bourgeoisiation</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.840" end="01:30:20.080" style="s2">of black people right and in fact people</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.320" end="01:30:23.440" style="s2">forget this the remember the monahan</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.080" end="01:30:25.280" style="s2">report back in the late 60s where he</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.440" end="01:30:27.600" style="s2">gave the famous report on the decline of</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.280" end="01:30:30.560" style="s2">the black family and the risks that</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.600" end="01:30:31.520" style="s2">made for racial progress and daniel</p>

<p begin="01:30:35.360" end="01:30:38.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s now considered racist horrible</p>

<p begin="01:30:38.480" end="01:30:42.800" style="s2">but i went back and did some research on</p>

<p begin="01:30:54.159" end="01:30:57.920" style="s2">now at 70 percent and it seems to me</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.360" end="01:31:01.120" style="s2">that this</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.920" end="01:31:03.679" style="s2">black power thing and black authenticity</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.120" end="01:31:04.560" style="s2">thing which happened right around that</p>

<p begin="01:31:04.560" end="01:31:10.000" style="s2">diverted what could have been a gradual</p>

<p begin="01:31:18.560" end="01:31:21.600" style="s2">sure what the alternative really was but</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.199" end="01:31:23.920" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.600" end="01:31:26.800" style="s2">essentially a precursor to this critical</p>

<p begin="01:31:26.800" end="01:31:30.239" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a really unfortunate situation</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.199" end="01:31:32.000" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.239" end="01:31:33.920" style="s2">again we kind of can dip back to that</p>
<p begin="01:31:32.000" end="01:31:35.440" style="s2">post-modern view or again we can look at</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.920" end="01:31:36.000" style="s2">it from the critical theory perspective</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.440" end="01:31:38.880" style="s2">of</p>

<p begin="01:32:51.120" end="01:32:54.239" style="s2">about that they want us</p>

<p begin="01:33:52.480" end="01:33:57.520" style="s2">hard lines and saying you know this is</p>

<p begin="01:34:06.960" end="01:34:10.560" style="s2">really like the exact wrong way to think</p>

<p begin="01:34:10.560" end="01:34:15.440" style="s2">it&#39;s so frustrating yeah</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.760" end="01:34:18.320" style="s2">it&#39;s crazy and you know the one you gave</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.440" end="01:34:21.040" style="s2">the example pissed me off some years ago</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.320" end="01:34:21.440" style="s2">the argument against punctuality so for</p>

<p begin="01:34:21.440" end="01:34:24.960" style="s2">i wrote an agent-based model that</p>

<p begin="01:34:24.960" end="01:34:29.120" style="s2">and you could set how much punctuality</p>

<p begin="01:34:29.120" end="01:34:32.719" style="s2">and if you assume that the the work of</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.960" end="01:34:35.040" style="s2">the company was significantly done by</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.719" end="01:34:37.600" style="s2">people synchronizing and having meetings</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.040" end="01:34:38.080" style="s2">you moved the slider on punctuality and</p>

<p begin="01:34:38.080" end="01:34:41.040" style="s2">effectiveness of the organization</p>
<p begin="01:34:39.679" end="01:34:42.560" style="s2">dropped radically and there was a point</p>

<p begin="01:34:42.560" end="01:34:46.800" style="s2">got done</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.199" end="01:34:50.159" style="s2">right so merely on the empirical</p>
<p begin="01:34:46.800" end="01:34:51.199" style="s2">dimension of utility punctuality clearly</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.159" end="01:34:53.600" style="s2">has values</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.199" end="01:34:54.400" style="s2">god damn it right and anyone who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.600" end="01:34:56.320" style="s2">understand that</p>
<p begin="01:34:54.400" end="01:34:57.440" style="s2">is just stupid i guess they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:56.320" end="01:34:59.360" style="s2">not necessarily stupid some of these</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.440" end="01:35:00.800" style="s2"> have phds right</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.360" end="01:35:02.480" style="s2">which means they got an iq of at least</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.800" end="01:35:04.960" style="s2">125 probably</p>
<p begin="01:35:02.480" end="01:35:06.639" style="s2">but the disease does something to their</p>

<p begin="01:35:06.639" end="01:35:10.560" style="s2">even think through the fact that you</p>
<p begin="01:35:08.880" end="01:35:12.960" style="s2">know means of production that involve</p>
<p begin="01:35:10.560" end="01:35:15.760" style="s2">people synchronizing in time</p>
<p begin="01:35:12.960" end="01:35:16.320" style="s2">must lose major effectiveness if we</p>

<p begin="01:35:16.320" end="01:35:21.199" style="s2">honor the value of punctuality yeah they</p>

<p begin="01:35:21.199" end="01:35:25.040" style="s2">unfortunately human human beings the</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.719" end="01:35:32.080" style="s2">often i mean this is probably why this</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.400" end="01:35:35.040" style="s2">crap festered in the academy</p>
<p begin="01:35:32.080" end="01:35:36.560" style="s2">among a few other problems and values uh</p>

<p begin="01:35:44.639" end="01:35:47.119" style="s2">because you&#39;re you&#39;re more able to</p>

<p begin="01:35:52.719" end="01:35:56.000" style="s2">is higher when you&#39;re smarter um than</p>

<p begin="01:36:08.159" end="01:36:11.360" style="s2">interesting yeah there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.520" end="01:36:12.239" style="s2">interesting psychological lab results</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.360" end="01:36:14.480" style="s2">which showed that the</p>

<p begin="01:36:14.480" end="01:36:18.239" style="s2">is the more susceptible they are to</p>
<p begin="01:36:16.000" end="01:36:19.520" style="s2">confirmation bias which is interesting</p>
<p begin="01:36:18.239" end="01:36:21.760" style="s2">sure because they can make the argument</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.520" end="01:36:23.840" style="s2">really quickly for why it must be true</p>
<p begin="01:36:21.760" end="01:36:25.920" style="s2">exactly they can rationalize and</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.840" end="01:36:27.840" style="s2">basically vibrate off their emotions</p>
<p begin="01:36:25.920" end="01:36:29.840" style="s2">and figure it out it&#39;s interesting now</p>
<p begin="01:36:27.840" end="01:36:31.679" style="s2">it&#39;s talking about psychology</p>
<p begin="01:36:29.840" end="01:36:33.520" style="s2">as i was reading in your rather</p>

<p begin="01:39:10.080" end="01:39:14.000" style="s2">the thing is</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.880" end="01:39:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s completely backwards in</p>

<p begin="01:39:15.920" end="01:39:18.960" style="s2">imagine so i often find myself saying</p>

<p begin="01:39:18.960" end="01:39:22.719" style="s2">every bit of their diagnosis was correct</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.520" end="01:39:24.400" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.719" end="01:39:27.280" style="s2">i think most of it&#39;s wrong but even if</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.400" end="01:39:29.119" style="s2">it were their prescriptions are all 100</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.280" end="01:39:30.880" style="s2">backwards their answers for what to do</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.119" end="01:39:32.880" style="s2">with the problem are a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="01:39:30.880" end="01:39:35.440" style="s2">backwards</p>
<p begin="01:39:32.880" end="01:39:36.560" style="s2">yep certainly strikes me as the case i</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.440" end="01:39:38.800" style="s2">mean frankly</p>
<p begin="01:39:36.560" end="01:39:40.000" style="s2">i&#39;m kind of old school my advice would</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.800" end="01:39:42.560" style="s2">be the same one as</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.000" end="01:39:44.400" style="s2">the traditional black grandmother which</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.560" end="01:39:45.119" style="s2">is yes there&#39;s some discrimination</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.400" end="01:39:46.960" style="s2">against you</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.119" end="01:39:49.760" style="s2">you got to work a bit harder to beat</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.960" end="01:39:51.920" style="s2">whitey right so get out there and study</p>
<p begin="01:39:49.760" end="01:39:53.280" style="s2">be diligent be at work five minutes</p>
<p begin="01:39:51.920" end="01:39:54.880" style="s2">before the hour</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.280" end="01:39:57.600" style="s2">be respectful even if you&#39;re a little</p>
<p begin="01:39:54.880" end="01:39:59.840" style="s2">cynical about authority which hell i was</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.600" end="01:40:01.119" style="s2">i&#39;ve always had a problem with authority</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.840" end="01:40:03.040" style="s2">god damn it right</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.119" end="01:40:05.600" style="s2">and that great advice from the</p>
<p begin="01:40:03.040" end="01:40:06.719" style="s2">traditional black grandmother is exactly</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.600" end="01:40:08.480" style="s2">the right way that</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.719" end="01:40:10.080" style="s2">african americans can overcome the</p>

<p begin="01:40:10.080" end="01:40:13.440" style="s2">that exists in the world and get their</p>

<p begin="01:40:13.440" end="01:40:16.800" style="s2">it pisses me off i&#39;m like i&#39;m the racist</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.920" end="01:40:19.040" style="s2">because okay</p>
<p begin="01:40:16.800" end="01:40:20.800" style="s2">if i admit yeah there&#39;s there is this</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.040" end="01:40:22.320" style="s2">friction you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.800" end="01:40:24.000" style="s2">in society but i believe that black</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.320" end="01:40:25.199" style="s2">people can actually succeed against that</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.000" end="01:40:28.800" style="s2">friction and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.199" end="01:40:30.719" style="s2">and i&#39;m the racist like you people</p>
<p begin="01:40:28.800" end="01:40:32.400" style="s2">exactly i think i&#39;ve tried the</p>

<p begin="01:44:09.880" end="01:44:13.840" style="s2">quasi-maoists and you know entirely</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.480" end="01:44:15.840" style="s2">innocent i would argue</p>
<p begin="01:44:13.840" end="01:44:17.040" style="s2">good faith correct way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.840" end="01:44:19.520" style="s2">the world was</p>
<p begin="01:44:17.040" end="01:44:21.280" style="s2">we should acknowledge current racism</p>
<p begin="01:44:19.520" end="01:44:21.520" style="s2">that still exists even at lower levels</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.280" end="01:44:24.719" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.520" end="01:44:27.520" style="s2">formally but we should aim for a future</p>
<p begin="01:44:24.719" end="01:44:28.320" style="s2">of color blindness i defined it very</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.520" end="01:44:31.440" style="s2">carefully</p>
<p begin="01:44:28.320" end="01:44:33.679" style="s2">where one&#39;s color had no more impact on</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.440" end="01:44:34.000" style="s2">your life&#39;s trajectory than the color of</p>

<p begin="01:44:34.000" end="01:44:37.679" style="s2">eyes and i made it very clear that we</p>
<p begin="01:44:36.080" end="01:44:41.040" style="s2">were talking about the future</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.679" end="01:44:43.199" style="s2">i got attacked vehemently for the word</p>
<p begin="01:44:41.040" end="01:44:45.440" style="s2">colorblind and the notion</p>
<p begin="01:44:43.199" end="01:44:46.960" style="s2">right but i did not back down</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.440" end="01:44:49.119" style="s2"> right i</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.960" end="01:44:50.880" style="s2">came back with guns blazing and i</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.119" end="01:44:53.440" style="s2">thought i did a pretty damn good job</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.880" end="01:44:55.920" style="s2">of justifying my position but of course</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.440" end="01:44:56.560" style="s2">their style online is very very</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.920" end="01:44:58.080" style="s2">vicious</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.560" end="01:44:59.760" style="s2">but i think we just got to say hey we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.080" end="01:45:01.440" style="s2">fighting the equivalent of nazis and</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.760" end="01:45:03.520" style="s2"> communists here</p>
<p begin="01:45:01.440" end="01:45:06.400" style="s2">and so we should not hold back and not</p>
<p begin="01:45:03.520" end="01:45:07.920" style="s2">be intimidated by these</p>
<p begin="01:45:06.400" end="01:45:09.600" style="s2">yeah the the thing that they have is</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.920" end="01:45:11.119" style="s2">name-calling primarily and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.600" end="01:45:12.639" style="s2">make you feel stupid like they have all</p>
<p begin="01:45:11.119" end="01:45:14.639" style="s2">these fancy definitions</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.639" end="01:45:16.000" style="s2">and trying to say oh you said colorblind</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.639" end="01:45:17.840" style="s2">so you&#39;re you&#39;ve committed some</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.000" end="01:45:19.440" style="s2">deep offense they&#39;re not telling you</p>
<p begin="01:45:17.840" end="01:45:21.440" style="s2">that they made up a new definition for</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.440" end="01:45:22.239" style="s2">colorblind that that works for their</p>
<p begin="01:45:21.440" end="01:45:24.480" style="s2">purposes</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.239" end="01:45:25.840" style="s2">nobody in reality except for you know</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.480" end="01:45:26.400" style="s2">people who aren&#39;t thinking about it very</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.840" end="01:45:28.320" style="s2">much</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.400" end="01:45:29.840" style="s2">believes that colorblind means i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.320" end="01:45:31.440" style="s2">see race so race is completely</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.840" end="01:45:32.880" style="s2">irrelevant and it has no impact in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.440" end="01:45:33.679" style="s2">world that&#39;s what they try to get you to</p>

<p begin="01:45:33.679" end="01:45:37.199" style="s2">about colorblindness now what it means</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.119" end="01:45:38.639" style="s2">is what you said about it has no impact</p>

<p begin="01:45:38.639" end="01:45:42.080" style="s2">that you&#39;re not put what it means is in</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.239" end="01:45:43.600" style="s2">the formal language i used earlier</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.080" end="01:45:45.840" style="s2">is you&#39;re not putting social</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.600" end="01:45:47.440" style="s2">significance into the racial category</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.840" end="01:45:48.719" style="s2">that has some determinant effect on</p>

<p begin="01:45:55.679" end="01:45:58.400" style="s2">to call you a name</p>
<p begin="01:45:56.800" end="01:46:00.080" style="s2">well guess what once you learn that</p>
