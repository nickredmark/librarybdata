<p begin="00:00:30.800" end="00:00:36.079" style="s2">uh no attracting stuff in the sink</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.200" end="00:00:43.200" style="s2">that would explain it yes</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.760" end="00:00:44.640" style="s2">yes once he&#39;s done with what&#39;s in the</p>

<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:53.120" style="s2">questions from three questions from</p>

<p begin="00:00:53.120" end="00:00:57.440" style="s2">and then uh pull a question that came</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.840" end="00:01:00.719" style="s2">off of the discord</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.440" end="00:01:04.159" style="s2">that was voted on by discord and then uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.719" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">walk right into questions from today so</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.159" end="00:01:09.680" style="s2">uh number one from last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:10.960" style="s2">given that having gay people in society</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.680" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">seems to be adaptive how did the</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.960" end="00:01:15.040" style="s2">homophobia and the abrahamic religions</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:18.080" style="s2">manage to survive</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.040" end="00:01:19.680" style="s2">wow i&#39;m gonna have to um</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.080" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">i&#39;m going to tantalize you with a piece</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.680" end="00:01:22.560" style="s2">of an answer without delivering the full</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:24.720" style="s2">answer because as i keep</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.560" end="00:01:25.600" style="s2">saying there&#39;s a but before you do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.720" end="00:01:28.000" style="s2">let me just say</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.600" end="00:01:30.159" style="s2">it&#39;s having gay people in a society</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.000" end="00:01:31.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t adaptive that&#39;s too universal to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.159" end="00:01:34.079" style="s2">claim right it&#39;s going to be adaptive in</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.600" end="00:01:37.200" style="s2">particular situations</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.079" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">yeah what i would say is homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.200" end="00:01:40.479" style="s2">is going to turn out to be adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:41.200" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s adaptive in</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.479" end="00:01:44.240" style="s2">every case</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.200" end="00:01:46.320" style="s2">but i would just say</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.240" end="00:01:49.200" style="s2">that i believe the answer to your</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.320" end="00:01:52.479" style="s2">question is that the homophobia</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.200" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">is also adaptive and i&#39;m not defending</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.479" end="00:01:58.960" style="s2">it but what i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:02:03.920" style="s2">is that the fact of homosexuality</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.960" end="00:02:08.319" style="s2">and the fact of resistance to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.920" end="00:02:09.920" style="s2">it being a phenomenon out in the open</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.319" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">is part and parcel of the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.920" end="00:02:15.200" style="s2">explanation which i hope to deliver</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:16.959" style="s2">soon maybe we will get a vaccine we will</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.200" end="00:02:17.840" style="s2">be able to return to the world we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.959" end="00:02:20.239" style="s2">rent a hall</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.840" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">we can wouldn&#39;t that be nice being able</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.239" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">to travel again</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">for instance we&#39;d love to do that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:27.520" style="s2">yep it would be terrific all right</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">sorry i i hate to i hate to put off an</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.520" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">answer here but</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:32.720" style="s2">it just seems like um bearing it in a q</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:35.599" style="s2">a is not the way to do it this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.720" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">important enough and enough rests on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:40.400" style="s2">way the answer</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">um functions that i think we have to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.400" end="00:02:44.480" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">in a larger form the only real driving</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.480" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">factor for men appears to be to have sex</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:49.519" style="s2">that is until they have children then</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">the main drive for most shifts to</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.519" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">equipping and protecting their offspring</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:55.040" style="s2">do you agree that these are the only two</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.080" style="s2">drives for men could they eventually</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.040" end="00:02:59.120" style="s2">negate</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.080" end="00:03:00.879" style="s2">each other wow yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.120" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">uh that&#39;s another big one there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.879" end="00:03:05.599" style="s2">in that question that i would</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">disagree with right i would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.599" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">sex is a major driving factor for men</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:14.640" style="s2">but that there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:17.519" style="s2">two versions of that there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.640" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">find a life partner version and the have</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.519" end="00:03:21.040" style="s2">sex without commitment version and those</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:24.239" style="s2">function very differently</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.040" end="00:03:27.280" style="s2">the former is closely aligned</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.239" end="00:03:28.879" style="s2">with the commitment that men</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.280" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">have to their children when their</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.879" end="00:03:32.480" style="s2">certainty of paternity is high</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.040" end="00:03:36.959" style="s2">but i wouldn&#39;t say that these are the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.080" end="00:03:39.040" style="s2">only drives either in fact i would say</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.959" end="00:03:40.560" style="s2">that one of the things that is deranging</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.040" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">society is that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.560" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">men used to be driven to</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">achieve things because it allowed them</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">to partner</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">with more desirable mates and that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:54.400" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">created a lot of the value in the world</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.400" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">as much as i think</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.640" end="00:04:03.439" style="s2">women being freed to participate in</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.360" end="00:04:05.200" style="s2">society in all kinds of different roles</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.439" end="00:04:06.640" style="s2">is a very positive thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:08.319" style="s2">that it did have this negative</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.640" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">externality which is that</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.319" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">um males are not as motivated to move</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">mountains as they once were</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:17.280" style="s2">and so anyway it would be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">have an adult conversation about</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.280" end="00:04:20.880" style="s2">how to restore the positives without</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:24.160" style="s2">banishing anyone to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.880" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">unfulfilling work</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.160" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">or work they did not prefer and surely</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a solution to that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">but it does involve us being candid and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:35.280" style="s2">not pretending uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.840" end="00:04:38.080" style="s2">that everything is categorical good bad</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.280" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">discrimination liberty that&#39;s right um</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.080" end="00:04:41.120" style="s2">and you know we explore</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:42.479" style="s2">we explore this in the book that we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.120" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">writing will be out next year and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.479" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">explore this in an essay</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:47.600" style="s2">on the evolution of sex and love uh that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">should be out</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.600" end="00:04:51.520" style="s2">any day now uh that we will perhaps talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:53.840" style="s2">about just a little bit once</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:54.800" style="s2">it is out so you&#39;ll get you&#39;ll get more</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.840" end="00:04:58.080" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.800" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">soon in this space watch the space final</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.080" end="00:05:00.800" style="s2">question from episode 38 that we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:03.600" style="s2">going back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.800" end="00:05:04.240" style="s2">in your a b political trough model brett</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.600" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">could the a</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.240" end="00:05:07.520" style="s2">and b peaks increase or decrease</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">contralaterally</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.520" end="00:05:10.800" style="s2">during societal well-being contraction</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:13.360" style="s2">and expansion</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.800" end="00:05:14.160" style="s2">love you both i&#39;m not sure i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.360" end="00:05:17.759" style="s2">exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.160" end="00:05:19.280" style="s2">uh contralaterally means but</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.759" end="00:05:20.880" style="s2">you know i i take that to be sort of if</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.280" end="00:05:21.919" style="s2">they&#39;re on if they&#39;re in a line with one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.880" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">another so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.919" end="00:05:26.000" style="s2">um you know as one increases the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:28.400" style="s2">one decreases could they</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.000" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">increase or decrease contralaterally</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.400" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">during societal</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:37.120" style="s2">well-being contraction expansion meaning</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:40.400" style="s2">that you are more likely to drop over</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.120" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">one than the other yeah yeah i see</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.400" end="00:05:47.759" style="s2">no reason to expect that they are um</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:50.320" style="s2">equally uh tall peaks</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.759" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">at any moment they may pass through it</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.320" end="00:05:54.080" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:55.759" style="s2">yeah would they oscillate um</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.039" end="00:06:12.240" style="s2">a and b you know this will work there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.039" end="00:06:13.680" style="s2">a model that would work for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.240" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">different situations across a number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.680" end="00:06:18.960" style="s2">different moments in time</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">so well i kind of did i at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.960" end="00:06:22.639" style="s2">did a prototype version which involves a</p>

<p begin="00:06:22.639" end="00:06:26.080" style="s2">a marxist failure mode and a fascist</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.080" end="00:06:29.199" style="s2">that&#39;s right you did um and so i would</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:32.840" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.199" end="00:06:35.680" style="s2">yeah the danger of those um is not</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.840" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">inherently equal it may equalize over</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.680" end="00:06:38.560" style="s2">time because</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">basically it&#39;s a question of which</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">deaf to at the moment you&#39;re more likely</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">to go over the peak</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:46.800" style="s2">that you can&#39;t see than the one that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:49.199" style="s2">see because</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.800" end="00:06:51.039" style="s2">recent history has informed you about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">at any one moment clearly there is going</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.039" end="00:06:53.759" style="s2">to be a greater risk of one than the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:55.840" style="s2">other although</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.759" end="00:06:57.440" style="s2">one thing that is interesting about this</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.840" end="00:07:00.560" style="s2">moment is how</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:07:02.479" style="s2">uh is how loudly uh some</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.560" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">on the fringe left are yelling about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.479" end="00:07:06.080" style="s2">possibility of one outcome</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">when many of us actually find the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.080" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">outcome much more likely</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.759" end="00:07:13.440" style="s2">yeah so i would say this is i think a</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:15.680" style="s2">case where you don&#39;t want to over</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.440" end="00:07:17.440" style="s2">instantiate the model the model works as</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.680" end="00:07:18.880" style="s2">a loose metaphor and it tells you</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.440" end="00:07:20.479" style="s2">sort of roughly what the dangers are but</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.880" end="00:07:22.080" style="s2">if you try to map it onto the world and</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.479" end="00:07:23.280" style="s2">be precise about the height of the peaks</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.080" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">and things</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.280" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">you are liable to lose the value of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">and turn it into something</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">that will inherently be false because</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:35.599" style="s2">the map will be imprecise</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:39.360" style="s2">all right this uh question from</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.599" end="00:07:40.479" style="s2">the voters on discord um</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.360" end="00:07:42.720" style="s2">let&#39;s see i got one of them that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.479" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">going to hold off for for next time</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.720" end="00:07:46.080" style="s2">for reasons that i talked to the guy who</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:48.080" style="s2">sent it to me about so</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.080" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">we are left with what might explain the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.080" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">success of the sabbath day of rest</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:53.360" style="s2">strategy used by religions</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s a hedge against the harms</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.360" end="00:07:55.840" style="s2">of transitioning from hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">lifestyles to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.840" end="00:07:59.840" style="s2">agricultural lifestyles or is there a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">deeper reason and do any other animals</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.840" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">sabbath um i think i deployed an</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">answer in one of my very early videos</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:10.400" style="s2">that right after the evergreen thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.400" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">we did talk about so the model i&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:18.319" style="s2">for sabbath for a long time is</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:21.440" style="s2">that it is a an instantiation of</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.319" end="00:08:24.560" style="s2">a um it is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.440" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">adaptive state that risks a game</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.560" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">theoretic failure and sabbath is the way</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">to resist the game theoretic failure and</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">so the way it works is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">let&#39;s say that it is better for society</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">for everybody to take off at least one</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:39.919" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">a week that working seven days a week it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.919" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">causes you</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">to distance yourself from your family</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:45.519" style="s2">and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:47.680" style="s2">results in all sorts of externalized</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.519" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">harms that aren&#39;t good for anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.680" end="00:08:51.760" style="s2">so there needs to be a rule that says</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:54.880" style="s2">take a day off a week but</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.760" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">if you take a day off a week then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.880" end="00:08:57.040" style="s2">in a puzzle let&#39;s say that you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:58.480" style="s2">shopkeeper</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.040" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">and what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.480" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">figure out the day of the week that</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">is taking off and the shop is closed and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:06.480" style="s2">then you open your shop up and you clean</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:08.560" style="s2">up because people who are looking to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.480" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">shop on that day come to your shop</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">and so what that does is it puts</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:15.760" style="s2">everybody in motion trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">whether or not a given day is the right</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.760" end="00:09:18.560" style="s2">one to take off in order to take</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:18.959" style="s2">advantage of the fact that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.560" end="00:09:22.320" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.959" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">is not doing the job on that day</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.320" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">so this causes another problem</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">which is it may be that if people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">playing that game trying to find the day</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">on which their shop will do best</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">that actually you will cheat and what</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:38.640" style="s2">you will do is you will</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:39.839" style="s2">not close your shop because actually you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.640" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">want to clean up from the days that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.839" end="00:09:42.320" style="s2">everybody is</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:44.320" style="s2">it&#39;s an end run around it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.320" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">a formalized prescription to avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.320" end="00:09:48.800" style="s2">tragedy of the commons</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">exactly and so you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.800" end="00:09:54.480" style="s2">um god says take a day off</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:56.880" style="s2">every week and you can&#39;t and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.480" end="00:09:57.839" style="s2">day and this is the day and the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.880" end="00:10:00.640" style="s2">what that allows</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.839" end="00:10:01.920" style="s2">to happen is that people can enforce</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.640" end="00:10:03.680" style="s2">god&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:05.360" style="s2">because if you open your shop on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.680" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">sabbath then you&#39;re being sacrilegious</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.360" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">and people will shun you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">so that they are not co-stigmatized for</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:12.720" style="s2">shopping on a day that you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">supposed to be selling them stuff</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.720" end="00:10:17.040" style="s2">so anyway that&#39;s the basic point is game</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">theory explains a formulation in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.040" end="00:10:19.839" style="s2">god picks a day</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">and everybody adheres to it and anybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.839" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t adhere to it is obviously in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">violation</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">that&#39;s the way to frustrate the race to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:27.680" style="s2">the bottom that otherwise unfolds</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">yeah and with regard to any other</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.680" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">animals taking sabbath we don&#39;t know of</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">any other animals that manage to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">tragedy of the commons race to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:37.200" style="s2">bottom etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">so uh so you know without any external</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.200" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">metaphorical enforcement like uh god</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:45.040" style="s2">will frown on this behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">i know i know of no such thing that said</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.040" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">there are regular intervals of rest but</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">they tend to be imposed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:53.440" style="s2">abiotic forces external abiotic forces</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">like winter</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.440" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">yeah um i&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:00.240" style="s2">some example somewhere because</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:02.000" style="s2">in eleanor ostrom&#39;s work she</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.240" end="00:11:02.959" style="s2">demonstrates how culture after culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.000" end="00:11:05.440" style="s2">avoids</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.959" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">game theoretic failures through</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.440" end="00:11:09.360" style="s2">essentially informal agreements that are</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:11.680" style="s2">often enforced through</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.360" end="00:11:12.480" style="s2">religious belief structures and so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.680" end="00:11:15.600" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.480" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">is these things evolve which means</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.600" end="00:11:19.680" style="s2">there&#39;s no bar to them evolving in some</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.079" end="00:11:30.240" style="s2">certainly does and so something that</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.320" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">some superstition that evolved that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.240" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">that was adhered to by everyone could</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">look this way what you really need is a</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">uh penalty mechanism because the problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.920" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:43.760" style="s2">that a free rider that recognizes the</p>

<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">is at advantage which is why the game</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.600" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">theory works the way it does and so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">you need is a mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:56.800" style="s2">in which collective</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:57.120" style="s2">policing serves this function but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.800" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">not</p>

<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:08.800" style="s2">wolves that kind of thing so um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.800" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">it may occur to us later or somebody may</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">message us with an example but uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">certainly</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:16.880" style="s2">not there&#39;s nothing about the</p>

<p begin="00:12:16.880" end="00:12:21.519" style="s2">it&#39;s just that most creatures won&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.320" style="s2">the important feature that lets it work</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.519" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.320" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">the mechanism to penalize a stranger</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">to penalize a stranger without a cost</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.079" end="00:12:33.120" style="s2">that would be prohibitive</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:36.720" style="s2">right okay first question</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.120" end="00:12:38.000" style="s2">from last hours live stream girls i meet</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.720" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">are divided into those who have</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.000" end="00:12:43.200" style="s2">intellectual interests</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:44.560" style="s2">like sensitive men but are very woke</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.200" end="00:12:46.560" style="s2">and the less woke who are not very</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.560" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">intellectual who seem to be consumerists</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.560" end="00:12:51.279" style="s2">and prefer traditional gender roles</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:52.240" style="s2">as a young man how can i date today well</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.279" end="00:12:54.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.240" end="00:12:55.920" style="s2">bleak binary picture that you have</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.079" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">painted</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.920" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">and i don&#39;t envy anyone being young and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:06.399" style="s2">entering the dating market right now</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">um i guess i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.399" end="00:13:10.399" style="s2">i&#39;m a little devastated about that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">description uh i know there are people</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.399" end="00:13:15.200" style="s2">who young women who are both</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.639" style="s2">intellectual and not woke</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.200" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know where they hang out</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.639" end="00:13:19.200" style="s2">particularly used to hang out in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:21.440" style="s2">classrooms</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.200" end="00:13:22.399" style="s2">but those don&#39;t exist anymore yeah but i</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.440" end="00:13:24.880" style="s2">think the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.399" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">we even know that many of the young</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.880" end="00:13:29.600" style="s2">women who were in our</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">classrooms uh you know continue into the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.600" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">world some of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.880" style="s2">remain single and some of them are not</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">but i think the thing is they suggest</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.880" end="00:13:39.839" style="s2">a fact which is many many people are</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.680" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">finding something</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.839" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">very troubling in the mating and dating</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">market</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:49.360" style="s2">and my recommendation would be</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:50.959" style="s2">you figure out the mechanism you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.360" end="00:13:52.800" style="s2">using to figure out who to date</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.959" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">is directing you to people who fall into</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.800" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">one of two categories that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:58.639" style="s2">resonate with um the key i&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:01.839" style="s2">figure out how to define</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.639" end="00:14:03.760" style="s2">and maybe create</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.839" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">that that third fourth fifth whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.760" end="00:14:06.399" style="s2">is category uh that will have people in</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:08.160" style="s2">it who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.399" end="00:14:10.240" style="s2">more interested in yes where would those</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:12.079" style="s2">people tend i mean you know if they are</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.240" end="00:14:15.120" style="s2">decrying the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.079" end="00:14:16.800" style="s2">men who uh yeah fit with their model</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.120" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">we certainly i mean this is now a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.800" end="00:14:18.720" style="s2">of years old but we certainly would hear</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.720" end="00:14:22.000" style="s2">students of both sexes straight students</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">from of both sexes</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.000" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">um that they were having a very hard</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:27.199" style="s2">time finding people uh with whom they</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">were interested in having a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.199" end="00:14:30.560" style="s2">yep and i you know for the most part</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:31.600" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t about their standards being</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:34.320" style="s2">ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.600" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">right no i think in large measure it has</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.320" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">with um almost everybody below a certain</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:42.160" style="s2">age having been</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:45.199" style="s2">sold a false bill of goods about</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.160" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">what is valuable and that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.199" end="00:14:48.320" style="s2">you&#39;re looking for the people who know</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:49.839" style="s2">that the description of what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.320" end="00:14:53.040" style="s2">supposed to be pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.839" end="00:14:55.920" style="s2">is hollow and you know largely driven by</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:57.040" style="s2">um people who want to sell you something</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.920" end="00:14:58.000" style="s2">rather than people who are actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.040" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">looking out for your interest</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.000" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">so my recommendation would be figure out</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">how to escape that you&#39;re looking for</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:06.240" style="s2">oddballs</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">um you that could be a very rewarding</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.240" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">uh relationship or search for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.320" style="s2">relationship and when you find</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:14.079" style="s2">the right person where do you find the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.320" end="00:15:16.160" style="s2">oddballs like what it depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.079" end="00:15:17.519" style="s2">kind of oddballs you want</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.160" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">you know one of my first guesses would</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.519" end="00:15:22.160" style="s2">be um</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">look for people who are doing something</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.160" end="00:15:25.360" style="s2">physical you know backpacking clubs or</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:27.440" style="s2">bicycling or</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.360" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">you know sports teams you know summer</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.440" end="00:15:30.639" style="s2">leagues pick up</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:33.040" style="s2">pickup games of something that are co-ed</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.639" end="00:15:36.880" style="s2">ultimate frisbee being particularly</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.040" end="00:15:39.759" style="s2">um responsive to co-ed sport</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.880" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">um just because as i&#39;ve said many many</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.759" end="00:15:42.959" style="s2">times</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:44.320" style="s2">and you have said as well uh engaging</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.959" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">with the world physically</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.320" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">makes it really so much harder to accept</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:50.720" style="s2">a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.000" end="00:15:51.199" style="s2">the work of garbage that uh requires</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.720" end="00:15:54.399" style="s2">that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.199" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">sort of have no feedback from the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.399" end="00:15:57.120" style="s2">and you know physical engagement with</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">the world gives you that feedback and so</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.120" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">you get to you hone</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:01.839" style="s2">your insight and i i think i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">is now hypothesis but</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.839" end="00:16:05.440" style="s2">given that i&#39;ve seen so few people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:07.360" style="s2">are you know rock climbers or</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.440" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">carpenters or you know otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.360" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">engaging the world in a real way</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">who are also really buying into the work</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:14.320" style="s2">stuff i think that it basically hones</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">your brain such that it&#39;s harder for you</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.320" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">to accept that totally</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.120" style="s2">socially created conclusions that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.240" end="00:16:23.440" style="s2">intersectional</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.120" end="00:16:26.959" style="s2">bullshit provides i&#39;m having the thought</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.440" end="00:16:30.639" style="s2">of a um a shirt</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.959" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">for the postmodern rock climbing club</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.639" end="00:16:36.720" style="s2">in which the shirt depicts a</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">cliff rising above the cliff is the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.720" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">sound of somebody falling ah</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">because that&#39;s what would happen in</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:44.639" style="s2">post-modern rock climbing yeah um i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:46.480" style="s2">it could just even be post-modern rock</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.639" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">climbing club and could have the coyote</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.480" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">suspended above cliff not recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">uh gravity yet yes oh that too</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.800" style="s2">there you go that&#39;s that&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:58.160" style="s2">that uh the idea that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.800" end="00:17:00.079" style="s2">the rules of physics don&#39;t apply to you</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.160" end="00:17:02.240" style="s2">until you recognize that they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.079" end="00:17:03.920" style="s2">uh is super amusing when it&#39;s a cartoon</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.240" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">coyote but not so amusing when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.920" end="00:17:06.000" style="s2">actually contending with these people uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:07.679" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.000" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">over issues of you know whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.679" end="00:17:11.199" style="s2">to defund the police</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:13.120" style="s2">i thought that cartoon was about market</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.199" end="00:17:14.319" style="s2">failure as depicted through the acme</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.120" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.319" end="00:17:16.799" style="s2">i think they were doing pretty well for</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:18.240" style="s2">themselves weren&#39;t they i guess they</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.799" end="00:17:21.679" style="s2">were yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.240" end="00:17:24.000" style="s2">yeah all right um well i would actually</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.679" end="00:17:25.120" style="s2">suggest though this is just a proof of</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.000" end="00:17:28.319" style="s2">concept but</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.120" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">um you say that you are encountering</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.319" end="00:17:35.600" style="s2">uh girls i would suggest you start</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.480" style="s2">searching for women uh and you are</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.600" end="00:17:39.039" style="s2">finding women</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.480" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">who have intellectual interests they</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.039" end="00:17:44.080" style="s2">like sensitive men</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:46.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a little suspect um</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:48.080" style="s2">and they&#39;re very woke well here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.320" end="00:17:51.840" style="s2">thing where would you find</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.080" end="00:17:53.120" style="s2">intellectual women who have no patience</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.840" end="00:17:55.520" style="s2">for woke</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.120" end="00:17:57.200" style="s2">i would say the rationalist community</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.520" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">would be one place you would find such</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.200" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">people now those people are certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">quirky but they tend to be quirky in a</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">kind of delightful way so</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:06.480" style="s2">if that&#39;s the dynamic you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:08.480" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.480" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">seek out a community where that</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.480" end="00:18:13.600" style="s2">formulation doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:16.400" style="s2">okay i mean right i it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.600" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s not all that numerous</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.400" end="00:18:20.240" style="s2">well and my guess would also be that the</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.559" end="00:18:22.080" style="s2">sex ratio is rather skewed in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.240" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">direction that this person writing in</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.080" end="00:18:25.280" style="s2">would not prefer</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:26.799" style="s2">but that&#39;s those are those are the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:28.000" style="s2">stereotypes i hold in my head that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.799" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">true but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.000" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">like it&#39;s a community nested within some</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:34.880" style="s2">other communities</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">right and so anyway all i&#39;m saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.880" end="00:18:37.679" style="s2">really it was just a proof of concept</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.840" style="s2">which is there&#39;s a place</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.679" end="00:18:41.200" style="s2">in which that formulation wouldn&#39;t add</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.840" end="00:18:43.520" style="s2">up yep so</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.200" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">it&#39;s also there will be others and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.520" end="00:18:46.799" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not suggesting you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:48.240" style="s2">take up with the rationalist community</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.799" end="00:18:49.280" style="s2">cynically it&#39;s also an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.240" end="00:18:51.919" style="s2">community i think</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.280" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">there are some ways in which there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.919" end="00:18:56.480" style="s2">some things that i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:56.880" style="s2">they get as well as they might but um</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.480" end="00:18:58.480" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.880" end="00:19:00.480" style="s2">we all don&#39;t get something as well as we</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.480" end="00:19:02.240" style="s2">might and it would be an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.480" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">place to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.240" end="00:19:07.360" style="s2">to spend time yep</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:09.120" style="s2">please expand on religion as extended</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.360" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">phenotype if it is an innate human</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.120" end="00:19:12.240" style="s2">behavior how do i meet that need without</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:14.480" style="s2">feeling like a hypocrite</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.240" end="00:19:16.720" style="s2">or causing cognitive dissonance can we</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.480" end="00:19:20.240" style="s2">use open label placebo</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.720" end="00:19:23.360" style="s2">we know it&#39;s not real but it still works</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.240" end="00:19:24.559" style="s2">so open label placebo is his uh i</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">presume his</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.559" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">uh request for a label for such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:34.799" style="s2">yeah open label placebo um</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">so which is you know which is literally</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.799" end="00:19:40.480" style="s2">false metaphorically true that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the the same category yeah i mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.480" end="00:19:43.440" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:45.039" style="s2">how do you meet the need this is in some</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.440" end="00:19:48.559" style="s2">sense going to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.039" end="00:19:51.440" style="s2">a personal question and i think</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.559" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">it depends a lot on who you are and what</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.440" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:56.160" style="s2">you&#39;re meeting some of us do not find</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">that the absence</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.160" end="00:19:58.960" style="s2">of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.360" end="00:20:06.000" style="s2">metaphysical ultimate level</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.880" end="00:20:07.120" style="s2">explanation robs life of meaning others</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.000" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">do find it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.120" end="00:20:10.960" style="s2">frightening so really depends on what</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:12.880" style="s2">thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.960" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">you it&#39;s it&#39;s like a little bit like</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.880" end="00:20:16.240" style="s2">buying a house</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.520" style="s2">you need to figure out what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.240" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">you absolutely require</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.520" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">and which things that others require are</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">places that you can borrow from to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">what you want</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:30.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know i mean you know i i figure</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">out what your values actually are</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.640" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">yeah and what you know so i guess the</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:36.320" style="s2">the thing maybe that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">struggling with slightly pushing back</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.320" end="00:20:40.400" style="s2">against in this question is the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:42.720" style="s2">an innate human behavior right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.400" end="00:20:45.039" style="s2">i think we see that religion or</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.720" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">religious-like tendencies are universal</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.039" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">across all human cultures um where it</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">has been</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">sought by anthropologists seeking such</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.919" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:59.440" style="s2">so the universality of an evolved</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.919" end="00:21:01.919" style="s2">cultural thing does not</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.440" end="00:21:02.720" style="s2">inherently mean innate and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.919" end="00:21:04.320" style="s2">won&#39;t find us</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.720" end="00:21:06.080" style="s2">actually choosing usually to use the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.320" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">word innate because it</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.080" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">it does raise these questions of well</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">then you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:13.120" style="s2">do you even have a choice and more to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:15.600" style="s2">the point it raises the question for</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.120" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">something as complex as religion</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.600" end="00:21:19.760" style="s2">which is what&#39;s what&#39;s it for what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:22.720" style="s2">know what is the purpose of it</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.760" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">what is it that all these religious and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.720" end="00:21:25.440" style="s2">religious like beliefs are actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">doing for people and you know you</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.440" end="00:21:29.440" style="s2">pointed out one of them</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:31.200" style="s2">in your answer um you know i believe in</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.440" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">a metaphysical being that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.200" end="00:21:35.039" style="s2">um created and or is looking out for all</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:36.960" style="s2">of us</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.039" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">um but of course we know that it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.960" end="00:21:41.039" style="s2">know they also bring together community</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">it acts as a kind of social safety net</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.039" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">um so you know part of the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:46.880" style="s2">you know we are likely seeing a growth</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:48.559" style="s2">in the governmental social safety net in</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.880" end="00:21:50.559" style="s2">the mid-20th century is as</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.559" end="00:21:52.080" style="s2">religion declines as one that people can</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.559" end="00:21:55.280" style="s2">rely on</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.080" end="00:21:58.480" style="s2">and you know do we want do we all</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.280" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">want to have a social safety net of some</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.480" end="00:22:02.000" style="s2">sort in place</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.840" end="00:22:03.280" style="s2">i think i think the vast majority of us</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.000" end="00:22:06.159" style="s2">do um but</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.280" end="00:22:07.679" style="s2">should that be um in you know within a</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.159" end="00:22:11.760" style="s2">religious community that might</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.679" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">also might also make demands of you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.760" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">that you would not otherwise want</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:16.240" style="s2">demanded of you so you know what are all</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.240" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">needs that uh religion may meet</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:24.159" style="s2">and figure out which of those things are</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:25.919" style="s2">your top five values and priorities and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.159" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">and then figure out from there what you</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.919" end="00:22:28.480" style="s2">want to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.720" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">yep what are your thoughts on the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.679" end="00:22:35.360" style="s2">origins of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">life small questions today by the way</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.159" style="s2">thank you very much for your podcast i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">thrilled by an opportunity to ask</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.159" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">questions of world-class scientists are</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:44.400" style="s2">all professors in the u.s like you</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:45.360" style="s2">yes all of them uh you are the brushes i</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.400" end="00:22:47.600" style="s2">wish i would have had</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.360" end="00:22:49.360" style="s2">thank you for that that&#39;s very nice so</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.600" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">the the first question was what are your</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.360" end="00:22:53.760" style="s2">thoughts in the origins of life</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">yes uh well i&#39;m for it yep and i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.760" end="00:22:56.640" style="s2">it happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:58.000" style="s2">i hate to be late to the party but uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.640" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">you know i&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.000" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">you&#39;re here um i&#39;m a drinker</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">i do actually um</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a tough question look we could</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">ask this with some regularity</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">i think people are fascinated for</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">understandable reasons</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">in uh you know origin of life questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:23.919" style="s2">it&#39;s one it&#39;s outside the realm</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">of what we actually study it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.919" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">you know if you find a cosmologist and</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">you ask them</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">well what&#39;s outside the universe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:34.559" style="s2">like well you just</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:35.679" style="s2">hit the border of where my expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.559" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">relevant</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.679" end="00:23:39.280" style="s2">and so here&#39;s the thing i&#39;m not worried</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:41.440" style="s2">about whether there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.280" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">uh origin of life explanation i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.440" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">actually quite convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:50.960" style="s2">life straightforwardly arises</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">from certain dynamics it was very</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.960" end="00:23:54.000" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">and therefore will have done so many</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.000" end="00:23:57.840" style="s2">many many times across the universe</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">yeah i find it almost inconceivable that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.840" end="00:24:02.720" style="s2">it would be uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">rare given</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.720" end="00:24:06.559" style="s2">conditions that are conducive on on</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:07.760" style="s2">planets that are within certain</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.559" end="00:24:11.520" style="s2">constraints et cetera</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.760" end="00:24:14.000" style="s2">right but um or large asteroids</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.520" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">the details yeah large afterwards not so</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.000" end="00:24:18.240" style="s2">much probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:20.400" style="s2">it&#39;s i think it&#39;s possible yeah not not</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.240" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">on but not in our solar system</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.400" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">um but anyway i&#39;m not sure quite what to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">say about it</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">i thought um you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">back in 1976 dawkins proof of concept</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">that there</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">you could lay out a a narrative</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">of essentially</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.679" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">non-living chemistry being selected by</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.520" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">wind blowing things across a dry</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:48.880" style="s2">landscape and something sticking and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:50.799" style="s2">something is not sticking</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.880" end="00:24:52.080" style="s2">um that was in the selfish gene yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.799" end="00:24:52.640" style="s2">you know he didn&#39;t present it as this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.080" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">the answer</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.640" end="00:24:56.640" style="s2">yes here&#39;s the story here&#39;s a possible</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">story you know and i&#39;m not sure it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.640" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">his to begin with but i think the basic</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">point is</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.799" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">life is the extension</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:10.240" style="s2">of a deeper pattern of selection</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:10.960" style="s2">that it is selection plus heredity that</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.240" end="00:25:14.240" style="s2">gives you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.960" end="00:25:16.080" style="s2">adaptation which eventually gives rise</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.240" end="00:25:17.440" style="s2">to things that you would automatically</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.080" end="00:25:20.720" style="s2">recognize as living</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.440" end="00:25:23.520" style="s2">but selection happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">in the inorganic world all the time and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.520" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">it results in</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:28.960" style="s2">all of the patterns you are capable of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">detecting that are outside of biology</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.960" end="00:25:34.159" style="s2">so that same process</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">happens onto a pathway that leads to</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.159" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">something we call life</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:39.679" style="s2">um at some point but it&#39;s not i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.240" end="00:25:42.320" style="s2">think it&#39;s in any way surprising that it</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.679" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">does that with some regularity so</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.320" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">um i guess the thing that i&#39;m getting at</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:50.960" style="s2">is people i think mistake the difficulty</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">for isolating what the exact pathway was</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.960" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">for the difficulty in establishing that</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:56.720" style="s2">there is a pathway by which it would</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.360" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">happen and i think one of these is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.720" end="00:25:59.360" style="s2">very low bar and one of them is a very</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:01.440" style="s2">high bar</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.360" end="00:26:03.360" style="s2">but the fact that it&#39;s hard to know what</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.440" end="00:26:04.159" style="s2">happened here because the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.360" end="00:26:10.320" style="s2">gone</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.159" end="00:26:13.120" style="s2">is not in and of itself daunting</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.320" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">teaching an environment after x number</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.120" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">of years doesn&#39;t produce mozart or bach</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">studies link brain differences and gifts</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">in sport and science</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.919" style="s2">jordan peterson talks about iq and life</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.679" style="s2">success why does nobody talk about</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.919" end="00:26:27.679" style="s2">inequality with regard to talents</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.679" end="00:26:30.080" style="s2">and iq is it because of political</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.679" end="00:26:33.200" style="s2">correctness and social justice</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.080" end="00:26:33.840" style="s2">thinking um couldn&#39;t we help find early</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.200" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">talents</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.840" end="00:26:40.320" style="s2">and so reform education um</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:41.520" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a hidden assumption here</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.320" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">that i think is just</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.520" end="00:26:48.400" style="s2">dead wrong iq is real</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:51.679" style="s2">but people tend to assume that iq is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.400" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">genetically encoded which i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.679" end="00:26:53.919" style="s2">there&#39;s much less evidence for than</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:56.240" style="s2">people think</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.919" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">because what they find is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.240" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">hereditary but hereditary can mean</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">all kinds of things that have everything</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:05.039" style="s2">to do with external</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:07.679" style="s2">influences rather than a blueprint</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.039" end="00:27:09.520" style="s2">for how to do cognition that exists in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.679" end="00:27:12.559" style="s2">the genome which it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.520" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">so anyway i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.559" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">people assume too much from the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">they hear the word iq they assume that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:20.799" style="s2">that&#39;s a parameter that you are given</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:23.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.799" end="00:27:23.840" style="s2">you know your structure for hemoglobin</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.360" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.840" end="00:27:27.120" style="s2">they proceed from there and in fact iq</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.120" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">much more plastic than people imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.880" style="s2">and that we will eventually figure that</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">out and it does mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.880" end="00:27:38.240" style="s2">that the chances that we are similarly</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">cognitively capable between populations</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.240" end="00:27:41.520" style="s2">are much higher i would rate them as</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:44.559" style="s2">much higher than other people</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.520" end="00:27:47.600" style="s2">uh would tend to but in the end i&#39;m i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.559" end="00:27:48.880" style="s2">just betting that&#39;s where it&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">all right there&#39;s a ton more to say</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.880" end="00:27:51.440" style="s2">there but maybe in the interest of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">getting through more questions we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.440" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">stop there</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:57.200" style="s2">consider the idea that much if not all</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.360" end="00:28:01.120" style="s2">motive power of current social</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">disharmony is a symptom of the four new</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.120" end="00:28:05.360" style="s2">kinds of radiation</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.799" style="s2">coming to us around the sun since 1993</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.360" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">ubc among them</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.799" end="00:28:11.760" style="s2">and increasing in magnitude affecting</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">humanity&#39;s evolution</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know anything about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.200" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if this is true 93 yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.360" end="00:28:20.159" style="s2">don&#39;t this this i&#39;ve never heard this it</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.399" style="s2">strikes me off</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.159" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">down my head is as something i i</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.399" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t believe if you said it to me</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.399" end="00:28:32.080" style="s2">um but uh four new kinds of radiation</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:34.080" style="s2">coming to us around the sun since 1993</p>

<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:11.440" style="s2">the only way would be complete</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.799" end="00:29:24.559" style="s2">about um the lead being taken out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.600" end="00:29:26.720" style="s2">gasoline</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.559" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">and we see rates of violent crime</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.720" end="00:29:30.080" style="s2">decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">um you know rates of violent crime in</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.080" end="00:29:34.240" style="s2">1970s in cities</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.080" end="00:29:35.679" style="s2">uh was quite high and lead was taken out</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:38.080" style="s2">of gas in</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.679" end="00:29:39.200" style="s2">late 70s something i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.080" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">exactly when</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.200" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">but somehow it it tracks really nicely</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">like it it does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">um you know in that again saying that</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">does not suggest that lead was the cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">of all violent crime</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">um but that seemed um led in the air uh</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:55.760" style="s2">seemed to both decrease general iq in</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:58.480" style="s2">people who lived</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.760" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">in uh very air polluted areas and also</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.480" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">increase</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">uh rates of um violence criminality so</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:05.919" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not that there couldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">some abiotic factor that is contributing</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.919" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">to something</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:11.919" style="s2">but it seems too too global too global</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">and i mean we also just don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.919" end="00:30:15.520" style="s2">know maybe it&#39;s you know hole in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">ozone layer is what&#39;s being alluded to</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.520" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">here yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">which would then be semi we&#39;d expect the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.919" style="s2">penguins to be going crazy first</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:24.559" style="s2">well they are because look at how they</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.919" end="00:30:27.840" style="s2">dress um all the time</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.559" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">all the time yeah um but so yes</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.840" end="00:30:34.840" style="s2">um you&#39;re right that global</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:37.840" style="s2">use of tetraethyl lead would cause</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.840" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">um does seem to have caused some level</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.840" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">of social disruption or at least</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">plausibly dead</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">um what i&#39;m doubting is four new kinds</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:47.600" style="s2">of radiation</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">this yeah and i mean this may just be</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.600" end="00:30:51.440" style="s2">imprecisely written you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:52.080" style="s2">for four things that weren&#39;t reaching</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.440" end="00:30:55.120" style="s2">the earth</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.080" end="00:30:55.840" style="s2">before i don&#39;t know i mean but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.120" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.840" end="00:30:59.600" style="s2">the little thing that i got into</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">thinking about ubc in the last couple of</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.600" end="00:31:02.240" style="s2">weeks</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">yep ubc is hitting the earth at higher</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">rates now since uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">since the ozone hall has been has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:11.279" style="s2">growing so that&#39;s you know that&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">least a possible connection here</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.279" end="00:31:14.880" style="s2">next question keep up the good work you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:17.120" style="s2">once mentioned that market</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.880" end="00:31:18.320" style="s2">markets are not a good tool for science</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.120" end="00:31:20.000" style="s2">would you consider saying that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.320" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">government is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.000" end="00:31:25.679" style="s2">tool either for science for some issues</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">or wait no the government is not a good</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.679" end="00:31:29.200" style="s2">tool for science or the</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">government not a good tool for science</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.200" end="00:31:34.000" style="s2">either yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:35.760" style="s2">um oh government is a terrible tool for</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.000" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">some things i would argue that science</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.760" end="00:31:38.159" style="s2">is not one of them because what science</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:40.240" style="s2">really needs is</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.159" end="00:31:41.679" style="s2">insulation from markets which means that</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.240" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">somebody needs to fund</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.679" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">that which we need done and to be done</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.159" end="00:31:49.120" style="s2">insensitively to what the market</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:50.720" style="s2">thinks of the conclusion yeah so what we</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.120" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">had you know so the government is an</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.720" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">answer that solves the problem of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">being done by rich aristocrats</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">right science being only available to</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">people who are sort of landed gentry</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:07.279" style="s2">good government good governance is</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:09.679" style="s2">a manifestation of the public</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.279" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">well-being so in order to get the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.679" end="00:32:14.880" style="s2">science done that is in our</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">collective interest governance</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.880" end="00:32:18.880" style="s2">good governance is able to direct the</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:22.080" style="s2">resources and immunize</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.880" end="00:32:24.960" style="s2">the process from um</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.080" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">from market forces so i would say and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.960" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">allows a wider swath of humanity access</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">to becoming scientists yep</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:33.519" style="s2">so i think this is one of these cases</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:36.000" style="s2">where we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.519" end="00:32:37.600" style="s2">malignant government and so people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.000" end="00:32:39.279" style="s2">distrustful of it rightly</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.600" end="00:32:41.039" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t an indictment of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.279" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">governance it&#39;s an indictment of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.039" end="00:32:46.159" style="s2">corrupt government</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:47.519" style="s2">structures that we currently have yep</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.159" end="00:32:49.919" style="s2">how would you respond to people whose</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.519" end="00:32:51.279" style="s2">response to an unpopular scientific fact</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.919" end="00:32:52.720" style="s2">is that most scientific studies are</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.279" end="00:32:53.760" style="s2">corrupted by the institutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.720" end="00:32:55.519" style="s2">funding them</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.760" end="00:32:57.279" style="s2">are there any means for regular that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.519" end="00:33:00.000" style="s2">non-scientist people to find out the</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.279" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">reliability of any study</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.000" end="00:33:06.320" style="s2">this is an important question and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.840" end="00:33:07.840" style="s2">at some level going to require that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.320" end="00:33:11.279" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.840" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">some of the both some of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.279" end="00:33:15.039" style="s2">sort of code words that people use in</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:16.399" style="s2">the papers</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.039" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">uh within the fields that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.399" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">interested in discerning</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:22.960" style="s2">and um become at least capable you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:24.159" style="s2">somewhat scientifically literate</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.960" end="00:33:25.519" style="s2">yourself that said</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.159" end="00:33:27.279" style="s2">the peer-reviewed literature the primary</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.519" end="00:33:28.480" style="s2">literature is mostly such a mess</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.279" end="00:33:30.480" style="s2">that i really don&#39;t want to recommend</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.480" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">that to anyone unless you are required</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.480" end="00:33:34.480" style="s2">to do it so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">you know how do we how do we encourage</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.480" end="00:33:36.720" style="s2">people to become more scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:39.679" style="s2">literate</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.720" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">and to actually assess themselves what a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.679" end="00:33:42.240" style="s2">study says given that you know as we</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.679" style="s2">have as we have</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.240" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">shown time after time right here</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.679" end="00:33:49.200" style="s2">and we used to all the time in our</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:52.320" style="s2">classrooms uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.200" end="00:33:55.200" style="s2">not only are is most primary literature</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.320" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">um flawed to some degree and written so</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.200" end="00:33:58.640" style="s2">as not to be decipherable by many people</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:00.640" style="s2">outside of the field</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.640" end="00:34:02.080" style="s2">but the media when when individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.640" end="00:34:03.200" style="s2">research is covered by the media it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.080" end="00:34:06.320" style="s2">almost always done so</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.200" end="00:34:08.399" style="s2">so badly that if you just take the media</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.320" end="00:34:08.879" style="s2">cover of a story you will end up with</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.399" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.879" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">wrong assessment of what the research</p>

<p begin="00:34:20.560" end="00:34:24.480" style="s2">are you going to as a private citizen be</p>

<p begin="00:34:45.520" end="00:34:51.119" style="s2">the best thing you can do</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.879" end="00:34:52.879" style="s2">is find somebody with a track record of</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.200" end="00:35:00.720" style="s2">a naseem tele like figure can be your</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.720" end="00:35:04.640" style="s2">to what high quality work looks like and</p>

<p begin="00:35:04.640" end="00:35:09.839" style="s2">so you can sort of proxy and of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">nassim has his blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.839" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">but his problem he&#39;s following him is</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">probably</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:16.640" style="s2">better than it is trying to you know</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.640" end="00:35:21.040" style="s2">yeah in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.040" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">hopeless i mean because this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">something that</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:28.560" style="s2">um i in particular used to try to help</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:32.240" style="s2">students with is try to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.560" end="00:35:34.079" style="s2">demonstrate how to become intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.240" end="00:35:35.520" style="s2">consumers unfortunately of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.079" end="00:35:37.119" style="s2">scientific literature</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.520" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">and you know with the recognition going</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.119" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">in that it&#39;s not written</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:42.800" style="s2">um to be understood by outsiders and yes</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:44.240" style="s2">scientists view everyone who&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.800" end="00:35:46.079" style="s2">actively doing science in that field for</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.240" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">the most part as outsiders</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.079" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">um so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not it&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">uncorrupt uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:56.000" style="s2">phenomenon at all so</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">one one thing and this is by no means</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.000" end="00:35:59.040" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">uh is to look for the hypothesis you</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.040" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">know if you are actually looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:04.640" style="s2">at a paper that was written here a piece</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:06.160" style="s2">of primary literature meaning paper</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.640" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">a paper written by the people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.160" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">actually did the research itself</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:12.320" style="s2">look for the hypothesis clearly stated</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">up front in both the abstract and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.320" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">introduction</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">and increasingly scientists who are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:18.960" style="s2">hypothesis driven will game this and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">pretend that they had hypothesis all</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.960" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">along and put it up front</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.079" style="s2">but it&#39;s also amazing how many papers</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:25.680" style="s2">don&#39;t even pretend</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.079" end="00:36:27.280" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re looking at research</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.680" end="00:36:28.400" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t even pretend that it had a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.280" end="00:36:30.000" style="s2">hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.400" end="00:36:31.760" style="s2">uh then i would say right away you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.000" end="00:36:33.520" style="s2">say i you know i just i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.760" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">need to spend time here</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.520" end="00:36:36.800" style="s2">um and when i you know when we were</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:39.200" style="s2">professors and i was</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.800" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">asked to do peer review of papers uh for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.200" end="00:36:44.720" style="s2">a variety of journals</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:48.240" style="s2">it was amazing to me how many papers</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.720" end="00:36:50.079" style="s2">my primary review that went back was</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.240" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">i see no evidence of a hypothesis here i</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.079" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">can&#39;t recommend that you publish this</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.880" style="s2">i was not particularly beloved among</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">journal editors as a result because</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.880" end="00:37:00.720" style="s2">the number of papers coming in that just</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.760" style="s2">had no pretense hypothesis was</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.720" end="00:37:05.599" style="s2">amazing yeah no it is a total failure</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.760" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">but even in the case of the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.599" end="00:37:08.880" style="s2">that have it i think you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:10.079" style="s2">a situation</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.880" end="00:37:13.200" style="s2">and i&#39;ve forgotten what the name of this</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.079" end="00:37:16.960" style="s2">principle is but um</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.200" end="00:37:20.240" style="s2">you are often where you are an expert</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.960" end="00:37:22.160" style="s2">able to detect just how bad reporting is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.240" end="00:37:23.920" style="s2">just journalistic reporting on something</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.160" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">where you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.920" end="00:37:27.839" style="s2">and then the reporting and every other</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">thing looks okay um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.839" end="00:37:31.200" style="s2">now increasingly that&#39;s not true but 10</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:34.320" style="s2">years ago that was</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.200" end="00:37:36.160" style="s2">a widely reported</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.320" end="00:37:38.320" style="s2">pattern what that means is that the</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.160" end="00:37:39.760" style="s2">reporting sucks in all of those places</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.320" end="00:37:41.599" style="s2">you&#39;re just capable of detecting it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.760" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">the one where you have the expertise</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.599" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">and my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.640" end="00:37:50.560" style="s2">science it&#39;s like that right</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.760" end="00:37:52.240" style="s2">you will find in each place there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.560" end="00:37:55.520" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s not being said</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.240" end="00:37:59.040" style="s2">you know i mean you can look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.520" end="00:38:01.520" style="s2">the sars cove to stuff</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.040" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">uh from the beginning about the natural</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.520" end="00:38:05.280" style="s2">origin of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:06.720" style="s2">right you had to have a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.280" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">expertise to be able to spot how</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.720" end="00:38:10.560" style="s2">nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:13.040" style="s2">filled this story was but if you did</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.560" end="00:38:14.400" style="s2">have it it was clear and yet you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.040" end="00:38:16.839" style="s2">and if you didn&#39;t have it you were told</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.400" end="00:38:19.599" style="s2">you were cracked by conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.839" end="00:38:20.160" style="s2">hypothesis right for believing it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.599" end="00:38:21.760" style="s2">a thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.160" end="00:38:23.680" style="s2">exactly and so you know to this day</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.760" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with that outgrowth which</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:26.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:28.079" style="s2">uh to see the emptiness of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.880" end="00:38:31.200" style="s2">explanation</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:33.760" style="s2">of the natural origin explanation is to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.200" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">sideline yourself um but i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.760" end="00:38:36.160" style="s2">expect</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.640" end="00:38:40.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not on you the fact is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.040" end="00:38:41.680" style="s2">fields are broken they&#39;re broken because</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.560" end="00:38:43.359" style="s2">of perverse incentives</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.680" end="00:38:44.960" style="s2">it&#39;s rare to find a field where that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.359" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">really not true</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.960" end="00:38:49.119" style="s2">and but i mean i i i applaud the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:50.320" style="s2">question so i feel like you&#39;re giving</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.119" end="00:38:52.960" style="s2">the person writing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.320" end="00:38:54.400" style="s2">out but i don&#39;t think i&#39;m going to guess</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.960" end="00:38:57.920" style="s2">here given the name</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.400" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">that she uh wants an out she&#39;s looking</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.920" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.320" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">a road forward right like some what what</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:07.040" style="s2">can i do as someone who is not</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">uh a scientist to interpret</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.040" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">scientific findings um and not just have</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:13.760" style="s2">sit down and shut up when people say ah</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:16.079" style="s2">you can&#39;t trust that because</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.760" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">institutions corrupt science it is both</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.079" end="00:39:19.359" style="s2">true that institutions corrupt science</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:21.839" style="s2">and that good science is done</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.359" end="00:39:23.440" style="s2">well yes on the other hand it&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.839" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">you know if the person said</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.440" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">um i&#39;m not comfortable with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:30.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">the products i buy uh result in</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.480" end="00:39:34.480" style="s2">the misery of the people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:36.079" style="s2">producing them or the people downstream</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.480" end="00:39:39.359" style="s2">from the pollutants and making them</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.079" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">how can i um you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.359" end="00:39:43.200" style="s2">build my life around products that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:45.440" style="s2">hurt people and the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.200" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">you can&#39;t it&#39;s not on you if this is</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.440" end="00:39:49.440" style="s2">something we have to collectively solve</p>

<p begin="00:39:49.440" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.880" end="00:39:55.280" style="s2">um so you know i don&#39;t like saying that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.200" style="s2">but i also don&#39;t want to lead you to</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.280" end="00:39:58.160" style="s2">believe that there&#39;s a good solution to</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.200" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">i think it&#39;s a little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.160" end="00:40:00.800" style="s2">though okay um because with regard to</p>

<p begin="00:40:38.160" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">do so terrific but</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.760" end="00:40:44.480" style="s2">if you suffer all the costs of</p>

<p begin="00:40:50.720" end="00:40:55.200" style="s2">and not simply make the collective</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:58.079" style="s2">better oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.200" end="00:40:58.720" style="s2">i get why this person wants to do this</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.079" end="00:41:01.680" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.720" end="00:41:02.319" style="s2">want them to do this but i also know</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.680" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.319" end="00:41:08.560" style="s2">wading into fields in which you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:09.440" style="s2">reciprocity networks in which people are</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.560" end="00:41:11.040" style="s2">you know</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">i mean look here&#39;s the thing the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.359" end="00:41:21.599" style="s2">year before the replication crisis broke</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.599" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">it was completely obvious that there</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:26.640" style="s2">would be one and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.800" end="00:41:28.640" style="s2">psychology psychology is where it broke</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.640" end="00:41:31.040" style="s2">first any place that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.640" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">statistics and p-values it was obvious</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.040" end="00:41:33.440" style="s2">that there was a perverse incentive that</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">was going to result</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.440" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">in the complete derangement of all of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">the work downstream of this</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">because the way you advanced your career</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:42.560" style="s2">was to publish papers the way you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">publish papers was to get significance</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.560" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">the way you got significance</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:47.760" style="s2">was to you know massage your day green</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">jelly beans cause cancer</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.760" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">they sure do yeah right they sure do</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:52.960" style="s2">jelly beans cause cancer so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">look</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.960" end="00:41:56.720" style="s2">it was obvious there was a replication</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.640" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">crisis in light of a replication crisis</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.720" end="00:42:00.319" style="s2">how do you figure out which results in</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:02.960" style="s2">psychology are right</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:05.839" style="s2">turns out pretty close to none of them</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.960" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">right so what do you do about that</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.839" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s just nothing to do you know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:10.480" style="s2">you know the thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">i mean it is the personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.480" end="00:42:14.880" style="s2">vortex the thing to do is to demand</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:16.319" style="s2">science that actually works and the way</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.880" end="00:42:18.319" style="s2">you do that is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.319" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">provide an incentive structure that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.319" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t cause people to publish bad work</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">in order to advance their careers</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">now we do need a drink</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">given so this is very much like a</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">question that we started with</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:35.839" style="s2">um so we may just uh refer back to that</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:37.839" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.839" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">given one human society&#39;s need for</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.839" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">religion and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.400" style="s2">two the waning of religion in the west</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">might the rise of the number of people</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.400" end="00:42:47.440" style="s2">who are willing to adopt or invent</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">bsc ideologies be tied to their now</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.440" end="00:42:49.839" style="s2">desperate innate need to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:52.640" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.839" end="00:42:53.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what bsc is here i feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.640" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">like i&#39;m just forgetting an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.920" end="00:42:58.319" style="s2">acronym</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">um but so this this</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.319" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">this differs a little bit from the</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:02.560" style="s2">earlier question or questions about</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.560" end="00:43:07.359" style="s2">uh and then it asks whether or not uh we</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">we feel a need to believe in something</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.359" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">that that belief</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:12.880" style="s2">may be a sort of a human universal</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:15.839" style="s2">desire</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.880" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">and that in a in a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.839" end="00:43:19.200" style="s2">becoming</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.880" style="s2">uh less coherent simultaneously more</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.200" end="00:43:23.119" style="s2">global so that we can see</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.880" end="00:43:25.440" style="s2">apparently uh what everyone else is</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.119" end="00:43:28.720" style="s2">doing even though we know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.440" end="00:43:32.319" style="s2">highly curated if not worse</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:35.599" style="s2">and we can well maybe maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.319" end="00:43:37.680" style="s2">maybe that so i would i think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.599" end="00:43:39.920" style="s2">something very much to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.680" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">that we have a need to believe but i</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:42.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think it works the way people</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:46.319" style="s2">think it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.079" end="00:43:49.040" style="s2">um so it drives people crazy especially</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.319" end="00:43:50.960" style="s2">uh died in the wool of science types</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.040" end="00:43:53.119" style="s2">when i say you can&#39;t do science without</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.960" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">a certain amount of faith drives them</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.119" end="00:43:56.319" style="s2">crazy yes it does</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:43:58.319" style="s2">but it&#39;s absolutely true it&#39;s me too a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">little bit it&#39;s provable</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.319" end="00:44:01.599" style="s2">well but here&#39;s the thing it&#39;s not much</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">of a claim right</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.599" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">the fact is you do not know that this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:07.359" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.599" style="s2">all a hallucination and in fact there</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.359" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">are explanations that could make it one</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.599" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">right if this was a simulation maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a simulation to see</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.839" style="s2">what a mind-like collection of circuits</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.680" end="00:44:19.359" style="s2">does with certain kinds of information</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.839" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">you can&#39;t prove that that&#39;s not where</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.359" end="00:44:24.560" style="s2">you are so you have to have faith but we</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:27.040" style="s2">can&#39;t get very far if we spend time on</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.560" end="00:44:28.640" style="s2">on such a hypothesis right worthless so</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.040" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">the point is what do you do</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.640" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">you you&#39;ve got two choices okay we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">i&#39;m going to dichotomize i&#39;m going to go</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:35.599" style="s2">i&#39;m going to go ibra max candy on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">right oh boy</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.599" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">but this is a real dichotomy you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">two choices you can spend</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">your entire life on one question</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:45.359" style="s2">on which you are guaranteed to make no</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:49.040" style="s2">progress</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.359" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">right or you can decide that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.040" end="00:44:52.240" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:54.400" style="s2">i&#39;m going to take on faith that this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.240" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">not a simulation designed to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.400" end="00:44:58.640" style="s2">what my collection of circuits will do</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:00.160" style="s2">with information that looks like this in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.640" end="00:45:02.079" style="s2">fact i&#39;m real</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.160" end="00:45:03.839" style="s2">tables are real i have mechanisms to</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.079" end="00:45:05.599" style="s2">figure out who they are if i go into the</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.839" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">laboratory i can run an experiment and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.599" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">it involves</p>

<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:13.680" style="s2">or worse</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.200" end="00:45:15.680" style="s2">right i can assume that i have the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.680" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">ability to detect the actual world and</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">that that allows me to do science and</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">discover things</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">and my feeling is tell you what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.920" style="s2">the cost that&#39;s good what&#39;s the cost</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">if i just accept i can&#39;t rule out that</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.920" end="00:45:28.480" style="s2">this is a simulation designed to see</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:30.319" style="s2">what i will do</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.480" end="00:45:31.839" style="s2">but assuming it&#39;s not i can do all this</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.319" end="00:45:32.640" style="s2">other stuff i&#39;m just gonna take it on</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.839" end="00:45:35.920" style="s2">faith that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.640" end="00:45:38.240" style="s2">universe is real and uh if it ain&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.920" end="00:45:39.680" style="s2">the cost is zero okay so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.240" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">believe something in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:42.480" style="s2">progress in whatever realm it is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.200" end="00:45:45.680" style="s2">trying to make progress</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.480" end="00:45:47.359" style="s2">in right but the thing is that thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">once you do that once you accept that</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.359" end="00:45:49.280" style="s2">first little bit of faith then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:51.599" style="s2">going to find it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.280" end="00:45:52.640" style="s2">so much well and i mean that one&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.599" end="00:45:54.160" style="s2">ultimate bargain</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.640" end="00:45:56.000" style="s2">i&#39;m guaranteed to waste everything for</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.160" end="00:45:58.240" style="s2">nothing or i get</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.000" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">access to everything based on a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.240" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">faith i&#39;m not going to worry too much</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">about it so you&#39;re going to give</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">abram candy credit for this no i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:06.079" style="s2">going to go dichotomous because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">actually dichotomous in this case</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.079" end="00:46:09.440" style="s2">but but the point is okay you accept</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.440" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s such a you know it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">rush to actually believe that the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">universe is real and that you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:17.200" style="s2">interact with it right</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:18.079" style="s2">it&#39;s just such a great reward that then</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.200" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">you say well</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.079" end="00:46:20.960" style="s2">maybe there&#39;s some other bargains not</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:22.160" style="s2">quite as good as that one i get</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.960" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">everything for nothing</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:26.640" style="s2">but i get a lot for a little right all</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">the heuristics that make your visual</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.640" end="00:46:29.920" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:30.480" style="s2">work you are taking on faith that things</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.920" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">end where</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.480" end="00:46:34.640" style="s2">they seem to end right and generally</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:36.079" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.640" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">and then occasionally they don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.079" end="00:46:39.440" style="s2">know what happens when they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:41.359" style="s2">you plummet to your death no well</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.440" end="00:46:42.480" style="s2">sometimes sometimes but try not to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.359" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">that so okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.480" end="00:46:46.880" style="s2">i&#39;m working on it you can get this all</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">from like a couple of subreddits right</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.880" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got the subreddits that</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:52.480" style="s2">focus on</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">you know optical illusions and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.480" end="00:46:55.119" style="s2">always optical but optical is a very</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">compelling one</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.119" end="00:46:59.440" style="s2">right where your heuristics mislead you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:01.520" style="s2">and you see something that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.440" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">right right and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.520" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">subreddit what could go wrong</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">one of your favorites i know well you</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">can learn all sorts of things</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">sometimes late at night before you go to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">bed you&#39;re scrolling through</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">that like dude how do you sleep do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:15.040" style="s2">know how many dreams look like i will</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:17.359" style="s2">never know how many deaths i have</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.040" end="00:47:19.359" style="s2">avoided because i&#39;m a devotee of what</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.359" end="00:47:22.240" style="s2">could go wrong and i learn about these</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.359" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">things on my phone rather than by making</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.240" end="00:47:29.359" style="s2">the error so anyway the point is</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:30.240" style="s2">heuristics are like an algorithmic kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.359" end="00:47:33.119" style="s2">of faith</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.240" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">right they trade on the fact that your</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:36.400" style="s2">system for</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:38.240" style="s2">using photons bouncing around a room to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.400" end="00:47:39.200" style="s2">assess where objects are and how you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.240" end="00:47:40.880" style="s2">interact with them</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.200" end="00:47:42.160" style="s2">actually work and in general it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.880" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">good deal you don&#39;t even think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.160" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">making a deal</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:46.880" style="s2">and then every so often you get one</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">wrong and it becomes oh yeah it was a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.880" end="00:47:50.160" style="s2">heuristic and every so often you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:51.359" style="s2">one and one in a thousand times the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.160" end="00:47:53.200" style="s2">heuristic fails</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.359" end="00:47:54.480" style="s2">so anyway my point is yes we need to</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.200" end="00:47:55.839" style="s2">believe things because we&#39;re structured</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.480" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">to use heuristics because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.839" end="00:48:00.400" style="s2">damn bargain</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">and then sometimes you pay the cost but</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.400" end="00:48:05.839" style="s2">um the question is how much does this</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:06.720" style="s2">have to do with our need to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.839" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.720" end="00:48:10.000" style="s2">a being above who gives a damn about us</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.000" end="00:48:13.680" style="s2">yep and i think it differs a lot for</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">different people i don&#39;t need there to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.680" end="00:48:17.520" style="s2">be a god above</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:18.800" style="s2">yeah some people do but i think it is a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.520" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">mistake to assume</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.800" end="00:48:23.359" style="s2">that our need to believe in something is</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:24.800" style="s2">synonymous with our need to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.359" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">purpose in the universe because some</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.800" end="00:48:26.800" style="s2">people have that need and some people</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.800" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">yeah uh 50 minutes oh boy uh let me just</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.119" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">uh to defend you against uh the idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.119" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">that you&#39;re spending your last waking</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">minutes</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">looking at what could go wrong and i</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:44.480" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine how you sleep i tend to</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">spend my last waking minutes reading</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.480" end="00:48:47.839" style="s2">about well</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:49.920" style="s2">if the last week is any uh indicator</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.839" end="00:48:52.079" style="s2">either north korea or 20th century china</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.920" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">which also does not exactly make for</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.079" end="00:48:55.200" style="s2">wonderful dreams so</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">i suppose to each their own uh with</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.200" end="00:48:57.520" style="s2">regard to how to plague their own dream</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:48:59.599" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.520" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">in fact in both those cases the only</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.599" end="00:49:03.200" style="s2">reason that china and north korea are</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:05.119" style="s2">not on what could go wrong because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.200" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">hard to know how to photograph the whole</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.119" end="00:49:09.440" style="s2">thing yeah yeah yeah oh man there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:10.160" style="s2">many good questions that we&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.440" end="00:49:13.680" style="s2">to get to</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.160" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">most of them let me do um</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.680" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">one more here and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:21.440" style="s2">then we&#39;ll go to the superchat from this</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.400" end="00:49:23.520" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.440" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">should unity promote platonic dialogues</p>

<p begin="00:49:46.960" end="00:49:50.960" style="s2">look to be honest with you i think unity</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.760" end="00:49:54.480" style="s2">2020</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.960" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">is a manifestation it is</p>

<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.079" style="s2">are many versions in many different</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:02.960" style="s2">realms and frankly they have to get</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.079" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">together right i think unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.960" end="00:50:08.079" style="s2">has a lot to do with blockchain</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:09.599" style="s2">and i think it has a lot to do with open</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.079" end="00:50:10.640" style="s2">source and i think it has a lot to do</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.640" end="00:50:16.800" style="s2">and idw and that all of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:17.680" style="s2">proof of concept prototypes that have</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.800" end="00:50:20.960" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.680" end="00:50:22.640" style="s2">some canonical problem in some zone</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.960" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">and the point is we need to stop</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.640" end="00:50:26.400" style="s2">recognizing them as separate projects we</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">need to recognize that really</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.400" end="00:50:30.079" style="s2">it is the overarching project we are</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:31.760" style="s2">about which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.079" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">how do we take all of the various</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.760" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">failure modes learn from them</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:36.720" style="s2">and build around them for the next phase</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:38.079" style="s2">of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.720" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t there ain&#39;t going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.079" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">be a next phase of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:45.680" style="s2">so yes to your point but maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:48.800" style="s2">expand it a bit</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.680" end="00:50:50.480" style="s2">uh so we&#39;re switching to the next uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.800" end="00:50:52.160" style="s2">super chat but i want to make i want to</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">read one more comment from this one and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.160" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">then we will come back to some of these</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:57.280" style="s2">questions in</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">episode 40. suggestion turn defund</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.280" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">into refund at the police refund doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:03.119" style="s2">make sense in terms of normal policing</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:05.119" style="s2">and lends itself to better unpacking and</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.119" end="00:51:06.800" style="s2">conversation so i read that because i</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.119" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">actually had exactly this thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.800" end="00:51:11.760" style="s2">earlier today and thought</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:12.240" style="s2">um you know how it rhymes it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.760" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">match</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.240" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">otherwise and uh you know i think i</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:19.119" style="s2">think what we really want is and</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:20.480" style="s2">is more funding than we had before in</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.119" end="00:51:22.079" style="s2">order to</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.480" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">start fixing the problems and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.079" end="00:51:25.839" style="s2">potentially scale back but</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">it&#39;s at least potentially an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.839" end="00:51:31.280" style="s2">linguistic starting point</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:34.240" style="s2">yes um two problems one</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.280" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">the word refund and refund are two</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.240" end="00:51:37.440" style="s2">different things</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">um but you know maybe maybe you can get</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.440" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">around that</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:42.640" style="s2">um because you know in a defund the</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">police world refund seems to be the</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.640" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">opposite</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">but the other thing is i really want you</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:48.559" style="s2">know i don&#39;t want to be caricatured as</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.359" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.559" end="00:51:52.960" style="s2">who thinks we need huge police budgets</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.359" end="00:51:54.160" style="s2">yeah i just think that the police</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">budgets are large</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.160" end="00:51:58.319" style="s2">because the police are being used to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.000" end="00:52:00.240" style="s2">solve a set of problems that are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.319" end="00:52:01.599" style="s2">best solved by the police which is not</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.240" end="00:52:03.920" style="s2">so far</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.599" end="00:52:05.200" style="s2">from a credible version of the claims</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.920" end="00:52:08.960" style="s2">that are being made but</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.200" end="00:52:09.440" style="s2">the point is that argues for doing it</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.960" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.440" end="00:52:12.640" style="s2">you know to the extent that the police</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:14.880" style="s2">are dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.640" end="00:52:16.480" style="s2">a mental health crisis because we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.880" end="00:52:18.400" style="s2">no solution for people</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.480" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">who have crippling mental health issues</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.400" end="00:52:22.000" style="s2">and therefore end up</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:23.200" style="s2">on the streets involved in petty and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.000" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">worse crime</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.200" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">that&#39;s not an elegant solution to this</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:29.359" style="s2">problem at all</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:31.599" style="s2">the police don&#39;t belong in that equation</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.359" end="00:52:33.680" style="s2">except very rarely and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:35.040" style="s2">figuring out how not to use the police</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.680" end="00:52:38.400" style="s2">as a cheap solution</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.040" end="00:52:40.880" style="s2">to problems is the key so</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.400" end="00:52:42.400" style="s2">at some level i want enough i want</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.880" end="00:52:44.079" style="s2">people to be imaginative enough that</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.400" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">what we&#39;re really saying is</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.079" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">render the police less necessary</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:50.160" style="s2">right let&#39;s get them out of the jobs</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:52.240" style="s2">they shouldn&#39;t be doing and let&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:55.359" style="s2">them do the jobs they need to be doing</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.240" end="00:52:56.720" style="s2">and you know there&#39;s a lot a lot a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.359" end="00:52:58.480" style="s2">is possible but not if</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.720" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">your point is let&#39;s go after the police</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.480" end="00:53:03.359" style="s2">and let&#39;s be personal about it</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:05.119" style="s2">on a scale from unicycle to 18 wheeler</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.359" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">how tired are you of the kleptocraptic</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.119" end="00:53:09.440" style="s2">duopoly</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:10.640" style="s2">did it say kleptocraptic uh no it</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.440" end="00:53:13.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i made that up</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.640" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">leptocratic on a scale from unicycle to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.760" end="00:53:16.720" style="s2">18 wheeler how tired are you of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:19.920" style="s2">kleptocratic</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.720" end="00:53:20.640" style="s2">duopoly um i like kleptocraptic i would</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.920" end="00:53:24.599" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.640" end="00:53:25.760" style="s2">i am panamax boat tired of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.599" end="00:53:29.280" style="s2">kleptocraptic</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.760" end="00:53:31.119" style="s2">duopoly they have no wheels at all</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.280" end="00:53:32.800" style="s2">we&#39;re simply measuring wheels i thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.119" end="00:53:34.720" style="s2">it was like getting unrecycled 18 wheel</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.800" end="00:53:38.079" style="s2">that looks like a wheel continuum to me</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.720" end="00:53:41.119" style="s2">it does but it was also a size continuum</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.079" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">and so uh you know panamax boat panama</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.119" end="00:53:44.880" style="s2">i&#39;ll tell you what if it&#39;s about wheels</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.720" style="s2">some of the panamax boats these are</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.880" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">boats that are the maximum dimensions to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.720" end="00:53:52.240" style="s2">fit in the locks of the panama canal</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:54.559" style="s2">they&#39;re very big and some of them if i</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.240" end="00:53:57.119" style="s2">understand it correctly actually have</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.559" end="00:53:58.079" style="s2">basically factories in them that finish</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.119" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">automobiles</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.079" end="00:54:03.520" style="s2">in transit to basically smooth out the</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">supply chain so that you&#39;re not wasting</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.520" end="00:54:07.680" style="s2">time you know the cars are sitting idle</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:09.440" style="s2">on their way they could also be being</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.680" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">finished on their way</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.440" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">so anyway a panamax boat full of cars</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:14.880" style="s2">that are in the process of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.920" style="s2">finished</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.880" end="00:54:21.119" style="s2">has six wheels per average</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.920" end="00:54:24.559" style="s2">car that&#39;s a lot of wheels six</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.119" end="00:54:27.040" style="s2">i think all you got four</p>

<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:03.200" style="s2">founded on enlightenment values of many</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.680" end="00:56:03.920" style="s2">great intellectuals like jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.200" end="00:56:05.599" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.920" end="00:56:07.520" style="s2">it may be the last place offering a real</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.599" end="00:56:08.880" style="s2">humanities education we were actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.520" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">one of the many things that we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.880" end="00:56:14.160" style="s2">able to do because of lockdown was</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:17.200" style="s2">go to i think it was to be their first</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.160" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">big weekend-long event</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.200" end="00:56:21.040" style="s2">uh that was supposed to be maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:22.960" style="s2">savannah um this last spring</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.040" end="00:56:24.319" style="s2">uh as i understand it it&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.960" end="00:56:25.680" style="s2">operational yet and i doubt it will</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.319" end="00:56:27.760" style="s2">become operational</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.680" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">in the near future given that so many</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.760" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">colleges are failing to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.440" end="00:56:33.839" style="s2">to operate</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">but yeah jordan peterson is on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.839" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">board or the founding people</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:40.240" style="s2">there are a lot of good people</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:42.480" style="s2">associated with it</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.240" end="00:56:44.240" style="s2">but i do not think that it is yet</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.480" end="00:56:46.599" style="s2">happening but yeah for people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.240" end="00:56:48.960" style="s2">know about it ralston college</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.599" end="00:56:49.599" style="s2">r-a-l-s-t-o-n which i think is actually</p>

<p begin="00:56:49.599" end="00:56:53.599" style="s2">happening in savannah georgia um they</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.559" end="00:56:55.680" style="s2">have a website and you can learn a</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.599" end="00:56:58.400" style="s2">little bit about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.680" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">in game of thrones the unsullied are in</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.400" end="00:57:01.520" style="s2">army and bunix</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">would eunuchs make acceptable soldiers</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.520" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">in the real world or is it functional</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:07.200" style="s2">fictional nonsense or awoke pun what</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">would such an army&#39;s strengths and</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.200" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">weaknesses be</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:15.119" style="s2">thanks from echo well</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">geez i don&#39;t know i mean the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.119" end="00:57:19.280" style="s2">the unsullied</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">in game of thrones is that we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.280" end="00:57:24.400" style="s2">by what mechanism they were trained</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:26.640" style="s2">and so we actually don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.400" end="00:57:27.760" style="s2">incentives drive them we know what</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.640" end="00:57:31.359" style="s2">incentives have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.760" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">removed from them but game of thrones</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.359" end="00:57:34.480" style="s2">explores</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">this trope in multiple places where it</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.480" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">basically i mean theon greyjoy</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:43.359" style="s2">gets remanufactured as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:47.440" style="s2">mental slave of i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.359" end="00:57:48.960" style="s2">ramsay yeah but anyway the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.440" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">could rebuild somebody</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.960" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">by altering and and varus ah</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:56.079" style="s2">i wanted to bring up varys because but</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.160" style="s2">okay so but before you speak so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.079" end="00:57:59.920" style="s2">you&#39;re focusing entirely on incentives</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.160" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">and whether or not it would sort of work</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.920" end="00:58:04.960" style="s2">coherently as an army behaviorally</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:06.480" style="s2">um i suspect given some of echo&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.960" end="00:58:08.079" style="s2">previous questions that she is at least</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.480" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">as interested in the question</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.079" end="00:58:12.319" style="s2">of anatomy and physiology and so it</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:16.799" style="s2">really depends</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.319" end="00:58:19.040" style="s2">on at what point this would-be army</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.799" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">had these unfortunate surgeries done to</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:23.359" style="s2">them that</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">little boys uh who are castrated are not</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.359" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">going to become</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:27.520" style="s2">uh warriors who are able who are going</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:30.000" style="s2">to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.520" end="00:58:31.119" style="s2">uh actually win against actually intact</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.000" end="00:58:34.000" style="s2">male armies</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.119" end="00:58:35.599" style="s2">right uh if they were castrated after</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.000" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">they&#39;d gone through male puberty</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.599" end="00:58:39.119" style="s2">um they would have uh you know male</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:40.720" style="s2">anatomy</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.119" end="00:58:42.880" style="s2">and male you know male physiology and</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.720" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">physique and and body mass and all of</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.880" end="00:58:45.920" style="s2">that and yes it would change somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:48.240" style="s2">at the point that they were no longer</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.920" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">producing much testosterone on their own</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.240" end="00:58:51.599" style="s2">um but they would they would be built</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">like men whereas</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.599" end="00:58:54.880" style="s2">uh you castrate a little boy and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:56.720" style="s2">not gonna end up being built like a man</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.880" end="00:58:59.200" style="s2">and so it wouldn&#39;t be an effective army</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.720" end="00:59:00.000" style="s2">right and so in some sense this goes</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.200" end="00:59:02.160" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">your distinction between uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.160" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">organizational and activational effects</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.920" style="s2">which i think is if you wanted to invest</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:09.440" style="s2">somewhere in a piece of knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.920" end="00:59:10.880" style="s2">would liberate you from all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.440" end="00:59:12.400" style="s2">scientific nonsense this would be a</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.880" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">great place to do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.400" end="00:59:17.599" style="s2">um but then you also have the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:19.280" style="s2">technological question which is</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.599" end="00:59:20.640" style="s2">okay if you get the advantage of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.280" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">organizational effects</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.640" end="00:59:27.359" style="s2">that make a masculinized army and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">you get presumably the control that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.359" end="00:59:31.839" style="s2">this question is predicated on a um</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:33.200" style="s2">someone who wants to control an army</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.839" end="00:59:35.119" style="s2">they&#39;re wondering if such an army would</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.200" end="00:59:39.200" style="s2">work so that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.119" end="00:59:41.040" style="s2">um the organizational effects create the</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.200" end="00:59:42.000" style="s2">masculinized body which is better for</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.040" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">fighting the</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.000" end="00:59:47.680" style="s2">lack of the androgens</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:48.319" style="s2">being produced increases control but</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.680" end="00:59:49.599" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.319" end="00:59:52.000" style="s2">technologically speaking you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.599" end="00:59:54.079" style="s2">introduce and remove androgens at will</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.000" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">which allows even greater control so if</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.079" end="00:59:58.079" style="s2">you imagine</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">the unsuspecting in modern times right</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.079" end="01:00:00.480" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">so the last thing i was going to say on</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">this topic is that um</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:10.480" style="s2">uh martin no the author</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:11.599" style="s2">uh oh george george r martin tells us</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.480" end="01:00:14.000" style="s2">something about what</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.599" end="01:00:16.720" style="s2">he actually thinks about this castration</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.000" end="01:00:19.280" style="s2">stuff because he says</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.720" end="01:00:21.359" style="s2">as people are talking about varus in</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.280" end="01:00:23.599" style="s2">early seasons</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.359" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">that nobody trusts a eunuch which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.599" end="01:00:27.599" style="s2">ironic because in some sense the eunuch</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">should be more trustworthy by virtue of</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.599" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">the fact</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:31.359" style="s2">that they&#39;re not being jerked around by</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:33.599" style="s2">their gonads but</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.359" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">martin&#39;s point if it fits martin&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.599" end="01:00:38.079" style="s2">and i assume it is</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:42.400" style="s2">is that the lack</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.079" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">of this distortion of maleness it makes</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.400" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">the person less reliable because you</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">don&#39;t know actually what they&#39;re after</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:50.079" style="s2">no clues to motive right men can be</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:52.240" style="s2">relied upon to be after certain things</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.079" end="01:00:55.119" style="s2">and a man who is not after those things</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.240" end="01:00:55.520" style="s2">is a mystery and therefore dangerous um</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.119" end="01:00:57.520" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.520" end="01:00:58.720" style="s2">anyway i don&#39;t know an unsolid army</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.520" end="01:01:01.359" style="s2">could you know if</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.720" end="01:01:03.040" style="s2">if they had masculinized bodies</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.359" end="01:01:06.480" style="s2">sufficiently enough to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.040" end="01:01:08.400" style="s2">adequate warriors could actually be</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.480" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">more confusing and surprising and</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.400" end="01:01:13.440" style="s2">therefore more powerful against</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:15.520" style="s2">intact male armies yes although in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.440" end="01:01:16.720" style="s2">case of the unsullied they are so well</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.520" end="01:01:18.400" style="s2">trained that even</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.720" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">liberated they are not the least bit</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.400" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">liberated right</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.960" end="01:02:00.319" style="s2">into the book that we&#39;re writing</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">in the chapter on parenthood and</p>

<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:06.799" style="s2">um and in part because</p>

<p begin="01:02:06.799" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">know evolutionary parenting</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.559" end="01:02:12.400" style="s2">isn&#39;t yet a field there are some you</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:14.000" style="s2">know halfway decent</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.400" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">things that i feel like i read</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.000" end="01:02:19.599" style="s2">occasionally but mostly</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">it was us figuring things out as we went</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:23.039" style="s2">alone</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:25.200" style="s2">from an evolutionary perspective</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.039" end="01:02:26.880" style="s2">watching as these amazing little</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.200" end="01:02:29.920" style="s2">critters</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.880" end="01:02:31.039" style="s2">quickly started trying to game their</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.920" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">situation</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.039" end="01:02:36.400" style="s2">and us and we responded</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.160" style="s2">with with love and putting a stop to</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.400" end="01:02:41.119" style="s2">their gaming</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.160" end="01:02:42.480" style="s2">um so i i&#39;m gonna try just general</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.119" end="01:02:46.240" style="s2">framework</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.480" end="01:02:48.799" style="s2">general framework is kids are designed</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.240" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">to be parented they are designed to be</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.799" end="01:02:52.559" style="s2">raised</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:53.119" style="s2">the purpose of childhood is to make</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.559" end="01:02:56.240" style="s2">highly</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.119" end="01:02:56.960" style="s2">functional adults the purpose of life is</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.240" end="01:03:00.000" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.960" end="01:03:03.520" style="s2">to be satisfied it is to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.000" end="01:03:06.160" style="s2">functional and all of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.520" end="01:03:06.640" style="s2">amounts to a system that works pretty</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.160" end="01:03:09.920" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.640" end="01:03:10.559" style="s2">by intuition except for one fact which</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.920" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.559" end="01:03:14.079" style="s2">you live in the modern world and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:16.160" style="s2">modern world is not the one</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.079" end="01:03:17.680" style="s2">for which children are designed and it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.160" end="01:03:18.400" style="s2">is not the one for which parents are</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.680" end="01:03:20.799" style="s2">designed</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.400" end="01:03:21.680" style="s2">and that means that you need to be hyper</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.799" end="01:03:24.480" style="s2">vigilant</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.680" end="01:03:25.520" style="s2">about the distortion that comes from</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.480" end="01:03:28.000" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.520" end="01:03:29.680" style="s2">short of modernity this would be i would</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.000" end="01:03:33.119" style="s2">not say an easy job because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.680" end="01:03:37.119" style="s2">very expensive in many regards</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.119" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">but it is a straightforward job in</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.119" end="01:03:41.119" style="s2">normal circumstances and a very</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">confusing job</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.119" end="01:03:46.400" style="s2">when for example your children will</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:48.400" style="s2">face market forces that are attempting</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.400" end="01:03:49.119" style="s2">to manipulate them into doing things</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.400" end="01:03:51.520" style="s2">that are not</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.119" end="01:03:53.200" style="s2">good for them because it&#39;s in somebody</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.520" end="01:03:54.960" style="s2">else&#39;s financial interest</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.200" end="01:03:56.240" style="s2">that&#39;s not something a hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.960" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">would encounter</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.240" end="01:04:01.920" style="s2">so be very on your guard</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:04.000" style="s2">about novel influences that potentially</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.920" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">disrupt the processing that your kid</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.000" end="01:04:08.240" style="s2">does</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:10.240" style="s2">but in general trust your intuition when</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.240" end="01:04:12.079" style="s2">psychological experts tell you you must</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.240" end="01:04:12.640" style="s2">be very careful not to love your kids</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.079" end="01:04:14.000" style="s2">too much</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.640" end="01:04:15.680" style="s2">they have to cry themselves to sleep or</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.000" end="01:04:17.359" style="s2">they&#39;ll become dependent they are full</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.680" end="01:04:19.440" style="s2">of shit and that&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.359" end="01:04:20.559" style="s2">and just go with your gut on this one</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.440" end="01:04:22.799" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.559" end="01:04:24.559" style="s2">um kids are designed to be parented</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.799" end="01:04:26.079" style="s2">you&#39;re designed to have the</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.559" end="01:04:27.200" style="s2">the right feeling if you&#39;re normal</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.079" end="01:04:28.319" style="s2">you&#39;re designed to have the right</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.200" end="01:04:30.240" style="s2">feelings towards them</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.319" end="01:04:31.599" style="s2">to the extent that you uh want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.240" end="01:04:33.200" style="s2">embrace them you probably do to the</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.599" end="01:04:35.920" style="s2">extent they&#39;re driving you crazy</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.200" end="01:04:36.880" style="s2">you probably need to tell them so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.920" end="01:04:40.799" style="s2">straightforward</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.880" end="01:04:41.520" style="s2">but for modernity okay let&#39;s do a few</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.799" end="01:04:44.319" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.520" end="01:04:46.319" style="s2">uh and then we&#39;ll stop for today in the</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.319" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">age of functional mostly 3d printed</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.319" end="01:04:51.359" style="s2">semi-automatics will gun control remain</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:55.200" style="s2">even possible for much longer</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.359" end="01:04:55.920" style="s2">uh no yeah well that&#39;s already a matter</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.200" end="01:05:00.160" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.920" end="01:05:02.160" style="s2">um limits the amount more to people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.160" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">limits of imagination than to any</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.160" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">practical detail</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:09.680" style="s2">yeah what role do you believe that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:11.119" style="s2">xenoestrogens such as bpa phthalates and</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.680" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">analogs are playing in the rate of</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.119" end="01:05:13.839" style="s2">transsexualism</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">given their established high occurrence</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.839" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">in human bodies and known effects on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:22.799" style="s2">inah3 the human sdn i don&#39;t recognize</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:22.799" style="s2">those last two</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.880" end="01:05:26.079" style="s2">abbreviations but the the larger</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.880" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">question is</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.079" end="01:05:31.920" style="s2">basically we&#39;ve got um</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:33.680" style="s2">estrogens entering the water supply</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.920" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">entering the environment at rates that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.680" end="01:05:35.760" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:37.520" style="s2">far higher than they ever have before</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.760" end="01:05:38.960" style="s2">from things like phytoestrogens which is</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.520" end="01:05:42.000" style="s2">to say that estrogens</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.960" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">and their analogues exist in nature</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.000" end="01:05:45.119" style="s2">but we have been synthesizing them and</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.559" end="01:05:47.440" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.119" end="01:05:48.960" style="s2">releasing them through our trash and our</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.440" end="01:05:52.000" style="s2">urine</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.960" end="01:05:54.000" style="s2">into water supply that then effectively</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.000" end="01:05:57.359" style="s2">feminizes boys</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.000" end="01:05:59.920" style="s2">uh and uh absolutely that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.359" end="01:06:01.119" style="s2">yes um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s you know how</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.920" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">explanatory is it</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.119" end="01:06:05.920" style="s2">how many how many hypotheses are there</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:09.680" style="s2">each of which have some role</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.920" end="01:06:12.160" style="s2">to explain in the actual legitimately</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.680" end="01:06:14.559" style="s2">increasing rates of transsexualism</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.160" end="01:06:15.280" style="s2">i don&#39;t know um but it is certainly one</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.559" end="01:06:18.319" style="s2">factor</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.280" end="01:06:19.520" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s certainly one factor there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.319" end="01:06:22.640" style="s2">also clearly</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.520" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">a cultural contagion factor</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.640" end="01:06:27.440" style="s2">which dovetails with a general</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:31.760" style="s2">general disruption of normal</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.480" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">environments so</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.760" end="01:06:35.039" style="s2">sure but that&#39;s i mean i think there are</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:36.799" style="s2">there are many</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.039" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">many things going on with regard to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.799" end="01:06:40.559" style="s2">rise and trans and this person</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.079" style="s2">specifically writes transsexualism</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.559" end="01:06:44.640" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s intentional right</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:46.640" style="s2">like transsexualism and transgender</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.640" end="01:06:47.760" style="s2">you know you know as i as i asked in my</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.640" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">recent letter to</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.119" end="01:07:06.400" style="s2">a muddling of the issue at best and</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.680" end="01:07:14.319" style="s2">in ways that is are historically more</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.160" end="01:07:16.079" style="s2">like the other sex would act um should</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.319" end="01:07:18.240" style="s2">warrant certainly nothing hormonally or</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.079" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">surgically and probably nothing at all</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.240" end="01:07:21.680" style="s2">um you know at least within some</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:23.359" style="s2">confines whereas you know tran</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.680" end="01:07:25.520" style="s2">transsexualism like actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.359" end="01:07:26.160" style="s2">legitimately feeling like one of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.520" end="01:07:29.520" style="s2">many</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.160" end="01:07:30.640" style="s2">manifestations of your sex um is out of</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.640" end="01:07:33.760" style="s2">sex um that you that you are you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:36.160" style="s2">usually it&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.760" end="01:07:38.319" style="s2">it&#39;s your brain telling you for sure</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.160" end="01:07:40.480" style="s2">that the sex that your chromosomes</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.319" end="01:07:42.000" style="s2">and your gametes and your anatomy and</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.480" end="01:07:43.839" style="s2">your physiology</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.000" end="01:07:45.359" style="s2">say you are is not the thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.839" end="01:07:48.799" style="s2">say you are you know is</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.359" end="01:07:51.599" style="s2">are are xenoestrogens contributing to</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.799" end="01:07:53.520" style="s2">basically a broader array of intersex</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.599" end="01:07:55.119" style="s2">conditions effectively yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.520" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">i think i think they are but you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.119" end="01:07:58.400" style="s2">but there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:07:59.760" style="s2">social contagion which may have nothing</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.400" end="01:08:02.160" style="s2">at all to do with that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.760" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">but it&#39;s really a different evolution of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.160" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.799" style="s2">transness but what i wanted to get at</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:09.680" style="s2">was the interaction between these things</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:10.079" style="s2">i think that there&#39;s some gateway which</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.680" end="01:08:13.680" style="s2">looks</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.079" end="01:08:16.159" style="s2">like i feel like something&#39;s off</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.680" end="01:08:18.000" style="s2">right i feel like something is off and i</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.159" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">want it not to be off anymore</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.000" end="01:08:21.040" style="s2">and so i&#39;m looking for the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:23.359" style="s2">off so i can</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.040" end="01:08:25.040" style="s2">fix it right and the point is okay one</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.359" end="01:08:28.480" style="s2">of the things this lab will be off</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.040" end="01:08:30.719" style="s2">is that you are getting a lot of uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.480" end="01:08:31.759" style="s2">um estrogens that you&#39;re not supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.719" end="01:08:35.040" style="s2">be exposed to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:36.319" style="s2">if you&#39;re uh a boy or you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.040" end="01:08:37.600" style="s2">supposed to be exposed to them if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.319" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">anybody but if you&#39;re a boy it has a</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.600" end="01:08:40.080" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">effect which is making you feel even</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.080" end="01:08:43.440" style="s2">more off and then somebody</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:45.520" style="s2">says you know what a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.440" end="01:08:46.400" style="s2">are feeling off are really just fine</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.520" end="01:08:47.839" style="s2">they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.400" end="01:08:49.359" style="s2">facing a kind of oppression where</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.839" end="01:08:50.080" style="s2">civilization is telling them that they</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.359" end="01:08:52.159" style="s2">are something</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.080" end="01:08:53.520" style="s2">it&#39;s denying who they really are and it</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.159" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">sounds like you know what</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.520" end="01:08:56.719" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s it maybe i really am</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:08:58.880" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.719" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">else and i would feel fine if i was that</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.880" end="01:09:02.159" style="s2">thing but i&#39;m being told i&#39;m this other</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">thing and that&#39;s why everything seems so</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.159" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">wrong and so people embrace it</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.480" end="01:09:08.560" style="s2">and then the point is well that didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">work because everything is still</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.560" end="01:09:12.239" style="s2">crazy right you&#39;re still interfacing</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:14.719" style="s2">with a world that</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.239" end="01:09:16.560" style="s2">is not well suited to you and so no</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.719" end="01:09:18.239" style="s2">wonder that this is largely happening</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.560" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">at the point that these kids are</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.239" end="01:09:21.520" style="s2">teenagers when guess what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:22.719" style="s2">as a teenager as you&#39;re trying to figure</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.520" end="01:09:24.560" style="s2">out who you are</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.719" end="01:09:26.239" style="s2">and why you no longer are the kid you</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.560" end="01:09:27.199" style="s2">once were and are not yet the adult that</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.239" end="01:09:28.880" style="s2">you might become</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.199" end="01:09:30.480" style="s2">or are hoping to become or haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.880" end="01:09:31.600" style="s2">even imagined what it might look like to</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.480" end="01:09:35.120" style="s2">become</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.600" end="01:09:36.719" style="s2">that that age that era in your life is</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.120" end="01:09:38.960" style="s2">exactly about it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.719" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">quite feel right this isn&#39;t fitting i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.960" end="01:09:41.600" style="s2">trying to figure out what it is that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:44.960" style="s2">going to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.600" end="01:09:46.319" style="s2">and so to have a political ideology move</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.960" end="01:09:47.759" style="s2">in and say we&#39;ve got the solution for</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.319" end="01:09:49.199" style="s2">you it involves going into the knife and</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.759" end="01:09:51.199" style="s2">taking hormones that are going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.199" end="01:09:52.400" style="s2">change your life forever well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.199" end="01:09:54.640" style="s2">that&#39;s child abuse</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.400" end="01:09:55.679" style="s2">yeah it is i mean at the same moment</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.640" end="01:09:58.880" style="s2">that you frankly</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.679" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">have um cardi b</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.880" end="01:10:04.480" style="s2">telling you what uh you know the cool</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:07.040" style="s2">sexuality is which is</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.480" end="01:10:08.000" style="s2">insane then you have joe biden sitting</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.040" end="01:10:09.679" style="s2">down with cardi b</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.000" end="01:10:11.440" style="s2">for an interview because the democratic</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.679" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">party is of course on board</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:14.960" style="s2">you can&#39;t make this stuff up the point</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:17.520" style="s2">is everything is broadcasting some</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.960" end="01:10:19.040" style="s2">message that you can&#39;t possibly process</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.520" end="01:10:21.120" style="s2">normally because it&#39;s not a normal</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.040" end="01:10:23.120" style="s2">message it&#39;s a malevolent message</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.120" end="01:10:25.520" style="s2">and anyway i think what you&#39;re finding</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.120" end="01:10:26.719" style="s2">is a lot of people looking for</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.520" end="01:10:29.840" style="s2">the same thing that makes them</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.719" end="01:10:30.480" style="s2">susceptible to get rich quick schemes</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.840" end="01:10:34.080" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.480" end="01:10:35.920" style="s2">uh snake oil right the i the sense that</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.080" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">there&#39;s got to be some way</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.920" end="01:10:39.360" style="s2">there&#39;s just got to be some way tell me</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.840" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">what switch i can flip</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.360" end="01:10:42.800" style="s2">and now hey guess what we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:45.199" style="s2">ultimate switch if you find</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.800" end="01:10:46.480" style="s2">something off-putting about the sexual</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.199" end="01:10:47.440" style="s2">message you&#39;re being expected to</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.480" end="01:10:49.120" style="s2">interface with</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.440" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">then there&#39;s a reason for that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.120" end="01:10:52.960" style="s2">called trans and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:54.560" style="s2">here&#39;s what you got to do and so anyway</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.960" end="01:10:56.640" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.560" end="01:10:58.320" style="s2">the bpa and the other estrogens that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.640" end="01:11:00.000" style="s2">may be taking in</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.320" end="01:11:01.920" style="s2">feed into the sense that something isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.000" end="01:11:03.199" style="s2">right and then this other thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.920" end="01:11:05.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be connected to it</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.199" end="01:11:06.159" style="s2">directly it just has to be connected to</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.040" end="01:11:08.080" style="s2">the fact that people</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.159" end="01:11:09.840" style="s2">for whom things don&#39;t feel right are</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">looking for an answer and this answer</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.840" end="01:11:12.000" style="s2">happens to be fashionable at the moment</p>

<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:27.520" style="s2">can just be a matter of lots of things</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.199" end="01:11:30.000" style="s2">that create a sense of being abilities</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.520" end="01:11:31.760" style="s2">and a small number of solutions that are</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.000" end="01:11:34.159" style="s2">becoming fashionable and</p>

<p begin="01:12:10.159" end="01:12:13.040" style="s2">rent-seeking elites</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.440" end="01:12:14.560" style="s2">can you offer one or two specific</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.040" end="01:12:15.920" style="s2">examples to illustrate their behavior</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.560" end="01:12:19.440" style="s2">and make them tangible to</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.920" end="01:12:22.640" style="s2">me um so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.440" end="01:12:25.840" style="s2">that you run a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.640" end="01:12:29.840" style="s2">fossil fuel extraction</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.840" end="01:12:33.280" style="s2">company and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.840" end="01:12:36.239" style="s2">become skeptical of anthropogenic global</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.280" end="01:12:37.360" style="s2">climate change because it is politically</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.239" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">in your interest</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.360" end="01:12:45.040" style="s2">to continue um selling your fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:47.040" style="s2">as long as possible and even though it</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.040" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">might be in civilization&#39;s interest</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.040" end="01:12:52.239" style="s2">to switch to a modality of moving from</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:55.440" style="s2">place to place or working from home</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.239" end="01:12:57.040" style="s2">or you know battery driven cars from</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.440" end="01:13:01.360" style="s2">solar power whatever it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.040" end="01:13:04.159" style="s2">so you become motivated to obstruct</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.360" end="01:13:06.719" style="s2">the new mechanism because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.159" end="01:13:09.360" style="s2">profiting from the old mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.719" end="01:13:10.800" style="s2">um so you are externalizing the harm of</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.360" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">fossil fuels</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.800" end="01:13:14.880" style="s2">in an effort uh to maintain your profit</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:17.040" style="s2">stream</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.880" end="01:13:18.000" style="s2">um you have not you have contributed</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.040" end="01:13:19.440" style="s2">something to the market you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.000" end="01:13:20.960" style="s2">contributed fossil fuels which have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.440" end="01:13:22.560" style="s2">value but they also have a cost</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.960" end="01:13:24.320" style="s2">which because it&#39;s externalized rather</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.560" end="01:13:25.280" style="s2">than internalized you don&#39;t experience</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.320" end="01:13:27.360" style="s2">directly</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.280" end="01:13:28.480" style="s2">and so anyway this deranges our</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.360" end="01:13:32.320" style="s2">conversation about</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.480" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">atmospheric chemistry and you may fund</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.320" end="01:13:35.920" style="s2">research that results in</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:37.600" style="s2">there being more confusion on this issue</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.920" end="01:13:39.440" style="s2">than there should have been so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.600" end="01:13:42.800" style="s2">example of a rent-seeking elite</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.440" end="01:13:46.480" style="s2">protecting their profit stream um</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.800" end="01:13:48.960" style="s2">while uh deranging the conversation in a</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.480" end="01:13:51.440" style="s2">way that externalizes harm</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.960" end="01:13:52.239" style="s2">well done all right i think we&#39;re done</p>
