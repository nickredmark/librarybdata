<p begin="00:02:20.550" end="00:02:25.020" style="s2">would just be that you have a critique</p>

<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:12.630" style="s2">at a a marginalized population group we</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.620" end="00:03:14.370" style="s2">say well there&#39;s an social externality</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.630" end="00:03:17.640" style="s2">that we need to fold back into the main</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.460" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">we think ok I&#39;ve been going along using</p>

<p begin="00:03:34.290" end="00:03:38.880" style="s2">who I am so I think this general notion</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.630" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">of unfolding externalities is sort of at</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.880" end="00:03:43.740" style="s2">the heart of postmodern movements</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.280" end="00:03:46.320" style="s2">I&#39;d like to specify that a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.740" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">gets called post modernity probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.320" end="00:03:56.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t meet my definition of it you</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:58.860" style="s2">mentioned integral philosophy and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.580" end="00:04:02.010" style="s2">is so what is that what does that term</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.860" end="00:04:06.120" style="s2">mean that&#39;s an interesting term it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.010" end="00:04:08.070" style="s2">used originally by a developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.120" end="00:04:11.550" style="s2">oriented Hindu mystic named Sri</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.070" end="00:04:13.530" style="s2">Aurobindo but it describes a general</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.550" end="00:04:17.460" style="s2">attempt over the course of history and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.530" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">much more commonly recently an attempt</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.460" end="00:04:21.660" style="s2">to bring all the different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:23.790" style="s2">and dimensions of our being together to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.660" end="00:04:27.450" style="s2">some kind of more functional</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.790" end="00:04:28.170" style="s2">superstructure and was for a while in</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.450" end="00:04:29.880" style="s2">the mid 20s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.170" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">entry associated with a transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.880" end="00:04:33.300" style="s2">psychology movement that was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:36.240" style="s2">bring different forms of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.300" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">together with spiritual practice but it</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.240" end="00:04:40.290" style="s2">got a real boost from the writings of</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.540" style="s2">the American philosopher Ken Wilber who</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.290" end="00:04:43.170" style="s2">tried to give it a prehensile formal</p>

<p begin="00:04:43.170" end="00:04:48.000" style="s2">he&#39;d several different moves in trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:50.750" style="s2">to bring that all together and now</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.000" end="00:04:53.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a sort of boost Wilber general</p>

<p begin="00:04:57.450" end="00:05:02.850" style="s2">it has in common is affirmation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.450" end="00:05:05.070" style="s2">several large chunks of types of</p>

<p begin="00:05:21.480" end="00:05:25.470" style="s2">things that&#39;s common in integral theory</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.160" end="00:05:28.830" style="s2">is of this notion of the four quadrants</p>

<p begin="00:17:01.280" end="00:17:06.870" style="s2">great my last general question so you I</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.010" end="00:17:08.880" style="s2">think you know what you would a deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.870" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">interest in shamanism is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.880" end="00:17:15.180" style="s2">it&#39;s correct yeah so how would how do</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.900" end="00:17:17.069" style="s2">you think we should relate to shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.180" end="00:17:21.100" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.069" end="00:17:22.839" style="s2">Ohman ISM and there&#39;s a distinction here</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.100" end="00:17:25.000" style="s2">one of the key things in so-called</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.839" end="00:17:27.670" style="s2">integral communities is to make what</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.000" end="00:17:28.870" style="s2">they call the pre trans distinction you</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.670" end="00:17:30.880" style="s2">don&#39;t want to confuse what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.870" end="00:17:32.800" style="s2">preconventional and pre rational with</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.880" end="00:17:35.890" style="s2">what&#39;s trans conventional and trans</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.800" end="00:17:37.750" style="s2">rational so one of the things to look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.890" end="00:17:41.830" style="s2">with shamanism is what should we leave</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.750" end="00:17:46.090" style="s2">behind and what should we aspire to pick</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.830" end="00:17:48.160" style="s2">a lot of oops skills that are found at</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.090" end="00:17:51.160" style="s2">the beginnings of human culture and</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.160" end="00:17:55.300" style="s2">religion we could continue to work with</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.160" end="00:17:57.700" style="s2">going forward CLE if we&#39;re in a new and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.300" end="00:18:00.760" style="s2">confusing almost cultural wilderness</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.700" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">situation people can&#39;t rely on their</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.760" end="00:18:05.950" style="s2">specific evolved cultural context as</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:07.750" style="s2">much as they could before dim part</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.950" end="00:18:11.200" style="s2">because all the cultural contexts are</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.750" end="00:18:14.410" style="s2">colliding now we are in a similar sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.200" end="00:18:20.100" style="s2">at the beginning of something II need to</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.410" end="00:18:23.679" style="s2">bring forward a sick some ways motive</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.100" end="00:18:25.170" style="s2">velop mental capacities need to bring</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.679" end="00:18:27.550" style="s2">forward our ability to access</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.170" end="00:18:29.710" style="s2">developmental flow States we need to do</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.550" end="00:18:31.990" style="s2">this especially in connection with</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.710" end="00:18:34.500" style="s2">ecology and the environment and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.990" end="00:18:36.880" style="s2">establishing a new relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.500" end="00:18:40.830" style="s2">anthropology and ecology between people</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.880" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">in nature and we also need to have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.830" end="00:18:46.530" style="s2">confidence and spiritual clarity that</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:48.970" style="s2">comes from knowing that we can access</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.530" end="00:18:52.390" style="s2">alternative states of consciousness I</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.970" end="00:18:54.460" style="s2">think all of that is very important also</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.390" end="00:18:57.220" style="s2">I think there&#39;s a spring in the notion</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.460" end="00:18:59.860" style="s2">of the the primitive shaman not</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.220" end="00:19:02.080" style="s2">necessarily soon you might meet today in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.860" end="00:19:05.830" style="s2">the Amazon who&#39;s officially described as</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.080" end="00:19:09.280" style="s2">a shaman in terms of these primitive um</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.830" end="00:19:12.330" style="s2">human sources of religious and spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.280" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">power and insight and developmental</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.330" end="00:19:19.090" style="s2">technology there&#39;s something in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.240" end="00:19:22.270" style="s2">how you actually get into these powers</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.090" end="00:19:25.150" style="s2">States access to divinity or the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.270" end="00:19:27.880" style="s2">are you bring that back into your life</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.150" end="00:19:30.730" style="s2">into the community how you consecrate</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.880" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">things how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.730" end="00:19:37.330" style="s2">how do we consecrate Our Lives how do we</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:39.400" style="s2">assimilate or metabolize these higher</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.330" end="00:19:41.830" style="s2">transcendental experiences in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.400" end="00:19:44.650" style="s2">that&#39;s compatible with the world it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.830" end="00:19:47.080" style="s2">deeply in need of ecological and</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.650" end="00:19:50.880" style="s2">embodied understanding I think shaman</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.080" end="00:19:56.040" style="s2">has a lot to teach us in those regards</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.880" end="00:19:58.620" style="s2">so do you see a role for for shamans a</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.040" end="00:20:02.590" style="s2">modern-day shaman in Western culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.620" end="00:20:05.320" style="s2">absolutely I see multiple types of roles</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.590" end="00:20:06.970" style="s2">I&#39;d like to specify that but I would</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.320" end="00:20:08.800" style="s2">call a shaman the majority of what I</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.970" end="00:20:11.860" style="s2">would call shamans are not people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.800" end="00:20:14.140" style="s2">say they&#39;re shamans or are acknowledged</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.860" end="00:20:17.580" style="s2">as shamans by others necessarily right</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.140" end="00:20:20.470" style="s2">he officially described as something is</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.580" end="00:20:23.350" style="s2">best a subset of the general phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.470" end="00:20:25.510" style="s2">the role of the shaman at different</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.350" end="00:20:28.890" style="s2">levels of current society would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.510" end="00:20:31.510" style="s2">things like hoping people to have um</p>

<p begin="00:20:35.290" end="00:20:41.190" style="s2">are also health and healing appearances</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.010" end="00:20:43.990" style="s2">shaman would be like many of our best</p>

<p begin="00:22:13.940" end="00:22:18.950" style="s2">so the question as I&#39;ve quickly written</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:21.470" style="s2">it there is how can meta modernism as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.950" end="00:22:24.140" style="s2">philosophical orientation be translated</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.470" end="00:22:26.120" style="s2">into concrete politics so you described</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.140" end="00:22:27.830" style="s2">this very complex if I&#39;d integral</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.120" end="00:22:30.290" style="s2">theoretic way of understanding in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.830" end="00:22:32.780" style="s2">world I would like to know how it could</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.290" end="00:22:35.240" style="s2">be molded somehow into an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.780" end="00:22:37.610" style="s2">position with popular appeal popular</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.240" end="00:22:40.940" style="s2">political action seems to require an</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.610" end="00:22:44.030" style="s2">ideological formulation in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.940" end="00:22:46.670" style="s2">easily digested and marketed so without</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.030" end="00:22:48.860" style="s2">that I don&#39;t understand how it can have</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.670" end="00:22:52.700" style="s2">popular appeal and if there is no</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.860" end="00:22:54.470" style="s2">popular appeal to be achieved with this</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.700" end="00:22:56.810" style="s2">kind of meta modernism and very</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.470" end="00:22:59.150" style="s2">complexified understanding of the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.810" end="00:23:02.740" style="s2">which you as you mentioned have</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.150" end="00:23:05.000" style="s2">mentioned thus far metabolizes</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.740" end="00:23:07.580" style="s2">transcendental phenomenological states</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.000" end="00:23:09.410" style="s2">and if still developmental folk states</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.580" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">and so on this can very easily in my</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.410" end="00:23:13.670" style="s2">opinion deteriorate into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:16.160" style="s2">esoteric system that&#39;s it that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.670" end="00:23:18.470" style="s2">absolutely incomprehensible to a normal</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.160" end="00:23:20.200" style="s2">guy you know so yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.470" end="00:23:22.640" style="s2">that&#39;s my question</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.200" end="00:23:25.370" style="s2">yeah the player you can understand it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.640" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">well I&#39;ll say a few things and you let</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.370" end="00:23:30.800" style="s2">me know if it addresses what your</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:33.590" style="s2">question was okay um political dimension</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.800" end="00:23:35.360" style="s2">of this is extremely significant on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.590" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">one hand there are a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.360" end="00:23:42.500" style="s2">the meta modernism community who feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:45.620" style="s2">like temporary progressive politics is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.500" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">the tip of the spear so to speak we need</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.620" end="00:23:50.150" style="s2">to be focusing on that it may not be the</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.320" end="00:23:52.040" style="s2">complete embodiment of meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.150" end="00:23:55.690" style="s2">principles but it&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.040" end="00:23:57.850" style="s2">movement towards the minimum</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.690" end="00:24:00.100" style="s2">number of systemic upgrades that we have</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.850" end="00:24:03.240" style="s2">to perform collectively in order to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.100" end="00:24:06.610" style="s2">to a more meta modern friendly society</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.240" end="00:24:11.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of a disagreement about</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.610" end="00:24:14.190" style="s2">how much Servat of and traditional</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.410" end="00:24:17.500" style="s2">understanding should play a role in that</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.190" end="00:24:19.390" style="s2">some people are Arab they believe very</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.500" end="00:24:21.190" style="s2">strongly that progressive politics is</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.390" end="00:24:24.160" style="s2">associated with meta modernism</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.190" end="00:24:27.010" style="s2">however there&#39;s this idea that the alyou</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.160" end="00:24:28.600" style="s2">systems that are spoken of in modern and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.010" end="00:24:30.850" style="s2">pre-modern society especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.600" end="00:24:34.290" style="s2">traditional values have to be folded</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.850" end="00:24:38.200" style="s2">into that somehow integral perspective</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.290" end="00:24:40.510" style="s2">it&#39;s important to try to bring left and</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.200" end="00:24:44.020" style="s2">right wing polarizations of anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.510" end="00:24:46.150" style="s2">together in order to stimulate actual uh</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.020" end="00:24:49.240" style="s2">need manifestation in the world which</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.150" end="00:24:53.680" style="s2">includes politics there what we have is</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.240" end="00:24:55.390" style="s2">a strong attunement to the issues and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.680" end="00:24:58.450" style="s2">insights of progressive politics</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.390" end="00:25:01.390" style="s2">combined with a need to supplement that</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.450" end="00:25:04.930" style="s2">by bringing in some of the basic healthy</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.390" end="00:25:07.030" style="s2">conservative values and putting a meta</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.930" end="00:25:09.360" style="s2">framework around that so that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.030" end="00:25:12.250" style="s2">so identified with it that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.360" end="00:25:14.500" style="s2">Edgeley adapt and reframe it to</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.250" end="00:25:16.750" style="s2">different contexts if it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.500" end="00:25:19.180" style="s2">it&#39;s the packaging and the messaging</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.750" end="00:25:22.180" style="s2">that&#39;s the problem oh it&#39;s a way I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.180" end="00:25:24.640" style="s2">of of bringing in some conservative</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.180" end="00:25:27.610" style="s2">populism combining it with a progressive</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.640" end="00:25:29.290" style="s2">agenda and being able to frame or phrase</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.610" end="00:25:32.320" style="s2">that in a number of different ways that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.290" end="00:25:34.450" style="s2">art I&#39;m completely identified with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.320" end="00:25:37.630" style="s2">particular embodiment of those politics</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.450" end="00:25:40.090" style="s2">at the moment that&#39;s all sort of on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.630" end="00:25:41.890" style="s2">political front but there&#39;s a second</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.090" end="00:25:44.440" style="s2">part of that right I would call the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.890" end="00:25:48.340" style="s2">religious analogy to individual</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.440" end="00:25:50.620" style="s2">spirituality is it in society you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.340" end="00:25:52.740" style="s2">bringing together subjective subsystems</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.620" end="00:25:56.490" style="s2">of the individual bringing together</p>

<p begin="00:25:59.050" end="00:26:04.800" style="s2">classes and those are also four</p>

<p begin="00:26:27.990" end="00:26:32.920" style="s2">still have to mobilize everybody you</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.940" end="00:26:35.260" style="s2">still have to develop something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.920" end="00:26:37.480" style="s2">nation spirit something like political</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.260" end="00:26:39.580" style="s2">will in every given zone that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.480" end="00:26:41.950" style="s2">trying to get that politics move forward</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.580" end="00:26:44.140" style="s2">in the way you get that is by bringing</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.950" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">different types and different genres of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.140" end="00:26:49.570" style="s2">people together causing them to mix and</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:51.430" style="s2">balance so that that similar kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.570" end="00:26:53.320" style="s2">excess quality is produced that can</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.430" end="00:26:56.860" style="s2">mobilize them because unless people have</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.320" end="00:26:58.600" style="s2">a a shared collective confidence in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.860" end="00:27:01.180" style="s2">powerful sense of meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.600" end="00:27:02.950" style="s2">transcends them they can see that</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.180" end="00:27:04.630" style="s2">expressed in a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.950" end="00:27:06.730" style="s2">values that they might otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.630" end="00:27:08.710" style="s2">disagree about then it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.730" end="00:27:13.060" style="s2">very hard for them to mobilize on any</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.710" end="00:27:14.920" style="s2">political agenda alright that was a very</p>

<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:39.610" style="s2">not sure if you&#39;re familiar with me</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.900" end="00:27:44.500" style="s2">Gilchrist&#39;s work I drove a he&#39;s done a</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.610" end="00:27:46.810" style="s2">conversation with them and to brain</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.500" end="00:27:48.310" style="s2">atmospheres yeah yeah exactly is that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.810" end="00:27:49.900" style="s2">very much resonate with what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.310" end="00:27:53.440" style="s2">saying here and the patterns that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.900" end="00:27:56.550" style="s2">been seeing in the world and I&#39;m I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.440" end="00:27:59.650" style="s2">been seeing this lack of the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.550" end="00:28:01.720" style="s2">to go than mythopoetic route right it</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.650" end="00:28:04.510" style="s2">seems very much like we we do have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.720" end="00:28:07.120" style="s2">engage in this kind of construction and</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.510" end="00:28:09.820" style="s2">unveiling of this mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.120" end="00:28:12.330" style="s2">language that makes sense of all the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.820" end="00:28:16.200" style="s2">chaos and complication in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.330" end="00:28:18.940" style="s2">so it seems like the right hemispherical</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.200" end="00:28:21.580" style="s2">capacity of the shaman to do all of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.940" end="00:28:22.509" style="s2">deep work and then give language and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.580" end="00:28:25.149" style="s2">narrative like</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.509" end="00:28:28.359" style="s2">Clos that the bones of the culture I</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.149" end="00:28:30.609" style="s2">think I mean that sounds like like a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.359" end="00:28:33.459" style="s2">vital element and so maybe to bring</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.609" end="00:28:35.859" style="s2">together with the point you just made it</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.459" end="00:28:38.229" style="s2">would you say then that like the shaman</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.859" end="00:28:39.999" style="s2">is in fact a vital element of politics</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.229" end="00:28:42.669" style="s2">that there&#39;s something to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.999" end="00:28:46.440" style="s2">coordination of our our governance that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.669" end="00:28:50.039" style="s2">has to do with the myth of polices</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.440" end="00:28:53.440" style="s2">absolutely and for good or ill because</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.039" end="00:28:55.209" style="s2">not every shaman is benevolent for her</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.440" end="00:28:57.129" style="s2">as the villages needs are concerned</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.209" end="00:28:59.199" style="s2">right you might even say that someone</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.129" end="00:29:00.940" style="s2">like Trump is you know we could</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.199" end="00:29:03.690" style="s2">mythologically characterize him as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.940" end="00:29:06.599" style="s2">dark shaman where he seems to work with</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.690" end="00:29:09.669" style="s2">irrational and nonlinear currents</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.599" end="00:29:12.269" style="s2">operate outside of the reasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.669" end="00:29:16.869" style="s2">systemic structures that we&#39;ve set up oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.269" end="00:29:19.690" style="s2">that is part of what every shaman has to</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.860" end="00:44:37.120" style="s2">those same incentives you have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.990" end="00:44:39.790" style="s2">operate from outside of that and in many</p>

<p begin="00:44:48.220" end="00:44:53.940" style="s2">so I&#39;m someone who I&#39;m in my 40s now and</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.250" end="00:44:56.230" style="s2">I sort of regret not playing around</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.940" end="00:44:59.980" style="s2">parenting with psychedelics back in my</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.230" end="00:45:03.370" style="s2">youth but now you know I wouldn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.980" end="00:45:05.500" style="s2">know how to go about it how to get it</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.370" end="00:45:09.610" style="s2">how to know it was safe you know from</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.500" end="00:45:11.470" style="s2">from a safe source how much to take and</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.610" end="00:45:13.900" style="s2">so on what what would you advise</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.470" end="00:45:15.490" style="s2">somebody in my position who would like</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.900" end="00:45:18.130" style="s2">to experiment</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.490" end="00:45:22.480" style="s2">with that to key into what people like</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.130" end="00:45:24.309" style="s2">you have been talking about oh you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.480" end="00:45:27.490" style="s2">wanted to get into psychedelics your</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.309" end="00:45:31.030" style="s2">your best bet is to I to find some</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.490" end="00:45:33.790" style="s2">individuals or some communities that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.030" end="00:45:37.630" style="s2">doing it regularly because they are</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.790" end="00:45:39.490" style="s2">going to have access to sources these</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.630" end="00:45:41.020" style="s2">substances that are pretty safe</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.490" end="00:45:45.339" style="s2">otherwise they would have noticed</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.020" end="00:45:47.140" style="s2">already it&#39;s toxic and so there you need</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.339" end="00:45:48.700" style="s2">to have somebody vet this and verify</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.140" end="00:45:50.829" style="s2">this for you to some degree otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.700" end="00:45:53.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of crapshoot just you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.829" end="00:45:55.750" style="s2">gonna grow your own which is also a good</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.800" end="00:45:57.280" style="s2">thing to do because a lot of this I mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.750" end="00:46:00.069" style="s2">it&#39;s one thing to take a chemical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.280" end="00:46:02.200" style="s2">another thing to ingest plant which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.069" end="00:46:05.800" style="s2">an organism brings along with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.200" end="00:46:07.839" style="s2">chemistry all of the story and structure</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.800" end="00:46:12.579" style="s2">and even potentially the subjectivity of</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.839" end="00:46:14.319" style="s2">that organism hmm um I would and it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.579" end="00:46:16.750" style="s2">depends on how far into it you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.319" end="00:46:18.880" style="s2">go like most of my own experiences with</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.750" end="00:46:22.089" style="s2">psychedelics were earlier in my life I</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.880" end="00:46:23.920" style="s2">went at extremely high doses because I</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.089" end="00:46:28.030" style="s2">wanted to have very transformative</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.920" end="00:46:30.970" style="s2">experiences and because I&#39;d read all</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.030" end="00:46:33.190" style="s2">those books from the 60s people were</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.970" end="00:46:34.540" style="s2">doing very high doses because they</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.190" end="00:46:36.010" style="s2">thought it wanted it to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.540" end="00:46:40.210" style="s2">transformative they didn&#39;t just want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.010" end="00:46:41.650" style="s2">have a little a oh maybe you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.210" end="00:46:43.599" style="s2">have a little peak because you want to</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.650" end="00:46:45.819" style="s2">be cautious or you just want to tip your</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.599" end="00:46:48.579" style="s2">toe in so you have to be clear about the</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.819" end="00:46:51.819" style="s2">goal that you have they have to find</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.579" end="00:46:55.000" style="s2">some source that provide the safety of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.819" end="00:46:57.069" style="s2">what you&#39;re taking and you probably need</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.000" end="00:46:59.049" style="s2">somebody around you who can anchor the</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.069" end="00:47:00.730" style="s2">experience now whether that&#39;s a shaman</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.049" end="00:47:02.290" style="s2">or whether that&#39;s a friend who&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.730" end="00:47:04.720" style="s2">this a little more than you who you feel</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.290" end="00:47:06.579" style="s2">you can emotionally trust it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.720" end="00:47:08.500" style="s2">really it&#39;s often important to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.579" end="00:47:10.599" style="s2">somebody there to run interface between</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.500" end="00:47:13.180" style="s2">you and reality when you&#39;re in one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.599" end="00:47:15.549" style="s2">these states also somebody who can give</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.180" end="00:47:17.829" style="s2">you the confidence that you can relax</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.549" end="00:47:21.670" style="s2">your stress about the situation and let</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.829" end="00:47:25.780" style="s2">go and see what&#39;s there always gonna</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.670" end="00:47:27.640" style="s2">surprise you and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.780" end="00:47:30.010" style="s2">you know it depends very much whether</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.640" end="00:47:33.820" style="s2">you want to get totally beyond your mind</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.010" end="00:47:36.790" style="s2">or not I experienced originally was that</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.820" end="00:47:39.310" style="s2">I felt I needed to take extremely large</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.790" end="00:47:42.430" style="s2">doses of things because I had this</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.310" end="00:47:44.320" style="s2">imaginary or possibly real sense that my</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.430" end="00:47:47.530" style="s2">mind was very strong and I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.320" end="00:47:49.300" style="s2">blow it right open if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.530" end="00:47:51.810" style="s2">that sense and you don&#39;t have that goal</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.300" end="00:47:54.730" style="s2">then by all means take a milder dose I</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.810" end="00:47:56.680" style="s2">think the most important thing upfront</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.730" end="00:48:00.100" style="s2">is to really engage in a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.680" end="00:48:03.040" style="s2">with the substance that the Terence</p>

<p begin="00:48:05.400" end="00:48:11.260" style="s2">how to talk to it try to see what it has</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.320" end="00:48:13.330" style="s2">for you and we there&#39;s a danger of</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.260" end="00:48:16.390" style="s2">limiting the experience by imagining</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.330" end="00:48:20.020" style="s2">that it&#39;s just a a modification of your</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.390" end="00:48:22.390" style="s2">own psychology if you can really enter</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.020" end="00:48:24.100" style="s2">into this attitude of relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.390" end="00:48:26.080" style="s2">communication and dialogue with the</p>

<p begin="00:48:26.080" end="00:48:31.360" style="s2">botanical substance and you have a much</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.900" end="00:48:34.150" style="s2">greater chance of accessing the types of</p>

<p begin="00:48:44.740" end="00:48:51.760" style="s2">significantly different things I was</p>

<p begin="00:49:07.900" end="00:49:12.160" style="s2">there&#39;s something called spiral dynamics</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.020" end="00:49:44.130" style="s2">I think you you might say from the</p>

<p begin="00:58:29.130" end="00:58:33.990" style="s2">year or two now since I moved but it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.900" end="00:58:36.210" style="s2">an attempt to set up in a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.990" end="00:58:38.310" style="s2">different communities way of bringing</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.740" end="00:58:45.660" style="s2">spiritually for them interfaith is</p>

<p begin="00:59:26.430" end="00:59:30.630" style="s2">for awhile and fell apart and that was</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.310" end="01:02:26.580" style="s2">question how familiar are you with John</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.840" end="01:02:31.530" style="s2">for Becky&#39;s project with the religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.580" end="01:02:34.350" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion I would say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.530" end="01:02:36.420" style="s2">fairly familiar with it but in a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.350" end="01:02:38.820" style="s2">colloquial way that most of my spear</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.420" end="01:02:40.980" style="s2">of it is from talking with John other</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.820" end="01:02:43.650" style="s2">than from officially involved in any</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.980" end="01:02:46.470" style="s2">project or working on it so if you mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.650" end="01:02:48.900" style="s2">something very specific not sure but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.470" end="01:02:51.360" style="s2">pretty comfortable with John and my</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.900" end="01:02:54.350" style="s2">discussions on that subject also with</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.360" end="01:02:57.360" style="s2">Jordans passions with John on that topic</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.350" end="01:02:59.400" style="s2">okay I think I should be able to still</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.360" end="01:03:02.280" style="s2">ask this question so something that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.400" end="01:03:05.340" style="s2">been thinking about is the progressive</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.280" end="01:03:09.780" style="s2">and the non progressive ways and how</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.340" end="01:03:12.120" style="s2">they&#39;ve been active nowadays so the like</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.780" end="01:03:13.590" style="s2">the progressive perspective is that we</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.120" end="01:03:16.800" style="s2">need to be moving forward it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.590" end="01:03:20.580" style="s2">literally progressive but then some like</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.800" end="01:03:22.320" style="s2">a basically a counter to that is like</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.580" end="01:03:24.350" style="s2">well the part of the problem with being</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.320" end="01:03:26.760" style="s2">progressive is that you fail to see the</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.350" end="01:03:29.910" style="s2">humanity that&#39;s have been ever present</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.760" end="01:03:32.040" style="s2">throughout history and so something I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.910" end="01:03:36.210" style="s2">been thinking about is in the religion</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.040" end="01:03:39.030" style="s2">that&#39;s not a religion how do you I guess</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.210" end="01:03:40.530" style="s2">facilitate learning that humanity that</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.030" end="01:03:47.610" style="s2">has always been present throughout</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.530" end="01:03:51.320" style="s2">history so capturing that the that that</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.610" end="01:03:54.120" style="s2">humanity question that I guess a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.320" end="01:03:58.350" style="s2">more traditional people will tend to</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.120" end="01:04:03.120" style="s2">argue I think there&#39;s there&#39;s -</p>
