<p begin="00:00:16.470" end="00:00:26.039" style="s2">crisis so last time I tried to make some</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.630" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">tentative suggestions as to what this</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.039" end="00:00:31.980" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion would</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:37.170" style="s2">look like and how it can make use of and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.980" end="00:00:38.550" style="s2">be integrated with an ecology of psyche</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.170" end="00:00:41.070" style="s2">with technologies for addressing the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.550" end="00:00:45.890" style="s2">perennial problems and a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.070" end="00:00:50.930" style="s2">scientific worldview that can legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.890" end="00:00:54.680" style="s2">and situate that ecology of practices</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.930" end="00:00:58.470" style="s2">and then I made some suggestions as to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.680" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">the relationship between credo and</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.470" end="00:01:02.820" style="s2">religio in our determination of our</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">mythos and the issue of criterion</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.820" end="00:01:10.579" style="s2">setting made again another argument for</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:15.420" style="s2">open-ended in that sense gnostic mythos</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.579" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">talked about a mythos that always puts</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.420" end="00:01:19.139" style="s2">therefore the credo in service of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:21.929" style="s2">religio and that is always directed</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.139" end="00:01:24.509" style="s2">towards right top-down the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.929" end="00:01:27.270" style="s2">being ultimately grounded in in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.509" end="00:01:29.490" style="s2">participatory and also affording the</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.270" end="00:01:31.409" style="s2">emergence up out of the participatory</p>

<p begin="00:01:31.409" end="00:01:40.579" style="s2">procedural into the the propositional I</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:44.459" style="s2">suggest in some ways in which we might</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.579" end="00:01:47.939" style="s2">set up a way of engineering credo</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.459" end="00:01:51.209" style="s2">something analogous to a wiki and create</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.939" end="00:01:53.849" style="s2">a structure that is a distributed co-op</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.209" end="00:02:02.459" style="s2">structure facilitated by things like the</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.849" end="00:02:04.679" style="s2">internet and so again remind you I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.459" end="00:02:06.929" style="s2">not trying to offer anything definitive</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.679" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">or set myself up in any kind of way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.929" end="00:02:13.140" style="s2">is not what I want to do I want to try</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:16.760" style="s2">and help facilitate the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.140" end="00:02:20.360" style="s2">already doing this so that they have</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.760" end="00:02:23.459" style="s2">ways of talking to each other</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.360" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">coordinating with each other</p>

<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:34.769" style="s2">development and growth I then turned</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.120" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">towards one of the culminating things we</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.769" end="00:02:39.650" style="s2">need to do taking up one on one of the</p>

<p begin="00:02:39.650" end="00:02:43.319" style="s2">sort of one of the deepest relationships</p>

<p begin="00:03:31.459" end="00:03:39.030" style="s2">then proposed to take a look at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.519" end="00:03:43.139" style="s2">cognitive science of wisdom and we did</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.030" end="00:03:45.569" style="s2">that by taking note of an important</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.139" end="00:03:48.269" style="s2">article that comes out sort of after the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.569" end="00:03:51.599" style="s2">first decade and a half of the</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.599" end="00:03:58.340" style="s2">wisdom and that&#39;s the article of McGee</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.530" end="00:04:00.150" style="s2">and Barber and they&#39;re doing something</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.340" end="00:04:05.069" style="s2">consonant with what we&#39;ve been trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.150" end="00:04:08.669" style="s2">do in this series they&#39;re trying to in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.069" end="00:04:13.379" style="s2">sense salvage what we can from the</p>

<p begin="00:04:13.379" end="00:04:17.669" style="s2">the axle Age of wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:23.639" style="s2">psychological theories that were</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.669" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">emerging at that time and then they set</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.639" end="00:04:27.990" style="s2">them into dialogue with each other a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">process of reflective equilibrium trying</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.990" end="00:04:34.770" style="s2">to get a convergence between them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:36.639" style="s2">they argue that all of these theories</p>

<p begin="00:04:40.180" end="00:04:45.330" style="s2">feature of wisdom and then following</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.449" end="00:04:48.069" style="s2">work that I did with Leo Ferraro and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.330" end="00:04:51.310" style="s2">2013 we can sort of expand beyond the</p>

<p begin="00:04:53.800" end="00:04:58.749" style="s2">directly implied by their phrase and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.960" end="00:05:04.749" style="s2">a central feature of wisdom is to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.749" end="00:05:14.159" style="s2">systematic the systematically sorry the</p>

<p begin="00:05:19.479" end="00:05:29.710" style="s2">and this of course is insight but it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.650" end="00:05:32.349" style="s2">a fundamental insight is a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.710" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">insight it is an insight not just into a</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.349" end="00:05:36.969" style="s2">particular problem but into a family of</p>

<p begin="00:05:36.969" end="00:05:42.159" style="s2">use of a point that I made use of what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.389" end="00:05:45.430" style="s2">was talking about systemic insight in</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.430" end="00:05:50.229" style="s2">use of the work of Piaget if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.349" end="00:05:52.419" style="s2">remember Piaget found systematic errors</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.229" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">and the way children are seeing the</p>

<p begin="00:05:56.770" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">pouring liquids right so you have these</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.569" end="00:06:04.149" style="s2">systemic errors which reflect a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:08.560" style="s2">systematic way in which the children</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.149" end="00:06:09.879" style="s2">have over constrained their cognition</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.560" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">there they have to constrain their</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.879" end="00:06:13.389" style="s2">cognition it&#39;s adaptive but they have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:14.819" style="s2">go through right that process of</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.389" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">assimilation and accommodation</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.819" end="00:06:19.620" style="s2">constantly optimizing and complexify</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.659" end="00:06:27.430" style="s2">system of constraints but what we see</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.939" end="00:06:29.830" style="s2">with the children is eventually they get</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.430" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">a systemic insight and we&#39;ve all done it</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.830" end="00:06:32.979" style="s2">we go through qualitative change</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:36.580" style="s2">qualitative development there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.979" end="00:06:38.919" style="s2">actual change in our competence because</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.580" end="00:06:40.449" style="s2">it&#39;s not an insight into this problem or</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.570" end="00:07:01.610" style="s2">that is not just at the level of framing</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.360" end="00:07:04.070" style="s2">but at the level of trans framing</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.610" end="00:07:07.220" style="s2">because it not only is reframing the</p>

<p begin="00:07:23.750" end="00:07:27.740" style="s2">their sensibility is going through a</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.460" end="00:08:07.760" style="s2">into what&#39;s real the sage right</p>

<p begin="00:08:21.290" end="00:08:25.780" style="s2">is not something the McGeehan barber say</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.000" end="00:08:28.520" style="s2">okay but you can see how this is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.780" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">automatically I would argue I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.520" end="00:08:33.530" style="s2">argue they&#39;re not but I would argue this</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:36.680" style="s2">is automatically you know connected to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.530" end="00:08:41.570" style="s2">the project of enlightenment in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.680" end="00:08:43.070" style="s2">very important fashion all right what</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.570" end="00:08:46.760" style="s2">are a couple other important things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.070" end="00:08:48.470" style="s2">may and barber talked about they talked</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.760" end="00:08:49.850" style="s2">about that with and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.470" end="00:08:51.260" style="s2">beginning of the important distinction</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.850" end="00:08:53.540" style="s2">between wisdom and knowledge that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.260" end="00:08:56.630" style="s2">been sort of also making use of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.540" end="00:09:00.260" style="s2">throughout the course that wisdom is not</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.630" end="00:09:02.360" style="s2">about what you know wisdom has to do</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.260" end="00:09:04.100" style="s2">with how you know it and there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.360" end="00:09:05.889" style="s2">senses of how that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.100" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">want to explicate that they leave rather</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.889" end="00:09:12.769" style="s2">implicit right there&#39;s how you know it</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">is how you have come to know it</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.769" end="00:09:17.209" style="s2">what&#39;s the processing involved as</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:20.540" style="s2">opposed to the product so wisdom has a</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.209" end="00:09:23.029" style="s2">lot more to do with the process than</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.540" end="00:09:25.670" style="s2">with the product knowledge is Right</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.029" end="00:09:27.290" style="s2">often the product I know like this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.670" end="00:09:29.630" style="s2">what I know and I know this and this and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.290" end="00:09:32.630" style="s2">this but wisdom is how am i knowing how</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.630" end="00:09:34.329" style="s2">am i knowing right so definitely that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.630" end="00:09:36.440" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to be pivotal because</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.329" end="00:09:39.589" style="s2">and that&#39;s going to immediately link</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.440" end="00:09:41.449" style="s2">wisdom to rationality because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.589" end="00:09:42.920" style="s2">key features of rationality I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.449" end="00:09:44.420" style="s2">mentioned this before we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.920" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">come back to this the work of Stanovich</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.420" end="00:09:51.259" style="s2">is a rational person is not only fixated</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:54.230" style="s2">on the products of their cognition they</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.259" end="00:09:56.660" style="s2">pay attention to and find value the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.230" end="00:10:00.110" style="s2">processing of their cognition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.660" end="00:10:02.750" style="s2">what it is to be rational right so</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.110" end="00:10:05.990" style="s2">that&#39;s one aspect of what they mean by</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.750" end="00:10:08.810" style="s2">the how and then there&#39;s another aspect</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.990" end="00:10:11.839" style="s2">of how you know and that has to do and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.810" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">this goes to a point made by Keeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.839" end="00:10:21.019" style="s2">between descriptive john cakes excellent</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:24.620" style="s2">philosopher does work on wisdom right</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.019" end="00:10:28.759" style="s2">but peaks makes a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.620" end="00:10:31.149" style="s2">descriptive knowledge and interpretive</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.759" end="00:10:31.149" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.779" end="00:10:42.970" style="s2">I often prefer to use the word knowing</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.269" end="00:10:45.399" style="s2">rather than knowledge but that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.970" end="00:10:49.029" style="s2">his way of talking about so again this</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.399" end="00:10:50.829" style="s2">is grasping the facts where is</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.029" end="00:10:53.680" style="s2">interpretive knowledge this points</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.829" end="00:10:55.149" style="s2">towards an aspect of wisdom that we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:09.459" style="s2">important feature of wisdom may point</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.620" end="00:12:12.509" style="s2">out there&#39;s a perspectival participatory</p>

<p begin="00:12:59.080" end="00:13:04.750" style="s2">means I have a uh Turing it from the</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.330" end="00:13:18.490" style="s2">I&#39;m actually pointing to myself with it</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.450" end="00:13:20.290" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s of course the degree</p>

<p begin="00:13:37.480" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">realize you&#39;re dreaming and remain in</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.480" end="00:13:49.540" style="s2">point out and think of you can just here</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.820" end="00:14:01.690" style="s2">are Socrates in this they point out that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.540" end="00:14:05.640" style="s2">this I am wise carries with it a sense a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.690" end="00:14:09.610" style="s2">very strong intuition of a pragmatic</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.610" end="00:14:19.870" style="s2">wise seems to be an indication that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.010" end="00:14:22.089" style="s2">are in a perspective and you have an</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.870" end="00:14:24.839" style="s2">identity that is precisely not that of</p>

<p begin="00:14:25.089" end="00:14:29.449" style="s2">and of course this is part of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.449" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">know idea this is part of again or how</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.800" end="00:14:41.500" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued and this is why ah right ah</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:46.250" style="s2">as the this this two-faced thing between</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.500" end="00:14:49.100" style="s2">horror and wonder right and that what it</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.250" end="00:14:50.839" style="s2">does is it brings out and I again I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:14:55.759" end="00:15:07.850" style="s2">humility right and so what that tells us</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.000" end="00:15:10.550" style="s2">right away right is that wisdom has has</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.850" end="00:15:15.829" style="s2">this perspectival and participatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.550" end="00:15:18.529" style="s2">aspects to it such that right it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.829" end="00:15:20.690" style="s2">matter of making even having true</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.529" end="00:15:23.959" style="s2">beliefs there&#39;s a matter of what</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.690" end="00:15:27.529" style="s2">perspective can you take what</p>

<p begin="00:15:27.529" end="00:15:31.880" style="s2">assuming and assigning so the</p>

<p begin="00:15:31.880" end="00:15:37.730" style="s2">also very central to with them and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.910" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">of course makes sense again with wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.730" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">having to do with much more with the how</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">than the what and of course this is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:50.149" style="s2">perspectival and participatory because</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.360" end="00:15:52.190" style="s2">I&#39;m seeing through a miss framing and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.149" end="00:15:53.449" style="s2">I&#39;m going through trans framing I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:13.490" style="s2">what Wonder and awe are all about okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.260" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">so that gives us some very important</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.490" end="00:16:21.139" style="s2">things to take note of and I&#39;ve already</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:24.110" style="s2">indicated a connection to Stanovich with</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.730" end="00:16:29.810" style="s2">strengthen that connection by noting</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.290" end="00:16:32.500" style="s2">that at the core of wisdom is the</p>

<p begin="00:16:48.410" end="00:16:54.739" style="s2">this ability to systematically overcome</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.799" end="00:17:00.189" style="s2">self-deception over and with another</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.739" end="00:17:02.720" style="s2">term and this is the term rationality</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.189" end="00:17:04.730" style="s2">and throughout I&#39;ve been proposing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.720" end="00:17:07.549" style="s2">you that part of what we need to do to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.730" end="00:17:09.409" style="s2">rehabilitate wisdom is we also need in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.549" end="00:17:12.139" style="s2">coordinated fashion to rehabilitate what</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.409" end="00:17:14.689" style="s2">it means to be rational rational does</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.139" end="00:17:17.600" style="s2">not cannot be reduced to cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.689" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">equated to a facility with syllogistic</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.600" end="00:17:32.149" style="s2">reasoning ok rationality cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:36.529" style="s2">reduced to logic so let&#39;s broaden the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.149" end="00:17:39.500" style="s2">notion right away and make it connect to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.529" end="00:17:45.309" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about which is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.500" end="00:17:50.419" style="s2">we mean by rationality is a capacity</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.309" end="00:17:53.149" style="s2">capacity to overcome self-deception in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.419" end="00:17:58.010" style="s2">reliable manner so what I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.149" end="00:18:01.760" style="s2">mean by rationality is a lot reliably</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.010" end="00:18:09.820" style="s2">and systematically what I mean by those</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:09.820" style="s2">in a sec overcoming self-deception and</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.450" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">this is also in a lot of the work on</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.460" end="00:18:24.159" style="s2">rationality especially by people like</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:24.159" style="s2">Stanovich and also affording flourishing</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.190" end="00:18:31.300" style="s2">which is afforded by some process of</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.130" end="00:18:34.270" style="s2">optimization of the cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.300" end="00:18:35.920" style="s2">okay what I mean by reliably it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.270" end="00:18:40.740" style="s2">operate according to a standard of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.920" end="00:18:42.970" style="s2">perfection completion right certainty</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.740" end="00:18:45.210" style="s2">reliably does mean though that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.970" end="00:18:48.610" style="s2">high probability of functioning</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.210" end="00:18:52.980" style="s2">successfully systematically means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.610" end="00:18:57.340" style="s2">not operational just in this one domain</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.980" end="00:19:04.180" style="s2">so let&#39;s compare being let&#39;s compare</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.340" end="00:19:07.690" style="s2">rationality with expertise okay I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.180" end="00:19:11.050" style="s2">become an expert and let&#39;s say tennis</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.690" end="00:19:12.400" style="s2">I&#39;m not this tennis won and I believe my</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.050" end="00:19:17.710" style="s2">dysgraphia is bad today</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.400" end="00:19:23.110" style="s2">let&#39;s whatever may be its two ends I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.710" end="00:19:24.850" style="s2">become an expert in this okay we have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.110" end="00:19:27.640" style="s2">be careful because we equivocate on this</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.850" end="00:19:29.470" style="s2">term there is one in which we can into</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.640" end="00:19:31.630" style="s2">something that we can study and one in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.470" end="00:19:33.490" style="s2">which this is just a synonym for being</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.630" end="00:19:36.520" style="s2">good at something</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.490" end="00:19:38.410" style="s2">okay I&#39;m not using it in that sense okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.520" end="00:19:41.110" style="s2">I&#39;m using it in the sense in which it</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.410" end="00:19:44.920" style="s2">makes sense to say somebody is an expert</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.110" end="00:19:47.920" style="s2">in tennis they have acquired a high</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.920" end="00:19:51.370" style="s2">proficiency in the set of skills such</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.920" end="00:19:53.620" style="s2">that they have an authority about tennis</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.370" end="00:19:58.810" style="s2">playing okay that&#39;s what we mean you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.620" end="00:20:00.730" style="s2">become a legal expert etc okay so that</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.810" end="00:20:04.720" style="s2">the person there is two ends in tennis</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.730" end="00:20:06.520" style="s2">my brain is settling down okay or in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.720" end="00:20:11.230" style="s2">law for example to become a legal expert</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.520" end="00:20:19.350" style="s2">so what happens in expertise is</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.230" end="00:20:23.590" style="s2">precisely this you find right a domain a</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.350" end="00:20:26.920" style="s2">bounded domain that has a reliable set</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.590" end="00:20:28.690" style="s2">of very complex very difficult but</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.920" end="00:20:32.800" style="s2">nevertheless reliable set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.690" end="00:20:35.320" style="s2">well-defined right or at least well</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.800" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">definable for you eventually set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.320" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">patterns and problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.559" end="00:20:44.999" style="s2">you know it&#39;s expertise precise because</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.119" end="00:20:47.639" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t transfer my expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.999" end="00:20:50.190" style="s2">tennis won&#39;t transfer even the things</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.639" end="00:20:54.419" style="s2">that are close in fact it will interfere</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.190" end="00:20:57.450" style="s2">with when I try to play squash my</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.419" end="00:21:01.830" style="s2">expertise in golf will interfere when I</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.450" end="00:21:06.179" style="s2">try to play hockey okay that&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.830" end="00:21:09.389" style="s2">does it not transfer right it will often</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.179" end="00:21:12.330" style="s2">interfere in transfer it even to things</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.389" end="00:21:14.639" style="s2">that are relevant ly similar to your</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.330" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">area of expertise now this is a way</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.639" end="00:21:20.789" style="s2">again in which we have to we have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:24.119" style="s2">more attention in ways in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.789" end="00:21:29.519" style="s2"> ourselves because we often</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.119" end="00:21:30.720" style="s2">confuse right because we we don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.519" end="00:21:36.139" style="s2">careful attention to how we&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.720" end="00:21:41.100" style="s2">similarity we often confuse people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.139" end="00:21:43.289" style="s2">expertise what do I mean by that so</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.100" end="00:21:46.619" style="s2">here&#39;s somebody who&#39;s an expert for</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.289" end="00:21:50.609" style="s2">example in a particular domain maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.619" end="00:21:52.289" style="s2">physics they have expertise there and of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.609" end="00:21:55.739" style="s2">course physics is about knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.289" end="00:21:59.450" style="s2">about getting at what&#39;s real and so that</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.739" end="00:22:02.639" style="s2">seems to be similar to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.450" end="00:22:05.279" style="s2">philosophy right and so presumably</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.639" end="00:22:07.769" style="s2">somebody in physics can therefore just</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.279" end="00:22:09.119" style="s2">transfer their expertise to philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.769" end="00:22:11.730" style="s2">and just make pronouncements about</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.119" end="00:22:14.249" style="s2">philosophy and metaphysics perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.730" end="00:22:16.470" style="s2">pronouncing that philosophy is dead or</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.249" end="00:22:18.149" style="s2">useless or some such thing which of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.470" end="00:22:19.799" style="s2">course itself is a philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.149" end="00:22:23.369" style="s2">statement and pragmatically self</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.799" end="00:22:25.259" style="s2">contradictory and if we don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.369" end="00:22:29.639" style="s2">attention to this fact about expertise</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.259" end="00:22:32.460" style="s2">we may fail to see that the similarity</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.639" end="00:22:34.649" style="s2">between physics and philosophy may</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.460" end="00:22:37.470" style="s2">actually be good reason for believing</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.649" end="00:22:39.989" style="s2">that these people are the worst people</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.470" end="00:22:42.869" style="s2">to listen to for philosophical advice</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.989" end="00:22:48.019" style="s2">because their expertise in physics may</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.869" end="00:22:50.440" style="s2">be in fact interfering with expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.019" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">philosophy for example of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.440" end="00:22:57.429" style="s2">philosophy just the way that expertise</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:23:06.850" style="s2">in tennis actually interferes with you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.429" end="00:23:12.070" style="s2">trying to play squash okay so expertise</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.850" end="00:23:18.309" style="s2">is is not systematic it is limited in</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.070" end="00:23:21.809" style="s2">its domain rationality is supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.309" end="00:23:25.539" style="s2">apply within it&#39;s supposed to be apt</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.809" end="00:23:31.720" style="s2">within each domain and apply across many</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.539" end="00:23:36.190" style="s2">domains somebody right is rational if</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.720" end="00:23:39.490" style="s2">they can note self-deception when</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.190" end="00:23:41.320" style="s2">they&#39;re doing right their daily life</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.490" end="00:23:43.090" style="s2">where they&#39;re doing their professional</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.320" end="00:23:45.340" style="s2">work where they&#39;re engaged in friendship</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.090" end="00:23:50.440" style="s2">where they&#39;re engaged in rational sorry</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.340" end="00:23:52.559" style="s2">romantic relationships okay so and this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.440" end="00:23:55.169" style="s2">is an important thing to remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.559" end="00:24:01.659" style="s2">rationality is in this sense a domain</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.169" end="00:24:04.480" style="s2">general notion as opposed to a context</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.659" end="00:24:08.950" style="s2">specific expertise tends to be a domain</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.480" end="00:24:11.889" style="s2">specific now of course this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.950" end="00:24:13.720" style="s2">continuum the more systematic somebody</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.889" end="00:24:15.730" style="s2">is the more rational we can claim there</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.720" end="00:24:17.500" style="s2">to be somebody might be very rational in</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.730" end="00:24:20.139" style="s2">a couple of domains and the irrational</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.500" end="00:24:22.690" style="s2">and others so on balance they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.139" end="00:24:25.259" style="s2">that rational of a person all right and</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.690" end="00:24:28.029" style="s2">of course I&#39;m not claiming that</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.259" end="00:24:30.399" style="s2">everybody is rational in the domain</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.029" end="00:24:34.149" style="s2">general way I&#39;m claiming that that is</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.399" end="00:24:37.419" style="s2">the achievement that we are aspiring to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.149" end="00:24:39.490" style="s2">so rationality is to reliably and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.419" end="00:24:42.549" style="s2">systematically overcome self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.490" end="00:24:44.860" style="s2">also affording flourishing optimization</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.549" end="00:24:48.190" style="s2">so you get you optimize a set of</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.860" end="00:24:52.809" style="s2">procedures for achieving the goals you</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.190" end="00:24:55.240" style="s2">want but and standard bitch doesn&#39;t talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.809" end="00:24:57.220" style="s2">enough about this other people talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.240" end="00:24:59.110" style="s2">about this when they talk like Agnes</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.220" end="00:25:01.480" style="s2">color when she talks about aspirational</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.110" end="00:25:03.590" style="s2">rationally part of it is also as you</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.480" end="00:25:06.049" style="s2">start to optimize your cognition</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.590" end="00:25:09.139" style="s2">it will also tend to shift and change</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.049" end="00:25:12.620" style="s2">the goals you are pursuing so the goals</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.139" end="00:25:15.049" style="s2">also tend to come under revision as we</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.620" end="00:25:16.999" style="s2">pursue this reliable and systematic</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.049" end="00:25:19.399" style="s2">overcoming of self-deception and the</p>

<p begin="00:25:19.399" end="00:25:31.309" style="s2">that we can afford flourishing ok so</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.159" end="00:25:36.230" style="s2">given that that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.309" end="00:25:38.210" style="s2">about we can then take a look at stander</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.230" end="00:25:40.009" style="s2">bitches work and other people&#39;s work and</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.210" end="00:25:42.169" style="s2">the way to do this is to situate it</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.009" end="00:25:45.139" style="s2">within the cognitive science of</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.169" end="00:25:51.289" style="s2">rationality and that is to take a look</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.139" end="00:25:54.080" style="s2">at the rationality debate okay so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.289" end="00:25:57.860" style="s2">rationality debate was driven by a whole</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.080" end="00:26:04.179" style="s2">bunch of experimental results that seem</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.860" end="00:26:07.179" style="s2">to show that human beings are irrational</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.179" end="00:26:07.179" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.760" end="00:26:15.750" style="s2">and how that works is I mean this is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.429" end="00:26:17.910" style="s2">not going to go into this in great</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.750" end="00:26:19.470" style="s2">lengths and I recommend you read</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.910" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">Stanovich is work I&#39;m just going to show</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.470" end="00:26:24.900" style="s2">you a couple of examples of the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:27.450" style="s2">experiments you do and then show you the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.900" end="00:26:32.940" style="s2">features of them so you give people</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.450" end="00:26:34.919" style="s2">certain problems to solve and then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.940" end="00:26:39.179" style="s2">will you&#39;ll note certain things about</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.919" end="00:26:46.679" style="s2">how they solve them so here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.179" end="00:26:51.059" style="s2">problem right so here&#39;s a right here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.679" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">pond of water right and I&#39;m covering it</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.059" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">right there&#39;s lily pads growing on it</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:58.890" style="s2">starts with one lily pad and every day</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:27:00.690" style="s2">the lily pads double right so on day day</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.890" end="00:27:03.179" style="s2">one there&#39;s one day two there&#39;s two and</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.690" end="00:27:07.650" style="s2">so for every day the lily pads are</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.179" end="00:27:11.040" style="s2">doubling and then I tell you on day 20</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.650" end="00:27:14.340" style="s2">the surface of the pond is completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.040" end="00:27:16.620" style="s2">covered on what day was the pawn half</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.340" end="00:27:19.970" style="s2">covered and people say oh on the tenth</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.620" end="00:27:25.169" style="s2">day halfway through it&#39;s half covered no</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.970" end="00:27:29.240" style="s2">right on day 19 the pond is half covered</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.169" end="00:27:32.070" style="s2">because on day 19 I&#39;m one I&#39;m halfway</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.240" end="00:27:35.760" style="s2">right oh look you have to ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.070" end="00:27:38.910" style="s2">right on day 19 I was halfway above</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.760" end="00:27:41.610" style="s2">towards being right full because</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.910" end="00:27:45.059" style="s2">doubling of half is what gets me full so</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.610" end="00:27:47.610" style="s2">it&#39;s on day 19 that the pawn what&#39;s half</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.059" end="00:27:50.130" style="s2">covered by the lily pads now what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.610" end="00:27:51.780" style="s2">interesting here is notice how the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.130" end="00:27:53.160" style="s2">Machine there&#39;s machinery like your</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.780" end="00:27:55.559" style="s2">insight machine er there&#39;s machinery</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.160" end="00:27:57.780" style="s2">that&#39;s making you leap to a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.559" end="00:27:59.820" style="s2">it sound it feels like an insight but</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.780" end="00:28:01.799" style="s2">it&#39;s actually causing you to miss sleep</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.820" end="00:28:04.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s and we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.799" end="00:28:06.809" style="s2">you&#39;re jumping to a conclusion that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.380" end="00:28:09.690" style="s2">actually incorrect now please note that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.809" end="00:28:12.690" style="s2">how that adaptive machinery that often</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.690" end="00:28:15.570" style="s2">causes you right to have an insight is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.690" end="00:28:19.980" style="s2">actually thwarting you in an important</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.570" end="00:28:21.080" style="s2">way so you people reliably fail on this</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.980" end="00:28:24.749" style="s2">kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.080" end="00:28:27.629" style="s2">right this kind of task or you can give</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.749" end="00:28:30.389" style="s2">people this kind of task you can get</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.629" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">them to you give a preliminary test and</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.389" end="00:28:36.690" style="s2">you find propositions that they strongly</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:38.879" style="s2">agree with or strongly disagree well</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.690" end="00:28:44.609" style="s2">let&#39;s say that some persons strongly</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.879" end="00:28:46.139" style="s2">believes be well you know I&#39;m not taking</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.609" end="00:28:48.059" style="s2">stand here on this particular issue</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.139" end="00:28:50.759" style="s2">right they may but you know they</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.059" end="00:28:52.529" style="s2">strongly believe that abortion is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.759" end="00:28:55.080" style="s2">or they strongly believe that capital</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.529" end="00:28:57.869" style="s2">punishment is wrong now what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.080" end="00:29:01.769" style="s2">you give them two situations you give</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.869" end="00:29:05.729" style="s2">them a good in the sense of a logically</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.769" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">valid argument that leads to not B that</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.729" end="00:29:12.299" style="s2">means not just but not in here and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:17.190" style="s2">give them a bad a very poorly</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.299" end="00:29:21.419" style="s2">constructed argument that leads to B and</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.190" end="00:29:23.849" style="s2">you ask them take a look at this and</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.419" end="00:29:26.759" style="s2">tell me which one of these is a good</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.849" end="00:29:28.859" style="s2">argument and notice notice what I said</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.759" end="00:29:31.529" style="s2">earlier how this points to what standard</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.859" end="00:29:35.159" style="s2">which argues that part of rationality is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.529" end="00:29:38.009" style="s2">your ability to remove your fixation on</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.159" end="00:29:39.539" style="s2">the product of your cognition that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.009" end="00:29:42.450" style="s2">like being locked in the nine dot</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.539" end="00:29:44.549" style="s2">problem right and be able to direct your</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.450" end="00:29:47.249" style="s2">attention and care about the processing</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.549" end="00:29:56.269" style="s2">for its own sake this is critical</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.249" end="00:29:59.549" style="s2">detachment and what you find reliably</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.269" end="00:30:02.549" style="s2">for many people is people will say oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.549" end="00:30:03.720" style="s2">well this is the good argument this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.549" end="00:30:10.940" style="s2">the good argument they&#39;ll fail a</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.720" end="00:30:13.169" style="s2">critical detachment now here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.940" end="00:30:14.879" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you a couple more of these but</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.169" end="00:30:16.649" style="s2">notice when I showed you the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.879" end="00:30:21.090" style="s2">answer in the pawned example you went oh</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.649" end="00:30:24.989" style="s2">yes of course of course so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.090" end="00:30:28.529" style="s2">acknowledge the principle you should be</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.989" end="00:30:32.419" style="s2">using but you don&#39;t actually reliably</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.529" end="00:30:34.560" style="s2">apply it so you know what the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.419" end="00:30:37.130" style="s2">reasoning principle is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.560" end="00:30:42.090" style="s2">but you don&#39;t reliably apply you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.130" end="00:30:46.380" style="s2">you know that I should be able to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.090" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">independently evaluate an argument with</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.380" end="00:30:51.030" style="s2">independent of what it leads to because</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:54.360" style="s2">if I can&#39;t do that then there is no</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.030" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">rationality possible because if you</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.360" end="00:30:59.250" style="s2">can&#39;t independently evaluate the</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:02.880" style="s2">argument then you can&#39;t use the argument</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.250" end="00:31:05.010" style="s2">to evaluate the conclusion and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.880" end="00:31:08.130" style="s2">I could never persuade you by argument</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.010" end="00:31:09.660" style="s2">so you know that you should evaluate the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.130" end="00:31:12.330" style="s2">argument independently from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.660" end="00:31:14.220" style="s2">conclusion but we reliably fail to do</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.330" end="00:31:16.740" style="s2">that do you see what the pattern is we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.220" end="00:31:19.530" style="s2">know what the principle is we acquiesce</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.740" end="00:31:22.200" style="s2">in it when it is stated to us but in</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.530" end="00:31:25.800" style="s2">experiment after experiment we reliably</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.200" end="00:31:28.350" style="s2">fail to do it let me give you one more</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.800" end="00:31:31.950" style="s2">example there are so many of these look</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.350" end="00:31:34.140" style="s2">up the conjunction fallacy look up</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.950" end="00:31:36.210" style="s2">confirmation bias look up the waste and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.140" end="00:31:37.860" style="s2">selection task some of you can read some</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.210" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">of my work elsewhere I&#39;ll give you one</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.860" end="00:31:46.170" style="s2">more example of this just because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:48.120" style="s2">again so interesting about this right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.170" end="00:31:50.370" style="s2">here&#39;s a principle we all acquiescent I</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.120" end="00:31:52.200" style="s2">believe because whenever you ask people</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.370" end="00:31:53.700" style="s2">they say yes yes of course that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.200" end="00:31:55.380" style="s2">rule we should be using here&#39;s the rule</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.700" end="00:31:58.160" style="s2">so I&#39;ve got some evidence and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.380" end="00:32:01.080" style="s2">evidence is the basis for my belief</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.160" end="00:32:05.180" style="s2">right and then if the evidence is</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.080" end="00:32:11.180" style="s2">undermined I should change my belief</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.180" end="00:32:11.180" style="s2">right of course right</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.440" end="00:32:16.490" style="s2">now of course we have disputes about</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.390" end="00:32:19.940" style="s2">what counts as evidence bla bla bla but</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.490" end="00:32:21.710" style="s2">that principle right right if the</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.940" end="00:32:24.290" style="s2">evidence for my belief changes I should</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.710" end="00:32:25.430" style="s2">change my belief now the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.290" end="00:32:27.980" style="s2">course with testing that experimentally</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.430" end="00:32:29.300" style="s2">is your beliefs are based upon all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.980" end="00:32:30.920" style="s2">of background evidence and information</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.300" end="00:32:32.690" style="s2">you&#39;ve got so testing it in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.920" end="00:32:35.600" style="s2">experimental situation is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.690" end="00:32:37.580" style="s2">difficult but this is what they did in</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.600" end="00:32:40.520" style="s2">an experiment right so what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.580" end="00:32:43.100" style="s2">you you try and create a belief just in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.520" end="00:32:44.540" style="s2">the experimental situation so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.100" end="00:32:46.550" style="s2">trying to create a new belief in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.540" end="00:32:48.500" style="s2">person right in that experiment and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.550" end="00:32:51.710" style="s2">the experiment is actually the place in</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.500" end="00:32:52.730" style="s2">which you&#39;re providing the evidence so</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.710" end="00:32:58.820" style="s2">what did they do is they brought a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.730" end="00:33:02.630" style="s2">of people in and they they told them</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.820" end="00:33:04.760" style="s2">about this important skill that they</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.630" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">wanted to see if they possessed which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.760" end="00:33:10.610" style="s2">the ability to detect authentic suicide</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:12.380" style="s2">notes many of us have no experience with</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.610" end="00:33:15.140" style="s2">this and so that&#39;s why it&#39;s plausible</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.380" end="00:33:17.000" style="s2">right that this is going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.140" end="00:33:18.980" style="s2">situation in which a new belief is going</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.000" end="00:33:21.080" style="s2">to emerge so the idea is I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.980" end="00:33:22.490" style="s2">give you a bunch of notes and you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:24.470" style="s2">to be able to tell me which ones are</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.490" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">authentic and which ones are fraudulent</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.470" end="00:33:28.790" style="s2">and this of course is a very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:31.060" style="s2">skill because it can help you know with</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.790" end="00:33:33.560" style="s2">first intervenors it can help prevent</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.060" end="00:33:35.810" style="s2">real suicide it can help us determine</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.560" end="00:33:38.270" style="s2">people who are just faking it or etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.810" end="00:33:42.050" style="s2">and so what you do is you give people a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.270" end="00:33:44.300" style="s2">bunch of notes and they or they make</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.050" end="00:33:46.040" style="s2">their judgments I think this is real no</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.300" end="00:33:47.150" style="s2">I think this is fraudulent and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.040" end="00:33:50.120" style="s2">of course give them feedback</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.150" end="00:33:54.500" style="s2">oh yes that&#39;s that&#39;s right or that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.120" end="00:33:59.660" style="s2">incorrect right and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.500" end="00:34:01.610" style="s2">right you later reveal to people the</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.660" end="00:34:03.670" style="s2">following thing that&#39;s happened people</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.610" end="00:34:06.740" style="s2">were randomly assigned to group a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.670" end="00:34:08.390" style="s2">randomly assigned to group B if they</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.740" end="00:34:10.850" style="s2">were in Group A they were told they were</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.390" end="00:34:12.200" style="s2">very good at this task if they were in</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.850" end="00:34:14.150" style="s2">Group B they were told they were very</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.200" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">bad at this task of course there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.150" end="00:34:17.150" style="s2">to be a group C which is the control</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:19.070" style="s2">group and it&#39;s just going to be neutral</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.150" end="00:34:20.210" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna use them as a control</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.070" end="00:34:21.830" style="s2">and I&#39;m not going to go into that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.210" end="00:34:25.190" style="s2">because that&#39;s just a good experimental</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.830" end="00:34:26.109" style="s2">design right and so these people come to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.190" end="00:34:28.569" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.109" end="00:34:30.730" style="s2">again on the basis of the evidence in</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.569" end="00:34:32.139" style="s2">the experiment that they&#39;re good these</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.730" end="00:34:35.109" style="s2">people come to believe they&#39;re bad and</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.139" end="00:34:37.749" style="s2">now this is what you now do once you get</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.109" end="00:34:39.190" style="s2">them to reliably evaluate like the self</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.749" end="00:34:40.690" style="s2">about and say yeah I&#39;m good look I keep</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.190" end="00:34:42.789" style="s2">doing well on this no no I&#39;m bad at this</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.690" end="00:34:47.319" style="s2">I keep doing bad on then you say aha</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.789" end="00:34:50.889" style="s2">then you debrief them right and you show</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.319" end="00:34:53.169" style="s2">them that they were right they were only</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.889" end="00:34:54.999" style="s2">getting the feedback completely randomly</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.169" end="00:34:57.009" style="s2">you show them two things all of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.999" end="00:34:58.660" style="s2">notes are fakes all of the notes are</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.009" end="00:35:01.150" style="s2">fakes none of them are real and you were</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.660" end="00:35:04.599" style="s2">given the feedback only on the arbitrary</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.150" end="00:35:06.279" style="s2">write this on the arbitrary factor the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.599" end="00:35:08.529" style="s2">completely random factor that you were</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.279" end="00:35:11.829" style="s2">just assigned to Group A or Group B what</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.529" end="00:35:14.559" style="s2">that means right is the belief that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.829" end="00:35:17.829" style="s2">are good at this or bad at this should</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.559" end="00:35:20.460" style="s2">be completely undermined because the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.829" end="00:35:23.259" style="s2">evidence for it that these are real</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.460" end="00:35:25.059" style="s2">suicide some of these are real suicide</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.259" end="00:35:26.589" style="s2">notes and that I&#39;m getting the feedback</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.059" end="00:35:30.039" style="s2">based on my performance has been</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.589" end="00:35:31.480" style="s2">completely undermined right and now you</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.039" end="00:35:34.059" style="s2">give people a bunch of distractor task</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.480" end="00:35:37.180" style="s2">so they&#39;re doing other things right and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.059" end="00:35:38.710" style="s2">then you come back and ask them okay but</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.180" end="00:35:41.049" style="s2">how do you think you would do on this in</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.710" end="00:35:43.420" style="s2">real life these people reliably port</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.049" end="00:35:45.670" style="s2">I&#39;ll be bad at it oh no these people</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.420" end="00:35:47.529" style="s2">I&#39;ll be good at this or you ask them how</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.670" end="00:35:49.509" style="s2">would you do on a tasks vary in Allegan</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.529" end="00:35:51.460" style="s2">this how you&#39;d be able to distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.509" end="00:35:53.739" style="s2">between fraudulent and legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.460" end="00:35:55.180" style="s2">marriage proposals right something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.739" end="00:35:56.079" style="s2">that and these people say oh I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.180" end="00:35:57.819" style="s2">really good at it</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.079" end="00:36:00.099" style="s2">these people say I&#39;ll be really bad at</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.819" end="00:36:02.529" style="s2">it this is known as belief for severance</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.099" end="00:36:05.349" style="s2">belief perseverance that people maintain</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.529" end="00:36:08.789" style="s2">the belief even though the only evidence</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.349" end="00:36:12.609" style="s2">for it has been completely directly</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.789" end="00:36:16.390" style="s2">undermined in front of them so once</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.609" end="00:36:18.460" style="s2">again what do we see here people</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.390" end="00:36:20.170" style="s2">acquiesce in a principle they say yes</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.460" end="00:36:23.529" style="s2">this is the principle notice to my</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.170" end="00:36:26.230" style="s2">language I should use I acknowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.529" end="00:36:28.239" style="s2">accept that I should use the principle</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.230" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">that if the evidence is undermined I</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.239" end="00:36:34.210" style="s2">should revise the belief and yet they</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:35.529" style="s2">reliably do not do that so again and</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.210" end="00:36:38.170" style="s2">again again you get all these</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.529" end="00:36:40.030" style="s2">experiments and there is a lot of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.170" end="00:36:43.030" style="s2">I&#39;ve just given you three example</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.030" end="00:36:44.920" style="s2">and there are like there&#39;s like 15 kinds</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.030" end="00:36:47.470" style="s2">of experiments you can run and you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.920" end="00:36:52.350" style="s2">tens sometimes hundreds of versions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.470" end="00:37:01.330" style="s2">these experiments right so people</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.350" end="00:37:04.980" style="s2">acknowledge the principle and then they</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.330" end="00:37:08.050" style="s2">reliably fail to engage in it so they</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.980" end="00:37:10.630" style="s2">suffer notice my language here from</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.050" end="00:37:18.300" style="s2">systemic illusion systemic</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.630" end="00:37:18.300" style="s2">self-deception all right so a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.990" end="00:37:23.050" style="s2">psychologists call you scientists and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.580" end="00:37:26.260" style="s2">philosophers we&#39;re coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.050" end="00:37:29.200" style="s2">conclusion that well that must human</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.260" end="00:37:32.050" style="s2">beings are just irrational right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.200" end="00:37:34.120" style="s2">just irrational and so this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.050" end="00:37:36.940" style="s2">we&#39;ve carried throughout all of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.120" end="00:37:40.090" style="s2">history from you know Aristotle on that</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.940" end="00:37:42.730" style="s2">human beings are the rational the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.090" end="00:37:44.560" style="s2">irrational animals that&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.730" end="00:37:46.380" style="s2">flawed we&#39;re not human beings are not</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.560" end="00:37:49.990" style="s2">rational no no that&#39;s very problematic</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.380" end="00:37:51.790" style="s2">right because think about what that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.990" end="00:37:53.770" style="s2">means if you if you were convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.790" end="00:37:58.390" style="s2">that was deeply correct that human</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.770" end="00:38:00.460" style="s2">beings are not rational then you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.390" end="00:38:03.300" style="s2">a very tough time justifying democracy</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.460" end="00:38:05.890" style="s2">because if human beings are reliably</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.300" end="00:38:07.920" style="s2">irrational democracy is a very bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.890" end="00:38:11.530" style="s2">you should you should have the few</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.920" end="00:38:13.270" style="s2">people who are reliably rational and let</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.530" end="00:38:15.880" style="s2">them rule for example I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.270" end="00:38:17.560" style="s2">this I&#39;m not advocating this I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.880" end="00:38:19.360" style="s2">to show you the consequences you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.560" end="00:38:21.070" style="s2">our legal system is also based on the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.360" end="00:38:24.550" style="s2">idea that people are fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.070" end="00:38:27.490" style="s2">reasonable reliably rational but if</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.550" end="00:38:30.430" style="s2">that&#39;s not the case can we hold people</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.490" end="00:38:32.380" style="s2">responsible for their actions I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.430" end="00:38:36.150" style="s2">way they&#39;re connecting evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.380" end="00:38:39.150" style="s2">believe to action is seriously you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.150" end="00:38:39.150" style="s2">problematic</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.930" end="00:38:45.580" style="s2">morality depends and this is something</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.880" end="00:38:48.910" style="s2">that Kant famously argued for morality</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.580" end="00:38:51.340" style="s2">depends on rationality people can only</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.910" end="00:38:55.120" style="s2">be held moral if they can also be deemed</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.340" end="00:38:58.960" style="s2">rational right if you if you keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.120" end="00:39:01.300" style="s2">the right thing because of Locke right</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.960" end="00:39:03.490" style="s2">or because of coercion we don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.300" end="00:39:05.170" style="s2">you moral we think it but if you do the</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.490" end="00:39:07.240" style="s2">right thing because you have reasoned it</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.170" end="00:39:09.700" style="s2">out and come to conclusion that that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.240" end="00:39:17.860" style="s2">the right thing to do right then of</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:22.960" style="s2">course we do deem you moral so as you</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.860" end="00:39:24.490" style="s2">can imagine right a debate arose and</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.960" end="00:39:27.310" style="s2">this is a very good thing for science</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.490" end="00:39:29.320" style="s2">right see notice what&#39;s going on here</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.310" end="00:39:32.190" style="s2">with rationality rationality is isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.320" end="00:39:36.820" style="s2">just a fact out in the world like</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.190" end="00:39:39.340" style="s2">whether or not the earth is round right</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.820" end="00:39:40.930" style="s2">rationality ultimately goes because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.340" end="00:39:42.670" style="s2">is so deeply tied to prospective and</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.930" end="00:39:46.360" style="s2">participatory knowing it goes deeply to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.670" end="00:39:50.040" style="s2">who and what I am and that has</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.360" end="00:39:52.120" style="s2">implications for what kind of political</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.040" end="00:39:54.940" style="s2">citizenship I can have what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.120" end="00:39:57.070" style="s2">moral status I can have what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.940" end="00:39:58.990" style="s2">legal status I can have even your</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.070" end="00:40:01.060" style="s2">judgments for example if I&#39;m mature or</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.990" end="00:40:03.700" style="s2">immature are going to be vectored</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.060" end="00:40:08.040" style="s2">through how well you are self how how</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.700" end="00:40:08.040" style="s2">you how you assess how rational I am</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.410" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">rationality is a deeply existential</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.040" end="00:40:17.280" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.860" end="00:40:30.570" style="s2">so a debate ensued around wet this boy</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.300" end="00:40:33.330" style="s2">they&#39;re not we should interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.570" end="00:40:35.100" style="s2">experiments or what they are and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.330" end="00:40:36.930" style="s2">robust and reliable they are not</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.100" end="00:40:42.650" style="s2">suffering the replication crisis these</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.930" end="00:40:45.150" style="s2">experiments so these experiments are</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.650" end="00:40:46.680" style="s2">robust and reliable but there&#39;s a debate</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.150" end="00:40:48.150" style="s2">about and there&#39;s always another always</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.680" end="00:40:49.800" style="s2">should be a debate innocence or in</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.150" end="00:40:51.810" style="s2">science about how you interpret your</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.800" end="00:40:53.340" style="s2">experiments should we interpret these</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.810" end="00:40:57.690" style="s2">experiments to mean that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.340" end="00:40:59.610" style="s2">are fundamentally irrational now a</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.690" end="00:41:01.770" style="s2">debate ensued and that debate is very</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.610" end="00:41:04.740" style="s2">important and I want to go through this</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.770" end="00:41:07.110" style="s2">debate why are we doing this well first</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.740" end="00:41:08.930" style="s2">of all I&#39;m trying to show you the deep</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.110" end="00:41:11.130" style="s2">connections between wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.930" end="00:41:13.740" style="s2">rationality and I&#39;m trying to show you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.130" end="00:41:16.620" style="s2">the existential and political and moral</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.740" end="00:41:19.170" style="s2">import of rationality and I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.620" end="00:41:21.600" style="s2">trying to get you to consider expanding</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.170" end="00:41:24.360" style="s2">and revising the notion of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.600" end="00:41:27.780" style="s2">in a way that will help us to come back</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.360" end="00:41:30.150" style="s2">and deepen our understanding of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.780" end="00:41:32.250" style="s2">why are we trying to understand wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.150" end="00:41:36.690" style="s2">because wisdom is deeply associated with</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.250" end="00:41:40.440" style="s2">meaning and wisdom is deeply needed for</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.690" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">addressing the project sort for for</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.440" end="00:41:43.860" style="s2">cultivating enlightenment for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:46.050" style="s2">project of enlightenment and addressing</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.860" end="00:41:49.170" style="s2">the perennial problems and also for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.050" end="00:41:51.750" style="s2">project of addressing the historical</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.170" end="00:41:59.690" style="s2">forces that have driven the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.750" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">crisis okay so the rationality debate</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.690" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">the first major response is by Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.060" end="00:42:10.320" style="s2">Cohen makes a very important argument</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.120" end="00:42:12.890" style="s2">it&#39;s in an argument that we have we need</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.320" end="00:42:15.990" style="s2">to go carefully through and see again</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.890" end="00:42:18.900" style="s2">there&#39;s what I mean there has been so</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.990" end="00:42:22.850" style="s2">much the work put into the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.900" end="00:42:25.920" style="s2">rationality we should not take the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.850" end="00:42:29.610" style="s2">self-proclaimed promoters of rationality</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.920" end="00:42:30.440" style="s2">on YouTube to be clear examples of what</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.610" end="00:42:35.119" style="s2">rationale</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.440" end="00:42:39.020" style="s2">is okay we have to do this more</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.119" end="00:42:41.290" style="s2">carefully cautiously reflectively paying</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.020" end="00:42:44.089" style="s2">much more attention to the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.290" end="00:42:49.130" style="s2">evidence the empirical evidence and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.089" end="00:42:51.560" style="s2">debate so Cohen argued that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.130" end="00:42:56.349" style="s2">problem with concluding that human</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.560" end="00:43:00.410" style="s2">beings are fundamentally irrational and</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.349" end="00:43:08.180" style="s2">his argument comes down to a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.410" end="00:43:13.099" style="s2">very key points so let me use this word</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.180" end="00:43:17.710" style="s2">cuz okay Cohen says okay to be rational</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.099" end="00:43:21.890" style="s2">is to acknowledge and to follow a set of</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.710" end="00:43:25.130" style="s2">right standards and we noted that that</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.890" end="00:43:28.609" style="s2">we can only attribute irrationality to</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.130" end="00:43:30.530" style="s2">someone something if it acknowledges the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.609" end="00:43:33.740" style="s2">standards and then fails to meet them to</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.530" end="00:43:37.640" style="s2">say that this book is irrational makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.740" end="00:43:39.920" style="s2">no sense because it does not acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.640" end="00:43:41.810" style="s2">the authority of those standards so the</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.920" end="00:43:44.420" style="s2">fact that it fails to meets those</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.810" end="00:43:48.819" style="s2">standards is no reason for calling it</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.420" end="00:43:48.819" style="s2">irrational the book is a rational okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.420" end="00:43:54.770" style="s2">so Cohen stops right there and he says</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.700" end="00:43:58.390" style="s2">well let&#39;s slow down let&#39;s ask ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.770" end="00:43:58.390" style="s2">where do we get these</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.609" end="00:44:07.539" style="s2">the way he asked this is how do we come</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.709" end="00:44:09.789" style="s2">up with our normative theory normative</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.539" end="00:44:11.920" style="s2">not meaning statistically normal normal</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.789" end="00:44:14.019" style="s2">here but normative meaning the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.920" end="00:44:15.849" style="s2">theory about of the standards to which</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.019" end="00:44:18.309" style="s2">we should hold ourselves accountable</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.849" end="00:44:24.239" style="s2">when we&#39;re reasoning so where does our</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.309" end="00:44:26.859" style="s2">normative theory come from right and</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.239" end="00:44:29.410" style="s2">then he makes use of an argument that</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.859" end="00:44:30.640" style="s2">goes back to Plato and you can it goes</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.410" end="00:44:34.029" style="s2">all the way through the Conte and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.640" end="00:44:37.140" style="s2">like well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a deep sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.029" end="00:44:42.099" style="s2">in which reason has to be autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.140" end="00:44:46.019" style="s2">let&#39;s say I believed that my standards</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.099" end="00:44:50.559" style="s2">were given to me by some divine being</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.019" end="00:44:53.670" style="s2">right in the sense that right it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.559" end="00:44:58.059" style="s2">commanded of me there are some Moses of</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.670" end="00:45:01.479" style="s2">rationality and the thee comes back or</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.059" end="00:45:04.719" style="s2">she comes back with the commandments for</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.479" end="00:45:07.150" style="s2">how was supposed to reason so if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.719" end="00:45:09.640" style="s2">follow these just because we are</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.150" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">commanded to do so that is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.640" end="00:45:14.259" style="s2">not a rational act that is just to give</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:16.180" style="s2">into authority to give in to fear and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.259" end="00:45:22.170" style="s2">would be doing the same thing regardless</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.180" end="00:45:25.029" style="s2">of what those standards were right if we</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.170" end="00:45:27.459" style="s2">follow the standards because we</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.029" end="00:45:29.079" style="s2">acknowledge that they&#39;re good and right</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.459" end="00:45:31.509" style="s2">that means we already possess the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.079" end="00:45:33.190" style="s2">standards this is an old argument that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.509" end="00:45:37.809" style="s2">goes back to Plato it&#39;s in the Euthyphro</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.190" end="00:45:40.989" style="s2">dialogue right we&#39;re right normativity</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.809" end="00:45:43.119" style="s2">has to be really deeply autonomous if</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.989" end="00:45:45.489" style="s2">something is only good because the gods</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.119" end="00:45:48.819" style="s2">say it then the gods aren&#39;t good in</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.489" end="00:45:52.930" style="s2">saying it look if God says to you do X</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.819" end="00:45:56.769" style="s2">and X isn&#39;t independently good to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.930" end="00:46:01.150" style="s2">then God&#39;s saying do X does not make God</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.769" end="00:46:03.430" style="s2">good because it would only make God good</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.150" end="00:46:06.789" style="s2">to say doing acts if doing X was</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.430" end="00:46:09.219" style="s2">independently good and if we only do</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.789" end="00:46:13.529" style="s2">something because we&#39;re commanded to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.219" end="00:46:16.029" style="s2">it not because we independently accept</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.529" end="00:46:16.670" style="s2">that it is the good or the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.029" end="00:46:19.490" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.670" end="00:46:26.299" style="s2">then we are also acting arbitrarily and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.490" end="00:46:32.569" style="s2">not acting in a good manner so right we</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.299" end="00:46:35.210" style="s2">have to possess the standards this is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.569" end="00:46:38.569" style="s2">argument right you know crucial and</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.210" end="00:46:40.700" style="s2">conch rash reason is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.569" end="00:46:42.920" style="s2">autonomous not in the sense of people</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.700" end="00:46:45.109" style="s2">misunderstand it that it&#39;s like a god or</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.920" end="00:46:49.069" style="s2">that right it has right absolute for</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.109" end="00:46:51.829" style="s2">it&#39;s that reason has to be the source of</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.069" end="00:46:54.799" style="s2">the very norms that constitute and</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.829" end="00:47:00.740" style="s2">govern reason because that&#39;s how reason</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.799" end="00:47:04.010" style="s2">operates okay so we have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.740" end="00:47:09.170" style="s2">standard there&#39;s another way of seeing</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.010" end="00:47:11.269" style="s2">this odd implies can giving you two</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.170" end="00:47:14.900" style="s2">separate arguments for this idea odd</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.269" end="00:47:18.890" style="s2">implies can if I lay a standard upon you</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.900" end="00:47:22.670" style="s2">you ought to do this then you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.890" end="00:47:25.039" style="s2">able to do it it makes no sense to apply</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.670" end="00:47:30.920" style="s2">a standard to you that you do not have</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.039" end="00:47:34.279" style="s2">the competence to fulfill okay you ought</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.920" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">to always say what is only certain and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.279" end="00:47:42.700" style="s2">perfectly true and if you don&#39;t you are</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:45.769" style="s2">failing you&#39;re immoral in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.700" end="00:47:47.990" style="s2">but that&#39;s of course impossible you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.769" end="00:47:50.660" style="s2">can&#39;t lay on anybody the obligation to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.990" end="00:47:53.000" style="s2">speak all and only what is true because</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.660" end="00:47:55.819" style="s2">everybody has false beliefs most of our</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.000" end="00:47:57.529" style="s2">beliefs are false and nobody can act</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.819" end="00:48:00.170" style="s2">comprehensively according to standards</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.529" end="00:48:05.329" style="s2">of certainty if I lay that standard on</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.170" end="00:48:07.160" style="s2">you it&#39;s a mistake because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.329" end="00:48:14.150" style="s2">have the competence to fulfill those</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.160" end="00:48:16.099" style="s2">standards okay so and there&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.150" end="00:48:18.200" style="s2">much argument that converges on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.099" end="00:48:22.900" style="s2">right that&#39;s point okay we are the</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.200" end="00:48:25.000" style="s2">source of the standards</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.900" end="00:48:27.130" style="s2">that&#39;s of course why you so readily</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.000" end="00:48:30.550" style="s2">acquiesce in them but then of course you</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.130" end="00:48:33.130" style="s2">should immediately say right but what</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.550" end="00:48:35.110" style="s2">the experiments show is yes people</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.130" end="00:48:37.140" style="s2">acknowledge the standard but they fail</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.110" end="00:48:40.870" style="s2">to satisfy them</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.140" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">well then Cohen does something very</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.870" end="00:48:46.540" style="s2">interesting he says well we have to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:52.390" style="s2">careful people make two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.540" end="00:48:54.120" style="s2">mistakes right and what we have to do is</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.390" end="00:48:58.630" style="s2">we have to make a distinction between</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.120" end="00:49:05.530" style="s2">competence and performance so let me</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.630" end="00:49:07.030" style="s2">give you an example this goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.530" end="00:49:10.390" style="s2">Chomsky and we talked about it when we</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.030" end="00:49:11.950" style="s2">talked about systemic error let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.390" end="00:49:14.380" style="s2">again just to bring it back into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.950" end="00:49:16.480" style="s2">argument okay competence is what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.380" end="00:49:17.860" style="s2">capable of doing performance is what</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.480" end="00:49:19.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually done you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.860" end="00:49:20.710" style="s2">competence that greatly exceeds what</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.720" end="00:49:22.270" style="s2">you&#39;ve got really don&#39;t you have a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.710" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">competence to speak so many sentences</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.270" end="00:49:29.500" style="s2">that you will never speak right right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:33.760" style="s2">it is false that I have held my breath</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.500" end="00:49:36.100" style="s2">underwater for 17 days while listening</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.760" end="00:49:38.760" style="s2">to Beethoven&#39;s 5th Symphony with a</p>

<p begin="00:49:38.760" end="00:49:45.570" style="s2">that since happens to be true by the way</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.630" end="00:49:47.590" style="s2">the fact that I uttered it is bizarre I</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.570" end="00:49:50.950" style="s2">probably would never have uttered it in</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.590" end="00:49:52.330" style="s2">my life right so but you have the call I</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.950" end="00:49:53.890" style="s2">have the competence to generate it and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.330" end="00:49:55.840" style="s2">you have the competence to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.890" end="00:49:57.280" style="s2">so competence is what you&#39;re capable of</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.840" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">doing performance of what you actually</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:50:02.080" style="s2">do now the thing is in between your</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:04.180" style="s2">competence and your performance right</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.080" end="00:50:09.880" style="s2">there are all the implementation</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.180" end="00:50:14.110" style="s2">processes remember this so I have the</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.880" end="00:50:16.660" style="s2">competence to speak English but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.110" end="00:50:19.090" style="s2">if I&#39;m extremely tired the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.660" end="00:50:21.130" style="s2">implementation process is did the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.090" end="00:50:22.930" style="s2">English in me doesn&#39;t it comes out</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.130" end="00:50:25.150" style="s2">garbled why I start slurring my speech</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.930" end="00:50:28.060" style="s2">or right perhaps if I was very drunk or</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.150" end="00:50:29.620" style="s2">something now you don&#39;t think that when</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.060" end="00:50:32.110" style="s2">I&#39;m very drunk or very tired that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.620" end="00:50:34.000" style="s2">lost the competence you just think</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.110" end="00:50:35.640" style="s2">rightly by the way that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.000" end="00:50:37.460" style="s2">something interference in too</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.640" end="00:50:40.980" style="s2">with the implementation processes</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.460" end="00:50:44.250" style="s2">alright but if I get in a car accident</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.980" end="00:50:47.940" style="s2">and my brain is damaged and I I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.250" end="00:50:53.280" style="s2">slurring my speech all the time and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.940" end="00:50:54.560" style="s2">go oh no John&#39;s lost English it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.280" end="00:51:00.900" style="s2">different thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.560" end="00:51:03.960" style="s2">all right now Coen does something really</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.900" end="00:51:06.450" style="s2">clever here he says how do we come up</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.960" end="00:51:08.400" style="s2">with this well we have to be the source</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.450" end="00:51:12.560" style="s2">of it and it has to be something that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.400" end="00:51:12.560" style="s2">can hold ourselves to odd implies can</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.670" end="00:51:16.710" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.820" end="00:51:19.470" style="s2">so where do we come up with these</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.710" end="00:51:20.880" style="s2">standards well what we do this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.470" end="00:51:22.860" style="s2">come up with all of our normative</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.880" end="00:51:25.800" style="s2">theories what we do is we look at our</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.860" end="00:51:29.160" style="s2">performance and we try to subtract from</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.800" end="00:51:30.660" style="s2">our performance all of the errors in it</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.160" end="00:51:33.030" style="s2">that are due to implementation</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.660" end="00:51:33.780" style="s2">implementation errors or as if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.030" end="00:51:36.570" style="s2">often called</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.780" end="00:51:38.730" style="s2">performance errors errors and how I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.570" end="00:51:41.460" style="s2">implementing my competence and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.730" end="00:51:44.070" style="s2">do is by this process of systematic</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.460" end="00:51:46.370" style="s2">idealization I try to come up with an</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.070" end="00:51:50.370" style="s2">account of what my competence looks like</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.370" end="00:51:52.110" style="s2">completely free of performance errors so</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.370" end="00:51:55.170" style="s2">why would I have to have in my head so</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.110" end="00:51:56.370" style="s2">that I could reliably speak and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.170" end="00:51:58.200" style="s2">understand English</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.370" end="00:52:01.080" style="s2">all the time in a perfect manner now of</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.200" end="00:52:03.240" style="s2">course all the time I&#39;m speaking because</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.080" end="00:52:06.180" style="s2">of implementation processes there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.240" end="00:52:09.480" style="s2">performance errors you times stammer I</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.180" end="00:52:11.240" style="s2">sometimes stutter there&#39;s gaps I speak</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.480" end="00:52:13.440" style="s2">elliptically notice they&#39;re just what I</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.240" end="00:52:18.210" style="s2">okay those are performance errors and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.440" end="00:52:22.680" style="s2">you read through those right so what we</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.210" end="00:52:24.630" style="s2">do is we take our performance we put it</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.680" end="00:52:26.880" style="s2">through a process of idealization we try</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.630" end="00:52:28.440" style="s2">and subtract all the performance errors</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.880" end="00:52:32.850" style="s2">that come from the implementation and</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.440" end="00:52:35.940" style="s2">then we get a purified account right of</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.850" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">our competence an idealized account in</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.940" end="00:52:41.370" style="s2">that sense and then it sits purified of</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:43.620" style="s2">distortion by performance errors and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.370" end="00:52:45.540" style="s2">then that is the standard to which we</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.620" end="00:52:47.760" style="s2">hold ourselves that&#39;s how we come up</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.540" end="00:52:49.260" style="s2">with a normative theory that shows how</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.760" end="00:52:52.140" style="s2">we can be the source</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.260" end="00:52:54.180" style="s2">and how we&#39;re alternately capable of it</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.140" end="00:52:56.940" style="s2">but how we can have nevertheless a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.180" end="00:53:00.360" style="s2">of the time fail to meet it so what he</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.940" end="00:53:02.280" style="s2">argues brilliantly but we&#39;re gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.360" end="00:53:04.920" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be problems with it he</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.280" end="00:53:07.230" style="s2">argues that all of the errors in these</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.920" end="00:53:09.600" style="s2">experiments have to be performance</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.230" end="00:53:11.730" style="s2">errors that all of the mistakes that</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.600" end="00:53:14.580" style="s2">people are making are like the slips of</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.580" end="00:53:21.030" style="s2">performance errors because why people</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.810" end="00:53:23.400" style="s2">have to be the source of the standards</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.030" end="00:53:26.820" style="s2">and they have to be able of meeting</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.400" end="00:53:29.250" style="s2">those standards so we must have at the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.820" end="00:53:32.100" style="s2">level of our competence all of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.250" end="00:53:34.350" style="s2">rational standards we must be at the</p>

<p begin="00:53:37.020" end="00:53:43.080" style="s2">making those mistakes is performance</p>

<p begin="00:54:07.470" end="00:54:13.620" style="s2">show us again about the nature of human</p>
