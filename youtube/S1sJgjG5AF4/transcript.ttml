<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.589" style="s2">hey folks Bret here I want to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.909" end="00:00:06.569" style="s2">you about a thought that has been</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.589" end="00:00:10.010" style="s2">preoccupying me over the last several</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.569" end="00:00:12.380" style="s2">months and it&#39;s a concern about where</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.010" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">intersectionality is going to lead us</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.380" end="00:00:16.560" style="s2">but in order to understand the concern I</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:21.330" style="s2">have to step back into evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.560" end="00:00:24.570" style="s2">history there are really two ways in</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.330" end="00:00:27.240" style="s2">which cooperation evolves the first one</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.570" end="00:00:29.510" style="s2">is very ancient it is based on genetic</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.240" end="00:00:31.980" style="s2">relatedness and it&#39;s very hard to put a</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.510" end="00:00:35.520" style="s2">starting point in it but it literally</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.980" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">goes back billions of years the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.520" end="00:00:41.520" style="s2">kind of cooperation is based on various</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">kinds of reciprocity and it is much</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.520" end="00:00:46.920" style="s2">newer and much more fragile it really</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:49.379" style="s2">gets going in human beings after the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.920" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">invention of farming approximately</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.379" end="00:00:56.550" style="s2">10,000 years ago the problem stems from</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">the fact that when reciprocity based</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.550" end="00:01:03.660" style="s2">cooperation breaks down we default to</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:05.820" style="s2">gene based cooperation now look at that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.660" end="00:01:09.990" style="s2">in the context of intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.820" end="00:01:13.830" style="s2">which has captured the attention of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:17.250" style="s2">far left intersectionality effectively</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.830" end="00:01:18.900" style="s2">argues that people have different kinds</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.250" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">of oppression that they have</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.900" end="00:01:25.380" style="s2">historically suffered from based on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:30.689" style="s2">categories that they inhabit so your</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.380" end="00:01:33.000" style="s2">race your gender your your sex all carry</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.689" end="00:01:35.700" style="s2">degrees of oppression that come from</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.000" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">history and the intersection lists would</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.700" end="00:01:41.009" style="s2">like to transfer well-being from those</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:42.630" style="s2">who have historically been privileged to</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.009" end="00:01:44.340" style="s2">those who have historically been</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.630" end="00:01:46.020" style="s2">oppressed based essentially on an</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.340" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">accounting scheme how many different</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.020" end="00:01:49.950" style="s2">kinds of oppression have you faced and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.790" style="s2">what are the implications of how those</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.950" end="00:01:57.450" style="s2">different kinds of oppression interact</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.790" end="00:02:01.250" style="s2">but the problem is that this way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.450" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">thinking which is very frequently a</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.250" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">cartoon of reality it does not depict</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:10.250" style="s2">the way oppression actually functions in</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">the present lacks nuance but beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.250" end="00:02:17.520" style="s2">in order to function it has to define</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:19.740" style="s2">an enemy the enemy is effectively a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.520" end="00:02:22.470" style="s2">fiction in this case it is something</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.740" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">called whiteness and the way the enemy</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.470" end="00:02:27.510" style="s2">is drawn whiteness is an inherent</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:30.210" style="s2">characteristic something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.510" end="00:02:33.930" style="s2">read on the skin and what that means is</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.210" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">there&#39;s no escaping it so for people who</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.930" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">suffer from whiteness you are simply</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:41.670" style="s2">going to be on the losing end of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:44.820" style="s2">intersectional juggernaut no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.670" end="00:02:49.080" style="s2">you do if you think about how that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.820" end="00:02:51.570" style="s2">likely to unfold people who are the</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:53.610" style="s2">object of ire from the intersection list</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.570" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">are going to be backed against the wall</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.610" end="00:03:00.180" style="s2">together who are they going to be well</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:04.350" style="s2">primarily they&#39;re going to be straight</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.180" end="00:03:06.630" style="s2">and white and very frequently male what</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.350" end="00:03:09.290" style="s2">happens though if you back straight</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.630" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">white males against the wall together</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.290" end="00:03:15.420" style="s2">well think about what goes on in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:19.380" style="s2">intersectional side as the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.420" end="00:03:21.000" style="s2">lists take power the coalition that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.380" end="00:03:22.890" style="s2">have assembled is likely to break down</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.000" end="00:03:25.020" style="s2">in other words those who are on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.890" end="00:03:27.420" style="s2">intersectional side but are not at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.020" end="00:03:29.340" style="s2">top of it have a lot to lose in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.420" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">reordering of things that would come</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.340" end="00:03:33.810" style="s2">from a win by the intersection list so</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:35.430" style="s2">cooperation game theoretically is very</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.810" end="00:03:38.490" style="s2">likely to break down amongst the</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.430" end="00:03:40.020" style="s2">intersection lists at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.490" end="00:03:42.630" style="s2">people who they have backed against the</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.020" end="00:03:44.550" style="s2">wall together have a second basis for</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.630" end="00:03:48.120" style="s2">cooperation and it is much more durable</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.550" end="00:03:50.430" style="s2">it is genetic cooperation so the concern</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.120" end="00:03:53.850" style="s2">that I have is that the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.430" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">lists may end up creating the very enemy</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.850" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">they claim they are fighting they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:00.420" style="s2">going to back straight white males</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:04.110" style="s2">against the wall and speak of the devil</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.420" end="00:04:07.470" style="s2">white nationalism will emerge from that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.110" end="00:04:10.370" style="s2">cohort and when it does those people</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.470" end="00:04:12.300" style="s2">will feel empowered and they will feel</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.370" end="00:04:16.340" style="s2">self-righteous because they have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.300" end="00:04:19.109" style="s2">accused of things that are frankly a</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.340" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">form of bigotry they have been accused</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:23.070" style="s2">by bigots of oppressing others and they</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">have been told that they are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.070" end="00:04:27.520" style="s2">entitled to well-being no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:29.710" style="s2">they individually have</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.520" end="00:04:32.800" style="s2">behaved and so what do they have to lose</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.710" end="00:04:35.169" style="s2">by cooperating together against the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.800" end="00:04:37.629" style="s2">intersection &#39;less and essentially</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.169" end="00:04:42.729" style="s2">creating the world that the intersection</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.629" end="00:04:44.440" style="s2">was claimed already exists now what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.729" end="00:04:47.020" style="s2">should do about this is not entirely</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.440" end="00:04:48.940" style="s2">clear but one thing that must happen is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.020" end="00:04:51.250" style="s2">we must level up our thinking and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.940" end="00:04:53.530" style="s2">must understand that backing people</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.250" end="00:04:56.139" style="s2">against the wall who have a genetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.530" end="00:04:59.110" style="s2">basis for cooperation is very dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.139" end="00:05:02.530" style="s2">because history tells us that movements</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.110" end="00:05:05.110" style="s2">created by such people can be very</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.530" end="00:05:09.610" style="s2">destructive and that ultimately they may</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.110" end="00:05:11.139" style="s2">turn into a genocidal menace so what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.610" end="00:05:13.060" style="s2">the outgrowth of all of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.139" end="00:05:16.810" style="s2">preoccupation that I&#39;ve had on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.060" end="00:05:19.389" style="s2">topic I think the answer is fairly clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.810" end="00:05:21.849" style="s2">the answer is that we must recognize</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.389" end="00:05:24.460" style="s2">that the very best things that human</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.849" end="00:05:27.069" style="s2">beings are capable of are based on this</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.460" end="00:05:30.190" style="s2">more elevated type of cooperation we</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.069" end="00:05:32.979" style="s2">have to resist the urge to fall into</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.190" end="00:05:35.919" style="s2">this negative kind of tribalism that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.979" end="00:05:38.110" style="s2">driven on both sides by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.919" end="00:05:40.900" style="s2">intersectional movement and we must</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.110" end="00:05:43.029" style="s2">foster the kind of cooperation that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.900" end="00:05:45.610" style="s2">spread over the course of recent history</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.029" end="00:05:47.469" style="s2">where people increasingly ignore genetic</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.610" end="00:05:50.169" style="s2">relatedness and they find other reasons</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.469" end="00:05:52.330" style="s2">to get along and to prosper together hey</p>
