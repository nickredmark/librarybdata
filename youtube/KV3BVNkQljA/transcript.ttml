<p begin="00:00:07.049" end="00:00:13.740" style="s2">which species would you well.one this</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.580" end="00:00:17.340" style="s2">get our term straight here at number one</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.740" end="00:00:19.080" style="s2">our assumption if someone doing</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.340" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">permaculture boots on started medicinal</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.080" end="00:00:21.869" style="s2">mushroom garden or a mushroom garden</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.359" style="s2">they&#39;re actually doing it already yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.869" end="00:00:27.449" style="s2">so the permaculture permaculture ist&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.359" end="00:00:29.490" style="s2">are growing mycelium are growing all</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.449" end="00:00:30.539" style="s2">sorts of microflora and you know in</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.490" end="00:00:33.989" style="s2">their environments they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.539" end="00:00:36.360" style="s2">seeing the advantageous species like at</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.989" end="00:00:38.520" style="s2">finned when we saw the big parasol</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.360" end="00:00:39.899" style="s2">mushroom mac macro lepida Procera coming</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.520" end="00:00:43.370" style="s2">up beautifully with the plants well</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.899" end="00:00:45.920" style="s2">that&#39;s a great pairing right there so</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.370" end="00:00:49.260" style="s2">the mushrooms that can be grown in</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.920" end="00:00:53.190" style="s2">companion cultivation in the garden are</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.260" end="00:00:56.850" style="s2">many fold there&#39;s there&#39;s the hips as I</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.190" end="00:00:58.199" style="s2">guess species the elm oysters from the</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.850" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">conference we were just at it was quite</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.199" end="00:01:01.230" style="s2">surprised and delighted to see the</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:05.010" style="s2">pleurotus pulmonary us maybe an end to</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.230" end="00:01:08.520" style="s2">fight and the fights are fungi that grow</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.010" end="00:01:10.200" style="s2">in association with the plants and they</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.520" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">give a host defense resistance against</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.409" end="00:01:21.420" style="s2">is one of them but the Amadou mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.049" end="00:01:24.030" style="s2">my hat is made from Amadou the birch</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.420" end="00:01:26.820" style="s2">polypore foamies vomit areas just as</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.030" end="00:01:28.829" style="s2">past four years ago research came out</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.820" end="00:01:31.290" style="s2">that it is an end to fight protecting</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.829" end="00:01:33.150" style="s2">potentially birch trees and this</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.290" end="00:01:36.990" style="s2">mushroom only forms on dead birch trees</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.150" end="00:01:39.180" style="s2">but the fungus infuses the stems and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.990" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">leaves of the birch tree preventing</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.180" end="00:01:43.619" style="s2">other quick to kill parasites from</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:46.049" style="s2">killing the birch tree but when the</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.619" end="00:01:48.780" style="s2">birch tree matures and dies for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.049" end="00:01:51.210" style="s2">reason then the fungus goes okay I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.780" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">protected you my time to reproduce and</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.210" end="00:01:55.590" style="s2">then it produces this Woodcock a hard</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">hoof and then this wood conch has</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.590" end="00:02:01.790" style="s2">antiviral properties we do know that</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:03.770" style="s2">it&#39;s active against the actually the</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.790" end="00:02:05.570" style="s2">I think it&#39;s called the variegated to</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.770" end="00:02:07.640" style="s2">tobacco virus as one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.570" end="00:02:10.490" style="s2">antivirals were found were found from</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.640" end="00:02:11.780" style="s2">the Amadou mushroom and now we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.490" end="00:02:14.180" style="s2">active against other viruses and other</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.780" end="00:02:16.450" style="s2">bacteria as at the vols protozoa so our</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.180" end="00:02:19.310" style="s2">ancestors I think and especially women</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.450" end="00:02:20.810" style="s2">it&#39;s just a fact of life is that men</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.310" end="00:02:22.130" style="s2">have testosterone we go out and beat</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.810" end="00:02:23.540" style="s2">each other up and kill each other with</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.130" end="00:02:25.490" style="s2">sores a lot more than women do I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.540" end="00:02:28.040" style="s2">most people accept that we come back to</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.490" end="00:02:29.450" style="s2">the camp were wounded and women are</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.040" end="00:02:31.970" style="s2">there because the children and nursing</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.450" end="00:02:34.910" style="s2">and all of that and I think they were</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.970" end="00:02:37.580" style="s2">the great mycologist of ancient time</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.910" end="00:02:40.310" style="s2">they were the labor making the mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.580" end="00:02:42.590" style="s2">potions they were boiling Amadou to</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.310" end="00:02:45.110" style="s2">create and preserve meat reduces</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.590" end="00:02:46.910" style="s2">bacteria the fabric that can be made in</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.110" end="00:02:48.740" style="s2">the clothing and I could give that to</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.910" end="00:02:50.990" style="s2">you to prevent you know parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.740" end="00:02:54.170" style="s2">diseases from infecting your wounds and</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.990" end="00:02:55.990" style="s2">I think there was a lot of this concept</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.170" end="00:02:58.280" style="s2">that witches brew I think there was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.990" end="00:03:01.640" style="s2">especially in middle Europe there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.280" end="00:03:02.600" style="s2">the enormous knowledge base around</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.640" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">paganism</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.600" end="00:03:08.090" style="s2">and witches and and some of these acts</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:10.190" style="s2">were Christian witches so it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.090" end="00:03:12.770" style="s2">Christianity here&#39;s about Earth based</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.190" end="00:03:15.260" style="s2">knowledge and knowledge of natural</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.770" end="00:03:17.600" style="s2">systems and that these medicinal</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.260" end="00:03:21.380" style="s2">mushrooms and even the psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.600" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">mushrooms are feared by many because</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.380" end="00:03:23.239" style="s2">they&#39;re so powerful and yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:25.730" style="s2">misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.239" end="00:03:27.500" style="s2">back in time I think we had a much</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.730" end="00:03:30.250" style="s2">greater knowledge and I propose the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.500" end="00:03:32.450" style="s2">hypothesis that the the greatest</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.250" end="00:03:34.580" style="s2">mycologists the greatest medicinal</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.450" end="00:03:37.130" style="s2">mushroom practitioners were probably</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.580" end="00:03:38.900" style="s2">guilds of women and and then they would</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.130" end="00:03:40.610" style="s2">give the men what they needed but they</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.900" end="00:03:42.680" style="s2">were the collector of knowledge it seems</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.610" end="00:03:43.940" style="s2">natural to me they would be because we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.680" end="00:03:46.520" style="s2">were foraging and bringing things back</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.940" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">to the camp but the men men would go out</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.520" end="00:03:50.420" style="s2">get harmed the women would be protecting</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.070" style="s2">the family so seems to me they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.420" end="00:03:56.900" style="s2">protecting the medicinal mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.070" end="00:03:58.340" style="s2">knowledge is fun turkey tail mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.900" end="00:04:00.130" style="s2">which I&#39;ve mentioned already turkey tail</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.340" end="00:04:02.600" style="s2">mushrooms hyperacute accumulate selenium</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.130" end="00:04:04.520" style="s2">selenium will bind with mercury ions</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.600" end="00:04:05.720" style="s2">mercury and selenium come together as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.520" end="00:04:08.810" style="s2">biomolecular unit that&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.720" end="00:04:11.780" style="s2">non-toxic so this was discovered by dr.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.810" end="00:04:13.640" style="s2">arica in Japan and he found something</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.780" end="00:04:14.780" style="s2">even very surprising you can take turkey</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.640" end="00:04:17.820" style="s2">tail mycelium</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.780" end="00:04:20.640" style="s2">kiloton autoclave is dead my psyllium</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.820" end="00:04:23.520" style="s2">powder up the mycelium throw it into</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.640" end="00:04:26.790" style="s2">mercuric ions and water and it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.520" end="00:04:28.020" style="s2">precipitate and bind with the mercury</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.790" end="00:04:29.100" style="s2">this lien will bind together so they</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.020" end="00:04:31.890" style="s2">needn&#39;t come from the mycelium the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.100" end="00:04:34.530" style="s2">mercury you know from a mine or from</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.890" end="00:04:37.020" style="s2">pollution and then we&#39;ll make it into a</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.530" end="00:04:39.150" style="s2">totally non-toxic form so there is no</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.020" end="00:04:41.970" style="s2">one example of the binding of heavy</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.150" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">metals using these different mushroom</p>

<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:49.290" style="s2">there was a mushroom but which we call</p>

<p begin="00:05:03.390" end="00:05:06.510" style="s2">a long history of collecting wild</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.650" end="00:05:08.570" style="s2">mushrooms wild foods and they found this</p>

<p begin="00:05:25.440" end="00:05:30.090" style="s2">channel it and focus it into a mushroom</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.540" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">now the mushroom is radioactive highly</p>
