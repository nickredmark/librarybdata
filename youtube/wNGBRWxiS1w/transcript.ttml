<p begin="00:00:52.260" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">guys kind of geeked out on the tech for</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.030" end="00:00:58.410" style="s2">a period of time and there was something</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:00.780" style="s2">a troll said of wanting to get</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.410" end="00:01:02.940" style="s2">information on I think which platform to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.780" end="00:01:04.500" style="s2">use or which I don&#39;t even know I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.940" end="00:01:06.960" style="s2">under techy that it didn&#39;t stick in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.500" end="00:01:08.430" style="s2">brain but having so I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.960" end="00:01:12.740" style="s2">talk about what is what would it look</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.430" end="00:01:14.909" style="s2">like to have maybe a few topics that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.740" end="00:01:17.070" style="s2">theoretically ones we kind of cover ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.909" end="00:01:19.140" style="s2">have people on board to talk about so</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.070" end="00:01:20.250" style="s2">that we could get more of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.140" end="00:01:21.450" style="s2">understanding of like all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.250" end="00:01:23.610" style="s2">platforms are out there and what&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.450" end="00:01:25.799" style="s2">and what&#39;s bad about them you know just</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.610" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">basically a video series that&#39;s designed</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.799" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">for that information via semin ated I</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s really a use</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:32.490" style="s2">for it though because of course all</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.170" end="00:01:34.590" style="s2">those videos already exist on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.490" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">but they&#39;re not done in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.590" end="00:01:38.070" style="s2">like what is out there what&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:39.659" style="s2">one and even just having that open</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.070" end="00:01:45.149" style="s2">conversation about those different</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.659" end="00:01:48.680" style="s2">things yeah yeah although that will also</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.149" end="00:01:53.610" style="s2">change pretty quick for the tech one</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.680" end="00:01:55.939" style="s2">because the one Adriel was suggesting i</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.610" end="00:02:01.829" style="s2">would have recommended four years ago</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.939" end="00:02:04.799" style="s2">but I no longer recommend so that may be</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.829" end="00:02:05.280" style="s2">a periodic one and also like the post I</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.799" end="00:02:10.410" style="s2">did today</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.280" end="00:02:13.110" style="s2">about a new no code solution you know it</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.410" end="00:02:16.330" style="s2">is one of those things that I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.110" end="00:02:17.350" style="s2">this kind of together tack and project</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.330" end="00:02:19.150" style="s2">space will be something more</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.350" end="00:02:25.090" style="s2">continuously exploring but yeah I do</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.150" end="00:02:27.130" style="s2">like the idea so does that is that still</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.090" end="00:02:28.690" style="s2">seems to me to kind of fall under the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.130" end="00:02:32.170" style="s2">thing like oh we need to have an episode</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.690" end="00:02:34.300" style="s2">about marketing for projects and then</p>

<p begin="00:02:36.520" end="00:02:44.709" style="s2">your other what about marketing was</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.630" end="00:02:47.440" style="s2">solving that wasn&#39;t about marketing for</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.709" end="00:02:49.660" style="s2">projects that was about the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.440" end="00:02:53.200" style="s2">marketing and how can we make marketing</p>

<p begin="00:03:00.340" end="00:03:04.900" style="s2">roundtables and people just come to them</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.010" end="00:03:07.060" style="s2">and then bring whatever is going on at</p>

<p begin="00:03:32.019" end="00:03:35.170" style="s2">best not the newest whatever one&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.110" end="00:03:50.049" style="s2">those one whenever you and Adriel and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.070" end="00:03:52.090" style="s2">and we&#39;re talking about last week was</p>

<p begin="00:03:52.090" end="00:03:56.170" style="s2">four or five six of them and saying what</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.900" end="00:03:58.209" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.170" end="00:04:00.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s interesting because it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.209" end="00:04:01.930" style="s2">interesting to focus both on and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.220" end="00:04:05.140" style="s2">even haven&#39;t be separate episodes or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.930" end="00:04:08.340" style="s2">first half be kind of an evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.140" end="00:04:11.019" style="s2">discussion what do we look for in tech</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.780" end="00:04:26.720" style="s2">discussion and then then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.490" end="00:04:28.550" style="s2">just thinking it might be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.720" end="00:04:30.949" style="s2">then kind of have okay then what&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:05:39.830" end="00:05:43.849" style="s2">not they&#39;re gonna tackle it as a more</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.810" end="00:05:46.099" style="s2">meta problem than like plumbing for this</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.849" end="00:05:48.770" style="s2">community and doing something somewhat</p>

<p begin="00:06:08.840" end="00:06:11.539" style="s2">three of us and for other but like how</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.219" end="00:06:15.710" style="s2">do we make it even more powerful right</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.539" end="00:06:18.169" style="s2">and more that the stuff we&#39;re doing in</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:20.419" style="s2">and of itself is valuable yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.169" end="00:06:23.090" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting also so much of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.419" end="00:06:30.039" style="s2">advice out there is focused on profit</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.090" end="00:06:32.780" style="s2">and I mean a lot of it&#39;s you know I</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.039" end="00:06:34.310" style="s2">guess it&#39;s good that today even a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.780" end="00:06:37.029" style="s2">you know Silicon Valley and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.310" end="00:06:39.500" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to do stuff that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.029" end="00:06:41.000" style="s2">beneficial they&#39;re not quite as profit</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.500" end="00:06:45.530" style="s2">they used to be in the past but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.000" end="00:06:46.970" style="s2">it is focused on find the the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.530" end="00:06:49.550" style="s2">problem you&#39;re gonna solve needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.970" end="00:06:52.100" style="s2">something that people will pay for as</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.550" end="00:06:55.760" style="s2">opposed to be based on the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.100" end="00:06:58.670" style="s2">value emojis as opposed to the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.760" end="00:07:00.920" style="s2">value that introduces right which there</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.670" end="00:07:03.530" style="s2">is some correlation between profit and</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.920" end="00:07:08.150" style="s2">value but it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not an exact</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.530" end="00:07:10.660" style="s2">match we&#39;re we&#39;re almost focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.150" end="00:07:13.610" style="s2">those things that are not profitable</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.660" end="00:07:19.400" style="s2">because of the profitable stuff is being</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.610" end="00:07:25.780" style="s2">handled right yeah so how does it go on</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.400" end="00:07:30.830" style="s2">Marty&#39;s what was a very productive week</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.780" end="00:07:34.100" style="s2">on one hand so yeah it&#39;s going well my</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.830" end="00:07:38.720" style="s2">project is moving along this goes to</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.100" end="00:07:40.100" style="s2">really teen and MVP which will be like a</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.720" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">that would be something</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.100" end="00:07:49.790" style="s2">finally I did read the specs for the</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:54.290" style="s2">week elections I think that&#39;s bubble</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.790" end="00:08:00.830" style="s2">like any before that is one weeks for</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.290" end="00:08:04.820" style="s2">initial setup and the first version like</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.830" end="00:08:09.680" style="s2">alpha alpha and another week for making</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.820" end="00:08:11.840" style="s2">it like more better I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.680" end="00:08:14.960" style="s2">should be enough for like initial for</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.840" end="00:08:17.690" style="s2">what&#39;s in the stack at least I actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.960" end="00:08:19.880" style="s2">what you not seen the spec so I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.690" end="00:08:25.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I miss that or if Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.880" end="00:08:28.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t send it my way shared with me the</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.610" end="00:08:32.630" style="s2">Google Doc and this is what he showed us</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.610" end="00:08:34.550" style="s2">on the reduce meeting so that&#39;s it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.630" end="00:08:36.890" style="s2">it&#39;s quite like the first version is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.550" end="00:08:40.849" style="s2">quite simple so I think it&#39;s doable</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.890" end="00:08:44.810" style="s2">within two weeks unless unexpected about</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.849" end="00:08:46.370" style="s2">it is should be double no it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.810" end="00:08:53.870" style="s2">person for two weeks you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.370" end="00:08:57.680" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m really curious what you thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.870" end="00:08:59.600" style="s2">is the correct time I yeah for some</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.680" end="00:09:01.280" style="s2">reason I didn&#39;t end up seeing the specs</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.600" end="00:09:03.230" style="s2">so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s on my side or</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.280" end="00:09:07.820" style="s2">fade you I just didn&#39;t send it to me yet</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.230" end="00:09:10.070" style="s2">but I have to look back and connect with</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.820" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">him and see but from what from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.070" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">discussion which I think he gave us a</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:16.210" style="s2">pretty good outline on the meeting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:20.020" style="s2">two weeks sounds about right</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.210" end="00:09:24.340" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t disagree with that estimate</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.020" end="00:09:29.090" style="s2">Jubilee and I were just discussing I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.340" end="00:09:30.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know outline it knows how well</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.090" end="00:09:32.330" style="s2">just we&#39;re just working through some</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.710" end="00:09:33.530" style="s2">stuff figure you know what how to make</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.330" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">this face rifle well it&#39;s kind of when</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.530" end="00:09:37.010" style="s2">you guys were talking in like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:39.200" style="s2">all these different projects right now</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.010" end="00:09:40.790" style="s2">staff although chained us I just had a</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.200" end="00:09:42.800" style="s2">conversation with a different technology</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.790" end="00:09:44.450" style="s2">cooperative our chain this morning I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.800" end="00:09:49.940" style="s2">just lecture Jordan hall video where</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.450" end="00:09:51.770" style="s2">he&#39;s starting the momento it&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.940" end="00:09:56.690" style="s2">what&#39;s called momento something on it oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.770" end="00:10:01.670" style="s2">and I get what I want to do is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.690" end="00:10:04.370" style="s2">bring it back to basics and map it not</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.670" end="00:10:06.260" style="s2">with without needing to do the work so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.370" end="00:10:07.610" style="s2">what I mean is and all of those people</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.260" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">have the conversation of how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.610" end="00:10:10.490" style="s2">governance how do you you know how do we</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:12.830" style="s2">trust each other how do we do those</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.490" end="00:10:14.480" style="s2">things and looking at okay if we were</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.830" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2">gonna start from scratch that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.480" end="00:10:17.510" style="s2">would need who out there is already</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.250" end="00:10:18.860" style="s2">doing these things right we want a team</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.510" end="00:10:19.970" style="s2">building up I know we&#39;ve looked at team</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.860" end="00:10:21.800" style="s2">building ones and none of them are</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.970" end="00:10:23.810" style="s2">really but like to be able to say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.800" end="00:10:27.550" style="s2">what he&#39;s just even just a list of what</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.810" end="00:10:31.430" style="s2">exists and then start working through</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.550" end="00:10:32.720" style="s2">having people maybe that one that like</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.430" end="00:10:34.340" style="s2">one of the team building ones coming</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.720" end="00:10:38.840" style="s2">together and saying why they like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.340" end="00:10:40.040" style="s2">one right and having it be I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.840" end="00:10:41.830" style="s2">I&#39;m working through things in my head</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.040" end="00:10:44.030" style="s2">right now this is also like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.830" end="00:10:45.980" style="s2">frustration with all of the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.030" end="00:10:47.270" style="s2">frustration and beauty that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.980" end="00:10:49.100" style="s2">tech is happening right now and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.270" end="00:10:52.160" style="s2">only happening more and more rapidly and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.100" end="00:10:54.920" style="s2">there is this division between like</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.160" end="00:10:56.570" style="s2">watching Jordan Hall talk I love Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.920" end="00:10:59.810" style="s2">Hall and I also think all of us people</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.570" end="00:11:01.310" style="s2">are very elitist they you know like</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.810" end="00:11:02.810" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for the top of the top</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.310" end="00:11:04.130" style="s2">to work with and although I get why</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.810" end="00:11:06.890" style="s2">they&#39;re doing that and I&#39;m glad they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.130" end="00:11:09.440" style="s2">doing that I think there</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.890" end="00:11:11.420" style="s2">a big piece of what&#39;s out there which is</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.440" end="00:11:15.220" style="s2">that we need something that like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.420" end="00:11:15.220" style="s2">everyone can see and everyone can trust</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.460" end="00:11:20.420" style="s2">then everything&#39;s so complex it up there</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.200" end="00:11:21.890" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to know like well while</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.420" end="00:11:23.840" style="s2">there&#39;s still many of these things and</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.890" end="00:11:26.060" style="s2">how does down that compare to polo chain</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.840" end="00:11:27.890" style="s2">and how does they like to truly</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.060" end="00:11:29.600" style="s2">understand when a tech project comes on</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:31.430" style="s2">board what is it all the sense making</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.600" end="00:11:33.730" style="s2">ones haven&#39;t we collection differ from</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.430" end="00:11:37.340" style="s2">for reasons for like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.730" end="00:11:38.960" style="s2">that happens behind closed doors it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.340" end="00:11:40.970" style="s2">the beginning of all of these projects</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.960" end="00:11:42.500" style="s2">that is like right why why are they all</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.970" end="00:11:44.870" style="s2">working on the same thing over and over</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.500" end="00:11:47.330" style="s2">again and us to like what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.870" end="00:11:49.400" style="s2">like right like what is the thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.330" end="00:11:50.570" style="s2">all creating and like what is that since</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.400" end="00:11:52.490" style="s2">we&#39;re working on our projects</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.570" end="00:11:54.050" style="s2">individually and we&#39;re bringing them</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.490" end="00:11:55.190" style="s2">together to this space to say what are</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.050" end="00:11:59.060" style="s2">the common pain points and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.190" end="00:12:00.380" style="s2">solve them somewhat the more met of</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.060" end="00:12:01.970" style="s2">conversation of that but maybe this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.380" end="00:12:03.500" style="s2">isn&#39;t the place for that like where we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.970" end="00:12:05.030" style="s2">have a very specific you about but</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.500" end="00:12:06.500" style="s2">there&#39;s something there where the two</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.030" end="00:12:11.080" style="s2">can kind of come together and we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.500" end="00:12:15.560" style="s2">serve our projects while also serving</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.080" end="00:12:17.330" style="s2">our bigger mission of creative like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.560" end="00:12:22.420" style="s2">don&#39;t know there&#39;s something here I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.330" end="00:12:31.220" style="s2">still working yes although that and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.420" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">agree I kind of I&#39;m just like I imagined</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.220" end="00:12:35.360" style="s2">something like apart from having at</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:37.250" style="s2">least of everything that&#39;s going on out</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.360" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">there and all the projects we just</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.250" end="00:12:44.600" style="s2">obvious starting point but immediately</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:48.470" style="s2">also missing in the talking part like</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.600" end="00:12:49.450" style="s2">each and every entry on the list this</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.470" end="00:12:53.360" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.450" end="00:12:55.520" style="s2">ABCD and whoever that should immediately</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.360" end="00:12:58.030" style="s2">follow with some kind of an interview</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.520" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">like actually talking to the people and</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.030" end="00:13:05.030" style="s2">trying to find out some common ground or</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:07.190" style="s2">possibility of cooperation and just</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.030" end="00:13:09.920" style="s2">letting them know that other stuff</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.190" end="00:13:13.880" style="s2">exists that was what me what&#39;s missing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.920" end="00:13:16.460" style="s2">think yeah and it makes me wonder</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.880" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">whether it be good or but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.460" end="00:13:23.440" style="s2">if it&#39;s possible with the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:26.620" style="s2">to have a comparison and contrasting</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.440" end="00:13:28.389" style="s2">each of these things now of course not</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.620" end="00:13:29.980" style="s2">everything I mean you can you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.389" end="00:13:32.889" style="s2">to compare and contrast every single one</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.980" end="00:13:36.639" style="s2">but if you put them in buckets and if</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.889" end="00:13:38.350" style="s2">they&#39;re in the same bucket or I guess an</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.639" end="00:13:41.290" style="s2">item could exist in multiple buckets</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.350" end="00:13:42.699" style="s2">right then then kind of a compare and</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.290" end="00:13:45.490" style="s2">contrast of the other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.699" end="00:13:47.880" style="s2">that are close enough that they seem to</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.490" end="00:13:52.260" style="s2">be attacking kind of the same problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.880" end="00:13:56.199" style="s2">but that also sounds like a lot of work</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:14:01.570" style="s2">actually I have an idea for this my my</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.199" end="00:14:04.660" style="s2">idea was when while creating a list of</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.570" end="00:14:07.420" style="s2">projects and contacting people</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.660" end="00:14:08.949" style="s2">responsible for those projects I would</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.420" end="00:14:11.320" style="s2">say something hello</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.949" end="00:14:14.139" style="s2">I&#39;m creating a list and I described you</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.320" end="00:14:15.010" style="s2">on the list such-and-such and if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.139" end="00:14:18.550" style="s2">want to change something</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.010" end="00:14:21.130" style="s2">please come log in and update your</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.550" end="00:14:26.380" style="s2">information because I might be wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.130" end="00:14:28.209" style="s2">that would if then some incentives to at</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.380" end="00:14:32.110" style="s2">least take a look what was written about</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.209" end="00:14:36.220" style="s2">them and hopefully they would feel</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.110" end="00:14:39.670" style="s2">compelled to update information about</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.220" end="00:14:42.310" style="s2">themselves and by doing that just put</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.670" end="00:14:46.570" style="s2">some effort some energy into this this</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.310" end="00:14:49.510" style="s2">list to make them maybe read to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.570" end="00:14:52.180" style="s2">least and get familiar with other</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.510" end="00:14:55.300" style="s2">projects on at least something so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.180" end="00:14:58.870" style="s2">don&#39;t have to do it ourselves because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.300" end="00:15:02.620" style="s2">think owners of projects should be</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.870" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">interested in updating and spreading</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.620" end="00:15:09.540" style="s2">information about their project using</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:11.740" style="s2">our system yeah I think though even if</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.540" end="00:15:16.990" style="s2">there doesn&#39;t quite get us to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.740" end="00:15:18.370" style="s2">comparison between the two projects you</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.990" end="00:15:20.620" style="s2">know because just too few written</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.370" end="00:15:23.769" style="s2">descriptions doesn&#39;t actually explain</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.620" end="00:15:25.660" style="s2">why these two things are different then</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.769" end="00:15:28.029" style="s2">I would out in the description staffing</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.660" end="00:15:29.870" style="s2">like this compares two projects project</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.029" end="00:15:34.790" style="s2">C which is the sender&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.870" end="00:15:37.130" style="s2">and I wouldn&#39;t go as far as saying the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.790" end="00:15:42.860" style="s2">project&#39;s is slightly better because and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.130" end="00:15:45.470" style="s2">then project a so you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.860" end="00:15:47.270" style="s2">oh yeah and often behind not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.470" end="00:15:48.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not a better thing but it is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.270" end="00:15:50.240" style="s2">they&#39;re coming at it from different</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.260" end="00:15:54.230" style="s2">angles because hollow chain is not is</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.240" end="00:15:58.220" style="s2">like not a blockchain but our chain it</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.230" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">does list themselves as a blockchain but</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.220" end="00:16:02.960" style="s2">I bet they are trying to solve the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:04.220" style="s2">issues so that&#39;d be something</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.960" end="00:16:07.520" style="s2">interesting to say is that all chains</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.220" end="00:16:09.589" style="s2">not blockchain right because that would</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.520" end="00:16:14.450" style="s2">differentiate it from all the other kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.589" end="00:16:17.690" style="s2">of ones in that similar space yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.450" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">guess so there&#39;s all the social media</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.690" end="00:16:21.740" style="s2">platforms and we don&#39;t own any of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:24.410" style="s2">we don&#39;t any of the data on any of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.740" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">if we all know that and part of what</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.410" end="00:16:28.730" style="s2">some of the block chains have tried to</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:30.230" style="s2">do is say okay well you own your data it</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.730" end="00:16:31.610" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter where it&#39;s presented you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.230" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">have the background and you can post it</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.610" end="00:16:35.660" style="s2">on Twitter and post on there but you</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:38.450" style="s2">have you have this and there&#39;s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.660" end="00:16:40.580" style="s2">of an irony that then Dao stack holo</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.450" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">chain I don&#39;t know what our chain but</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.580" end="00:16:49.790" style="s2">all like probably memento are all sound</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:52.010" style="s2">like are they creating the backends that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.790" end="00:16:54.440" style="s2">okay even if holo chain disappears all</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.010" end="00:16:55.880" style="s2">of the stuff is still there and you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.440" end="00:16:58.520" style="s2">move it to the DAO stack you can move it</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.880" end="00:17:00.350" style="s2">to memento and vice versa or no they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.520" end="00:17:01.760" style="s2">creating a new thing that&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.350" end="00:17:03.290" style="s2">gonna solve all the world&#39;s problems but</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.760" end="00:17:05.240" style="s2">only if it&#39;s under this umbrella and if</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.290" end="00:17:07.459" style="s2">the umbrella fails everything fails and</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.240" end="00:17:08.990" style="s2">yes I know we&#39;re also kind of doing that</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.459" end="00:17:12.530" style="s2">but we&#39;re also trying to do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.990" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">that it&#39;s like and we&#39;re transparent so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.530" end="00:17:16.730" style="s2">even if we fail everyone can see and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:18.980" style="s2">it benefits the next one and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.730" end="00:17:20.150" style="s2">something about it&#39;s beautifully</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.980" end="00:17:22.370" style="s2">happening because all these people are</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.150" end="00:17:24.709" style="s2">doing it and hopefully somebody succeeds</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.370" end="00:17:27.250" style="s2">and somebody creates it and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.709" end="00:17:31.460" style="s2">time it&#39;s dissipating that energy and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.250" end="00:17:34.670" style="s2">why this has come up is a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.460" end="00:17:36.559" style="s2">which is this one big conflict that kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.670" end="00:17:38.390" style="s2">of happened behind around adjacent to</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.559" end="00:17:40.370" style="s2">game B between someone who is like Ivan</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.390" end="00:17:42.260" style="s2">I have a tech project that I love and</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.370" end="00:17:43.410" style="s2">it&#39;s my baby and talk to someone who</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.260" end="00:17:44.850" style="s2">they thought should be a profession</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.410" end="00:17:45.870" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t think they&#39;d show up as</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.850" end="00:17:49.050" style="s2">a professional man we need to go to</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.870" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">conduct in in and they were really upset</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.050" end="00:17:52.800" style="s2">that this person had called their idea</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">of Aprilaire and I&#39;m like really cuz</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.800" end="00:17:56.070" style="s2">don&#39;t isn&#39;t it like that&#39;s what we all</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:17:58.800" style="s2">have right is until it&#39;s real and they</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.070" end="00:18:02.660" style="s2">even when it can be vaporware and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.800" end="00:18:07.620" style="s2">it&#39;s vaporware I&#39;m trying to solve not</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.660" end="00:18:12.270" style="s2">like there&#39;s something when you have in</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.620" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">science you do a study and then you</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.270" end="00:18:18.360" style="s2">publish it there&#39;s a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:21.150" style="s2">that&#39;s missing because we don&#39;t register</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.360" end="00:18:24.060" style="s2">null studies if your study didn&#39;t come</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.150" end="00:18:25.350" style="s2">up come to a neutral or the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.060" end="00:18:27.720" style="s2">conclusion just doesn&#39;t get published</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.350" end="00:18:29.370" style="s2">right so it&#39;s not in there and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.720" end="00:18:31.800" style="s2">very important information that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.370" end="00:18:33.720" style="s2">missing and I love that usually with</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.800" end="00:18:34.890" style="s2">vaporware cuz the idea paper where is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.720" end="00:18:37.200" style="s2">like oh I&#39;m gonna create this and it</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.890" end="00:18:38.670" style="s2">never gets created there be a dishonest</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.200" end="00:18:39.810" style="s2">component to that right give me your</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.670" end="00:18:41.460" style="s2">money and then I have the money never</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.810" end="00:18:42.900" style="s2">meant to make it which is I think what</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.460" end="00:18:44.520" style="s2">they mean when they say vaporware but</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.900" end="00:18:46.470" style="s2">there&#39;s also like I have an ID and I</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.520" end="00:18:47.940" style="s2">want it to exist and then how much time</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.470" end="00:18:50.190" style="s2">and energy I put into it it still goes</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.940" end="00:18:52.170" style="s2">into the paper right it still doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.190" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">exist anymore and the longer and a</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.170" end="00:18:56.460" style="s2">longer sphere and so how can we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:58.560" style="s2">people and then there&#39;s also this new</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.460" end="00:19:01.470" style="s2">person in in game B would stumbled upon</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.560" end="00:19:02.910" style="s2">it in a weird way and it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.470" end="00:19:04.410" style="s2">doesn&#39;t understand what the NB a--&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.910" end="00:19:06.120" style="s2">is trying to make it be game it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.410" end="00:19:08.340" style="s2">well where&#39;s the leadership I need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.120" end="00:19:09.600" style="s2">talk to people in charge and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.340" end="00:19:11.250" style="s2">figure out how to get this going and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.600" end="00:19:13.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like who are you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.250" end="00:19:15.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s something about like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.710" end="00:19:17.250" style="s2">like you realize everyone here has a</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.870" end="00:19:18.750" style="s2">social media platform because you found</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.250" end="00:19:20.970" style="s2">it through the social media he&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.750" end="00:19:22.650" style="s2">well I can be social media like if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.970" end="00:19:25.260" style="s2">don&#39;t know what game B is you might be</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.650" end="00:19:26.910" style="s2">in the wrong crew and he&#39;s like trying</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.260" end="00:19:30.570" style="s2">to create a social media platform like</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.910" end="00:19:34.530" style="s2">so is everybody else and it&#39;s like okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.570" end="00:19:36.000" style="s2">so how can we honor all of that right</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.530" end="00:19:37.350" style="s2">that people have ideas that aren&#39;t being</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.000" end="00:19:39.390" style="s2">done and they can feel really upset that</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.350" end="00:19:41.280" style="s2">other people that are these leaders</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.390" end="00:19:43.110" style="s2">aren&#39;t listening to them why would they</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.280" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">right they&#39;re not gonna say like why are</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.110" end="00:19:45.630" style="s2">they sitting down with you and not the</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:48.840" style="s2">like this doesn&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.630" end="00:19:52.560" style="s2">um but the Vapor like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.840" end="00:19:54.870" style="s2">about when if someone comes up with an</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.560" end="00:19:56.130" style="s2">idea it could be registered just to say</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.870" end="00:19:56.910" style="s2">hey this is something I&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.130" end="00:19:58.740" style="s2">then everyone</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.910" end="00:20:00.240" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s also my denominator my</p>

<p begin="00:20:03.870" end="00:20:08.850" style="s2">vaporware anyway it exists right to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.380" end="00:20:10.350" style="s2">somewhat of like a register of like work</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.850" end="00:20:12.090" style="s2">and I know it exists it&#39;s github it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.350" end="00:20:13.680" style="s2">all these other things like something</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.090" end="00:20:15.090" style="s2">about it doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.680" end="00:20:17.160" style="s2">open source whether it&#39;s for proper</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.090" end="00:20:18.870" style="s2">whether it&#39;s gaming your baby that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.160" end="00:20:21.720" style="s2">trying to create it what is our purpose</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.870" end="00:20:23.310" style="s2">for creating it how do we trust it how</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.720" end="00:20:24.690" style="s2">do we know it&#39;s gonna be long-term like</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.310" end="00:20:25.830" style="s2">some I don&#39;t know there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.690" end="00:20:28.470" style="s2">there and again it&#39;s just working</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.830" end="00:20:32.370" style="s2">through it because it&#39;s like tension</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.470" end="00:20:34.860" style="s2">inside with all this stuff there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.370" end="00:20:41.610" style="s2">nothing funny about saying my vapor very</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.860" end="00:20:45.540" style="s2">vapor where is the best like no - so</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.610" end="00:20:49.230" style="s2">just ideas and blueprints maybe and some</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.540" end="00:20:51.870" style="s2">I know how to fix it just oh I just need</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.230" end="00:20:57.060" style="s2">to work on the documentation and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.870" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">the cold end yeah and sorry recording</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.060" end="00:21:02.160" style="s2">everything is important not only the</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:04.530" style="s2">good projects that are going somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.160" end="00:21:06.810" style="s2">but good projects that are not going</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.530" end="00:21:10.290" style="s2">anywhere and not very good projects</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.810" end="00:21:14.340" style="s2">because then the knowledge domain as is</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.290" end="00:21:17.670" style="s2">complete and only then we know what has</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.340" end="00:21:23.640" style="s2">a chance of working and what was proven</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.670" end="00:21:25.140" style="s2">to not work so no one else needs to work</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.640" end="00:21:29.460" style="s2">on something that is not going to fly</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.140" end="00:21:32.930" style="s2">anyway unless they have a way of making</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.460" end="00:21:43.140" style="s2">it right in which cases they&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.930" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">yeah yeah I I&#39;ve been in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.140" end="00:21:47.430" style="s2">space of a lot of people who are trying</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:50.130" style="s2">to build things that they think will</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.430" end="00:21:52.470" style="s2">have a great impact on the world and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.130" end="00:21:54.180" style="s2">that my assessment of most of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.470" end="00:21:57.360" style="s2">projects is that they were doomed to</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.180" end="00:22:02.970" style="s2">fail from the beginning now part of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:04.410" style="s2">is my ego and I do know that a majority</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.970" end="00:22:08.060" style="s2">of the people I share my project with</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.410" end="00:22:08.060" style="s2">have that opinion of my project</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">and they still may be right I have not</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:18.720" style="s2">proven that wrong so yeah I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:20.480" style="s2">was just gonna say I&#39;ve had a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.720" end="00:22:23.250" style="s2">experience with that in those solutions</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.480" end="00:22:25.410" style="s2">ya know and my also like I came in</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.250" end="00:22:27.090" style="s2">September in kPa like I gotta solve game</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.410" end="00:22:28.410" style="s2">B who do I talk to around here I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.090" end="00:22:33.020" style="s2">quite like that and people were like</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.410" end="00:22:33.020" style="s2">there is none I didn&#39;t you felt that I</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.679" end="00:22:39.270" style="s2">know how to do this like it&#39;s it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.720" end="00:22:41.100" style="s2">and now it&#39;s like honoring that right</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.270" end="00:22:42.659" style="s2">we&#39;re all there that&#39;s all of us and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.100" end="00:22:44.010" style="s2">great that this is here that all these</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.659" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">people are here but there&#39;s a tension</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.010" end="00:22:48.330" style="s2">that happens there right there is no</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:50.039" style="s2">leader we&#39;re all leading and we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.330" end="00:22:53.070" style="s2">blind and we&#39;re all not like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.039" end="00:22:55.010" style="s2">chaotic beautiful mess and just try to</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.070" end="00:22:58.289" style="s2">make some sense of it like watching it</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.010" end="00:23:00.179" style="s2">so then watching Jordan halls video and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.289" end="00:23:02.059" style="s2">he&#39;s starting this this tech thing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.179" end="00:23:05.490" style="s2">there was part of it when I was like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.059" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">parts of it I can see interwoven in it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.490" end="00:23:08.909" style="s2">what we talked about in September where</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:11.429" style="s2">he didn&#39;t have these ideas necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.909" end="00:23:13.110" style="s2">and and then there&#39;s what happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.429" end="00:23:15.179" style="s2">game be space between this professional</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.110" end="00:23:18.960" style="s2">and this person who had the vaporware</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.179" end="00:23:22.380" style="s2">and that he was like well other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.960" end="00:23:23.940" style="s2">have stolen my ideas and I know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.380" end="00:23:25.860" style="s2">get any credit for them and I don&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.940" end="00:23:28.200" style="s2">so watching this video with your Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.860" end="00:23:29.700" style="s2">Hall I was like oh how beautiful if a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.200" end="00:23:32.250" style="s2">piece of what I said went into this</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.700" end="00:23:33.780" style="s2">right but then if I was also like and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.250" end="00:23:36.270" style="s2">better get a piece of it too right</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.780" end="00:23:37.559" style="s2">because one it&#39;s short-haul right like</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.270" end="00:23:40.169" style="s2">it&#39;s not like he didn&#39;t know any of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.559" end="00:23:42.120" style="s2">stuff but it&#39;s like and that&#39;s it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.169" end="00:23:43.799" style="s2">all interval been together so my issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.120" end="00:23:44.970" style="s2">and this is my is like he&#39;s looking for</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.799" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">more of an elitist how do we get people</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.970" end="00:23:48.570" style="s2">together the top top top at this realm</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:49.650" style="s2">in this room in this room so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.570" end="00:23:51.630" style="s2">create this and then open it up to other</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.650" end="00:23:53.220" style="s2">people and I don&#39;t think you can create</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.630" end="00:23:54.360" style="s2">it without opening up to other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.220" end="00:23:55.740" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re creating it for</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.360" end="00:23:57.990" style="s2">the Jordan halls and not the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.740" end="00:23:59.370" style="s2">neurotypical and disabled people and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.990" end="00:24:06.179" style="s2">people who maybe gave me a doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.370" end="00:24:08.280" style="s2">for and but there&#39;s something about that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.179" end="00:24:09.900" style="s2">like he what he was saying I was like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.280" end="00:24:12.059" style="s2">can see part of me will in interwoven</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.900" end="00:24:13.980" style="s2">here and that is beautiful and I like</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.059" end="00:24:15.780" style="s2">that and at the same time I can see how</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.980" end="00:24:18.450" style="s2">from this other person standpoint and</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.780" end="00:24:20.000" style="s2">had nothing to join Hall that if that</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.450" end="00:24:21.560" style="s2">had happened it&#39;d be like and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.000" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">I&#39;d better get a piece of this right</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.560" end="00:24:25.250" style="s2">like like what percentage of this is my</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:26.270" style="s2">responsibility of the truth is you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.250" end="00:24:28.190" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you could ever measure</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.270" end="00:24:29.690" style="s2">that I don&#39;t know I&#39;m Jordan himself is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.190" end="00:24:31.880" style="s2">good would whenever say that he got any</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.690" end="00:24:33.620" style="s2">of the ideas for me right um</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.880" end="00:24:35.510" style="s2">but it&#39;s not about that it&#39;s about like</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.620" end="00:24:36.920" style="s2">the inter openness of hey I had this</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.510" end="00:24:39.740" style="s2">conversation I know it sparked this I</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.920" end="00:24:41.140" style="s2">mean it&#39;s got in me and I don&#39;t know why</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.740" end="00:24:46.010" style="s2">that has anything to do in favor where</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.140" end="00:24:47.300" style="s2">except that there&#39;s like someone has an</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.010" end="00:24:49.130" style="s2">idea and they want to hold on to it it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.300" end="00:24:50.930" style="s2">the best idea and then also if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.130" end="00:24:52.370" style="s2">else it&#39;s like I told you about my</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.930" end="00:24:54.050" style="s2">social media platform then you made a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.370" end="00:24:57.860" style="s2">social media platform like that&#39;s mine</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.050" end="00:24:59.060" style="s2">it&#39;s like no it&#39;s not it&#39;s an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.860" end="00:25:01.040" style="s2">so part of what I&#39;m talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.060" end="00:25:02.960" style="s2">paper where I guess like registry is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.040" end="00:25:04.730" style="s2">that you can say it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.960" end="00:25:06.860" style="s2">proprietary us because it is about right</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.730" end="00:25:09.590" style="s2">I have an idea for food out cool awesome</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.860" end="00:25:11.630" style="s2">that&#39;s great did it get made I made a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.590" end="00:25:13.610" style="s2">food app okay why did it succeed or not</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.630" end="00:25:15.350" style="s2">succeed right and actually looking at</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.610" end="00:25:17.090" style="s2">the ones that exist in are currently in</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.350" end="00:25:18.620" style="s2">the field market how do they compare to</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.090" end="00:25:20.630" style="s2">each other and then the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.620" end="00:25:21.980" style="s2">they&#39;re like I have an idea of great</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.630" end="00:25:25.130" style="s2">then we&#39;re following it through so we</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.980" end="00:25:26.330" style="s2">know if we haven&#39;t heard from it in 10</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.130" end="00:25:28.280" style="s2">years it&#39;s not getting made right like</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.330" end="00:25:30.410" style="s2">more just that null like the null</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.280" end="00:25:31.970" style="s2">scientists registry which is would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.410" end="00:25:35.800" style="s2">really useful and I think actually has</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.970" end="00:25:37.610" style="s2">started having somewhat of like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.800" end="00:25:39.500" style="s2">register of we&#39;re working on this</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.610" end="00:25:41.390" style="s2">project not so other people can&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.500" end="00:25:43.100" style="s2">on it which is also what I feel happens</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.390" end="00:25:45.620" style="s2">under holo chains out stuff it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.100" end="00:25:46.820" style="s2">yeah someone&#39;s on contracts so you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.620" end="00:25:48.920" style="s2">need to it&#39;s like we don&#39;t they the best</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.490" end="00:27:01.070" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:27:06.380" style="s2">how just imagine game be one the world</p>

<p begin="00:27:15.530" end="00:27:26.480" style="s2">sexuality talking about this because I</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.270" end="00:27:27.410" style="s2">feel like it means something I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.480" end="00:27:30.860" style="s2">one I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.410" end="00:27:31.570" style="s2">yes I don&#39;t um so somebody sent me it in</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.610" end="00:27:47.000" style="s2">and not is where I got it from and so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.890" end="00:27:49.640" style="s2">think it might be an unlisted video</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.000" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not because because the URL for</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.640" end="00:27:53.900" style="s2">memento will be out and in like a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:55.910" style="s2">instead a week or two and he doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:28:03.680" end="00:28:11.510" style="s2">I can I can post it in our projects page</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.410" end="00:28:13.640" style="s2">available you&#39;ll be a little disjointed</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.510" end="00:28:15.700" style="s2">but I&#39;ll post under this post under this</p>

<p begin="00:28:39.980" end="00:28:44.450" style="s2">vaporware right bit like I don&#39;t think</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.460" end="00:28:59.360" style="s2">like even Jim Rudd because when I came</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.559" end="00:29:00.440" style="s2">in and like technology it&#39;s the solution</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.360" end="00:29:01.759" style="s2">and unders I get it</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.440" end="00:29:05.659" style="s2">he&#39;s like we&#39;ve been there try that</p>

<p begin="00:29:10.070" end="00:29:14.600" style="s2">who&#39;s had anything in the realm of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.659" end="00:29:16.130" style="s2">technology that&#39;s failed are you open</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.600" end="00:29:18.470" style="s2">for an interview or like a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.130" end="00:29:20.990" style="s2">together of like hey how did it fail why</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.470" end="00:29:23.710" style="s2">did it fail maybe there&#39;s some spark</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.990" end="00:29:27.019" style="s2">from in in my hometown we actually had</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.710" end="00:29:30.019" style="s2">for about a year there a monthly video</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.019" end="00:29:33.620" style="s2">we caught a fail learn grow and we would</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.019" end="00:29:35.450" style="s2">interview local startup founders who had</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.620" end="00:29:38.029" style="s2">a failed business or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.450" end="00:29:39.740" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s always very is very similar</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.029" end="00:29:41.570" style="s2">so yeah I think that would be that also</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.740" end="00:29:48.230" style="s2">be very I think that&#39;d be something</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.570" end="00:29:50.899" style="s2">people would like to see about doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.230" end="00:29:53.690" style="s2">business or starting projects they were</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.899" end="00:29:56.899" style="s2">about how to fail and what went wrong</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.690" end="00:30:00.379" style="s2">because the success story is yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.899" end="00:30:02.509" style="s2">very nice that someone made all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.379" end="00:30:05.240" style="s2">right choices or not all the right</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.509" end="00:30:09.100" style="s2">choices but enough right choices that he</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.240" end="00:30:12.500" style="s2">succeeded and actually did something but</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.100" end="00:30:16.399" style="s2">what went wrong is much broader and much</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.500" end="00:30:20.059" style="s2">more interesting area so yeah that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.399" end="00:30:21.470" style="s2">be nice yeah and I know two founders I</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.059" end="00:30:24.019" style="s2">mean they weren&#39;t in the game B space</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.470" end="00:30:25.960" style="s2">but they both took three to six months</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.019" end="00:30:28.429" style="s2">off the job like I&#39;m doing now and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.960" end="00:30:35.629" style="s2">started something and then shut it down</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.429" end="00:30:38.750" style="s2">that didn&#39;t Roy gain traction so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.629" end="00:30:40.700" style="s2">could I could tap those and if we ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.750" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">wanted to I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;d be as</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.700" end="00:30:44.299" style="s2">helpful they&#39;re not so much the game B</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:45.769" style="s2">but they were they were hoping to have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.299" end="00:30:51.350" style="s2">positive impact on the world they</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.769" end="00:30:53.659" style="s2">weren&#39;t purely profit driven just the</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.350" end="00:30:55.460" style="s2">hot weirder harder space to be in cuz</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.659" end="00:30:56.690" style="s2">it&#39;s like you you need to be profitable</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.460" end="00:30:58.070" style="s2">to stay there but you&#39;re like I&#39;m here</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.690" end="00:30:59.090" style="s2">for the greater good and you still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.070" end="00:31:01.610" style="s2">it&#39;s still cricket</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.090" end="00:31:03.470" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s a bigger meta problem</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.610" end="00:31:04.999" style="s2">we&#39;re not solving here and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.470" end="00:31:06.980" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about like solving that for</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.999" end="00:31:09.649" style="s2">vaporware that when somebody has an idea</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.980" end="00:31:11.720" style="s2">how do you get the best product out of</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.649" end="00:31:13.909" style="s2">it how do you get and I&#39;m just tackling</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.720" end="00:31:16.999" style="s2">it Millennials but there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.909" end="00:31:18.740" style="s2">about this particular thing in game B of</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.999" end="00:31:20.749" style="s2">everyone coming everyone has a project</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.740" end="00:31:22.580" style="s2">and some people have valuable actual</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.749" end="00:31:23.690" style="s2">projects that are world saving and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.580" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">want them out there and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.690" end="00:31:29.029" style="s2">people who have less than stellar ideas</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:30.740" style="s2">or her per se in my opinion but like</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.029" end="00:31:33.799" style="s2">that&#39;s my opinion right so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.740" end="00:31:35.779" style="s2">we&#39;re how do you know whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.799" end="00:31:37.369" style="s2">merit or not and how do you especially</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.779" end="00:31:39.169" style="s2">like it&#39;s different because you have the</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.369" end="00:31:41.029" style="s2">skill to make your thing so even if</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.169" end="00:31:42.289" style="s2">other people can&#39;t see your vision you</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.029" end="00:31:43.759" style="s2">can see it you can continue moving</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.289" end="00:31:45.350" style="s2">forward I&#39;m in a different place where I</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.759" end="00:31:47.269" style="s2">can&#39;t make anything I have a vision on</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:49.190" style="s2">except for now I&#39;m starting to realize I</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.269" end="00:31:50.539" style="s2">can I can create the idea cafes and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.190" end="00:31:52.639" style="s2">solution raisins and the things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.539" end="00:31:53.990" style="s2">aren&#39;t tech based and then hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.639" end="00:31:56.929" style="s2">there&#39;s tech that comes onboard at some</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.990" end="00:31:59.179" style="s2">one time but it was like what about the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.929" end="00:32:00.559" style="s2">tech the people like a lot of time is</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.179" end="00:32:02.330" style="s2">wasted coming up with projects that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.559" end="00:32:04.070" style="s2">aren&#39;t even putting in that work or</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.330" end="00:32:06.200" style="s2">paying someone else to create that work</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.070" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">when they aren&#39;t viable to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.200" end="00:32:12.230" style="s2">and yet that&#39;s how we all learn like</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:13.639" style="s2">that&#39;s how the agile individual learns</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.230" end="00:32:14.929" style="s2">right is like having enough failed</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.639" end="00:32:17.059" style="s2">projects because like where does it fail</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.929" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">right and have an idea okay I know for</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.059" end="00:32:20.690" style="s2">me just getting a team of people</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:22.399" style="s2">together to work on it right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.690" end="00:32:24.649" style="s2">okay what&#39;s not quite like we decide our</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.399" end="00:32:27.440" style="s2">first process raising on Thursday I was</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.649" end="00:32:29.240" style="s2">like something failed here I need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.440" end="00:32:30.980" style="s2">write out something and yet it didn&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.240" end="00:32:32.840" style="s2">any way like it&#39;s it&#39;s going to keep</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.980" end="00:32:34.220" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna meet next Thursday and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.840" end="00:32:36.259" style="s2">Thursday after but I&#39;m like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.220" end="00:32:37.789" style="s2">something miscommunicated between like</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.259" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">Eric and Ramon&#39;s and I&#39;m like okay</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.789" end="00:32:39.950" style="s2">there&#39;s something missing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:42.860" style="s2">beautiful actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.950" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">and it&#39;s which I know like I need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.860" end="00:32:47.330" style="s2">communicate my ideas in a crappy way so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:48.679" style="s2">they come back to me and confusing ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.330" end="00:32:50.539" style="s2">that I can make it a little less well</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.679" end="00:32:52.100" style="s2">it&#39;s just a little less like a way oh</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.539" end="00:32:53.779" style="s2">that&#39;s where I went wrong okay I can</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.100" end="00:32:56.749" style="s2">agree explain it with just that part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.779" end="00:32:58.070" style="s2">it and like yeah you put yourself out</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.749" end="00:33:00.889" style="s2">there you get better your idea gets</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.070" end="00:33:03.200" style="s2">better but there&#39;s something about the</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.889" end="00:33:04.850" style="s2">vaporware in general that isn&#39;t about us</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.200" end="00:33:06.740" style="s2">that are individual projects it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.850" end="00:33:08.330" style="s2">the world like it&#39;s about that these</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.740" end="00:33:10.429" style="s2">things come into existence and go out</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.330" end="00:33:12.470" style="s2">and the idea itself is good but we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.429" end="00:33:15.450" style="s2">all the issues we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.470" end="00:33:16.680" style="s2">like the marketing and the funding and</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.450" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">how do we make the there might be just</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.680" end="00:33:20.550" style="s2">one little thing wrong with the idea but</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:22.590" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have ownership or</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.550" end="00:33:26.310" style="s2">transparency or margin like you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.590" end="00:33:29.670" style="s2">going to find out and I think like</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.310" end="00:33:31.860" style="s2">project raising was a huge is a part of</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.670" end="00:33:33.240" style="s2">that because I started saying oh it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.860" end="00:33:34.940" style="s2">great if we had this that I realized oh</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.240" end="00:33:39.210" style="s2">we have that that&#39;s a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.940" end="00:33:41.280" style="s2">for part of it so like I was thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.210" end="00:33:46.200" style="s2">SWAT team of people that come into your</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.280" end="00:33:48.030" style="s2">idea and they think about how to I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.200" end="00:33:49.620" style="s2">know the right word here it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.030" end="00:33:51.510" style="s2">improved the idea you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:53.310" style="s2">change the idea too much you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.510" end="00:33:57.780" style="s2">kind of evaluate the idea but once again</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.310" end="00:33:59.010" style="s2">just because the idea that experience of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.780" end="00:34:01.020" style="s2">going through and learning why there</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.010" end="00:34:06.600" style="s2">does it doesn&#39;t work doesn&#39;t mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.020" end="00:34:09.090" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t mate you know like slack the</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.600" end="00:34:11.670" style="s2">company slack started out as a as a as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.090" end="00:34:13.920" style="s2">video game maker they pivoted when they</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.670" end="00:34:15.720" style="s2">ran out of money if they&#39;ve never gone</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.920" end="00:34:21.720" style="s2">together and made this company to make</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.720" end="00:34:23.460" style="s2">this thing slack would exist so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.720" end="00:34:26.580" style="s2">then I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even know if we</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.460" end="00:34:31.169" style="s2">want to deter to rail someone from that</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.580" end="00:34:32.910" style="s2">learning experience but so I so what I</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.169" end="00:34:35.250" style="s2">was thinking well that&#39;s very similar to</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.910" end="00:34:37.470" style="s2">solutions raising so what&#39;s what&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.250" end="00:34:40.590" style="s2">little bit different than solution</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.470" end="00:34:42.090" style="s2">raising that says I don&#39;t it would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.590" end="00:34:45.000" style="s2">really interesting to have the SWAT team</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.090" end="00:34:47.429" style="s2">come in to help you validate an idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.000" end="00:34:55.230" style="s2">quicker maybe to accelerate that</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.429" end="00:34:56.490" style="s2">learning path yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.230" end="00:34:57.660" style="s2">of the opposite of a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.490" end="00:34:59.490" style="s2">because a project crazy like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.660" end="00:35:05.220" style="s2">help you raise your project and someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.490" end="00:35:06.570" style="s2">team is like which honestly because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.220" end="00:35:07.830" style="s2">like the individual is the one who gets</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.570" end="00:35:09.330" style="s2">to choose which one of those things like</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.830" end="00:35:11.220" style="s2">I know for me with the idea of together</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.330" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">tech and a technological operative and</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.220" end="00:35:15.570" style="s2">all the ideas of how tech saves us I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.010" style="s2">not stopping unless somebody kills me or</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.570" end="00:35:19.110" style="s2">somebody saves the world like there is</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.010" end="00:35:21.720" style="s2">no stopping yes every project can fail</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.110" end="00:35:24.210" style="s2">every relationship can visit ever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.720" end="00:35:24.660" style="s2">not stopping unless someone breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.210" end="00:35:26.130" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.660" end="00:35:28.410" style="s2">unless someone</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.130" end="00:35:30.660" style="s2">actually points out the flaws in like</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.410" end="00:35:32.460" style="s2">actual system and it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.660" end="00:35:34.020" style="s2">convincing it&#39;s like I have to see the</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.460" end="00:35:35.790" style="s2">flaw right that it&#39;s big enough that</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.020" end="00:35:38.610" style="s2">it&#39;s like my life&#39;s work is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.790" end="00:35:40.110" style="s2">here cuz what&#39;s working isn&#39;t working</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.610" end="00:35:41.520" style="s2">like what&#39;s out there isn&#39;t working I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.110" end="00:35:42.810" style="s2">can see something better and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.520" end="00:35:45.810" style="s2">gonna keep trying to work towards it</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.810" end="00:35:47.370" style="s2">until it&#39;s there or it&#39;s not and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.810" end="00:35:48.930" style="s2">want to take that away from other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.370" end="00:35:50.640" style="s2">and yet I do cuz I want people to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.930" end="00:35:51.900" style="s2">that away from me I don&#39;t anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.640" end="00:35:53.370" style="s2">before when I was all alone I was like</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.900" end="00:35:55.740" style="s2">somebody that needs to come join me or</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.370" end="00:35:57.960" style="s2">like break this for me cuz I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.740" end="00:35:59.610" style="s2">waste my life here I mean I would I</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.960" end="00:36:03.930" style="s2">would love if someone would come in and</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.610" end="00:36:06.030" style="s2">give me proof that reason score will not</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.930" end="00:36:08.160" style="s2">provide as much value as I think well</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.030" end="00:36:09.870" style="s2">not provide a sufficient amount of value</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.160" end="00:36:12.810" style="s2">I&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t provide as much</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.870" end="00:36:15.440" style="s2">value as I think it will but still will</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.810" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">be enough value to spend more time on it</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.440" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">but I could be wrong I could get a year</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:22.920" style="s2">down the path and realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:25.860" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter how good this is at</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.920" end="00:36:28.230" style="s2">making the truth obvious that if no one</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.860" end="00:36:31.020" style="s2">if if the level of effort to get that</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.230" end="00:36:34.050" style="s2">level of learning is too high then</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.020" end="00:36:36.360" style="s2">people will not do it there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.050" end="00:36:38.100" style="s2">money to pay there&#39;s there&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.360" end="00:36:40.980" style="s2">a chance of there being a wall on why</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.100" end="00:36:45.780" style="s2">this idea won&#39;t work but yeah until I</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.980" end="00:36:47.180" style="s2">have irrefutable proof of that I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.780" end="00:36:50.820" style="s2">still bang my head against the wall</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.180" end="00:36:53.310" style="s2">which I have been doing every I&#39;ve given</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.820" end="00:36:54.960" style="s2">up like four or five times but a week</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.310" end="00:36:57.210" style="s2">later I&#39;m like okay what&#39;s my next big</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.960" end="00:37:00.570" style="s2">idea and I said oh this idea won&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.210" end="00:37:01.950" style="s2">until I can have this truth seeking I I</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.570" end="00:37:04.890" style="s2">keep coming back to it because every</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.950" end="00:37:08.510" style="s2">other idea it would be so much better if</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.890" end="00:37:10.530" style="s2">I had this this first core thing done so</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.510" end="00:37:12.510" style="s2">but yeah it would be nice if someone</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.530" end="00:37:14.580" style="s2">would sit down long enough and and</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.510" end="00:37:16.560" style="s2">actually prove not just say oh I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.580" end="00:37:18.120" style="s2">think that&#39;s gonna work or here&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.560" end="00:37:19.920" style="s2">you know cuz a lot of times they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.120" end="00:37:23.280" style="s2">bring up and they&#39;re just not like</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.920" end="00:37:26.580" style="s2">they&#39;re not like absolute blocks they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.280" end="00:37:28.020" style="s2">just like walls that I that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.580" end="00:37:33.450" style="s2">figure out a way over but they&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.020" end="00:37:35.580" style="s2">reason to stop so yeah yeah yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.450" end="00:37:38.910" style="s2">wonder whether it&#39;s getting to that spot</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.580" end="00:37:39.460" style="s2">faster or just a group of people to come</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.910" end="00:37:42.630" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.460" end="00:37:46.810" style="s2">and a lot of the ideas it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.630" end="00:37:50.470" style="s2">validation although it doesn&#39;t work with</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.810" end="00:37:52.930" style="s2">my idea because I keep you know I keep</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.470" end="00:37:54.790" style="s2">trying things out and no one grabs on to</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.930" end="00:37:58.260" style="s2">it but I keep thinking it&#39;s like well it</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.790" end="00:37:58.260" style="s2">just means I&#39;m not explaining it right</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.770" end="00:38:09.280" style="s2">but maybe that&#39;s not it right it could</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.050" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">be that well it&#39;s yeah coming together</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.280" end="00:38:13.570" style="s2">like it is something that is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:14.710" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about I don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.570" end="00:38:17.440" style="s2">vaporware and everything else like it</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.710" end="00:38:19.150" style="s2">seems like the people as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.440" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">hold the vision you&#39;re gonna keep moving</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.150" end="00:38:24.280" style="s2">forward with it and thank God at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:26.200" style="s2">same time there&#39;s certain like I look at</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.280" end="00:38:27.370" style="s2">the idea there&#39;s certain ideas I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.200" end="00:38:30.190" style="s2">become across and game being that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.370" end="00:38:33.940" style="s2">like this is in no way a solution hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.190" end="00:38:35.890" style="s2">the idea itself and I think separating</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.940" end="00:38:39.670" style="s2">the idea from the person is actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.890" end="00:38:41.050" style="s2">really powerful to say okay well am i</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.670" end="00:38:43.270" style="s2">trying to knock her Bentley&#39;s feelings</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.050" end="00:38:44.920" style="s2">or my trying to her Bentley&#39;s feelings</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.270" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">has nothing to do with the idea right</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.920" end="00:38:49.180" style="s2">versus the idea itself and then also can</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:50.740" style="s2">I understand it to be able to critique</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.180" end="00:38:52.450" style="s2">it anyway right I&#39;d like to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.740" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">understand how you think this should</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.450" end="00:38:55.180" style="s2">work before I&#39;m like oh back at work</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:38:56.410" style="s2">there&#39;s no way we could have you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.180" end="00:38:59.190" style="s2">great sense making</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.410" end="00:39:00.940" style="s2">um which is what I&#39;m coming up with in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.190" end="00:39:02.290" style="s2">processor AZ and it&#39;s like well there</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.940" end="00:39:03.220" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly away ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.290" end="00:39:06.460" style="s2">people can come together create a</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.220" end="00:39:11.380" style="s2">project so we&#39;d like have this what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.460" end="00:39:12.940" style="s2">the word like a narrowing down process</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.380" end="00:39:14.380" style="s2">like that&#39;s not actually what I&#39;m try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.940" end="00:39:15.490" style="s2">say I actually think we can create</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.380" end="00:39:17.620" style="s2">something with ten thousand people or I</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.490" end="00:39:19.660" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be doing it we just aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.620" end="00:39:21.100" style="s2">there yet and so it&#39;s like like I could</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.660" end="00:39:24.210" style="s2">see the vision enough that I will keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.100" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">moving in that direction and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.210" end="00:39:30.040" style="s2">that like what I was trying to say that</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:32.560" style="s2">I didn&#39;t get to was the person the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.040" end="00:39:35.740" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard from people then I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.560" end="00:39:37.150" style="s2">think our solutions I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.740" end="00:39:38.620" style="s2">would look at them differently and see</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.150" end="00:39:40.840" style="s2">the beauty of let&#39;s say they came from</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.620" end="00:39:43.840" style="s2">Jordan Hall right like what if they came</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.840" end="00:39:47.380" style="s2">from a different person and or what if</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.840" end="00:39:48.880" style="s2">this person who&#39;s maybe not the best at</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.380" end="00:39:51.370" style="s2">communicating the idea but the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.880" end="00:39:52.750" style="s2">really good what if somebody else was</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.370" end="00:39:54.850" style="s2">able to communicate this idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.750" end="00:39:56.740" style="s2">like what if you had you know Russell</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.850" end="00:39:58.090" style="s2">Brand explained the suite yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.740" end="00:39:59.860" style="s2">then I&#39;d definitely be behind right like</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.090" end="00:40:03.670" style="s2">what&#39;s not gonna go by Russell forensics</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.860" end="00:40:05.770" style="s2">way and so like that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.670" end="00:40:07.690" style="s2">know what I&#39;m going with that but so</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.770" end="00:40:11.230" style="s2">it&#39;s just thinking I have have we seen</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.690" end="00:40:15.790" style="s2">any ideas that we knew upfront could not</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.230" end="00:40:17.920" style="s2">be successful and then do you think we</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.790" end="00:40:20.740" style="s2">could have proved it and saved some</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.920" end="00:40:23.830" style="s2">resources do have you seen any that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.740" end="00:40:25.900" style="s2">know for a fact wouldn&#39;t have worked yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.830" end="00:40:27.790" style="s2">but and I did try and the person wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.900" end="00:40:29.260" style="s2">open to having a conversation now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.790" end="00:40:30.460" style="s2">from my side right because from their</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.260" end="00:40:32.320" style="s2">side they&#39;re like you didn&#39;t look at it</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.460" end="00:40:37.120" style="s2">enough you didn&#39;t like really look at it</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.320" end="00:40:38.440" style="s2">I&#39;m like I did like there&#39;s if part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.120" end="00:40:41.830" style="s2">it is this person couldn&#39;t have a video</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.440" end="00:40:42.700" style="s2">conversation I cannot yeah right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.830" end="00:40:44.700" style="s2">like when you have an actual</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.700" end="00:40:48.520" style="s2">conversation different different</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.700" end="00:40:49.840" style="s2">communication stops yeah and so it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.520" end="00:40:53.350" style="s2">like that there&#39;s just not a solution</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.840" end="00:40:54.460" style="s2">here and every my opinion and so and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.350" end="00:40:56.380" style="s2">then there&#39;s other ones where I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.460" end="00:40:57.730" style="s2">oh I love this 90% and those are the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.380" end="00:40:59.950" style="s2">ones I actually want to deal with right</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.730" end="00:41:03.010" style="s2">like like here&#39;s the 10% I don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.950" end="00:41:04.540" style="s2">and it&#39;s for you to accept it or fix it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.010" end="00:41:06.730" style="s2">right like it&#39;s not you don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.540" end="00:41:08.020" style="s2">take on my little view just here&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.730" end="00:41:10.090" style="s2">don&#39;t think blockchain here&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.020" end="00:41:15.310" style="s2">don&#39;t think you know but that&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.090" end="00:41:17.620" style="s2">happen right and that is also this space</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.310" end="00:41:18.910" style="s2">because it&#39;s like we&#39;re trying to solve</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.620" end="00:41:20.320" style="s2">things for other people instead of</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.910" end="00:41:21.940" style="s2">solving them for ourselves because of</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.320" end="00:41:23.470" style="s2">course that&#39;s what gaming is and we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.940" end="00:41:25.060" style="s2">to do it that way right like you have to</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.470" end="00:41:27.010" style="s2">put yourself in other people&#39;s shoes and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.060" end="00:41:28.840" style="s2">say how do they make decisions on</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.010" end="00:41:31.120" style="s2">reasons that you can create reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.840" end="00:41:32.380" style="s2">but they will use it at the same time if</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.120" end="00:41:33.850" style="s2">there was a way to like bring it from</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.380" end="00:41:35.740" style="s2">the ground I&#39;ve no idea how we do that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.850" end="00:41:38.020" style="s2">freezes right but from the ground up of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.740" end="00:41:39.580" style="s2">like how do you and the closest will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.020" end="00:41:41.410" style="s2">tomorrow we do the solution yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.580" end="00:41:44.860" style="s2">solution raising it&#39;s like how do we get</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.410" end="00:41:46.500" style="s2">our information how do we what could</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.860" end="00:41:53.260" style="s2">that look like with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.500" end="00:41:57.490" style="s2">$100,000 but having again well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.260" end="00:41:59.140" style="s2">there are some ideas that that can come</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.490" end="00:42:00.840" style="s2">up that way and the challenge with</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.140" end="00:42:03.190" style="s2">reason scores it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.840" end="00:42:05.100" style="s2">inventing the light bulb you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.190" end="00:42:07.680" style="s2">have gotten there unless you try it out</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.100" end="00:42:09.780" style="s2">some different materials like they you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.680" end="00:42:12.600" style="s2">know they literally tried a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.780" end="00:42:16.920" style="s2">different materials tell it was a piece</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.600" end="00:42:19.020" style="s2">of metal from a folding fan that ended</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.920" end="00:42:21.960" style="s2">up having the right thing to wear it</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.020" end="00:42:24.000" style="s2">worked for thirteen hours and that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.960" end="00:42:26.670" style="s2">the success we got like over the last 13</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.000" end="00:42:30.750" style="s2">hours can you imagine having light bulbs</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.670" end="00:42:32.550" style="s2">they don&#39;t last that long so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.750" end="00:42:34.410" style="s2">there&#39;s there are different groups some</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.550" end="00:42:36.660" style="s2">of them some ideas some things take a</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.410" end="00:42:40.020" style="s2">big R&amp;D cycle and some of them it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.660" end="00:42:41.910" style="s2">oh we we know we know kind of what we</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.020" end="00:42:44.280" style="s2">get net that the question is how do we</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.910" end="00:42:45.780" style="s2">make the it an interface to where the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.280" end="00:42:47.280" style="s2">people can use it and then it&#39;s then</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.780" end="00:42:49.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a lot of really good input from</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.280" end="00:42:52.080" style="s2">people so like for the reason school</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.290" end="00:42:53.850" style="s2">idea although I&#39;m going off tangent I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.080" end="00:42:56.970" style="s2">got to figure out how to get the math to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.850" end="00:42:59.010" style="s2">work and then after that there&#39;s tons of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.970" end="00:43:01.050" style="s2">ways to represent it and I and I need</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.010" end="00:43:03.720" style="s2">people&#39;s input on how do you how do i</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.050" end="00:43:06.450" style="s2">display this information in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.720" end="00:43:08.010" style="s2">is meaningful and useful to you and how</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.450" end="00:43:11.040" style="s2">do I collect it from you in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.010" end="00:43:13.860" style="s2">not you know dragging glass across your</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.040" end="00:43:15.210" style="s2">scanners which is what it turned out</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.860" end="00:43:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like I&#39;m gonna have to like hire</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.210" end="00:43:22.490" style="s2">somebody because it&#39;s too boring for me</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.800" end="00:43:24.450" style="s2">to do or too painful so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.490" end="00:43:25.590" style="s2">different yeah different ideas do</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.450" end="00:43:29.760" style="s2">definitely have different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.590" end="00:43:31.590" style="s2">investment levels but yeah so I was just</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.760" end="00:43:35.490" style="s2">thinking is there is there a way I could</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.590" end="00:43:36.540" style="s2">really help cuz there&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.490" end="00:43:39.360" style="s2">like I have some concerns about</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.540" end="00:43:45.120" style="s2">Adrienne&#39;s idea that he&#39;s not here to</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.360" end="00:43:47.340" style="s2">defend himself from but you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.120" end="00:43:49.200" style="s2">still gonna support him on that and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.340" end="00:43:53.580" style="s2">don&#39;t know none of them are like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.200" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">can&#39;t do this because his idea I think</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.580" end="00:43:58.830" style="s2">has some has some definite possibilities</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:02.670" style="s2">there&#39;s just some risk that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.830" end="00:44:05.610" style="s2">mitigate like well you know will he have</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.670" end="00:44:07.080" style="s2">enough funds to get it produced if but</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.610" end="00:44:08.760" style="s2">you know and that&#39;s why it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.080" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">important that when more to she and I</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.760" end="00:44:13.860" style="s2">are helping him develop this that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:16.440" style="s2">making sure that what we&#39;re doing will</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.860" end="00:44:18.630" style="s2">get him to a point where he can get some</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.440" end="00:44:19.140" style="s2">traction right there&#39;s a lot of features</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.630" end="00:44:21.600" style="s2">we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.140" end="00:44:24.030" style="s2">we could put in and if we were just game</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.600" end="00:44:25.440" style="s2">a software developers we&#39;d be like oh</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.030" end="00:44:26.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a feature yeah we&#39;ll put it in</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.440" end="00:44:29.130" style="s2">but we kind of have a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.730" end="00:44:30.900" style="s2">responsibility to say we&#39;re happy to do</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.130" end="00:44:33.990" style="s2">this but are you sure that this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.900" end="00:44:36.330" style="s2">getting you closer to funding support of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.990" end="00:44:38.910" style="s2">you know or is this just a nice-to-have</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.330" end="00:44:40.650" style="s2">feature and that&#39;s why I kind of I am</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.910" end="00:44:43.770" style="s2">very careful about doing development for</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.650" end="00:44:46.020" style="s2">anyone in this space even donating time</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.770" end="00:44:47.640" style="s2">all right it&#39;s poor like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.020" end="00:44:49.620" style="s2">them to pay me for something unless I</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.640" end="00:44:59.360" style="s2">really know that it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.620" end="00:45:02.460" style="s2">successful that is yeah it is morally</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.360" end="00:45:09.770" style="s2">not come to two percent obvious because</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.460" end="00:45:09.770" style="s2">oh I&#39;m not sure how to express this but</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.370" end="00:45:21.360" style="s2">if we are going to and the idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.500" end="00:45:23.910" style="s2">create something that is not they may</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.360" end="00:45:33.170" style="s2">basically so we are not doing this for</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.910" end="00:45:36.810" style="s2">profit and on the other hand there is oh</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.170" end="00:45:39.930" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated I want to say something</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.810" end="00:45:41.850" style="s2">different I think so I would say also</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.930" end="00:45:47.820" style="s2">something something something different</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.850" end="00:45:50.930" style="s2">I did not see any one particular idea</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.820" end="00:45:54.210" style="s2">that I would be sure it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.930" end="00:45:57.540" style="s2">succeed in any way possible it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.210" end="00:46:03.020" style="s2">haven&#39;t seen anything that I would know</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.540" end="00:46:10.280" style="s2">is going to fail completely same with</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.020" end="00:46:13.590" style="s2">your projects and I might have some</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.280" end="00:46:17.220" style="s2">reservations or some ideas what would</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.590" end="00:46:23.180" style="s2">need to be done differently but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.220" end="00:46:26.130" style="s2">think I can state them before eyes</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.180" end="00:46:29.040" style="s2">before we can show something that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.130" end="00:46:31.140" style="s2">working and before something exists that</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.040" end="00:46:32.930" style="s2">can be actually improved because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.140" end="00:46:37.049" style="s2">hard to</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.930" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">Fiori make a theory about what we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.049" end="00:46:45.119" style="s2">improve when there is nothing physical</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.319" end="00:46:48.809" style="s2">to improve yet so I would well</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.119" end="00:46:51.749" style="s2">I always prefer to code something and</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.809" end="00:46:54.650" style="s2">have it working and then improve it once</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.749" end="00:46:56.309" style="s2">it&#39;s there so there was feedback</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.650" end="00:46:59.430" style="s2">relating to something that people</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.309" end="00:47:01.349" style="s2">actually use and are able to see as</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.430" end="00:47:03.380" style="s2">opposed to something that they think</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.349" end="00:47:08.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not though it work because</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.380" end="00:47:12.239" style="s2">something so yeah practice first yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.880" end="00:47:15.109" style="s2">and sometimes a small bit of development</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.239" end="00:47:23.039" style="s2">or or work and get you to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.109" end="00:47:24.720" style="s2">validation mind yeah so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.039" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">thinking through whether there&#39;s any I</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.720" end="00:47:29.700" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve given lots of people advice on</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:34.499" style="s2">ideas and sometimes I was helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.700" end="00:47:39.569" style="s2">sometimes I really wasn&#39;t yeah I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.499" end="00:47:42.450" style="s2">know if there&#39;s a I mean yeah I I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.569" end="00:47:43.859" style="s2">that there probably is a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.450" end="00:47:48.900" style="s2">probably something there that we could</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.859" end="00:47:52.700" style="s2">figure out how to improve the efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.900" end="00:47:59.910" style="s2">in that in that area of taking idea to</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.700" end="00:48:01.529" style="s2">kind of prove point yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.910" end="00:48:03.239" style="s2">there&#39;s also like when you have an idea</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.529" end="00:48:04.890" style="s2">it&#39;s also sometimes in its infancy</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.239" end="00:48:08.759" style="s2">especially when there isn&#39;t a thing to</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.890" end="00:48:10.229" style="s2">critique and improve of like all the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.759" end="00:48:13.049" style="s2">emotional stuff that comes up when</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.229" end="00:48:14.309" style="s2">someone&#39;s someone&#39;s critiquing it and no</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.049" end="00:48:18.079" style="s2">we know that you&#39;re capable of handling</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.309" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">that right in any any moment but was I</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.079" end="00:48:21.660" style="s2">kind of like three conversations for</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:23.519" style="s2">this favorite where thing like I want</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.660" end="00:48:25.829" style="s2">people who had the idea never got it</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.519" end="00:48:28.349" style="s2">made those are the people in game B I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.829" end="00:48:30.329" style="s2">the best idea why aren&#39;t you guys giving</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.349" end="00:48:33.589" style="s2">me money and asking to make this for me</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.329" end="00:48:35.700" style="s2">that&#39;s me I know what it&#39;s like and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.589" end="00:48:37.049" style="s2">people who&#39;ve made it and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.700" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">beautiful product but they shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.049" end="00:48:41.549" style="s2">have users right the marketing was off</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:44.160" style="s2">or and then people who had a product had</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.549" end="00:48:46.320" style="s2">users it was working but it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.160" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">financially sustainable right</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.320" end="00:48:50.160" style="s2">that would just was able to last a long</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:52.200" style="s2">time and then what went wrong but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.160" end="00:48:53.360" style="s2">gonna put up a post in game B just</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.200" end="00:48:56.100" style="s2">asking for people to have a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.360" end="00:48:58.350" style="s2">saying awful one on one on one and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.100" end="00:49:00.210" style="s2">having the conversation I would why did</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.350" end="00:49:02.610" style="s2">it fail but they&#39;d be very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.210" end="00:49:03.900" style="s2">to see and since you kind of see</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.610" end="00:49:07.230" style="s2">yourself as one of those people if you</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.900" end="00:49:09.810" style="s2">need someone to interview you about your</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.230" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">experience then I can probably do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.810" end="00:49:15.120" style="s2">if you want to be a subject of one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:23.190" style="s2">those meetings yeah we&#39;ll see because I</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.120" end="00:49:25.110" style="s2">don&#39;t I haven&#39;t failed Bentley no yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.190" end="00:49:27.360" style="s2">but you did that emotional journey where</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.110" end="00:49:30.150" style="s2">yeah where we come in with a great idea</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.360" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like oh I got a my egos</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.150" end="00:49:33.680" style="s2">take a couple bruises and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.980" end="00:49:39.210" style="s2">interesting story in that space so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.560" end="00:49:45.120" style="s2">and I you know I could probably talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.210" end="00:49:47.010" style="s2">about mine yeah the only yeah I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.120" end="00:49:51.780" style="s2">to think I guess the reason scores not</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.010" end="00:49:54.840" style="s2">there yet to be in that conversation to</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.780" end="00:49:56.280" style="s2">be a value I mean I the one other</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.840" end="00:49:58.200" style="s2">project that I did that was personal</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.280" end="00:50:00.660" style="s2">that I ended up really shutting down was</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.200" end="00:50:04.920" style="s2">just a podcast and those because I was</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.660" end="00:50:07.590" style="s2">way too vague on the topic so no one</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.920" end="00:50:13.890" style="s2">really ever listened to it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.590" end="00:50:16.080" style="s2">not a lot of learning there so I I know</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.890" end="00:50:18.060" style="s2">there&#39;s like I&#39;m gonna I have yet to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.080" end="00:50:20.250" style="s2">have a one-on-one conversation with Jim</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.060" end="00:50:23.100" style="s2">but I&#39;m in approached him about this one</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.250" end="00:50:25.260" style="s2">cuz I&#39;m like I want to know like if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.100" end="00:50:27.060" style="s2">don&#39;t think technologies the answer what</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.260" end="00:50:29.730" style="s2">was the failure what didn&#39;t work and</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.060" end="00:50:31.530" style="s2">what was and yet his his opinion I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.730" end="00:50:32.910" style="s2">if he&#39;s open to that and then it is I</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.530" end="00:50:34.590" style="s2">know there&#39;s a bunch of people in there</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.910" end="00:50:37.140" style="s2">and then I do want a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.590" end="00:50:39.180" style="s2">like me who have the like vaporware idea</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.140" end="00:50:42.270" style="s2">write some paper bricks it has it gone</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.180" end="00:50:43.740" style="s2">away it could this is not made it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.270" end="00:50:46.830" style="s2">financed so it&#39;s not even like a team</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.740" end="00:50:48.450" style="s2">making it necessarily right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.830" end="00:50:50.460" style="s2">still not failed because I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.450" end="00:50:53.220" style="s2">holding on to it I haven&#39;t let it go</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.460" end="00:50:54.510" style="s2">so all of those right like people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.220" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">are like I have the social media</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.510" end="00:50:58.410" style="s2">platform like we take a step back and</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:51:00.000" style="s2">realize that no you don&#39;t cuz no one</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.410" end="00:51:02.880" style="s2">does because you don&#39;t have your friends</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.000" end="00:51:05.310" style="s2">family you need millions of people is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.880" end="00:51:07.020" style="s2">not the point of a social media platform</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.310" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s not like getting people</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.020" end="00:51:14.190" style="s2">have the idea and have a conversation of</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:16.500" style="s2">what&#39;s broken here why can&#39;t we work</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.190" end="00:51:18.750" style="s2">together on one especially a social</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.500" end="00:51:21.840" style="s2">media or team building or any any of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.750" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">this this stuff ends there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.840" end="00:51:25.830" style="s2">broken between you that&#39;s an individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:27.420" style="s2">I like to create I like to create in my</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.830" end="00:51:28.710" style="s2">room yeah I can&#39;t communicate it to the</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.420" end="00:51:31.890" style="s2">world and now I&#39;m enjoying creating with</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.710" end="00:51:33.420" style="s2">people but we all like kind of creating</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.890" end="00:51:34.770" style="s2">by ourselves and with people we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.420" end="00:51:36.270" style="s2">know how to like crew we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.770" end="00:51:39.480" style="s2">definitely on a grave 10,000 people but</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.270" end="00:51:41.550" style="s2">like what the difference between Chris</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.480" end="00:51:43.859" style="s2">solving it alone in your bedroom and in</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.550" end="00:51:46.800" style="s2">your minds and solving it with people</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.859" end="00:51:48.480" style="s2">and I&#39;m in that stage and I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.800" end="00:51:50.099" style="s2">get there through game B I came into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.480" end="00:51:51.450" style="s2">space solving it by myself and I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.099" end="00:51:56.400" style="s2">okay but now I gotta solve it with</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.450" end="00:52:01.470" style="s2">people and like getting into that as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.400" end="00:52:01.890" style="s2">more meta and not really if something is</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.470" end="00:52:04.200" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.890" end="00:52:09.660" style="s2">I&#39;m sure if it&#39;s the right word to use</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.200" end="00:52:14.280" style="s2">because there is something needed and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.660" end="00:52:19.260" style="s2">think technology is a big part of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.280" end="00:52:23.190" style="s2">answer but there&#39;s missing a piece in</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.260" end="00:52:26.640" style="s2">this the way I see it the images I have</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.190" end="00:52:32.040" style="s2">now are like neurons that are separate</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.640" end="00:52:34.200" style="s2">and they need something to realize they</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.040" end="00:52:37.260" style="s2">are part of the network and connect</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.200" end="00:52:40.170" style="s2">that&#39;s the one thing and the second</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.260" end="00:52:43.050" style="s2">thing is when you had all the static</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.170" end="00:52:45.570" style="s2">electricity in the cloud in order for</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.050" end="00:52:48.570" style="s2">the lightning to happen there is some</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.570" end="00:52:50.430" style="s2">condition that needs to be present this</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.570" end="00:52:52.140" style="s2">will be there so there is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.430" end="00:52:54.690" style="s2">missing but not necessarily something</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.140" end="00:52:59.070" style="s2">broken because something broken or imply</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.690" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">that there is nothing we can fix but I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.070" end="00:53:04.230" style="s2">think it&#39;s more like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:06.710" style="s2">we can add to the equation in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.230" end="00:53:10.619" style="s2">make this all work to make the</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.710" end="00:53:12.540" style="s2">connectivity happening that is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.619" end="00:53:13.340" style="s2">what I meant by this is broken there is</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.540" end="00:53:14.840" style="s2">a piece missing</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.340" end="00:53:16.820" style="s2">there&#39;s something here that&#39;s not quite</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.840" end="00:53:21.350" style="s2">working and I don&#39;t mean it yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.820" end="00:53:24.310" style="s2">you yeah and and do you think your</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.350" end="00:53:28.340" style="s2">phrasing it mostly is why why can&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.310" end="00:53:30.080" style="s2">coalesce and work together because I</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.340" end="00:53:31.400" style="s2">mean I see a lot of that but is that I</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.080" end="00:53:34.430" style="s2">just want to make sure that that&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.400" end="00:53:36.920" style="s2">core thesis I don&#39;t know what the core</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.430" end="00:53:39.140" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s literally I can save the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.920" end="00:53:41.900" style="s2">alone in my bedroom I can&#39;t communicate</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.140" end="00:53:43.700" style="s2">it with the rest of the world I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.900" end="00:53:45.200" style="s2">encountering all these other people who</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.700" end="00:53:48.500" style="s2">also have saved the world alone in their</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.200" end="00:53:50.000" style="s2">bedroom what is missing to get us to</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.500" end="00:53:51.220" style="s2">come together go back to square one and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.000" end="00:53:53.030" style="s2">work you know what I mean create like</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.220" end="00:53:54.320" style="s2">what is the missing piece</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.030" end="00:53:56.390" style="s2">I liked the neuron because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.320" end="00:53:58.310" style="s2">we&#39;re all firing neurons but the reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.390" end="00:54:00.710" style="s2">to know there&#39;s a neurological system</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.310" end="00:54:04.190" style="s2">right so that&#39;s just pain that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.710" end="00:54:07.250" style="s2">like send out a signal that&#39;s broken</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.190" end="00:54:09.950" style="s2">it&#39;s that is broken and it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.250" end="00:54:11.630" style="s2">so there&#39;s something missing and yet the</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.950" end="00:54:13.610" style="s2">neuron just keeps firing at them and</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.630" end="00:54:17.870" style="s2">then it does find its pathway and actual</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.610" end="00:54:19.430" style="s2">biology but yeah like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.870" end="00:54:21.230" style="s2">missing in it too that I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.430" end="00:54:23.570" style="s2">out and yet it&#39;s it&#39;s brand-new and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.230" end="00:54:24.800" style="s2">like something that&#39;s no one solved</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.570" end="00:54:25.970" style="s2">because the point is you what do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.800" end="00:54:27.950" style="s2">mean you want to work for something from</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.970" end="00:54:30.110" style="s2">the ground up like you just build it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.950" end="00:54:31.250" style="s2">it fails or succeeds you find a small</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.110" end="00:54:33.200" style="s2">group of people and you build it or it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.250" end="00:54:37.090" style="s2">succeeds like it&#39;s Aria fails or</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.200" end="00:54:42.620" style="s2">succeeds it&#39;s like no there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.090" end="00:54:44.270" style="s2">here it&#39;s just like almost ready so the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.620" end="00:54:47.720" style="s2">point is not to become the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.270" end="00:54:50.300" style="s2">neuron in the neighborhood the point is</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.720" end="00:54:53.000" style="s2">to be the right neuron in the right</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.300" end="00:54:58.250" style="s2">place and connected to the right other</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.000" end="00:55:01.610" style="s2">neros mm-hmm yeah have a connection at</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.250" end="00:55:04.550" style="s2">all because all right I mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.610" end="00:55:09.800" style="s2">excited yeah so I&#39;m in part of a group</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.550" end="00:55:11.270" style="s2">that has six or seven developers having</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.800" end="00:55:15.370" style="s2">some of them are researchers and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.270" end="00:55:19.910" style="s2">all working on some sort of debate tool</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.370" end="00:55:23.650" style="s2">that we all have our own tools we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.910" end="00:55:26.330" style="s2">able to coalesce around the single idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.650" end="00:55:28.059" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a I mean that</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.330" end="00:55:33.130" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.059" end="00:55:37.040" style="s2">my heart it&#39;d be a feature but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.130" end="00:55:40.220" style="s2">because you&#39;ll disagree about the some</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.040" end="00:55:44.630" style="s2">core idea how it should look like how it</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.220" end="00:55:48.859" style="s2">should work like oh we are hitting it</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.630" end="00:55:50.900" style="s2">slightly different benefits so like for</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.859" end="00:55:54.710" style="s2">this example they and we&#39;re almost out</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.900" end="00:55:57.530" style="s2">of time I guess they want a system that</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.710" end="00:56:00.349" style="s2">models several of them wants a system</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.530" end="00:56:02.180" style="s2">that models real-world discussions like</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.349" end="00:56:04.280" style="s2">if two people are sitting at a table let</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.180" end="00:56:08.809" style="s2">we need to log down what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.280" end="00:56:12.220" style="s2">and then work through it and I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.809" end="00:56:14.299" style="s2">do agree on that some instance but my</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.220" end="00:56:16.460" style="s2">yeah so I do have a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.299" end="00:56:18.500" style="s2">thesis on what the problem is and what</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.460" end="00:56:25.010" style="s2">the solution is and they have slightly</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.500" end="00:56:26.299" style="s2">different concepts of that but we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.010" end="00:56:28.460" style="s2">learning from each other because we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.299" end="00:56:31.010" style="s2">talk about okay this is this is our</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.460" end="00:56:33.440" style="s2">difference in opinion on trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.010" end="00:56:35.420" style="s2">about the most recent one we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.440" end="00:56:37.609" style="s2">about context and debates and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.420" end="00:56:40.760" style="s2">that and so we&#39;re throwing on different</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.609" end="00:56:42.410" style="s2">definitions of stuff like that and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.760" end="00:56:43.849" style="s2">they&#39;d recently changed my mind on</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.410" end="00:56:46.069" style="s2">something where I might want to</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.849" end="00:56:47.930" style="s2">implement it and reasons Corwin before I</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.069" end="00:56:50.480" style="s2">was reticent about it</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.930" end="00:56:52.910" style="s2">so so I guess part of the process is</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.480" end="00:56:55.010" style="s2">working through and coming to an</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.910" end="00:57:01.730" style="s2">understanding of a shared understanding</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.010" end="00:57:08.299" style="s2">of the problem and the solution weird</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.730" end="00:57:11.890" style="s2">okay cool weird question it&#39;s yo data</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.299" end="00:57:19.130" style="s2">like back-end data they got structure</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.890" end="00:57:21.680" style="s2">compatible with theirs so no but we as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.130" end="00:57:23.480" style="s2">group we are working on building a</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.680" end="00:57:26.480" style="s2">shared back-end</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.480" end="00:57:30.430" style="s2">oh well mostly very on the front end and</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.480" end="00:57:30.430" style="s2">then I diverged from that so</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.609" end="00:57:40.820" style="s2">I&#39;m asking because I have this one of</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.170" end="00:57:53.420" style="s2">the like enlightening moments you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.820" end="00:57:53.420" style="s2">when I participated so discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.770" end="00:57:59.580" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.090" end="00:58:03.330" style="s2">buck and versus front-end separation as</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.580" end="00:58:05.690" style="s2">in the data can be like all the same one</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.330" end="00:58:13.230" style="s2">scheme out one structure one later</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.690" end="00:58:16.170" style="s2">established and like we know the data is</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.230" end="00:58:19.920" style="s2">correct it&#39;s coherent and it&#39;s there and</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.170" end="00:58:23.700" style="s2">we can have variety of tools and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.920" end="00:58:27.720" style="s2">interfaces to this data so and that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.700" end="00:58:31.470" style="s2">very powerful idea because it means it</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.720" end="00:58:34.200" style="s2">really moves a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.470" end="00:58:37.350" style="s2">previously is you know for each project</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.200" end="00:58:39.240" style="s2">you need to create a front-end to show</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.350" end="00:58:42.900" style="s2">to people and have users and and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.240" end="00:58:46.020" style="s2">and you need to have a back-end and to</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.900" end="00:58:48.600" style="s2">be full of makeup so having a shared</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.020" end="00:58:55.710" style="s2">pool of established like I would remove</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.600" end="00:58:57.690" style="s2">like the effort for everyone and it can</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.710" end="00:58:58.859" style="s2">be awesome yeah so that that is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.690" end="00:59:00.750" style="s2">first place we&#39;re going to collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.859" end="00:59:04.250" style="s2">because supposed to most of our</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.750" end="00:59:06.270" style="s2">differences are in the front-end I think</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.250" end="00:59:09.450" style="s2">well it looks like we&#39;re about out of</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.270" end="00:59:12.150" style="s2">time we are and so you can wrap it up</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.450" end="00:59:13.470" style="s2">here this is our to be you does anyone</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.150" end="00:59:15.330" style="s2">have a question they want to do next</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.470" end="00:59:17.609" style="s2">week for the idea Cafe that we would</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.330" end="00:59:21.570" style="s2">like to answer for our projects my brain</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.609" end="00:59:24.119" style="s2">keeps having issues but you are Nesta do</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.570" end="00:59:26.330" style="s2">you have a question for us to answer for</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.119" end="00:59:29.010" style="s2">our projects for idea cafe next week and</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.330" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">tomorrow we&#39;re doing a instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.010" end="00:59:34.640" style="s2">project round table we have a solution</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:35.850" style="s2">raising during that time period on</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.640" end="00:59:37.980" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.850" end="00:59:39.750" style="s2">on media and information I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.980" end="00:59:42.330" style="s2">doing three within basically a week</p>
