<p begin="00:01:04.739" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">hundred years we&#39;ve created a situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.330" end="00:01:11.790" style="s2">where we have destroyed half of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:14.010" style="s2">biosphere there used to be twice as much</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.790" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">biomass in the world roughly as there is</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.010" end="00:01:21.240" style="s2">now and that&#39;s gone and most of that</p>

<p begin="00:01:21.240" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">and has disappeared is turned into co2</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.960" end="00:01:30.360" style="s2">for soil carbon that is underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:32.250" style="s2">that sense probably something like five</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:34.290" style="s2">or ten times more than what is in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:36.690" style="s2">biomass themselves it&#39;s a huge carbon</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.290" end="00:01:39.890" style="s2">store and every place that we have</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.690" end="00:01:43.320" style="s2">transformed the land from forest into</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.890" end="00:01:46.140" style="s2">agriculture into pasture or grazing or</p>

<p begin="00:01:46.140" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">cities etc etc we have lost at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.460" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">half of the carbon that was in the soil</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">that&#39;s much bigger than what was in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:58.830" style="s2">biomass so in destabilizing the system</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:01.260" style="s2">would make the climate change situation</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.830" end="00:02:04.170" style="s2">worse but at the same time we destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.260" end="00:02:06.030" style="s2">their capability of what only living</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">organisms really do effective just to</p>

<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:13.319" style="s2">trees and then down into the ground</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:15.569" style="s2">which is really the long-term storage so</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.319" end="00:02:18.659" style="s2">that&#39;s a fundamental ecosystem service</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.569" end="00:02:21.440" style="s2">the biosphere regulates our climate it</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.659" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">regulates availability of water</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">so we&#39;ve really crippled ourselves in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:31.050" style="s2">destroying it and part of our view</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:33.330" style="s2">by regenerating ecosystems intelligently</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.050" end="00:02:35.700" style="s2">in a way to maximize biomass and</p>

<p begin="00:02:35.700" end="00:02:40.620" style="s2">biodiversity we can reverse some of</p>

<p begin="00:02:40.620" end="00:02:44.760" style="s2">and and the critical thing is from my</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.140" end="00:02:47.670" style="s2">point of view is we have to stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.760" end="00:02:50.430" style="s2">co2 of climate at safe levels because at</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.670" end="00:02:52.410" style="s2">the moment we are on a path of runaway</p>

<p begin="00:03:23.670" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">from now now the fact is though that the</p>

<p begin="00:03:39.780" end="00:03:44.730" style="s2">not immediate and that is because the</p>

<p begin="00:03:44.730" end="00:03:49.950" style="s2">takes 1,500 years for the ocean to turn</p>

<p begin="00:04:52.370" end="00:05:00.240" style="s2">IPCC will tell us that for doubling of</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.550" end="00:05:02.760" style="s2">co2 no actually for the present yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.240" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">people are talking about is increases of</p>

<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">degrees Celsius and changes in sea level</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.760" end="00:05:14.880" style="s2">amount derived about that but tens of</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.530" style="s2">centimeters maybe a meter or so and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.880" end="00:05:19.260" style="s2">they&#39;re talk about that happening by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.530" end="00:05:21.510" style="s2">end of the century my point is as these</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.260" end="00:05:23.430" style="s2">are just the very beginnings of trends</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.510" end="00:05:25.169" style="s2">if I&#39;m going to accelerate and continue</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.430" end="00:05:27.930" style="s2">going for thousands and thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.169" end="00:05:29.430" style="s2">years and so I pieces and only considers</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.930" end="00:05:32.130" style="s2">the very initial product doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.430" end="00:05:35.039" style="s2">consider where we&#39;re going and the point</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.130" end="00:05:37.320" style="s2">is that we are already on a route to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.039" end="00:05:39.660" style="s2">runaway climate change that will result</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.320" end="00:05:42.389" style="s2">in melting all the ice caps now when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.660" end="00:05:45.870" style="s2">look at the actual long-term climate</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.389" end="00:05:48.750" style="s2">change data itself the real numbers what</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.870" end="00:05:51.000" style="s2">we find is that for 400 parts per</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.750" end="00:05:54.000" style="s2">million of co2 which we&#39;ve passed</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.000" end="00:05:56.700" style="s2">already several years ago without 416</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.000" end="00:05:59.460" style="s2">but for 400 parts per million what the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.700" end="00:06:02.789" style="s2">climate change data shows us peak steady</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.460" end="00:06:06.419" style="s2">state changes in global temperature</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.789" end="00:06:08.220" style="s2">would be about 17 degrees Celsius warmer</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.419" end="00:06:11.340" style="s2">than today and the cela would be about</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.220" end="00:06:14.669" style="s2">23 meters higher than today let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.340" end="00:06:18.539" style="s2">fulfill hunt ppm we&#39;re already well past</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.669" end="00:06:20.760" style="s2">that and it&#39;s accelerating we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.539" end="00:06:22.950" style="s2">on a pop now that will ultimately result</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.760" end="00:06:26.220" style="s2">in the melting of Greenland and</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.950" end="00:06:29.460" style="s2">Antarctica and that&#39;s 17 meters of sea</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.220" end="00:06:31.620" style="s2">level change that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.460" end="00:06:32.930" style="s2">right now we&#39;re on target to get that</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.620" end="00:06:36.419" style="s2">way now that doesn&#39;t happen quickly</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.930" end="00:06:38.639" style="s2">because even Greenland is going to take</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.419" end="00:06:40.530" style="s2">three or four or five thousand years to</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.639" end="00:06:42.599" style="s2">melt its melting at an incredible rate</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.530" end="00:06:44.910" style="s2">but there&#39;s a lot of ice that happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.599" end="00:06:47.310" style="s2">slowly so that this impact won&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.910" end="00:06:49.650" style="s2">our lifetime but we have guaranteed it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.310" end="00:06:51.960" style="s2">going to happen to future generations so</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.650" end="00:06:54.659" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to say is the situation</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.960" end="00:06:55.050" style="s2">is far more terrifying that the public</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.659" end="00:06:56.819" style="s2">on this</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.050" end="00:06:58.949" style="s2">stand who the politicians would make a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.819" end="00:07:01.050" style="s2">want to hear about because in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.949" end="00:07:02.970" style="s2">they only want to hear good news so that</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.050" end="00:07:05.159" style="s2">basically cooked the books to get the</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.970" end="00:07:07.650" style="s2">answer they want which is not the answer</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.159" end="00:07:09.919" style="s2">that affects humanity or our planet so</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.650" end="00:07:13.349" style="s2">my point is that you prevent that</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.919" end="00:07:15.330" style="s2">inevitable catastrophe from a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.349" end="00:07:17.729" style="s2">point of view our only real solution is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.330" end="00:07:20.639" style="s2">to reduce the amount of co2 into the</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.729" end="00:07:23.610" style="s2">atmosphere maybe there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.639" end="00:07:26.490" style="s2">proposals for expensive technological</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.610" end="00:07:28.949" style="s2">solutions and we&#39;re proponents of is</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.490" end="00:07:31.050" style="s2">what we call geo therapy which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.949" end="00:07:34.020" style="s2">basically the regeneration of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.050" end="00:07:37.310" style="s2">natural biological mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.020" end="00:07:40.590" style="s2">regulate our planet&#39;s climate and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.310" end="00:07:43.229" style="s2">atmospheric composition that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.590" end="00:07:45.240" style="s2">callback jira therapy which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.229" end="00:07:47.009" style="s2">treating the earth as a sick patient</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.240" end="00:07:49.409" style="s2">here at there&#39;s running a fever the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.009" end="00:07:51.539" style="s2">temperature is out of control what do</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.409" end="00:07:53.490" style="s2">you what would you do as a doctor with</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.539" end="00:07:55.050" style="s2">your patient to stabilize the</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.490" end="00:07:58.009" style="s2">temperature and bring it down to a safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.050" end="00:08:00.300" style="s2">level that&#39;s what we call geo therapy is</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.009" end="00:08:02.849" style="s2">correcting the heals now that that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.300" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">two branches one is by oh gee if there</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.849" end="00:08:07.710" style="s2">are be witches you subtly kosa so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:10.979" style="s2">other is what we call geoengineering</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.710" end="00:08:13.080" style="s2">which is physical fixes like spring</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.979" end="00:08:15.719" style="s2">sulfuric acid into space and giving</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.080" end="00:08:18.810" style="s2">Europe an acid bath people are seriously</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.810" end="00:08:25.020" style="s2">mirrors out in space there&#39;s solutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.699" end="00:08:26.849" style="s2">that are enormous ly expensive unproven</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.020" end="00:08:28.259" style="s2">and likely have side effects that are</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.849" end="00:08:30.949" style="s2">worse than the problem they&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.259" end="00:08:33.779" style="s2">soul so our focus is really on on</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.949" end="00:08:37.709" style="s2">ecosystem regeneration on a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.779" end="00:08:39.659" style="s2">to try to solve the problem now there</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.709" end="00:08:41.880" style="s2">are many aspects of that and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.659" end="00:08:44.070" style="s2">we&#39;re here to talk about seagrasses and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.880" end="00:08:45.810" style="s2">Posidonia mainly but i just want to put</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.070" end="00:08:48.870" style="s2">this in the context of the larger global</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.810" end="00:08:51.269" style="s2">issues of humanity as a whole faces and</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.870" end="00:08:54.390" style="s2">if we don&#39;t solve this problem and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.269" end="00:08:57.949" style="s2">good to basically wipe out our species</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.390" end="00:09:00.810" style="s2">and many others cockroaches will survive</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.949" end="00:09:03.930" style="s2">bacteria was a survival world optimal</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.810" end="00:09:07.410" style="s2">but but the planet will not be that</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.930" end="00:09:08.850" style="s2">planet the human humans have evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.410" end="00:09:10.319" style="s2">adapted to not</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.850" end="00:09:13.019" style="s2">one that we could we could live in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.319" end="00:09:15.089" style="s2">securely at all who would love to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.019" end="00:09:16.860" style="s2">another conversation to talk about soil</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.089" end="00:09:21.829" style="s2">at some point but as he said like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.860" end="00:09:24.920" style="s2">focusing on on marine regeneration and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.829" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">okay so just continue on here</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.920" end="00:09:30.120" style="s2">essentially what what we have done from</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:34.160" style="s2">our point of view is that um I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.120" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">working for since the 1980s on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.160" end="00:09:38.699" style="s2">technology that uses electricity to</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">regenerate marine ecosystems</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.699" end="00:09:42.680" style="s2">it sounds very bizarre to people you</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:44.910" style="s2">know everyone&#39;s afraid at all Christy</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.680" end="00:09:46.440" style="s2">Frankenstein and getting electric shocks</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.910" end="00:09:49.079" style="s2">and you know being killed and all that</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.440" end="00:09:52.290" style="s2">so no one likes to talk about a twisting</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.079" end="00:09:54.750" style="s2">water and of course naturally high</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.290" end="00:09:57.000" style="s2">levels of electricity and in particular</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.750" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">alternating current but we get out of</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.000" end="00:10:01.769" style="s2">the wall you know it&#39;s this alternating</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:03.180" style="s2">60 cycles a second of course you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.769" end="00:10:05.130" style="s2">you stick your finger in the electrics</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.180" end="00:10:06.600" style="s2">all to hear you&#39;re gonna kill yourself</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.130" end="00:10:09.540" style="s2">especially if you&#39;re wet and covered</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.600" end="00:10:12.439" style="s2">with salt water that that can be deadly</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.540" end="00:10:15.750" style="s2">stuff what we&#39;re talking here about</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.439" end="00:10:17.880" style="s2">extremely low levels in terms of voltage</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.750" end="00:10:20.040" style="s2">and current that are completely safe and</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.880" end="00:10:22.829" style="s2">we&#39;re talk about direct current but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.040" end="00:10:24.209" style="s2">get from a battery now the fact is is</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.829" end="00:10:26.430" style="s2">you know we go into the water with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.209" end="00:10:28.110" style="s2">battery on our watch we&#39;re going to walk</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.430" end="00:10:30.720" style="s2">with underwater flashlights so we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.110" end="00:10:32.850" style="s2">afraid of it killing us okay I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.720" end="00:10:34.620" style="s2">know that&#39;s that&#39;s that safe because the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.850" end="00:10:36.990" style="s2">amounts are very small and the human</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.620" end="00:10:39.540" style="s2">body can tolerate that so we&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.990" end="00:10:41.130" style="s2">with essentially our voltages and</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.540" end="00:10:42.990" style="s2">currents that are down in that level</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.130" end="00:10:46.170" style="s2">like what you would get from a battery</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.990" end="00:10:48.630" style="s2">or from a solar panel and what we found</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.170" end="00:10:51.720" style="s2">I have to really explain a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.630" end="00:10:53.699" style="s2">history here I had a very close call</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.720" end="00:10:56.100" style="s2">week he died more than ten years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.699" end="00:10:57.600" style="s2">his name was wolf Hilbert&#39;s and he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.100" end="00:10:59.519" style="s2">an architect who was originally from</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.600" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">Germany when he became a professor of</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.519" end="00:11:03.750" style="s2">architecture in the United States and he</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.449" style="s2">was interested in trying to produce</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.750" end="00:11:09.329" style="s2">building materials from the sea so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.449" end="00:11:12.660" style="s2">his point of view was is that a coral or</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.329" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">a snail can grow a shell or a skeleton</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.660" end="00:11:18.689" style="s2">very precise architectural shape of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:20.850" style="s2">dissolved minerals in seawater I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.689" end="00:11:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not collecting sword stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.850" end="00:11:25.320" style="s2">taking dissolved room</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.680" end="00:11:27.330" style="s2">silicate in it in a precise form and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.320" end="00:11:29.190" style="s2">shape and that doesn&#39;t happen naturally</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.330" end="00:11:30.870" style="s2">you can watch the ocean for a million</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.190" end="00:11:32.700" style="s2">years and isn&#39;t the limestone isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.870" end="00:11:35.130" style="s2">going to precipitate what what he found</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.700" end="00:11:37.470" style="s2">was is that if he applied a small</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.130" end="00:11:41.399" style="s2">current to the water you could grow</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.470" end="00:11:42.660" style="s2">limestone rock out of you and I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.399" end="00:11:44.430" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s easier if I show some</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.660" end="00:11:46.140" style="s2">pictures to explain that process and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.430" end="00:11:48.750" style="s2">I&#39;ll discuss the applications to see</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.140" end="00:11:50.870" style="s2">grouse so let me I&#39;ll try to share the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.750" end="00:11:54.660" style="s2">screen here and I&#39;m going to show you</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.870" end="00:11:57.270" style="s2">can you see this picture here yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.660" end="00:12:00.779" style="s2">so that is Wolfe filbert and he&#39;s making</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.270" end="00:12:03.899" style="s2">a drawing on the bottom and so what he</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.779" end="00:12:05.970" style="s2">found was that that&#39;s a bust of world</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.899" end="00:12:08.010" style="s2">story that we have in Bali but this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.970" end="00:12:11.070" style="s2">what we do we build structures out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.010" end="00:12:12.959" style="s2">ordinary construction steel of any we</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.070" end="00:12:15.149" style="s2">can make them any size or shape no steel</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.959" end="00:12:16.200" style="s2">was the cheapest most common building</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.149" end="00:12:18.930" style="s2">material in the world</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.200" end="00:12:20.490" style="s2">as everyone knows and so we have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.930" end="00:12:23.070" style="s2">of experience and bending it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.490" end="00:12:24.750" style="s2">stretching it and welding it and we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.070" end="00:12:25.529" style="s2">build any size or shape with steel</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.750" end="00:12:27.990" style="s2">berries</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.529" end="00:12:30.839" style="s2">now steel has a fatal flaw when you put</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.990" end="00:12:32.880" style="s2">it in seawater it rusts very quickly so</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.839" end="00:12:35.700" style="s2">when you put steel water it turns red</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.880" end="00:12:37.050" style="s2">with iron oxide eventually it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.700" end="00:12:40.440" style="s2">crumble and fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.050" end="00:12:42.180" style="s2">that&#39;s an evident so it&#39;s a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.440" end="00:12:44.490" style="s2">construction material to use in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.180" end="00:12:45.950" style="s2">ocean and in the ocean people make stuff</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.490" end="00:12:48.720" style="s2">that looks like this figure out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.950" end="00:12:50.970" style="s2">concrete steel bars inside of concrete</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.720" end="00:12:53.880" style="s2">and what happens is to see what the</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.970" end="00:12:57.060" style="s2">penetrates those made the concrete the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.880" end="00:12:59.700" style="s2">iron rusts when it rusts it expands that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.060" end="00:13:01.410" style="s2">cracks the concrete and it&#39;s crack the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.700" end="00:13:03.779" style="s2">water has even more access would</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.410" end="00:13:05.640" style="s2">accelerate some rusting and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.779" end="00:13:07.980" style="s2">the whole thing falls apart and every</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.640" end="00:13:10.470" style="s2">reinforced concrete structure in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.980" end="00:13:12.540" style="s2">ocean isn&#39;t collapsing in that sense I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.470" end="00:13:15.029" style="s2">mean it&#39;s inevitable that you see them</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.540" end="00:13:17.370" style="s2">rust you see them crumble they have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.029" end="00:13:19.709" style="s2">be torn down and rebuilt over and over</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.370" end="00:13:21.570" style="s2">again so it&#39;s a poor material for that</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.709" end="00:13:24.660" style="s2">purpose so we do something very</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.570" end="00:13:28.770" style="s2">different we apply it&#39;s very small</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.660" end="00:13:31.650" style="s2">trickle charge to the iron the right</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.770" end="00:13:33.990" style="s2">polarity and then that completely</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.650" end="00:13:36.590" style="s2">prevents rusting electrical current</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.990" end="00:13:38.450" style="s2">itself prevents rusting</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.590" end="00:13:40.490" style="s2">so in this case here and then what</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.450" end="00:13:43.490" style="s2">happened something even more amazing not</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.490" end="00:13:45.590" style="s2">only do we prevent rust put a little</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.490" end="00:13:48.080" style="s2">more current in good then we actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.590" end="00:13:50.660" style="s2">grow limestone rock this was the rough</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.080" end="00:13:52.970" style="s2">that corals and snails and clams make</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.660" end="00:13:55.070" style="s2">their shells from it&#39;s a natural</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.970" end="00:13:55.640" style="s2">material it&#39;s all over the earth it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.070" end="00:13:58.220" style="s2">formed</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.640" end="00:13:59.810" style="s2">every almost all of this was formed by</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.220" end="00:14:03.050" style="s2">living organisms and that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.810" end="00:14:06.130" style="s2">living organisms use their biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.050" end="00:14:09.620" style="s2">energy to pull in calcium and carbonate</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.130" end="00:14:12.140" style="s2">they use enzymes concentrate them and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.620" end="00:14:15.260" style="s2">precipitate them in a precise form</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.140" end="00:14:19.130" style="s2">inside of the cell so that evolved over</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.260" end="00:14:21.050" style="s2">billions of years to do that now but it</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.130" end="00:14:23.180" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen naturally but we find</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.050" end="00:14:24.950" style="s2">that when we apply the current we grow</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.180" end="00:14:26.780" style="s2">that rock right out of seawater we</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.950" end="00:14:28.820" style="s2">precipitate it right out of the water</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.780" end="00:14:31.690" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t happen naturally and so the</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.820" end="00:14:34.520" style="s2">piece that you see here is a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.690" end="00:14:39.320" style="s2">reinforcing bar steel bar about the size</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.520" end="00:14:41.240" style="s2">of my finger and that is about a you</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.320" end="00:14:43.340" style="s2">know about two years of growth with</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.240" end="00:14:45.530" style="s2">mercurial of limestone now this is</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.340" end="00:14:47.240" style="s2">limestone of course is something with</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.530" end="00:14:49.490" style="s2">use of building materials from the days</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.240" end="00:14:51.740" style="s2">of the pyramids you know limestone</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.490" end="00:14:54.020" style="s2">doesn&#39;t dissolve yeah but this all very</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.740" end="00:14:57.080" style="s2">slowly sort does dissolve an acid rain</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.020" end="00:14:58.730" style="s2">okay you know you know a lot of the old</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.080" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">Roman monuments for instance are</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.730" end="00:15:03.890" style="s2">dissolving because of acid rain that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:05.570" style="s2">that can be a part but that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.890" end="00:15:08.660" style="s2">happen in the ocean but we can as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.570" end="00:15:11.500" style="s2">result grow limestone over steel in any</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.660" end="00:15:14.030" style="s2">size you shape the material we grow</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.500" end="00:15:17.780" style="s2">depends on how fast we grow it had to</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.030" end="00:15:20.260" style="s2">good very good very slowly less than</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.780" end="00:15:22.820" style="s2">about one to two centimeters a year as</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.260" end="00:15:25.910" style="s2">in this picture that you see in front of</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.820" end="00:15:27.980" style="s2">you we can produce material that&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.910" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">to three times harder than ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.980" end="00:15:33.170" style="s2">concrete okay so it&#39;s a superior</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:35.780" style="s2">material in that sense in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.170" end="00:15:37.220" style="s2">scrape load-bearing strength that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.780" end="00:15:40.370" style="s2">know the amount of weight you put on it</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.220" end="00:15:42.710" style="s2">before it cracks and crumbles um we can</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.370" end="00:15:45.350" style="s2">good also very fast but then we get soft</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.710" end="00:15:46.730" style="s2">material so our goal is to do it slowly</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.350" end="00:15:49.060" style="s2">very slowly</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.730" end="00:15:50.510" style="s2">now when Wolfe Hilbert&#39;s invented this</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.060" end="00:15:52.310" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.510" end="00:15:55.340" style="s2">this method a he called it originally</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.310" end="00:15:58.280" style="s2">mineral accretion that sounds like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.340" end="00:16:00.710" style="s2">stuff you get in your cattle or in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.280" end="00:16:01.940" style="s2">boiler but and he called it also</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.710" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">see-cret</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.940" end="00:16:08.210" style="s2">or cement but I began working with them</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:10.790" style="s2">soon after I heard about his work quite</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.210" end="00:16:13.100" style="s2">by chance but he was asked at building</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.790" end="00:16:15.950" style="s2">things in the ocean and maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.100" end="00:16:20.510" style="s2">grow corals on it and he invented this</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.950" end="00:16:22.850" style="s2">process in 1976 in 1987 I heard about</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.510" end="00:16:24.710" style="s2">him and I asked him to come to Jamaica</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.850" end="00:16:26.660" style="s2">which is my home Island where I come</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.710" end="00:16:27.680" style="s2">from so I asked him to come to Jamaica</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.660" end="00:16:30.170" style="s2">and work with me</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.680" end="00:16:32.540" style="s2">to try to grow corals so all we did is</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.170" end="00:16:36.530" style="s2">he came down to Jamaica we built our</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.540" end="00:16:38.660" style="s2">first structures and I the reefs that I</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.530" end="00:16:40.460" style="s2">worked in in Jamaica I&#39;ve known them</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.660" end="00:16:41.960" style="s2">since I was a very small child and been</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.460" end="00:16:44.210" style="s2">diving all my life from them</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.960" end="00:16:46.640" style="s2">it used to be so beautiful and so full</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.210" end="00:16:48.710" style="s2">of life and now they&#39;re dead and no we</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.640" end="00:16:51.530" style="s2">killed them ourselves we human beings</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.710" end="00:16:53.540" style="s2">and this we killed our roots in Jamaica</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.530" end="00:16:54.980" style="s2">before global warming that&#39;s global</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.540" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">warming is the number one killer pools</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.980" end="00:16:59.660" style="s2">right now but we kill them because we</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:01.790" style="s2">didn&#39;t treat our sewage properly and</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.660" end="00:17:04.310" style="s2">what happened is that weedy algae over</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.790" end="00:17:06.680" style="s2">grew and killed the weeds because we saw</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.310" end="00:17:08.780" style="s2">not only the most sensitive ecosystem of</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.680" end="00:17:10.610" style="s2">all the temperature they&#39;re also most</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.780" end="00:17:12.320" style="s2">sensibly nutrients and sediments but</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.610" end="00:17:14.570" style="s2">every single thing we imagine so</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.320" end="00:17:16.430" style="s2">whenever we developed the coastline and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.570" end="00:17:18.500" style="s2">we dumped our sewage in the water we cut</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.430" end="00:17:21.079" style="s2">down the force and the soil washes into</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.500" end="00:17:23.270" style="s2">the sea and global warming and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.079" end="00:17:25.760" style="s2">putting pathogens into the water that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.270" end="00:17:28.280" style="s2">cause disease all of that wiping out our</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.760" end="00:17:29.960" style="s2">reefs and soul into makeup at the site</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.280" end="00:17:31.100" style="s2">that I worked in we were down to the</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.960" end="00:17:33.950" style="s2">last few calls</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.100" end="00:17:36.020" style="s2">everything was just massive weedy algae</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.950" end="00:17:37.880" style="s2">slugging and killing everything or one</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.020" end="00:17:40.820" style="s2">or two little corals here or there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.880" end="00:17:43.090" style="s2">so I I transplanted some of these corals</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.820" end="00:17:45.020" style="s2">on to some of these structures and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.090" end="00:17:47.120" style="s2">astonishing in three months they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.020" end="00:17:49.730" style="s2">tripled in size and they were growing at</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.120" end="00:17:52.010" style="s2">record rates in a place where the water</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.730" end="00:17:53.990" style="s2">quality was so bad that they were dying</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.010" end="00:17:56.960" style="s2">we got coral settling on these</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.990" end="00:17:58.580" style="s2">structures at very high rates whether in</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.960" end="00:18:00.200" style="s2">an area where there&#39;s no natural colon</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.580" end="00:18:02.240" style="s2">so we realize we had something</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.200" end="00:18:04.160" style="s2">biologically that was very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.240" end="00:18:06.440" style="s2">so let me come back I mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.160" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">a little bit here to the physical</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.440" end="00:18:12.440" style="s2">principles be sure more of this material</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:14.690" style="s2">I called bio rock I invented that term</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.440" end="00:18:16.970" style="s2">because mineral accretion didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.690" end="00:18:21.620" style="s2">have an intuitive meaning to people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.970" end="00:18:25.250" style="s2">sounds like that crud no so bio rock</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.620" end="00:18:27.920" style="s2">gives the idea of a stone that grows</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.250" end="00:18:29.840" style="s2">that&#39;s living and that&#39;s what we do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.920" end="00:18:31.550" style="s2">we&#39;re growing walk out of the sea and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.840" end="00:18:33.890" style="s2">these are a bunch of pieces that you see</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.550" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">here in this picture they&#39;re almost all</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.890" end="00:18:38.540" style="s2">from the Maldives and they took they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:41.390" style="s2">grown over by the one about a two-year</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.540" end="00:18:44.420" style="s2">period in the Maldives with solar panels</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.390" end="00:18:45.800" style="s2">and other left so a little trickle</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.420" end="00:18:47.660" style="s2">current to them which we can provide</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.800" end="00:18:50.630" style="s2">from any source and like that I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.660" end="00:18:52.370" style="s2">mentioned that we use in our project</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.630" end="00:18:55.250" style="s2">solar panels windmills</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.370" end="00:18:59.050" style="s2">reduce tidal energy generate wave energy</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.250" end="00:19:01.340" style="s2">generators but in most cases with us an</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.050" end="00:19:02.150" style="s2">infrastructure to provide electricity to</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.340" end="00:19:04.550" style="s2">shore</p>

<p begin="00:19:09.770" end="00:19:13.040" style="s2">you&#39;d get from batteries otherwise you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.540" end="00:19:15.560" style="s2">have to keep you charging the battery</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.040" end="00:19:18.080" style="s2">constantly you know as it grows down so</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.560" end="00:19:19.910" style="s2">we often use electricity for that but we</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.080" end="00:19:22.100" style="s2">can use any form of electricity and</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.910" end="00:19:25.250" style="s2">obviously since global warming is the</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.100" end="00:19:27.980" style="s2">number one killer of corals we try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.250" end="00:19:30.290" style="s2">use clean sustainable energy renewable</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.980" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">energy whatever that is possible but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.290" end="00:19:34.610" style="s2">isn&#39;t possible every going forward so</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:37.610" style="s2">coming back to the materials I say this</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.610" end="00:19:40.790" style="s2">is rock it&#39;s growing stone it&#39;s rock</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.610" end="00:19:41.960" style="s2">hard the piece you see in the upper left</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.790" end="00:19:45.020" style="s2">here and I don&#39;t know if you see my</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.960" end="00:19:46.850" style="s2">arrow here on the screen that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.020" end="00:19:49.430" style="s2">the first pieces that wolf Hilbert&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.850" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">grew in Louisiana near the mouth the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.430" end="00:19:54.140" style="s2">Mississippi River but in the Gulf of</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:19:54.980" style="s2">Mexico was about half seawater and half</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.140" end="00:19:58.970" style="s2">freshwater</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.980" end="00:20:02.600" style="s2">our process is based on the conductivity</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.970" end="00:20:04.670" style="s2">of the water replying a small voltage so</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.600" end="00:20:06.830" style="s2">they obviously flows through the water</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.670" end="00:20:09.230" style="s2">and how much flows depends on how</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.830" end="00:20:11.630" style="s2">conductive it is and how conductive it</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.230" end="00:20:13.460" style="s2">is as function how salty this saltier it</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.630" end="00:20:15.110" style="s2">is the more conductive it is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.460" end="00:20:17.720" style="s2">Mediterranean is saltier than the</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.110" end="00:20:19.220" style="s2">Atlantic Ocean so you would get</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.720" end="00:20:20.810" style="s2">current to the same voltage in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.220" end="00:20:23.270" style="s2">Mediterranean than you would in a place</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.810" end="00:20:25.550" style="s2">like Louisiana which is half freshwater</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.270" end="00:20:26.930" style="s2">so it doesn&#39;t work in freshwater this is</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.550" end="00:20:29.000" style="s2">not conductive but it works in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.930" end="00:20:31.250" style="s2">intermediate so well this piece here in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.000" end="00:20:35.150" style="s2">the upper left was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.250" end="00:20:37.760" style="s2">structures wolf built and when he came</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.150" end="00:20:39.980" style="s2">back three months later his PC cut out</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.760" end="00:20:42.290" style="s2">was completely covered with oysters that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.980" end="00:20:44.870" style="s2">had grown to adult size and three months</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.290" end="00:20:47.330" style="s2">it was astonishing so we realized there</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.870" end="00:20:50.000" style="s2">was something there and we began then to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.330" end="00:20:51.740" style="s2">- you know when wolf started working</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.000" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2">with me in Jamaica we began applying it</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.740" end="00:20:56.150" style="s2">to growing organisms what we found was</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.050" end="00:20:59.180" style="s2">as we could grow essentially all marine</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.150" end="00:21:01.070" style="s2">organisms again at record rates we found</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.180" end="00:21:02.810" style="s2">I&#39;ll show you some pictures of that a</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.070" end="00:21:05.450" style="s2">little later but let me first stick to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.810" end="00:21:07.670" style="s2">the properties of the material this is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.450" end="00:21:09.530" style="s2">piece of proving them all B&#39;s we look</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.670" end="00:21:11.720" style="s2">we&#39;ve cut it out but you see the steel</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.530" end="00:21:14.770" style="s2">bars inside there&#39;s no rust on them the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.720" end="00:21:19.430" style="s2">completely protected this massive of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.770" end="00:21:20.930" style="s2">rock around them besides being the only</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.430" end="00:21:23.530" style="s2">marine construction macule that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.930" end="00:21:26.690" style="s2">growing and getting stronger with age</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.530" end="00:21:28.250" style="s2">like a real coral reef it also is the</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.690" end="00:21:31.190" style="s2">only marine construction material that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.250" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">repairs itself here is a sum for a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.190" end="00:21:35.690" style="s2">series of photographs of a structure</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:38.450" style="s2">that we built in Bali it was hit bad</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.690" end="00:21:40.700" style="s2">boat a boat smashed into it it cracked</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.450" end="00:21:43.460" style="s2">off the limestone on the outside and</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.700" end="00:21:45.080" style="s2">exposed steel frames and those steel</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.460" end="00:21:47.060" style="s2">frames had been the ocean for 11 years</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.080" end="00:21:49.400" style="s2">and I give you a close that had no rust</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.060" end="00:21:52.420" style="s2">some time series I&#39;ll give you some</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.400" end="00:21:55.100" style="s2">close-ups here this is a after a year</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.420" end="00:21:59.180" style="s2">the initial one okay well at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.100" end="00:22:01.190" style="s2">beginning should be in this series I</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.180" end="00:22:03.260" style="s2">don&#39;t I yes okay this is right after the</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.190" end="00:22:05.480" style="s2">boat hit it and you can see the steel</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.260" end="00:22:08.180" style="s2">bar was bent by the impact but it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.480" end="00:22:13.310" style="s2">rust on it in the ocean for 11 years a</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.180" end="00:22:15.500" style="s2">year later that that looks that grew</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.310" end="00:22:17.570" style="s2">back I mean that this is the area bare</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.500" end="00:22:19.340" style="s2">steel but you see your new limestone</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.570" end="00:22:21.290" style="s2">grew on it so these structures actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.340" end="00:22:23.090" style="s2">are able to repair themselves and their</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.290" end="00:22:25.010" style="s2">damage so they&#39;re really unique that</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.090" end="00:22:27.230" style="s2">completely different than any other moon</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.010" end="00:22:29.390" style="s2">construction material but you have to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.230" end="00:22:31.610" style="s2">think long term because going slowly</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.390" end="00:22:33.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not like a car</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.610" end="00:22:35.870" style="s2">we will building that you can pour this</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.890" end="00:22:37.760" style="s2">thickness of concrete you know just pour</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.870" end="00:22:39.110" style="s2">it and just wait for the set and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.760" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">have a building you know a few days</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.110" end="00:22:43.640" style="s2">later when it&#39;s dry in our case we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:45.890" style="s2">to grow it slowing it this way per year</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.640" end="00:22:48.290" style="s2">and so to build something this big my</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.890" end="00:22:49.730" style="s2">cake in Kenya Chris for 20 years and all</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.290" end="00:22:52.130" style="s2">obviously people don&#39;t have the patience</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.730" end="00:22:54.230" style="s2">that so the Wolf&#39;s idea as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.130" end="00:22:56.330" style="s2">construction material is valid but it</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.230" end="00:22:58.850" style="s2">didn&#39;t balance to slow people weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.330" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">interested the fact is that in almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.850" end="00:23:04.580" style="s2">any place that&#39;s on the coast we can</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">produce superior building material we</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.580" end="00:23:09.110" style="s2">believe for less cost and a concrete</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:11.419" style="s2">material would cost if you have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.110" end="00:23:13.610" style="s2">import the cement Portland cement from</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.419" end="00:23:15.110" style="s2">someplace else so in fact it is a good</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.610" end="00:23:17.630" style="s2">building material who&#39;s not been</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.110" end="00:23:19.580" style="s2">exploited and in a place like Majorca</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.630" end="00:23:21.500" style="s2">for instance if you don&#39;t make your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.580" end="00:23:23.900" style="s2">cement and you looked important in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.500" end="00:23:26.360" style="s2">mainland our material would probably be</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:28.400" style="s2">cheap so it has unique properties but</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.360" end="00:23:31.220" style="s2">the fundamental thing that amazes us is</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.400" end="00:23:33.320" style="s2">all these corals and things that grow</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.220" end="00:23:35.660" style="s2">all over some of these little pieces we</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.320" end="00:23:37.820" style="s2">put on but in most cases they&#39;re ones</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.660" end="00:23:39.890" style="s2">that spontaneously that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.820" end="00:23:43.130" style="s2">you right after growth that&#39;s the bare</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.890" end="00:23:46.100" style="s2">steel and then a year later you know so</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.130" end="00:23:49.370" style="s2">it has pretty amazing properties I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.100" end="00:23:52.970" style="s2">to hold on let me move through this a</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.370" end="00:23:54.710" style="s2">little bit yes okay I&#39;m going to go back</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.970" end="00:23:58.429" style="s2">to the slide sorter I&#39;m going to jump</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.710" end="00:24:01.160" style="s2">here what we found was very briefly so</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.429" end="00:24:04.429" style="s2">I&#39;ve used slide sorter we found very</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.160" end="00:24:07.460" style="s2">briefly was that all forms of marine</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.429" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">life are attracted to electrical and</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.460" end="00:24:11.600" style="s2">this is something because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:13.460" style="s2">fundamental basis of all life is</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.600" end="00:24:15.650" style="s2">electricity people don&#39;t realize that</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.460" end="00:24:19.580" style="s2">every cell of every living organism</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.650" end="00:24:22.070" style="s2">through the lowest bacteria up make</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.580" end="00:24:25.640" style="s2">their biochemical energy from about a</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.070" end="00:24:27.590" style="s2">1/10 of a volt potential difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.640" end="00:24:30.230" style="s2">between the outside of the cell me</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.590" end="00:24:31.970" style="s2">inside and that means that electrical</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.230" end="00:24:36.230" style="s2">current flows through the membrane of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.970" end="00:24:38.540" style="s2">the cell and bike was involved enzymes</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.230" end="00:24:40.280" style="s2">that are able to trap that electrical</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.540" end="00:24:43.070" style="s2">current and turn it into biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.280" end="00:24:45.170" style="s2">energy but every form of life uses the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.070" end="00:24:47.090" style="s2">same mechanism goes back to what</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.170" end="00:24:49.480" style="s2">course the last common Universal</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.090" end="00:24:52.430" style="s2">ancestor billions of years ago the</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.480" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">identical mechanism so eltra c is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.430" end="00:24:58.540" style="s2">basis of life and we basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:25:01.730" style="s2">discovered as a way to increase</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.540" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">electrical field within the range that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.730" end="00:25:06.380" style="s2">stimulates organisms okay so if you add</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:08.150" style="s2">you know to have no currently at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.380" end="00:25:11.180" style="s2">kind in fact they grow faster of course</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.150" end="00:25:13.700" style="s2">at some point it&#39;s too bad you start to</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.180" end="00:25:15.650" style="s2">get negative effects so in the very low</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.700" end="00:25:18.110" style="s2">range that their natural electrical</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.650" end="00:25:20.180" style="s2">fields in fact workable founder&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.110" end="00:25:22.040" style="s2">really that there are natural electrical</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.180" end="00:25:24.410" style="s2">fields due to the magnetic field of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.040" end="00:25:26.390" style="s2">earth and the fact that the ocean is an</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.410" end="00:25:28.190" style="s2">electrical conductor and when an</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.390" end="00:25:30.410" style="s2">electrical conductor moves with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.190" end="00:25:32.560" style="s2">waves through a magnetic field sets up a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.410" end="00:25:35.420" style="s2">current and organisms have evolved to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.560" end="00:25:37.700" style="s2">utilize that current we were stimulating</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.420" end="00:25:40.790" style="s2">that now normally what an organism has</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.700" end="00:25:43.240" style="s2">to do is to spend half in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.790" end="00:25:45.950" style="s2">more that bow chemical energy</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.240" end="00:25:48.050" style="s2">maintaining the voltage gradient the</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.950" end="00:25:49.940" style="s2">voltage gradient collapses the organism</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.050" end="00:25:51.890" style="s2">dives it doesn&#39;t matter the seagrass or</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.940" end="00:25:54.980" style="s2">a human being or a bacteria same</p>

<p begin="00:26:15.050" end="00:26:20.990" style="s2">marine life we get higher settlement and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.250" end="00:26:22.610" style="s2">actually attracted to the electrical</p>

<p begin="00:26:32.690" end="00:26:37.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have to put them on the second</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.910" end="00:26:38.900" style="s2">thing is that they grow faster it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.460" end="00:26:40.550" style="s2">depends on how much current they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.900" end="00:26:42.110" style="s2">getting because i mentioned more current</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.550" end="00:26:45.530" style="s2">more growth and then at some point you</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.110" end="00:26:48.950" style="s2">to high so there&#39;s a broad range in</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.530" end="00:26:50.300" style="s2">which they increase the growth rate and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.950" end="00:26:52.430" style="s2">we see that with everything that would</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.300" end="00:26:53.900" style="s2">look measured we&#39;ve measured with corals</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.430" end="00:26:57.050" style="s2">with oysters</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.900" end="00:26:58.340" style="s2">many different species not all of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.050" end="00:26:59.120" style="s2">because you don&#39;t have the time or the</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.120" end="00:27:03.260" style="s2">but everything we&#39;ve looked at grows</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.980" end="00:27:05.950" style="s2">faster addition we get much higher</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.260" end="00:27:08.150" style="s2">survival and we get much higher</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.150" end="00:27:12.440" style="s2">stresses and for example with corals I</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.400" end="00:27:18.830" style="s2">high temperatures cause coral bleaching</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.020" end="00:27:20.720" style="s2">and coral death and on corals are on bio</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.830" end="00:27:22.460" style="s2">Rock we&#39;ve survived bleaching when</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.720" end="00:27:24.500" style="s2">everything around them dies it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.460" end="00:27:26.990" style="s2">something that they have more metabolic</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.500" end="00:27:29.990" style="s2">energy so they have more energy for</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.990" end="00:27:32.000" style="s2">growth for resisting stress possibly for</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.990" end="00:27:35.330" style="s2">reproduction but we don&#39;t know so it may</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:38.090" style="s2">be the point is is the because of these</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.330" end="00:27:40.820" style="s2">advantages we&#39;re able to keep whole</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.090" end="00:27:43.610" style="s2">ecosystems alive when they would die</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.820" end="00:27:46.760" style="s2">because severe temperatures events</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.610" end="00:27:48.290" style="s2">severe stresses you know as we know are</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.760" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">getting worse and worse with global</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.290" end="00:27:51.920" style="s2">climate change so we&#39;re able to keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:53.690" style="s2">whole ecosystems alive when they would</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.920" end="00:27:55.940" style="s2">die I&#39;ll show you some examples related</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.690" end="00:27:58.100" style="s2">to seagrass in a minute but freeze with</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.940" end="00:28:02.630" style="s2">corals we have we the only people keep</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.100" end="00:28:04.520" style="s2">coral to live completion events so um in</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.630" end="00:28:06.920" style="s2">addition because we&#39;re increasing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.520" end="00:28:09.550" style="s2">growth rate and the settlement rate of</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.920" end="00:28:12.640" style="s2">organisms so much we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.550" end="00:28:16.850" style="s2">regenerate whole marine ecosystems and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.640" end="00:28:18.590" style="s2">biodiversity at record rates even in</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.850" end="00:28:20.870" style="s2">places where there&#39;s no natural recovery</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.590" end="00:28:22.850" style="s2">so places where all the reefs and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.870" end="00:28:26.180" style="s2">seagrass is dead we can grow them back</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.850" end="00:28:28.430" style="s2">and so it&#39;s really remarkable properties</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.180" end="00:28:30.890" style="s2">and they ate as far as we can see they</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.430" end="00:28:32.990" style="s2">apply to all marine ecosystems so in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.890" end="00:28:35.180" style="s2">warm waters we grow coral reefs and cold</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.990" end="00:28:37.640" style="s2">waters we grow easterlies we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.180" end="00:28:39.500" style="s2">sea grasses anyplace in salt marshes and</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.640" end="00:28:42.230" style="s2">mangroves and that that&#39;s what we want</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.500" end="00:28:44.360" style="s2">to focus on here because obviously there</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.230" end="00:28:46.520" style="s2">are corals around Majorca and the two</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.360" end="00:28:49.220" style="s2">species of corals that occur in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.520" end="00:28:50.600" style="s2">Mediterranean that are they don&#39;t build</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.220" end="00:28:52.970" style="s2">wheat because they&#39;re mostly little</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.600" end="00:28:55.310" style="s2">small ones isolated but we can grow</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.970" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">those too but in my York of course the</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.310" end="00:29:00.890" style="s2">key interests of seagrass beds and there</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:03.350" style="s2">were spectacular seagrass beds all</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.890" end="00:29:07.600" style="s2">around my York and as in many places</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.350" end="00:29:10.160" style="s2">there they&#39;re going back now sea grasses</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.600" end="00:29:13.100" style="s2">destroyed about half the sea grasses in</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.160" end="00:29:15.409" style="s2">the world it been dug up but</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.100" end="00:29:17.269" style="s2">part of it is physical damage in a court</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.409" end="00:29:20.029" style="s2">development and dredging and all that</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.269" end="00:29:23.179" style="s2">but the main thing access is to curating</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.029" end="00:29:25.490" style="s2">water quality seagrasses they need</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.179" end="00:29:28.789" style="s2">shallow water with nutrients and light</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.490" end="00:29:30.019" style="s2">now the nutrients get too high same</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.789" end="00:29:33.080" style="s2">thing happens to them as happens with</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.019" end="00:29:35.299" style="s2">coral reefs weedy algae take over over</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.080" end="00:29:37.970" style="s2">Google and kill them if the water gets</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.299" end="00:29:40.610" style="s2">too muddy they get smothered they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.970" end="00:29:42.919" style="s2">have light it can&#39;t grow so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.610" end="00:29:44.450" style="s2">seeing in coastal development areas all</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.919" end="00:29:47.210" style="s2">around the world it&#39;s a water quality</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.450" end="00:29:48.980" style="s2">superior rating and the sea grasses are</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.210" end="00:29:51.289" style="s2">dying even where we&#39;re not deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.980" end="00:29:52.820" style="s2">destroying them but in many places we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.289" end="00:29:55.940" style="s2">deliberately destroyed them for instance</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.820" end="00:29:58.460" style="s2">I mean one example is in front of hotels</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.940" end="00:29:59.929" style="s2">in the tropics</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.460" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">you have a beautiful beach you have</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.929" end="00:31:11.450" style="s2">is a beautiful ecosystem things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.230" end="00:31:14.179" style="s2">almost all species of sea grasses</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.450" end="00:31:17.450" style="s2">require sediment because what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.179" end="00:31:19.610" style="s2">that the it&#39;s a flowering plant and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.450" end="00:31:21.889" style="s2">not actually true dress but it behaves</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.610" end="00:31:24.620" style="s2">like a grass it has underground runners</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.889" end="00:31:26.040" style="s2">so knows that the leaves are sticking</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.620" end="00:31:28.890" style="s2">vertically up but</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.040" end="00:31:31.530" style="s2">roots are growing through the sediment</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.890" end="00:31:33.780" style="s2">and pretty much all sea grasses require</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.530" end="00:31:36.120" style="s2">about five or ten centimeters or so of</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.780" end="00:31:39.090" style="s2">sediments for the roots to proliferate</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.120" end="00:31:41.430" style="s2">so without that sand or mud or something</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.090" end="00:31:43.140" style="s2">else there they&#39;re unable to spread and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.430" end="00:31:46.940" style="s2">in your case you know you have large</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.940" end="00:31:51.960" style="s2">allows what you say a clone its allows</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.770" end="00:31:54.060" style="s2">one single lucky call it could spread</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.960" end="00:31:55.980" style="s2">over huge areas so goodbye the roots</p>

<p begin="00:32:01.650" end="00:32:07.350" style="s2">events like hurricanes or like like</p>

<p begin="00:32:23.550" end="00:32:27.780" style="s2">Gloria we don&#39;t seem to have any</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.770" end="00:32:29.340" style="s2">information yet mapping what damage</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.780" end="00:32:31.350" style="s2">occurred but definitely under those</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.340" end="00:32:33.810" style="s2">conditions you do lose a lot of seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.350" end="00:32:35.940" style="s2">in the long run it&#39;s deteriorating water</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.810" end="00:32:38.340" style="s2">quality around ports and I imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.940" end="00:32:40.650" style="s2">you see increase in port areas first</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.340" end="00:32:43.290" style="s2">although there&#39;s a counterbalance and</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.650" end="00:32:45.030" style="s2">that is that sea grasses need nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.290" end="00:32:46.920" style="s2">and if the nutrients are low and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.030" end="00:32:50.640" style="s2">sewage coming in the sea grass will grow</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.920" end="00:32:53.220" style="s2">faster until the weeds take over so you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.640" end="00:32:56.100" style="s2">do in fact see faster growth of seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.220" end="00:32:57.990" style="s2">around villages and small remote islands</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.100" end="00:33:01.350" style="s2">and in clean areas because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.990" end="00:33:03.840" style="s2">living off the nutrients so synchronises</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.350" end="00:33:05.910" style="s2">are a very important ecosystem and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.840" end="00:33:07.740" style="s2">wiping them out now there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.910" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">point about sea grasses I mean sea</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.740" end="00:33:13.430" style="s2">grasses stabilize the sediment because</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:15.570" style="s2">of the roots they create a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.430" end="00:33:19.530" style="s2">ecosystem that&#39;s essentially a nursery</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.570" end="00:33:21.390" style="s2">ground for baby fish baby lobsters and</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.530" end="00:33:24.090" style="s2">other marine organisms and a little</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.390" end="00:33:25.530" style="s2">things are hiding between the blades so</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.090" end="00:33:28.380" style="s2">that they don&#39;t get eaten by the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.530" end="00:33:32.130" style="s2">fish and so they&#39;re an essential nursery</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.380" end="00:33:33.630" style="s2">ground for many marine ecosystems that</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.130" end="00:33:37.280" style="s2">then when they get bigger they move into</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.630" end="00:33:39.480" style="s2">other habitats so they&#39;re very important</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.280" end="00:33:41.070" style="s2">so there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.480" end="00:33:44.130" style="s2">reasons to reject there&#39;s another reason</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.070" end="00:33:48.360" style="s2">- and that is that seagrasses along with</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.130" end="00:33:51.750" style="s2">salt marshes and mangroves create a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.360" end="00:33:53.520" style="s2">marine soil and B grow the carbon that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.750" end="00:33:55.560" style="s2">they produce and the roots when that</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.520" end="00:33:58.740" style="s2">deteriorates and builds up organic</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.560" end="00:34:01.680" style="s2">carbon in the sediment and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.740" end="00:34:04.740" style="s2">major sink of carbon globally as a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.680" end="00:34:07.470" style="s2">matter of fact as I mentioned there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.740" end="00:34:09.300" style="s2">about perhaps 10 times more carbon in</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.470" end="00:34:12.510" style="s2">the soil when there is in the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.300" end="00:34:14.310" style="s2">or in the biomass numbers are little</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.510" end="00:34:16.260" style="s2">uncertain some people use lower numbers</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.310" end="00:34:18.630" style="s2">but I think the higher numbers are more</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.260" end="00:34:22.080" style="s2">accurate every five to ten times more</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.630" end="00:34:25.460" style="s2">you can argue about that but half of all</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.080" end="00:34:28.050" style="s2">that&#39;s carbon soil is in wetlands</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.460" end="00:34:31.290" style="s2">marshes from swamps and all that and</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.050" end="00:34:33.690" style="s2">half of that is in marine wetlands sea</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.290" end="00:34:35.730" style="s2">grasses salt marshes mangroves that</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.690" end="00:34:38.250" style="s2">occupy less than one percent of your</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.730" end="00:34:41.880" style="s2">service but they&#39;re holding a quarter of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.250" end="00:34:44.520" style="s2">the soil carbon so if we would generate</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.880" end="00:34:46.770" style="s2">these ecosystems there are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.520" end="00:34:48.930" style="s2">the most cost-effective carbon sinks so</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.770" end="00:34:50.970" style="s2">we can imagine because you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.930" end="00:34:52.860" style="s2">be able to bury the most carbon the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.970" end="00:34:53.940" style="s2">smallest here you could please cross so</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.860" end="00:34:55.860" style="s2">that&#39;s another reason that would</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.940" end="00:34:58.230" style="s2">generate sea glass yeah could you ask</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.860" end="00:35:01.440" style="s2">you to last time we talked to you in</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.230" end="00:35:03.630" style="s2">pointed out that in the initial growth</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.440" end="00:35:07.010" style="s2">when the blade grows it actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.630" end="00:35:09.720" style="s2">releases co2 in the process that</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.010" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">carbonate that is precipitated out</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.720" end="00:35:15.210" style="s2">around the blade that the white flaky</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.000" end="00:35:18.690" style="s2">bits don&#39;t actually create a net carbon</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.210" end="00:35:20.640" style="s2">sink that it is only the biological</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.690" end="00:35:24.000" style="s2">material in the marine soils together</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.640" end="00:35:27.390" style="s2">the organic carbon that&#39;s buried in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.000" end="00:35:29.250" style="s2">soil is not decomposed so basically when</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.390" end="00:35:32.010" style="s2">it when the sea grass grows it&#39;s pulling</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.250" end="00:35:34.860" style="s2">co2 in it&#39;s making organic matter if</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.010" end="00:35:37.140" style="s2">that organic matter gets eaten or rocks</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.860" end="00:35:39.390" style="s2">or decomposed turns back to co2 in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.140" end="00:35:41.660" style="s2">atmosphere so it&#39;s only when they have</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.390" end="00:35:44.940" style="s2">to get buried where it can&#39;t decompose</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.660" end="00:35:48.330" style="s2">and sea grasses and salt marshes and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.940" end="00:35:51.630" style="s2">mangroves they build up organic carbon</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.330" end="00:35:53.100" style="s2">some cases and the highest most</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.630" end="00:35:55.320" style="s2">concentrated organic</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.100" end="00:35:57.120" style="s2">Cardon of any soils in the world it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.320" end="00:35:59.700" style="s2">really can build it up and it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.120" end="00:36:01.170" style="s2">helps preserve it so that&#39;s the roots</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.700" end="00:36:02.970" style="s2">and all that sort of thing but now that</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.170" end="00:36:04.860" style="s2">the limestone itself is a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.970" end="00:36:07.740" style="s2">different but people don&#39;t understand is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.860" end="00:36:10.230" style="s2">when when you make limestone the see</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.740" end="00:36:12.000" style="s2">you&#39;re using what&#39;s called bicarbonate</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.230" end="00:36:14.130" style="s2">that&#39;s a dissolved form and for every</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.950" style="s2">atom of bicarbonate that you make into</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.130" end="00:36:19.620" style="s2">calcium carbonate can precipitate out in</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.950" end="00:36:22.200" style="s2">order to maintain the charge balance</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.620" end="00:36:25.290" style="s2">that&#39;s a physical law you can&#39;t violate</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.200" end="00:36:28.710" style="s2">that balance of charge like conservation</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.290" end="00:36:30.300" style="s2">of energy and to maintain the pH because</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.710" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">the oceans are buffered system what</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.300" end="00:36:34.140" style="s2">happens for each molecule of carbon that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:36.900" style="s2">you take out of the ocean put into</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.140" end="00:36:39.690" style="s2">limestone you released one molecule co2</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.900" end="00:36:42.450" style="s2">so in fact limestone deposition is a one</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.690" end="00:36:43.980" style="s2">of the geological sources of co2 almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.450" end="00:36:45.990" style="s2">everyone gets that back what they think</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.980" end="00:36:48.420" style="s2">more reefs you have the more co2 you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.990" end="00:36:50.520" style="s2">removing in fact it&#39;s adding but to put</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.420" end="00:36:52.680" style="s2">that into perspective and all the reefs</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.520" end="00:36:56.670" style="s2">in the world are releasing something</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.680" end="00:36:59.250" style="s2">like less than 1% of what we&#39;re putting</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.670" end="00:37:01.590" style="s2">in from fossil fuel emmissions so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.250" end="00:37:04.380" style="s2">natural sources long-term source of co2</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.590" end="00:37:07.800" style="s2">are limestone deep position outgassing</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.380" end="00:37:11.070" style="s2">of co2 from volcanoes now the sink is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.800" end="00:37:13.800" style="s2">where that co2 then dissolves and</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.070" end="00:37:16.380" style="s2">rainwater falls on the land dissolves</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.800" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">limestone then that co2 gets convert</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.380" end="00:37:20.540" style="s2">into bicarbonate and goes into the ocean</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:23.610" style="s2">so actually that&#39;s that&#39;s a sink is</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.540" end="00:37:25.530" style="s2">limestone dissolution is actually carbon</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.610" end="00:37:27.510" style="s2">sink limestone B position as a source</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.530" end="00:37:30.030" style="s2">but it&#39;s small on a global scale</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.510" end="00:37:32.280" style="s2">the real sink is bearing carbon now the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.030" end="00:37:34.980" style="s2">problem is that the ocean is a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.280" end="00:37:37.680" style="s2">efficient ecosystem of carbons produces</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.980" end="00:37:40.500" style="s2">essentially all even composed it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.680" end="00:37:42.810" style="s2">build up because it&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.500" end="00:37:45.060" style="s2">efficient I mean the phytoplankton which</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.810" end="00:37:48.030" style="s2">are the most productive they live a day</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.060" end="00:37:49.890" style="s2">or two before they go back into co2 so</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.030" end="00:37:52.680" style="s2">it&#39;s the oceans very inefficient of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.890" end="00:37:56.270" style="s2">storing except in marine wetlands marine</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.680" end="00:37:58.950" style="s2">wetlands seagrass and salt marshes etc</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.270" end="00:38:01.320" style="s2">mangroves are storing about half of</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.950" end="00:38:03.510" style="s2">burying about half of all the carbon in</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.320" end="00:38:06.140" style="s2">the ocean even though they all could</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.510" end="00:38:08.000" style="s2">time much less than 1% of the area</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.140" end="00:38:10.730" style="s2">in the deep ocean none of that carbon</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.000" end="00:38:13.369" style="s2">survived at all decomposing goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.730" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">co2 unless you turn the ocean go dead</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.369" end="00:38:18.140" style="s2">zone that&#39;s the only way to make the</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:20.089" style="s2">ocean as a whole or carbon sink but</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.140" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">wetlands we can restore and store carbon</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.089" end="00:38:24.049" style="s2">very easily we&#39;re going to have to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:26.420" style="s2">that on a large scale the technology</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.049" end="00:38:28.579" style="s2">we&#39;ve developed because the Bhairav</p>

<p begin="00:38:28.579" end="00:38:34.010" style="s2">of seagrass salt marsh and mangroves</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.980" end="00:38:36.260" style="s2">then we can accelerate that and I want</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.010" end="00:38:37.579" style="s2">to show you really briefly what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.260" end="00:38:40.609" style="s2">done I mean this is all we&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:38:40.609" end="00:38:44.510" style="s2">actually used a fair bit of time so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.170" end="00:38:49.099" style="s2">let&#39;s move on to what we do with sea</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.510" end="00:38:50.779" style="s2">grasses in salt marshes now so let me</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.670" end="00:39:03.740" style="s2">water they grew and said them the salt</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.859" end="00:39:06.260" style="s2">marshes are similar types of you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.740" end="00:39:08.950" style="s2">grass sea organisms and grasses in bed</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.260" end="00:39:11.869" style="s2">in the real sense but they grow in</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.950" end="00:39:14.029" style="s2">intertidal areas so they&#39;re exposed to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.869" end="00:39:16.099" style="s2">air some of the times and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.029" end="00:39:20.390" style="s2">underwater part of the time so they have</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.099" end="00:39:22.400" style="s2">to have that exposure and you know being</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.390" end="00:39:23.990" style="s2">underwater like that they&#39;re central to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.400" end="00:39:26.569" style="s2">life Manuel&#39;s only growing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.990" end="00:39:28.970" style="s2">intertidal salt marsh grasses only</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.569" end="00:39:32.089" style="s2">growing the intertidal so they form huge</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.970" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">swamps there are also huge carbon sinks</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.089" end="00:39:35.480" style="s2">so they&#39;re very similar to seagrass yes</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:39.200" style="s2">just briefly let you know that there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.480" end="00:39:40.819" style="s2">the salt marsh on Majorca but it&#39;s dying</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.200" end="00:39:43.009" style="s2">Isamu Farah in the north of the island</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.819" end="00:39:45.019" style="s2">because it happens to be in the area</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.009" end="00:39:47.750" style="s2">where there&#39;s also very intensive potato</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.019" end="00:39:49.910" style="s2">farming and basically it&#39;s dying because</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.750" end="00:39:54.490" style="s2">there&#39;s so many nitrates coming in from</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.910" end="00:39:56.900" style="s2">yes what we&#39;d like to look at that so</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.490" end="00:39:58.849" style="s2">I&#39;ll work here I&#39;m going to show you a</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.900" end="00:40:01.430" style="s2">little bit of old um salt marshes and</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.849" end="00:40:04.190" style="s2">sea grasses so let me begin with sea</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.430" end="00:40:06.710" style="s2">grasses and I want to show you hold on</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.190" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">one second it&#39;s a seagrass section in</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.710" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">this presentation yes here so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.289" end="00:40:19.059" style="s2">is posted only oceanic a-- the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.019" end="00:40:22.630" style="s2">species that you have in Majorca and</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.059" end="00:40:25.479" style="s2">this is in new Puglia and southern italy</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.630" end="00:40:27.249" style="s2">it&#39;s an experiment that we did I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.479" end="00:40:30.249" style="s2">working with Raphael a back that Ella</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.249" end="00:40:33.130" style="s2">who is he was the scientist for the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.249" end="00:40:35.979" style="s2">provincia di body in Puglia in southern</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.130" end="00:40:38.439" style="s2">Italy and what we did in this case here</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.979" end="00:40:39.849" style="s2">is that the pasta Don is disappearing</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.439" end="00:40:43.269" style="s2">the Erika&#39;s like it is a mostly</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.849" end="00:40:45.630" style="s2">Mediterranean variety of causes and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.269" end="00:40:48.189" style="s2">we did here as we did the first pair up</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.630" end="00:40:50.799" style="s2">Posidonia experiment or seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.189" end="00:40:52.509" style="s2">experiment deliberate one and here we</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.799" end="00:40:55.589" style="s2">did it as you see a diver in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.509" end="00:40:57.969" style="s2">picture and there two patches here of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.589" end="00:41:00.069" style="s2">Macedonian growing what we&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.969" end="00:41:02.799" style="s2">these are patches that are you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.069" end="00:41:05.019" style="s2">maybe half a meter a quarter square</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.799" end="00:41:07.329" style="s2">meter in size I forget the exact shape</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.019" end="00:41:09.369" style="s2">then we took you can see them it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.329" end="00:41:11.739" style="s2">mesh down here on the bottom so this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.369" end="00:41:14.799" style="s2">a square mesh about you know centimeter</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.739" end="00:41:17.410" style="s2">size spacing or so we put on the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.799" end="00:41:18.999" style="s2">we applied an electrical charge and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.410" end="00:41:20.979" style="s2">see where the arrow is here at the</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.999" end="00:41:23.079" style="s2">bottom they&#39;re white that&#39;s white</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.979" end="00:41:25.239" style="s2">because the limestone is precipitating</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.079" end="00:41:27.880" style="s2">out on the meshes it meshes flat on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.239" end="00:41:31.209" style="s2">bottom we did in these two places you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.880" end="00:41:33.849" style="s2">could put a few spartina roots and</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.209" end="00:41:35.499" style="s2">shoots into them that&#39;s a easy to</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.849" end="00:41:38.019" style="s2">transplant you can dig them up and</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.499" end="00:41:39.999" style="s2">Transplant now in fact let me we say</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.019" end="00:41:42.969" style="s2">something about that you people have</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.999" end="00:41:45.099" style="s2">been actively transplanting seagrass and</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.969" end="00:41:46.719" style="s2">salt marsh and mangrove they&#39;re easy to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.099" end="00:41:48.929" style="s2">plot you know you dig them out one place</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.719" end="00:41:50.979" style="s2">you stick them in someplace else and</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.929" end="00:41:53.199" style="s2">people have been doing that on a large</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.979" end="00:41:55.689" style="s2">scale because all these ecosystems are</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.199" end="00:41:58.029" style="s2">disappearing the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.689" end="00:42:00.789" style="s2">almost all these restoration efforts</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.029" end="00:42:03.339" style="s2">have failed and the reason they fail is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.789" end="00:42:06.130" style="s2">because heavy waves wash them away</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.339" end="00:42:08.890" style="s2">before the roots can grow and be sorely</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.130" end="00:42:10.900" style="s2">attached so I mean people make very big</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.890" end="00:42:12.969" style="s2">clinto we planted a million sea grass</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.900" end="00:42:15.269" style="s2">plants but you grow back here too late</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.969" end="00:42:17.979" style="s2">are you lucky to find any surviving and</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.269" end="00:42:20.469" style="s2">the other the other aspect is that if</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.979" end="00:42:22.390" style="s2">you don&#39;t do what you&#39;re doing is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.469" end="00:42:25.659" style="s2">find a way to increase the growth rate</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.390" end="00:42:27.040" style="s2">then taking away from a healthy seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.659" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">meadow somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.040" end="00:42:30.930" style="s2">the things you plan somewhere else</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:33.490" style="s2">you&#39;ve actually done damage over there</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.930" end="00:42:35.140" style="s2">the balance isn&#39;t actually that positive</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.490" end="00:42:37.120" style="s2">that&#39;s correct you have to do better</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.140" end="00:42:39.100" style="s2">than the original site so in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.120" end="00:42:42.160" style="s2">particular case as you see here here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.100" end="00:42:44.110" style="s2">diver and what we did is this structures</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.160" end="00:42:46.000" style="s2">of power these little meshes that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.110" end="00:42:48.160" style="s2">very small I said we can do it any size</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.000" end="00:42:50.620" style="s2">or shape and obviously we&#39;d like to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.160" end="00:42:52.600" style="s2">whole you know tens of square kilometers</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.620" end="00:42:55.990" style="s2">but we&#39;re beginning on a little pilot</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.600" end="00:42:59.620" style="s2">scale and this this project was powered</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.990" end="00:43:02.440" style="s2">by a solar panel on land about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.620" end="00:43:04.720" style="s2">meters away and a little trickle charge</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.440" end="00:43:06.100" style="s2">went into these structures we only did</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.720" end="00:43:08.110" style="s2">this experience for three months but</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.100" end="00:43:12.460" style="s2">what&#39;s important are two things first of</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.110" end="00:43:14.080" style="s2">all the controls we had other pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.460" end="00:43:16.570" style="s2">mesh you weren&#39;t getting out just and we</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.080" end="00:43:19.420" style="s2">planted seagrass under they all died</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.570" end="00:43:21.220" style="s2">they all died so that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.420" end="00:43:23.200" style="s2">ecological damage you&#39;re saying you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.220" end="00:43:24.820" style="s2">killing you&#39;re killing it</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.200" end="00:43:26.620" style="s2">unfortunately we have to do that for</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.820" end="00:43:28.210" style="s2">scientific purposes or we like to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.620" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">that as well as possible we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.210" end="00:43:34.630" style="s2">a control otherwise won&#39;t believe us so</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:36.910" style="s2">the controls all that these ones here</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.630" end="00:43:38.530" style="s2">grew like tremendously and I&#39;ll show you</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.910" end="00:43:41.200" style="s2">a few more pictures good point that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.530" end="00:43:44.650" style="s2">important here is the bottom is not sad</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.200" end="00:43:46.690" style="s2">this is rock we grew them on bare rock</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.650" end="00:43:47.710" style="s2">something no one else has ever been able</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.690" end="00:43:49.660" style="s2">to do before</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.710" end="00:43:51.820" style="s2">okay because we had such political</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.660" end="00:43:54.460" style="s2">growth and you see in the next picture a</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.820" end="00:43:56.920" style="s2">close-up there and there&#39;s some of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.460" end="00:43:58.600" style="s2">pasta Dona and here here&#39;s our mesh and</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.920" end="00:44:00.190" style="s2">I think I think it was one centimeter</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.600" end="00:44:03.100" style="s2">spacing I&#39;d have to check that I think</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.190" end="00:44:05.260" style="s2">that&#39;s it and if you look a little more</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.100" end="00:44:07.300" style="s2">closely here we&#39;ll created a whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.260" end="00:44:09.490" style="s2">little mini ecosystems you see the fish</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.300" end="00:44:11.500" style="s2">swimming around this is a close-up of</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.490" end="00:44:13.990" style="s2">the moon so after they they afterwards</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.500" end="00:44:17.230" style="s2">so this is a mussel mussel settled in it</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.990" end="00:44:19.480" style="s2">crabs it was shrimp all kinds of marine</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.230" end="00:44:22.950" style="s2">worms and stuff so we created a whole</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.480" end="00:44:24.820" style="s2">little mini ecosystem about this big and</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.950" end="00:44:26.350" style="s2">it did very well</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.820" end="00:44:27.550" style="s2">now this was a temporary experiment you</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.350" end="00:44:29.200" style="s2">only did this for three months</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.550" end="00:44:31.420" style="s2">unfortunately and we there those what</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.200" end="00:44:32.920" style="s2">you know our permits were for so it</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.420" end="00:44:35.410" style="s2">wasn&#39;t wasn&#39;t to actually do</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.920" end="00:44:37.600" style="s2">restorations to do an experiment but it</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.410" end="00:44:40.549" style="s2">was tremendously productive now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.600" end="00:44:45.890" style="s2">gonna show I will show you a video</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.549" end="00:44:49.309" style="s2">see us work in a minute but what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.890" end="00:44:51.469" style="s2">seen is that we&#39;re mainly not working in</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.309" end="00:44:53.989" style="s2">C bus most of my work is coral</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.469" end="00:44:56.269" style="s2">restoration but many of our coral reefs</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.989" end="00:44:58.519" style="s2">have seen breasts around her under them</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.269" end="00:45:01.039" style="s2">but so we&#39;ve done many projects in</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.519" end="00:45:02.809" style="s2">countries around the world where we go a</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.039" end="00:45:04.819" style="s2">coral reef and we see the seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.809" end="00:45:07.699" style="s2">growing more politically around and</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.819" end="00:45:09.499" style="s2">under them so that that I&#39;m show you one</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.699" end="00:45:11.119" style="s2">video of that and the Bahamas in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.499" end="00:45:13.699" style="s2">minute that&#39;s something we generally see</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.119" end="00:45:16.130" style="s2">as we see the seagrass being taller and</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.699" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">greener around them now I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.130" end="00:45:20.989" style="s2">jump to salt marshes for a second when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.819" style="s2">come back to sea grasses and this this</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.989" end="00:45:26.329" style="s2">is a site in New York City</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.819" end="00:45:31.699" style="s2">it&#39;s a Superfund toxic waste site and we</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.329" end="00:45:35.209" style="s2">at that site this is this is our</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.699" end="00:45:37.130" style="s2">shoreline I mean it&#39;s all toxic waste of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.209" end="00:45:39.099" style="s2">construction debris and all that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.130" end="00:45:42.079" style="s2">the beach and we&#39;ve done is implanted</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.099" end="00:45:44.059" style="s2">spartina alterniflora that&#39;s a salt</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.079" end="00:45:45.920" style="s2">marsh an intertidal blast and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.059" end="00:45:49.099" style="s2">were out there at low tide and model.i</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.920" end="00:45:50.779" style="s2">tide was under water and with this area</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.099" end="00:45:52.939" style="s2">was so poisonous this stuff couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.779" end="00:45:55.099" style="s2">grow so we&#39;re growing these with solar</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.939" end="00:45:57.559" style="s2">panels you see a solar panel here where</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.099" end="00:45:59.179" style="s2">I&#39;m moving the cursor and here&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.559" end="00:46:01.880" style="s2">our students here and she&#39;s measuring</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.179" end="00:46:04.939" style="s2">the height this is a clump of sea grass</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.880" end="00:46:07.400" style="s2">and toxic waste that we&#39;re growing and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.939" end="00:46:09.979" style="s2">she&#39;s measuring the height of them now</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.400" end="00:46:11.869" style="s2">what we saw compared to the controls you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.979" end="00:46:14.539" style="s2">know control areas were responding</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.869" end="00:46:15.920" style="s2">without electricity we found the sea</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.539" end="00:46:20.869" style="s2">grass grew much taller</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:24.289" style="s2">a blue greener it had tall it also had</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.869" end="00:46:27.439" style="s2">many more stems for klompers as a root</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.289" end="00:46:28.849" style="s2">mass and many more stems but we didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.439" end="00:46:31.609" style="s2">really count that we just measured the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.849" end="00:46:33.890" style="s2">height and so this is a gun what other</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.609" end="00:46:36.319" style="s2">thing is we&#39;re able to grow these lower</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.890" end="00:46:38.779" style="s2">in the intertidal than they normally put</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.319" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">bro so normally down the lower jerk</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.779" end="00:46:42.559" style="s2">tidal there is a limit because they</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:44.929" style="s2">don&#39;t get enough light or the wave</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.559" end="00:46:48.759" style="s2">energy washes away and all that so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.929" end="00:46:51.259" style="s2">at six all the salt marshes are roading</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.759" end="00:46:52.910" style="s2">natural salt lime roading because of sea</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.259" end="00:46:54.000" style="s2">level rise when you look at the natural</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.910" end="00:46:56.100" style="s2">salt marsh</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.000" end="00:46:58.920" style="s2">most places to see that collapsing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.100" end="00:47:00.780" style="s2">edges are falling into the sea and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.920" end="00:47:02.940" style="s2">they&#39;re retreating and land of sea level</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.780" end="00:47:04.710" style="s2">rise it&#39;s critical to extend them</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.940" end="00:47:06.960" style="s2">seaward so what we&#39;re trying to do in</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.710" end="00:47:08.790" style="s2">this experiment in New York City so here</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.960" end="00:47:10.710" style="s2">we planted lower in the intertidal they</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.790" end="00:47:16.170" style="s2">could grow and we&#39;ve been doing that now</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.710" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">for about 1314 years and we started with</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.170" end="00:47:20.580" style="s2">just ten plants and they proliferated</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:23.280" style="s2">now we have hundreds of them going there</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.580" end="00:47:24.840" style="s2">the controls all die every year what</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.280" end="00:47:27.150" style="s2">happens is they die back in the winter</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.840" end="00:47:29.100" style="s2">and they never come back in the spring</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.150" end="00:47:31.110" style="s2">but ours just comes stronger and</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.100" end="00:47:32.940" style="s2">stronger every year so we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.110" end="00:47:35.400" style="s2">grow them tremendously here here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.940" end="00:47:37.920" style="s2">example of this Vartan again this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.400" end="00:47:40.320" style="s2">mesh that as I&#39;d say 15 centimeters and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.920" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s facing and it&#39;s very easy to do we</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.320" end="00:47:43.170" style="s2">just lay the mesh down and charge it</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:45.570" style="s2">appropriately and we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.170" end="00:47:48.510" style="s2">regenerate them assured this is some</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.570" end="00:47:50.250" style="s2">data from Sparta now the Reds are just</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.510" end="00:47:52.770" style="s2">measuring the height this is in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.250" end="00:47:54.630" style="s2">growing season for about three months or</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.770" end="00:47:56.250" style="s2">so and you can see we measured the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.630" end="00:47:58.290" style="s2">height at the controls and then with a</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.250" end="00:48:01.800" style="s2">little trickle at all Tristen a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.290" end="00:48:04.080" style="s2">we&#39;re getting no increase in growth</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.800" end="00:48:06.210" style="s2">above double under these conditions</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.080" end="00:48:08.520" style="s2">possibly we could get it much higher we</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.210" end="00:48:10.170" style="s2">had a higher more current at some point</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.520" end="00:48:11.790" style="s2">you start to get negative effect so you</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.170" end="00:48:13.590" style="s2">don&#39;t really know how high we could go</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.790" end="00:48:15.960" style="s2">but what we&#39;re able to show is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.590" end="00:48:18.930" style="s2">they&#39;re growing taller about twice as</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.960" end="00:48:21.390" style="s2">fast in this growing season with under</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.930" end="00:48:23.940" style="s2">these conditions but also we have many</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.390" end="00:48:26.250" style="s2">more stems than the plants of Gleaner so</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.940" end="00:48:28.020" style="s2">they&#39;re more more photosynthetic so we</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.250" end="00:48:29.070" style="s2">we showed here that we could regenerate</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.020" end="00:48:33.210" style="s2">Spartina</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.070" end="00:48:35.430" style="s2">or salt marsh very effectively with just</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.210" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">trickle charge and solar panels and NC</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.430" end="00:48:41.400" style="s2">glass so all right so I want to let me</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:43.110" style="s2">jump now to something else now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.400" end="00:48:45.420" style="s2">trying to apply this to mangroves as</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.110" end="00:48:47.250" style="s2">well we believe this is a general</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.420" end="00:48:50.220" style="s2">mechanism that affects all forms of</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.250" end="00:48:53.300" style="s2">marine life and mangroves fences I do</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.220" end="00:48:57.330" style="s2">most of my work is in Indonesia and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.300" end="00:48:59.730" style="s2">Indonesia is the world&#39;s largest area of</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.330" end="00:49:03.000" style="s2">seagrass and mangrove in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.730" end="00:49:05.540" style="s2">by far the highest biodiversity of those</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.000" end="00:49:07.400" style="s2">ecosystems such as the center of</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.540" end="00:49:08.990" style="s2">diversity and amount</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.400" end="00:49:10.369" style="s2">and they&#39;re destroying them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.990" end="00:49:12.650" style="s2">destroying them like every place else</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.369" end="00:49:14.270" style="s2">they&#39;re cutting down the mangroves for</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.650" end="00:49:16.220" style="s2">shrimp ponds a shrimp all died from</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.270" end="00:49:18.230" style="s2">disease they abandon them and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.220" end="00:49:20.390" style="s2">where they used to be a kilometer of</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.230" end="00:49:23.000" style="s2">mangrove altas on open water it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.390" end="00:49:25.670" style="s2">causing massive erosion for instance and</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.000" end="00:49:27.789" style="s2">all over Southeast Asia because half of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.670" end="00:49:30.619" style="s2">the areas of mangrove that had been</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.789" end="00:49:34.069" style="s2">destroyed have been abandoned because</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.619" end="00:49:36.680" style="s2">they were unusable so we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.069" end="00:49:38.420" style="s2">regenerate those mangroves and turn them</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.680" end="00:49:40.510" style="s2">into carbon sinks and orangutan</p>

<p begin="00:49:40.510" end="00:49:44.720" style="s2">sources it&#39;s a long story that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.680" end="00:49:47.210" style="s2">need to get into here so let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.720" end="00:49:49.039" style="s2">get back to the sea grasses though but</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.210" end="00:49:51.770" style="s2">as I say it&#39;s a general application to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.039" end="00:49:53.960" style="s2">all marine plants everything so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.770" end="00:49:59.000" style="s2">going to show you I think a short video</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.960" end="00:50:00.950" style="s2">here and this video is just a minute and</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.000" end="00:50:04.010" style="s2">a half but this shows sea grasses the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.950" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">Bahamas now in this case here I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.010" end="00:50:08.510" style="s2">lay a mesh down flat</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:11.900" style="s2">I actually took mesh I rolled it up into</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.510" end="00:50:14.000" style="s2">sort of a double cylinder okay and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.900" end="00:50:16.460" style="s2">way I was trying to create habitat for</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.000" end="00:50:18.950" style="s2">corals and fish as well as for seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.460" end="00:50:22.490" style="s2">Magnus will show you what what it looks</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.950" end="00:50:24.349" style="s2">like here and this is a Abaco in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.490" end="00:50:28.910" style="s2">Bahamas yeah it&#39;s just destroyed by the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.349" end="00:50:31.250" style="s2">hurricane devastated seagrass beds are</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.910" end="00:50:32.990" style="s2">crucial habitats as fisheries for</p>

<p begin="00:50:32.990" end="00:50:35.720" style="s2">structures for them and so they get</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.760" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">eaten by predators</p>

<p begin="00:51:51.350" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">in the future I think the point here is</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.770" end="00:51:59.780" style="s2">that what we see it&#39;s a very short</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">hearing of course but basically if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.780" end="00:52:04.550" style="s2">look at the height of the sea craft a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:05.810" style="s2">bit smaller and be around the structure</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.550" end="00:52:08.210" style="s2">under them this is something we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.810" end="00:52:10.640" style="s2">noticed in Panama and other places as</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.210" end="00:52:12.710" style="s2">well so we don&#39;t have measurements I</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.640" end="00:52:13.940" style="s2">mean I say if this leaves no work in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.710" end="00:52:16.850" style="s2">field with this planet</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.940" end="00:52:18.800" style="s2">see what we can grow and but we can see</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.850" end="00:52:21.320" style="s2">the impact I think very clearly that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:23.780" style="s2">Haydn&#39;s waiver under and around these</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.320" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">structures and what we would like to do</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.780" end="00:52:28.970" style="s2">was to do some work with people in my</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:31.790" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in generating seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.970" end="00:52:35.330" style="s2">so see if we could apply our methods to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.790" end="00:52:37.400" style="s2">it on on a large scale to be generated</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.330" end="00:52:41.150" style="s2">consistently think we have a solution</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.400" end="00:52:43.310" style="s2">that is it&#39;s obviously there&#39;s a cost</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.150" end="00:52:45.200" style="s2">because you have to find the target</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.310" end="00:52:48.650" style="s2">electricity that&#39;s a limitation of our</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.200" end="00:52:54.490" style="s2">method but we can do that with folding</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.650" end="00:52:54.490" style="s2">solar panels and it could be very large</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.960" end="00:53:01.070" style="s2">could you say a little bit because</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.890" end="00:53:02.870" style="s2">you&#39;ve just um started working in Spain</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.070" end="00:53:05.420" style="s2">quite extensively and you you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.870" end="00:53:08.030" style="s2">on a project and under Lucia and to</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.420" end="00:53:09.110" style="s2">protect beaches and can you just tell a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.030" end="00:53:11.030" style="s2">little bit more about the background</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.110" end="00:53:21.050" style="s2">about your work in Spain and and the</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.030" end="00:53:25.480" style="s2">partners in it Coris permeable structure</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.050" end="00:53:28.460" style="s2">the water goes through the breakwater</p>

<p begin="00:53:34.610" end="00:53:41.540" style="s2">on that plane and then it washes away</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.610" end="00:53:43.540" style="s2">all the sand in front but disappears and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.540" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">then the sand underneath disappears</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.540" end="00:53:47.450" style="s2">launches undred to get a whole London</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:49.820" style="s2">and the whole structure eventually</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.450" end="00:53:52.520" style="s2">collapses and breaks and falls apart and</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.820" end="00:53:55.010" style="s2">we saw that in scrum gloria sent you</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.520" end="00:53:58.160" style="s2">every seawall in Spain that was hit by</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.010" end="00:54:00.440" style="s2">that storm caused erosion in front of it</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.160" end="00:54:03.350" style="s2">the sand disappeared and in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.440" end="00:54:05.360" style="s2">the sea wall itself was destroyed and</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.350" end="00:54:07.160" style="s2">broken by the waves so so they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.360" end="00:54:10.190" style="s2">work I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.160" end="00:54:12.500" style="s2">but here in Spain people invested so</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.190" end="00:54:14.750" style="s2">much money in trying to protect their</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.500" end="00:54:18.320" style="s2">futures for tourism and the building</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.750" end="00:54:20.540" style="s2">walls and then groins as Pagonis you</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.320" end="00:54:24.290" style="s2">know all over the place and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.540" end="00:54:26.750" style="s2">almost all of them failed people realize</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.290" end="00:54:28.910" style="s2">that now they&#39;re guests for it because</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.750" end="00:54:31.070" style="s2">all these beaches have disappeared the</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.910" end="00:54:33.470" style="s2">hotel&#39;s not that sand back before it</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.070" end="00:54:35.390" style="s2">ones up in 80 million current show up</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.470" end="00:54:38.630" style="s2">you know looking for 2 square meters for</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.390" end="00:54:40.130" style="s2">their death there&#39;s no sound there so</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.630" end="00:54:42.950" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty desperate but the point</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.130" end="00:54:44.810" style="s2">is sea walls don&#39;t work they never have</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.950" end="00:54:47.120" style="s2">worked every seawall that&#39;s ever been</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.810" end="00:54:48.890" style="s2">built if it hasn&#39;t fallen down already</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.120" end="00:54:51.110" style="s2">it&#39;s going to some at some point in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.890" end="00:54:52.670" style="s2">future and it&#39;s a huge business now the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.110" end="00:54:54.860" style="s2">point is what they do is they destroy</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.670" end="00:54:57.140" style="s2">the ecosystem in front of them and the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.860" end="00:54:59.540" style="s2">ecosystem service so we do something</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.140" end="00:55:01.400" style="s2">very different a coral reef does not</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.540" end="00:55:03.050" style="s2">work like a sea wall there&#39;s a coral</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.400" end="00:55:06.140" style="s2">reef is full of holes like these</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.050" end="00:55:08.810" style="s2">structures water goes through them it</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.140" end="00:55:11.330" style="s2">loses energy by friction the more things</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.810" end="00:55:13.850" style="s2">grow on it the more seagrass they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.330" end="00:55:16.280" style="s2">some more clams growing on it</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.850" end="00:55:18.020" style="s2">mussels more surface areas and the more</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.280" end="00:55:19.490" style="s2">they slow the waves down because the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.020" end="00:55:22.100" style="s2">waves are able to grow through they</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.490" end="00:55:24.320" style="s2">don&#39;t destroy the structure and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.100" end="00:55:26.180" style="s2">depth that&#39;s why every place is a coral</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.320" end="00:55:28.940" style="s2">reef or an oyster with you grow Beach</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.180" end="00:55:30.740" style="s2">behind it and you kill the coral reef or</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.940" end="00:55:33.560" style="s2">the oyster reef the beach starts to wash</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.740" end="00:55:35.690" style="s2">away so we do is essentially sweet gross</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.560" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">structures I mean this is an example</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.690" end="00:55:40.820" style="s2">here in front of each&#39;s and what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.980" style="s2">done in eight different places in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.820" end="00:55:46.130" style="s2">world as we have grown back severely</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.980" end="00:55:48.369" style="s2">eroded beaches of record rates by were</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.130" end="00:55:51.069" style="s2">generating the ecosystem in front of</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.369" end="00:55:52.630" style="s2">and creating fisheries habitat I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.069" end="00:55:54.249" style="s2">you see on this picture how many fish</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.630" end="00:55:56.499" style="s2">hang out in the structure they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.249" end="00:55:59.410" style="s2">looking for a place to hide the seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.499" end="00:56:01.749" style="s2">bed this is not very much I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.410" end="00:56:03.549" style="s2">you&#39;re small and can hide behind the the</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.749" end="00:56:05.559" style="s2">blades of the grass that&#39;s okay but for</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.549" end="00:56:07.720" style="s2">a bigger fish you know if they can see</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.559" end="00:56:09.369" style="s2">we thought we&#39;re creating habitat we</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.720" end="00:56:11.259" style="s2">were generating the Fisher&#39;s we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.369" end="00:56:14.259" style="s2">generating all the ecosystem services</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.259" end="00:56:16.119" style="s2">they provide it we&#39;re protecting the</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.259" end="00:56:18.339" style="s2">sand the beach from erosion and more</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.119" end="00:56:20.980" style="s2">than that we&#39;re also generating new sand</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.339" end="00:56:24.450" style="s2">because we&#39;re getting prolific growth of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.980" end="00:56:28.119" style="s2">organisms that produce and when they got</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.450" end="00:56:30.130" style="s2">calcareous algae that have good algae</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.119" end="00:56:33.249" style="s2">and bad algae the bad algae the fleshy</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.130" end="00:56:34.869" style="s2">ones that all go and kill kill reefs but</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.249" end="00:56:37.569" style="s2">the good ones are the ones that make</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.869" end="00:56:39.609" style="s2">limestone we get prolific growth of them</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.569" end="00:56:41.410" style="s2">on our structures too so what we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.609" end="00:56:44.170" style="s2">just protecting the shore actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.410" end="00:56:46.630" style="s2">growing new said and in Indonesia we</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.170" end="00:56:48.519" style="s2">have places where we&#39;ve had black sand</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.630" end="00:56:51.099" style="s2">beaches and we&#39;re producing so much new</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.519" end="00:56:53.559" style="s2">limestone sand is now a white layer in</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.099" end="00:56:56.049" style="s2">front of the black sand beach material</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.559" end="00:56:58.210" style="s2">we produce oh so now I would say here in</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.049" end="00:57:00.400" style="s2">Spain there&#39;s a tremendous erosion</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.210" end="00:57:03.609" style="s2">people realize that the methods that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.400" end="00:57:06.700" style="s2">spent so much money on they failed they</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.609" end="00:57:09.849" style="s2">didn&#39;t work and with the very beginnings</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.700" end="00:57:11.589" style="s2">of a situation where extreme events I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.849" end="00:57:13.900" style="s2">going to be more frequent and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.589" end="00:57:16.329" style="s2">severe in the future until we control</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.900" end="00:57:19.150" style="s2">global warming on the global scale so we</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.329" end="00:57:21.640" style="s2">have to be prepared for our failures our</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.150" end="00:57:24.339" style="s2">failures at global environmental</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.640" end="00:57:26.980" style="s2">management and so what we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.339" end="00:57:30.039" style="s2">do it in places here in Spain would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.980" end="00:57:32.700" style="s2">to grow leaps like this they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.039" end="00:57:35.470" style="s2">corrilesa be muscled we voice Therese</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.700" end="00:57:37.749" style="s2">whatever grows naturally in that habitat</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.470" end="00:57:40.720" style="s2">will try to propagate the seagrass</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.749" end="00:57:43.049" style="s2">underneath it like we do here and that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.720" end="00:57:45.309" style="s2">that would be the goal is in a sense to</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.049" end="00:57:48.039" style="s2">think about these structures for</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.309" end="00:57:50.200" style="s2">instances that assigned accumulates</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.039" end="00:57:53.230" style="s2">under them in storms but if you had a</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.200" end="00:57:54.999" style="s2">solid structure the waves would reflect</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.230" end="00:57:57.730" style="s2">and they would scour the sand away</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.999" end="00:57:59.890" style="s2">around them so this way we can in a</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.730" end="00:58:01.270" style="s2">sense create sand bars in front of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.890" end="00:58:04.120" style="s2">beaches and when the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.270" end="00:58:05.980" style="s2">a storm and sand washes away to be sit</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.120" end="00:58:08.110" style="s2">on the sandbar and can feed back to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.980" end="00:58:09.940" style="s2">beach in the calm season so we think</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.110" end="00:58:11.800" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of potential now what is</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.940" end="00:58:14.560" style="s2">interesting is in those places only</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.800" end="00:58:17.680" style="s2">regenerate at the beaches we&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.560" end="00:58:19.990" style="s2">sort of constants up ten times less than</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.680" end="00:58:22.090" style="s2">what a seawall would have cost the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.990" end="00:58:24.490" style="s2">seawall would have killed the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.090" end="00:58:26.170" style="s2">services we regenerate them for a</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.490" end="00:58:29.110" style="s2">fraction the price and grow the beach</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.170" end="00:58:32.400" style="s2">back now we have in Indonesia we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.110" end="00:58:35.410" style="s2">grown back each&#39;s in months record rates</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.400" end="00:58:38.140" style="s2">you know several meters high hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.410" end="00:58:40.900" style="s2">meters long 20 or 30 meters wide and</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.140" end="00:58:42.820" style="s2">done back at incredible rates so what</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.900" end="00:58:45.580" style="s2">we&#39;re doing with blue regeneration which</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.820" end="00:58:48.670" style="s2">is this new Spanish company just form</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.580" end="00:58:50.470" style="s2">that on Friday last year we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.670" end="00:58:52.390" style="s2">have our website up yet we&#39;ll post that</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.470" end="00:58:54.100" style="s2">as quickly as we can look we&#39;ll get that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.390" end="00:58:56.470" style="s2">to you but the purpose of blue</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.100" end="00:58:59.530" style="s2">regenerations mainly improve our</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.470" end="00:59:01.210" style="s2">technology - for power systems now the</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.530" end="00:59:03.370" style="s2">thing is we&#39;ve been mostly doing very</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.210" end="00:59:05.110" style="s2">small projects because there&#39;s no money</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.370" end="00:59:06.760" style="s2">in marine ecosystem is no funding</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.110" end="00:59:09.010" style="s2">community good system restorations not</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.760" end="00:59:10.810" style="s2">something anyone any policymaker has</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.010" end="00:59:12.460" style="s2">been taking seriously up to now this</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.810" end="00:59:14.380" style="s2">sense you have volunteers out there</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.460" end="00:59:16.030" style="s2">planting seagrass because they know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.380" end="00:59:18.670" style="s2">the right thing to do but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.030" end="00:59:20.230" style="s2">systemic funding now so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.670" end="00:59:21.610" style="s2">been doing small-scale part just like</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.230" end="00:59:24.270" style="s2">this one I show you in the Bahamas I</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.610" end="00:59:26.470" style="s2">built this thing in one day okay</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.270" end="00:59:27.730" style="s2">let me ask you one question which you</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.470" end="00:59:30.010" style="s2">would also be interesting for the New</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.730" end="00:59:31.810" style="s2">York an example is that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.010" end="00:59:34.060" style="s2">areas some of the larger Bay&#39;s around</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.810" end="00:59:37.630" style="s2">the island where there&#39;s a high</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.060" end="00:59:40.840" style="s2">concentration of hotels and basically</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.630" end="00:59:42.220" style="s2">unfortunate Majorca still not up to</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.840" end="00:59:47.070" style="s2">scratch with the way that they treat</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.220" end="00:59:50.140" style="s2">domestic general switch and over maybe</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.070" end="00:59:52.900" style="s2">eutrophication effects when algae blooms</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.140" end="00:59:54.130" style="s2">in the summer which of course the</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.900" end="00:59:56.380" style="s2">tourism industry is not happy about</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.130" end="01:00:01.690" style="s2">because the tourists don&#39;t like green</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.380" end="01:00:03.370" style="s2">seas they like blue seas in this kinda</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.690" end="01:00:06.060" style="s2">like using this kind of technology if</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.370" end="01:00:09.850" style="s2">you have a very high nutrient density</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.060" end="01:00:11.740" style="s2">because of runoff would directly improve</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.850" end="01:00:13.030" style="s2">the growth rate would that be beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.740" end="01:00:14.260" style="s2">and could it help with the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.030" end="01:00:16.900" style="s2">eutrophication as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.260" end="01:00:19.240" style="s2">well it depends on the ecosystem corals</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.900" end="01:00:20.980" style="s2">are the most sensitive of all ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.240" end="01:00:22.869" style="s2">to high nutrients because they get over</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.980" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">going to kill by algae if the lowest</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.869" end="01:00:27.609" style="s2">nuclear bubbles others are different</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">weekly most of the places where people</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.609" end="01:00:32.680" style="s2">ask us to do projects are severely</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:35.230" style="s2">eutrophic quite frankly in front of</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.680" end="01:00:37.300" style="s2">hotels or dive shops and then kill their</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.230" end="01:00:39.430" style="s2">own ecosystem they do to treat their</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.300" end="01:00:41.170" style="s2">sewage this is a worldwide problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.430" end="01:00:42.970" style="s2">not just in my Orkut if me</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.170" end="01:00:45.250" style="s2">we see this stuff flowing into the water</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.970" end="01:00:47.140" style="s2">every place the same content well our</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.250" end="01:00:49.270" style="s2">projects I think about our projects</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.140" end="01:00:52.090" style="s2">obviously is we will get the best</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.270" end="01:00:54.820" style="s2">results in the cleanest waters but what</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.090" end="01:00:57.130" style="s2">is interesting is we also get very</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.820" end="01:00:59.859" style="s2">positive results in the dirtiest waters</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.130" end="01:01:02.470" style="s2">were no other method works I mean that</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.859" end="01:01:04.240" style="s2">that&#39;s really pretty important so yes I</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.470" end="01:01:05.619" style="s2">mean the algae are a problem I mean in</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.240" end="01:01:07.990" style="s2">the long run you have to clean up the</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.619" end="01:01:09.940" style="s2">nutrient sources but we I mean you see</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.990" end="01:01:13.630" style="s2">algae on this structure here this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.940" end="01:01:15.580" style="s2">water that&#39;s 2 meters deep there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.630" end="01:01:17.290" style="s2">much of a tide there but the ants you</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.580" end="01:01:20.020" style="s2">are not really a problem there I mean</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.290" end="01:01:22.390" style="s2">what we find is that the we build up</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.020" end="01:01:24.100" style="s2">large fish populations in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.390" end="01:01:26.890" style="s2">one thing everyone notices their</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.100" end="01:01:28.540" style="s2">projects my goodness this year you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.890" end="01:01:31.690" style="s2">you look around and there&#39;s hardly any</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.540" end="01:01:33.340" style="s2">and and so the fish eat the algae you</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.690" end="01:01:35.560" style="s2">might have building up populations of</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.340" end="01:01:37.330" style="s2">fish eating algae and so they tend to</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.560" end="01:01:40.260" style="s2">keep it under control in fact we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.330" end="01:01:43.630" style="s2">creating a whole new food chain of</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.260" end="01:01:45.190" style="s2">eating keywords fish just briefly if</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.630" end="01:01:46.840" style="s2">you&#39;re done with the slides let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.190" end="01:01:50.050" style="s2">stop screen sharing so we can see each</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.840" end="01:01:53.050" style="s2">other yes okay sure let me stop here yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.050" end="01:01:55.660" style="s2">the Tony font has joined us Tony is</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.050" end="01:01:57.520" style="s2">there and he used to work for Greenpeace</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.660" end="01:02:02.290" style="s2">International I was on the board he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.520" end="01:02:05.050" style="s2">been a captain on the world wildlife WWF</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.290" end="01:02:06.340" style="s2">solar boat and and he knows the marine</p>

<p begin="01:02:06.340" end="01:02:10.210" style="s2">Majorca and the Mediterranean much</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.050" end="01:02:12.609" style="s2">better than I so Tony if you&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.210" end="01:02:14.560" style="s2">could do you want to pop up your video</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.609" end="01:02:18.369" style="s2">and and if you have any questions for</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.560" end="01:02:22.700" style="s2">Tom I&#39;d love to hear them</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.369" end="01:02:28.280" style="s2">see don&#39;t need maybe he&#39;s away from the</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.700" end="01:02:30.290" style="s2">squeak yes well anyway let&#39;s see if it</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.280" end="01:02:32.630" style="s2">comes back but this has been super</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.290" end="01:02:34.700" style="s2">helpful and I will share this with</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.630" end="01:02:36.530" style="s2">people who are working in marine</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.700" end="01:02:38.869" style="s2">protection here on the island and see</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.530" end="01:02:40.880" style="s2">whether we can the conversation again of</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.869" end="01:02:43.550" style="s2">marine regeneration is only starting</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.880" end="01:02:46.369" style="s2">here but it&#39;s wonderful that do you now</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.550" end="01:02:48.140" style="s2">have a Spanish based company in Spanish</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.369" end="01:02:50.540" style="s2">based partners did you did you make sure</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.140" end="01:02:53.599" style="s2">you also have a foundation and that is</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.540" end="01:02:55.339" style="s2">supporting your work well I&#39;m the person</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.599" end="01:02:57.320" style="s2">in the font of the global coral reef</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.339" end="01:02:59.960" style="s2">alliances have been around for about 30</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.320" end="01:03:03.349" style="s2">years as a nonprofit organization based</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.960" end="01:03:05.450" style="s2">in the United States we&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.349" end="01:03:08.030" style="s2">working with no funding especially in</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.450" end="01:03:10.940" style="s2">this field but we work with partners all</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.030" end="01:03:13.040" style="s2">around the world who have a problem and</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.940" end="01:03:15.740" style="s2">they want help and they they want to try</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.040" end="01:03:17.780" style="s2">using our methods so and that that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.740" end="01:03:20.180" style="s2">been doing small project but as I say</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.780" end="01:03:22.280" style="s2">the magnitude of the problems are so</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.180" end="01:03:24.800" style="s2">large that doing little demonstration</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.280" end="01:03:26.420" style="s2">parts isn&#39;t really solving problems we</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.800" end="01:03:29.599" style="s2">have to be doing this on a large scale</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.420" end="01:03:31.730" style="s2">and that that&#39;s that involves</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.599" end="01:03:33.140" style="s2">complications in terms of powering them</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.730" end="01:03:35.119" style="s2">and so we have to provide electricity</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.140" end="01:03:37.580" style="s2">but we providing authenticity over</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.119" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">square kilometers we need larger power</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.580" end="01:03:41.810" style="s2">suppliers they need to be more efficient</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:43.849" style="s2">even to be smart all that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.810" end="01:03:45.520" style="s2">so the purpose of what we&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.849" end="01:03:49.820" style="s2">in Spain it&#39;s been working with</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.520" end="01:03:52.730" style="s2">engineers primarily and we&#39;re working to</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.820" end="01:03:55.220" style="s2">try to develop much more efficient power</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.730" end="01:03:57.200" style="s2">supplies for smart they feed data back</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.220" end="01:03:59.240" style="s2">so we know how they&#39;re performing the</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.200" end="01:04:02.330" style="s2">monitoring themselves and so forth and</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.240" end="01:04:05.660" style="s2">so that would allow us to do very large</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.330" end="01:04:08.180" style="s2">projects in my or not you know nonprofit</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.660" end="01:04:10.220" style="s2">organization it&#39;s probably not the way</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.180" end="01:04:12.859" style="s2">to go because at this point it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.220" end="01:04:14.900" style="s2">too small and impact so it allows us to</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.859" end="01:04:17.000" style="s2">make demonstration projects like what I</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.900" end="01:04:19.250" style="s2">showed you here with very little funds</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.000" end="01:04:21.980" style="s2">but when we&#39;re talking about square</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.250" end="01:04:24.140" style="s2">kilometers obviously we need a much more</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.980" end="01:04:26.540" style="s2">serious organ trade and have you have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.140" end="01:04:29.000" style="s2">you got any data on because I was just</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.540" end="01:04:31.160" style="s2">thinking of course the potential of</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.000" end="01:04:34.970" style="s2">areas where this could be done we</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.160" end="01:04:37.280" style="s2">be improved drastically the minute you</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.970" end="01:04:39.800" style="s2">can grow posi dounia&#39;s slightly deeper</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.280" end="01:04:41.660" style="s2">than it would naturally grow and grow</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.800" end="01:04:44.510" style="s2">and I&#39;m wondering with giving it that</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.660" end="01:04:46.880" style="s2">extra help of the microcurrent that</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.510" end="01:04:49.220" style="s2">helps reproduce faster and and so on</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.880" end="01:04:51.620" style="s2">maybe you could find that you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.220" end="01:04:55.460" style="s2">actually grow seagrass Meadows at a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.620" end="01:04:57.650" style="s2">slightly lower depth that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.460" end="01:04:58.910" style="s2">probably true I mean we haven&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.650" end="01:05:00.500" style="s2">chance to experiment with that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.910" end="01:05:01.880" style="s2">obviously I&#39;m not going to make claims</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.500" end="01:05:04.160" style="s2">that&#39;s something I haven&#39;t actually done</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.880" end="01:05:06.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s too easy to do but</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.160" end="01:05:08.300" style="s2">but um the thing is in general we find</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.230" end="01:05:10.460" style="s2">with most organs we&#39;re able to expand</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.300" end="01:05:12.380" style="s2">their environmental tolerance range the</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.460" end="01:05:14.570" style="s2">conditions that they would normally be</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.380" end="01:05:16.460" style="s2">wiped out by extreme events in the case</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.570" end="01:05:18.800" style="s2">of deep sea grass of course it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.460" end="01:05:21.830" style="s2">bidat events and block their light or</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.800" end="01:05:24.740" style="s2">that they get buried in mud possibly to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.830" end="01:05:27.260" style="s2">grow so it&#39;s my view that we can expand</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.740" end="01:05:28.820" style="s2">their range but until we demonstrate</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.260" end="01:05:31.310" style="s2">that we can we&#39;re not going to claim</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.820" end="01:05:32.930" style="s2">that but it&#39;s I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.310" end="01:05:35.330" style="s2">case I mean you might be able to extend</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.930" end="01:05:37.730" style="s2">sea grass to the warmer colder waters</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.330" end="01:05:40.190" style="s2">and they control that sort of thing so</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.730" end="01:05:43.070" style="s2">yes there&#39;s a lot of possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.190" end="01:05:45.260" style="s2">before before we wrap up and I would</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.070" end="01:05:47.180" style="s2">like to give you the opportunity if I</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.260" end="01:05:48.920" style="s2">any of the people who are working on</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.180" end="01:05:51.740" style="s2">marine conservation and protection and</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.920" end="01:05:54.350" style="s2">research in marine biology and ecology</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.740" end="01:05:56.840" style="s2">here around the ballet Eric&#39;s that I I</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.350" end="01:05:59.000" style="s2">will try to make this video accessible</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.840" end="01:06:00.440" style="s2">too and and actually actively ask them</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.000" end="01:06:03.860" style="s2">to comment on it</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.440" end="01:06:05.930" style="s2">and you know it would be you opportunity</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.860" end="01:06:07.820" style="s2">to ask them some questions of what you</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.930" end="01:06:10.970" style="s2">would like to know about poly Eric&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.820" end="01:06:12.200" style="s2">so we I can also add those questions to</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.970" end="01:06:19.910" style="s2">the list so we can move the process</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.200" end="01:06:21.740" style="s2">forward well I think I&#39;m a tropical guy</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.910" end="01:06:25.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m almost always working in coral</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.740" end="01:06:27.740" style="s2">reef so this is a bit exotic to me but</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.490" end="01:06:31.010" style="s2">the thing is they&#39;re excellent marine</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.740" end="01:06:33.740" style="s2">scientists here know these ecosystems</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.010" end="01:06:35.330" style="s2">inside-out and we would like to try to</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.740" end="01:06:37.580" style="s2">work with them to see if we can apply</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.330" end="01:06:40.070" style="s2">our method to their situation obviously</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.580" end="01:06:42.020" style="s2">we want we want to work with the best</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.070" end="01:06:44.239" style="s2">people the ones who know their ecosystem</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.020" end="01:06:46.969" style="s2">and the earth isn&#39;t inside out</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.239" end="01:06:50.179" style="s2">and see if we can help absorb all this</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.969" end="01:06:52.159" style="s2">here so eager to do that right now</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.179" end="01:06:53.899" style="s2">because that&#39;s that&#39;s why I invited this</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.159" end="01:06:57.919" style="s2">conversation because there is such an</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.899" end="01:07:00.979" style="s2">enormous density of top sea grass and</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.919" end="01:07:01.759" style="s2">and marine scientists on Majorca and in</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.979" end="01:07:04.939" style="s2">the Balearic s--</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.759" end="01:07:07.549" style="s2">that it&#39;s just an obvious place and they</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.939" end="01:07:09.409" style="s2">I know that there are experiments in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.549" end="01:07:11.779" style="s2">Bay of piensa that are funded by and</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.409" end="01:07:13.399" style="s2">essa and that in media the Institute for</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.779" end="01:07:14.869" style="s2">Advanced Studies of the Mediterranean</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.399" end="01:07:17.569" style="s2">which is based in a small is here on the</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.869" end="01:07:19.849" style="s2">island and have started but what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.569" end="01:07:21.739" style="s2">not doing is increasing the reproduction</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.849" end="01:07:25.069" style="s2">rate of the growth rate and therefore</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.739" end="01:07:28.429" style="s2">it&#39;s questionable whether it&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.069" end="01:07:30.199" style="s2">any real application for it because what</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.429" end="01:07:33.039" style="s2">I&#39;d say in every place we work obviously</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.199" end="01:07:36.529" style="s2">would try to solve a local problem and</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.039" end="01:07:39.289" style="s2">we can&#39;t every site is different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.529" end="01:07:40.759" style="s2">different wave energy forces history all</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.289" end="01:07:42.559" style="s2">that sort of thing so we need to</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.759" end="01:07:45.199" style="s2">understand the site and the problems</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.559" end="01:07:47.719" style="s2">very well before we design something</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.199" end="01:07:49.489" style="s2">that you know convict and and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.719" end="01:07:51.889" style="s2">we want to work with local people who</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.489" end="01:07:54.229" style="s2">know these ecosystems when the changes</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.889" end="01:07:55.969" style="s2">they&#39;ve seen inside out typically the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.229" end="01:07:57.799" style="s2">people come to us and they say you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.969" end="01:07:59.839" style="s2">it used to be so wonderful here we have</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.799" end="01:08:01.849" style="s2">almost now almost nothing left can you</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.839" end="01:08:05.149" style="s2">help a usually they come to us when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.849" end="01:08:07.249" style="s2">almost all gone no when the conditions</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.149" end="01:08:09.649" style="s2">have become so severe and so extreme</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.249" end="01:08:11.779" style="s2">that you go with basket cases but at</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.649" end="01:08:13.699" style="s2">anyway we&#39;d have to come really I&#39;d love</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.779" end="01:08:15.979" style="s2">to come and see these sea grasses now</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.699" end="01:08:24.679" style="s2">it&#39;s to quote me to go into the water</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.979" end="01:08:26.630" style="s2">now I bet I mean I&#39;d love to see me go</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.679" end="01:08:29.179" style="s2">system can learn a lot more about them</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.630" end="01:08:31.579" style="s2">and then I mean obviously the thing for</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.179" end="01:08:34.190" style="s2">us to do is to dive in the water with</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.579" end="01:08:37.309" style="s2">local people who know those areas and</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.190" end="01:08:38.869" style="s2">then see what we could do each cycle is</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.309" end="01:08:41.900" style="s2">different I mean actually they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.869" end="01:08:44.150" style="s2">specification is obviously relate to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.900" end="01:08:46.549" style="s2">nature of the bottom the wave forces</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.150" end="01:08:48.380" style="s2">that can get extreme forces that you</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.549" end="01:08:51.049" style="s2">have to be ready to deal with not the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.380" end="01:08:53.929" style="s2">average conditions and then how you</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.049" end="01:08:55.909" style="s2">power it that&#39;s a big issue I mean you</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.929" end="01:08:57.739" style="s2">you have to either be near a place where</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.909" end="01:09:00.170" style="s2">you can do for sure you might have</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.739" end="01:09:02.359" style="s2">working solar panels it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.170" end="01:09:05.569" style="s2">site-specific decisions how to do that</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.359" end="01:09:09.080" style="s2">most effectively so that&#39;s what we one</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.569" end="01:09:11.630" style="s2">of the problems with using DC lower</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.080" end="01:09:13.310" style="s2">voltages over high distances that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.630" end="01:09:16.670" style="s2">have such much as such loss in the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.310" end="01:09:19.130" style="s2">cables so you can only efficiently do it</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.670" end="01:09:21.319" style="s2">and when it&#39;s close to shore that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.130" end="01:09:23.060" style="s2">absolutely correct and that is precisely</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.319" end="01:09:24.710" style="s2">the point of the technological</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.060" end="01:09:26.299" style="s2">developments were making the CUDA</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.710" end="01:09:28.460" style="s2">generations we&#39;re going to be building</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.299" end="01:09:29.900" style="s2">systems that are more powerful more</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.460" end="01:09:32.480" style="s2">efficient and capable of transmitting</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.900" end="01:09:34.040" style="s2">over greater distances in some cases</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.480" end="01:09:35.900" style="s2">what you have to do is transmit other</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.040" end="01:09:38.029" style="s2">ways and then drop it down in low</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.900" end="01:09:39.920" style="s2">voltage to the site but the transmission</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.029" end="01:09:42.469" style="s2">losses that&#39;s what people use high</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.920" end="01:09:44.239" style="s2">voltage DC you know transmission and</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.469" end="01:09:45.739" style="s2">stepping down because that already</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.239" end="01:09:48.080" style="s2">exists off the shelf</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.739" end="01:09:50.180" style="s2">likes small units that you could sink</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.080" end="01:09:53.420" style="s2">under well no we have we&#39;ve built them</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.180" end="01:09:56.030" style="s2">under my colleague here Thomas is</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.420" end="01:09:58.969" style="s2">designing building such systems and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.030" end="01:10:02.060" style="s2">purpose of this company at least is to</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.969" end="01:10:04.580" style="s2">make them make them available on a large</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.060" end="01:10:05.900" style="s2">scale but now we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.580" end="01:10:06.980" style="s2">making them ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.900" end="01:10:10.969" style="s2">these aren&#39;t commercially available</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.980" end="01:10:13.910" style="s2">units Thomas has basically built them</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.969" end="01:10:16.130" style="s2">himself and obviously there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.910" end="01:10:19.010" style="s2">costs for prototypes and all that sort</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.130" end="01:10:21.440" style="s2">of thing but that&#39;s that&#39;s the hurdle we</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.010" end="01:10:26.360" style="s2">planted over come here and see the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.440" end="01:10:27.830" style="s2">efficiency on the spot excellent so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.360" end="01:10:29.810" style="s2">stop the recording now and then we can</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.830" end="01:10:34.520" style="s2">just wrap up and and then we see where</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.810" end="01:10:36.350" style="s2">the same provocation and let me just add</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.520" end="01:10:40.130" style="s2">one more thing I mean I&#39;m going to be in</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.350" end="01:10:42.110" style="s2">Spain probably until late next week I</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.130" end="01:10:43.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a possibility to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.110" end="01:10:45.950" style="s2">come to my York I&#39;m very happy to come</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.880" end="01:10:48.219" style="s2">and meet with people learn more about</p>
