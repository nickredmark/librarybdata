<p begin="00:00:16.220" end="00:00:23.280" style="s2">all right so the last time I was here</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.390" end="00:00:25.710" style="s2">many of you were as well we got halfway</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.280" end="00:00:28.820" style="s2">through the story of Jacob and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.710" end="00:00:31.860" style="s2">digging underneath the story</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.820" end="00:00:33.180" style="s2">sporadically since then to try to find</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.860" end="00:00:35.580" style="s2">out whether other themes are being</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.180" end="00:00:36.870" style="s2">developed and I&#39;ve got some things that</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.580" end="00:00:42.390" style="s2">I think are really interesting to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.870" end="00:00:45.559" style="s2">about so so we&#39;ll get right into it so</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.390" end="00:00:49.670" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna review a little bit first so</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.559" end="00:00:53.489" style="s2">we were talking about Jacob and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.670" end="00:00:55.380" style="s2">read eight his biography a little bit so</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.489" end="00:00:58.350" style="s2">that we can place ourselves in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.380" end="00:01:00.930" style="s2">proper context before we go on so his</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.350" end="00:01:03.329" style="s2">mother Rebecca gave birth to twins and</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.930" end="00:01:05.520" style="s2">the twins even in her womb were</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.329" end="00:01:07.350" style="s2">struggling for although they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.520" end="00:01:08.490" style="s2">struggling and of course the story is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.350" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">that they were struggling for dominance</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.490" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">the older are the younger against the</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:18.840" style="s2">older really because Jacob Jacob means</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:21.619" style="s2">usurper and Rebecca had a what would you</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.840" end="00:01:26.580" style="s2">call a vision from God that said that</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.619" end="00:01:29.340" style="s2">Jacob would supplant Esau and so even</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.580" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">before her twins were born they were in</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.340" end="00:01:34.260" style="s2">a state of competition and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:36.330" style="s2">recapitulation of the motif of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.260" end="00:01:39.570" style="s2">hostile brothers right it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.330" end="00:01:42.270" style="s2">very common mythological motif and we we</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.570" end="00:01:44.250" style="s2">already saw that really well developed</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.270" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">in the story of Cain and Abel right and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.250" end="00:01:48.509" style="s2">Cain and Abel were essentially the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">two human beings the first two natural</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.509" end="00:01:52.650" style="s2">born human beings and they were</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">instantly locked in a state of enmity</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.650" end="00:01:59.310" style="s2">which is symbolic of first the enmity</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">that exists within people&#39;s psyche</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.310" end="00:02:03.930" style="s2">between the part of them you might say</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:05.220" style="s2">that&#39;s aiming at the light and the part</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.930" end="00:02:07.290" style="s2">of them that&#39;s aiming at the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.220" end="00:02:10.259" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s a reasonable way of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.290" end="00:02:14.610" style="s2">portraying it obviously it&#39;s a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.259" end="00:02:17.940" style="s2">sort of rife with symbolism but my</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.610" end="00:02:19.560" style="s2">experience of people especially when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.940" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">get to know them seriously or when</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.560" end="00:02:23.640" style="s2">they&#39;re dealing with serious issues is</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:25.829" style="s2">that there is quite clearly a part of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.640" end="00:02:28.260" style="s2">them that&#39;s striving to do well in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.829" end="00:02:29.580" style="s2">world or even to do good and another</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.260" end="00:02:31.980" style="s2">part that&#39;s deeply sinned</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.580" end="00:02:34.260" style="s2">and embittered that that says to hell</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.980" end="00:02:37.590" style="s2">with it and is self-destructive and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.260" end="00:02:42.060" style="s2">lashes out and really aims at making</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.590" end="00:02:44.360" style="s2">things worse and so that seems to be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.060" end="00:02:47.940" style="s2">natural part of the human psyche and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.360" end="00:02:50.340" style="s2">that&#39;s also reflected in the the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.940" end="00:02:52.830" style="s2">the fall and so those ideas are not</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.340" end="00:02:54.750" style="s2">easily cast away they&#39;re associated with</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.830" end="00:02:57.240" style="s2">the rise of self-consciousness right and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.750" end="00:03:00.210" style="s2">in the story of the Garden of Eden and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.240" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">think that&#39;s right because I do think</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.210" end="00:03:04.950" style="s2">that our self-consciousness produces</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:07.230" style="s2">that division within us because more</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.950" end="00:03:10.110" style="s2">than any other creature were intensely</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.230" end="00:03:12.540" style="s2">aware of our finitude and suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.110" end="00:03:15.600" style="s2">that tends to turn us at least to some</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.540" end="00:03:19.320" style="s2">degree against being itself you know I</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.600" end="00:03:23.690" style="s2">was watching a bunch of protesters in</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.320" end="00:03:27.810" style="s2">the US last week scream out the sky</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.690" end="00:03:29.370" style="s2">about Trump you know and it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.810" end="00:03:32.370" style="s2">interesting like I thought it was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.370" end="00:03:34.530" style="s2">extraordinarily narcissistic display but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.370" end="00:03:36.600" style="s2">but despite that there was something</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.530" end="00:03:39.350" style="s2">symbolically appropriate about it</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.600" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">I also there&#39;s a movie I really like</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.350" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">sadly enough called fubar I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:49.650" style="s2">how many of you have seen that yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:52.800" style="s2">know that movie I take it yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.650" end="00:03:54.989" style="s2">about the people I grew up with so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.800" end="00:03:58.019" style="s2">that&#39;s true man I&#39;m telling you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.989" end="00:04:01.010" style="s2">true so the the guy the main actor in</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.019" end="00:04:04.230" style="s2">fubar who&#39;s quite bright but completely</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.010" end="00:04:06.090" style="s2">uncivilized gets testicular cancer and</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.230" end="00:04:07.890" style="s2">there&#39;s one great scene where he gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.090" end="00:04:10.860" style="s2">far too drunk and he&#39;s stumbling around</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.890" end="00:04:12.750" style="s2">the street you know in in a virtually</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.860" end="00:04:14.370" style="s2">comatose state and of course he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.750" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">very thrilled with what&#39;s happened to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.370" end="00:04:18.390" style="s2">him and he&#39;s shaking his fist at the sky</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:21.299" style="s2">it&#39;s pouring rain and he&#39;s cursing God</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.390" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s like well you can kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.299" end="00:04:25.650" style="s2">of understand his position so that kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">of reminded me of these people who were</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.650" end="00:04:29.580" style="s2">yelling at this guy you know they were</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.919" style="s2">basically they were out dramatizing the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.580" end="00:04:34.620" style="s2">idea of in rape they were enraged at</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.919" end="00:04:36.479" style="s2">well you could say god of course most of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.620" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">them wouldn&#39;t say that but but they were</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.479" end="00:04:41.640" style="s2">the ones yelling at the damn sky I mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:43.020" style="s2">you know so you got a he got a look at</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.640" end="00:04:43.350" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing rather than what they</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.020" end="00:04:45.870" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.350" end="00:04:47.910" style="s2">and they were outraged that being was</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.870" end="00:04:51.750" style="s2">constructed such that Trump could have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.910" end="00:04:54.240" style="s2">arisen as president and so well so this</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.750" end="00:04:56.340" style="s2">idea you know that we can be easily</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.240" end="00:04:59.040" style="s2">turned against being and work for its</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.340" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">destruction is a really it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.040" end="00:05:04.080" style="s2">common common common theme it never goes</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:06.330" style="s2">away you see it echoed in stories like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.080" end="00:05:09.360" style="s2">with the new Marvel series for example</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.330" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">you see the enmity between Thor and Loki</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.360" end="00:05:13.350" style="s2">that&#39;s a good example of the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:15.810" style="s2">or between Batman and the Joker there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.350" end="00:05:19.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a Superman and Lex Luthor these</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:22.710" style="s2">there&#39;s these pairs of hero against</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.620" end="00:05:26.700" style="s2">villain that&#39;s a really dramatic and</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.710" end="00:05:29.820" style="s2">easily what everyone can understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.700" end="00:05:32.250" style="s2">dynamic right it&#39;s a basic plot and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.820" end="00:05:34.920" style="s2">reason it&#39;s a basic plot is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.250" end="00:05:36.660" style="s2">true of the battle within our spirits</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.920" end="00:05:38.790" style="s2">our own individual spirits it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.660" end="00:05:41.640" style="s2">within families because sibling rivalry</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.790" end="00:05:43.560" style="s2">can be unbelievably brutal it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.640" end="00:05:45.840" style="s2">between human beings who are strangers</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.560" end="00:05:48.300" style="s2">it&#39;s true between groups of people like</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.840" end="00:05:51.720" style="s2">it&#39;s true at every level of analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.300" end="00:05:54.990" style="s2">then in some sense it&#39;s it&#39;s archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.720" end="00:05:57.210" style="s2">true at least with regards to deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.990" end="00:05:59.640" style="s2">religious symbolism because you see that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.210" end="00:06:01.530" style="s2">echoed in many stories as well so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.640" end="00:06:03.480" style="s2">think the clearest representation is</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.530" end="00:06:05.910" style="s2">probably Christ and Satan that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.480" end="00:06:08.700" style="s2">closest to a pure archetype although</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.910" end="00:06:11.910" style="s2">there&#39;s in the old Egyptian stories</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.700" end="00:06:15.180" style="s2">there&#39;s Osiris and Seth or Horus and</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.910" end="00:06:18.450" style="s2">Seth and Seth is a precursor to Satan</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:20.280" style="s2">etymologically so it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.450" end="00:06:22.260" style="s2">common motif and so that&#39;s what happens</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.280" end="00:06:24.420" style="s2">again in Rebecca&#39;s womb is that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.260" end="00:06:30.240" style="s2">thing this idea is played out right away</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.420" end="00:06:33.230" style="s2">and the two two twins are actually what</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.240" end="00:06:37.320" style="s2">would you call it there they have a</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.230" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">superordinate destiny because one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.320" end="00:06:42.960" style="s2">them is destined to become the father of</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:45.390" style="s2">Israel and of course that&#39;s a pinnacle</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.960" end="00:06:48.540" style="s2">moment in the Old Testament obviously</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.390" end="00:06:51.690" style="s2">and arguably a pinnacle moment in human</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.540" end="00:06:53.370" style="s2">history now you know degree to which the</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.690" end="00:06:54.720" style="s2">stories in the Old Testament actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.370" end="00:06:56.940" style="s2">constitute what we would consider</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.940" end="00:07:03.300" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t matter in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.970" end="00:07:06.090" style="s2">because as I mentioned I think before in</p>

<p begin="00:07:06.090" end="00:07:13.200" style="s2">are forms of fiction that are met a true</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.720" style="s2">generally think they are based on the</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.720" end="00:07:25.020" style="s2">simplest theory but who knows right but</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.070" end="00:07:27.960" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re more real than reality</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.020" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">itself because they abstract out the</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.510" style="s2">present them to you and that&#39;s why you</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.800" end="00:07:35.520" style="s2">watch fiction you know you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.510" end="00:07:37.830" style="s2">want you want your fiction boiled down</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.520" end="00:07:39.570" style="s2">right you want to boil down to the</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.830" end="00:07:41.700" style="s2">essence that&#39;s what makes good fiction</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.570" end="00:07:45.600" style="s2">and that essence is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.700" end="00:07:48.600" style="s2">truer than then plain old truth if it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.840" end="00:08:22.740" style="s2">to approximating so then this motif of</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.870" end="00:08:49.770" style="s2">inversion there right because as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:51.450" style="s2">discussed historically speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.770" end="00:08:54.810" style="s2">traditionally speaking it&#39;s the elder</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.810" end="00:09:02.120" style="s2">blessings flow there&#39;s some truth in</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.800" end="00:09:05.430" style="s2">that too even more</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.120" end="00:09:07.440" style="s2">what would you say more empirically iq</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.430" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">tends to decrease as the number of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.440" end="00:09:10.690" style="s2">children in the family increase the</p>

<p begin="00:09:10.690" end="00:09:14.920" style="s2">is the smartest generally speaking it</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.240" end="00:09:17.020" style="s2">isn&#39;t clear why that is but it might be</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.920" end="00:09:19.180" style="s2">that they get more attention and who</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.020" end="00:09:23.710" style="s2">knows so those of you who are younger</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.180" end="00:09:24.520" style="s2">can be very unhappy about that fact now</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.710" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.520" end="00:09:33.610" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s another there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:39.100" style="s2">plotline here too because Abraham and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.610" end="00:09:41.650" style="s2">and Rebecca are at odds at sorry Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.100" end="00:09:44.170" style="s2">and Rebecca are at odds about the</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.650" end="00:09:47.800" style="s2">children right so there&#39;s a there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.170" end="00:09:50.800" style="s2">eatable twist to it too because well</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.800" end="00:09:53.460" style="s2">Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.800" end="00:09:55.810" style="s2">to be the hunter type so he&#39;s your basic</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.460" end="00:09:58.150" style="s2">rough-and-tumble character you know and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.810" end="00:10:00.190" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a wild looking guy he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.150" end="00:10:02.080" style="s2">Harry and he likes to be outside he</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.190" end="00:10:04.000" style="s2">lives in tents he likes to hunt he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.080" end="00:10:04.450" style="s2">man&#39;s man that&#39;s one way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.000" end="00:10:06.970" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.450" end="00:10:08.730" style="s2">whereas Jacob dwells in tents you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.970" end="00:10:10.870" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t go outside much he&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.730" end="00:10:12.840" style="s2">well maybe he&#39;s more introverted but</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.870" end="00:10:15.880" style="s2">he&#39;s certainly this sort of kid</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.840" end="00:10:18.340" style="s2">adolescent say who hangs around home and</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.880" end="00:10:19.870" style="s2">it there&#39;s some intimation that he&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.340" end="00:10:22.300" style="s2">mud well he&#39;s clearly his mother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.870" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">favorite and with all the advantages and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.300" end="00:10:27.670" style="s2">I suppose disadvantage does go along</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">with that and Isaac and Rebecca don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.670" end="00:10:33.460" style="s2">see eye-to-eye about who should have</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:39.180" style="s2">predominance among the sons and Rebecca</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.460" end="00:10:41.650" style="s2">is quite complicit with Jacob in</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.180" end="00:10:43.960" style="s2">inverting the social order so the first</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.650" end="00:10:49.000" style="s2">thing that happens that&#39;s crooked is</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.960" end="00:10:50.470" style="s2">that Esau comes in from hunting and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.000" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">you know maybe he&#39;s been out for a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.470" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">number of days and he&#39;s ravenous and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of an impulsive guy doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:10:59.980" style="s2">really seem to think about the long term</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.800" end="00:11:04.089" style="s2">very much and Jacob was cooking some</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.980" end="00:11:07.450" style="s2">lentil stew and Esau I want some of it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.089" end="00:11:10.780" style="s2">and Jacob refuses and and then says that</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.450" end="00:11:16.030" style="s2">he&#39;ll trade his his birthright for it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.780" end="00:11:19.390" style="s2">and Esau agrees which is a bad deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.030" end="00:11:21.700" style="s2">right it&#39;s a bad deal and so you you</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.390" end="00:11:22.780" style="s2">could say that Esau actually deserves</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.700" end="00:11:25.380" style="s2">what&#39;s coming to him</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.780" end="00:11:27.940" style="s2">although</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.380" end="00:11:30.070" style="s2">at minimum you&#39;d have to think of them</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.940" end="00:11:30.970" style="s2">both as being equally culpable it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.070" end="00:11:35.370" style="s2">nasty trick</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.970" end="00:11:41.110" style="s2">and so that&#39;s Jacob&#39;s first trick and</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.370" end="00:11:44.500" style="s2">then the second trick is that it&#39;s later</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.110" end="00:11:47.470" style="s2">and Isaac is old and blind and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.500" end="00:11:50.260" style="s2">close to death and it&#39;s time for him to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.470" end="00:11:52.029" style="s2">bestow a blessing on his sons which is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.260" end="00:11:57.279" style="s2">very important event apparently among</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.029" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">these ancient people and Esau again is</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.279" end="00:12:03.130" style="s2">out hunting and Rachel dress dress is</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.839" style="s2">Jacob up in a hairy it puts a goat skin</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.130" end="00:12:07.420" style="s2">on his arm so he&#39;s kind of hairy like</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.839" end="00:12:10.990" style="s2">Esau and dresses him and Esau is closed</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.420" end="00:12:14.710" style="s2">so he smells like he&#39;s so and Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.990" end="00:12:17.790" style="s2">tells Esau to go out and hunt him up</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.710" end="00:12:20.620" style="s2">some some venison I think it is and</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.790" end="00:12:23.080" style="s2">which is a favorite of his and Rebekah</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.620" end="00:12:27.250" style="s2">has Jacob cook up a couple of goat kids</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.080" end="00:12:30.550" style="s2">and serve that to Isaac and play the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.250" end="00:12:32.830" style="s2">role of Esau and so he does that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.550" end="00:12:35.710" style="s2">pretty net damn nasty really all things</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.830" end="00:12:37.450" style="s2">considered you know to play a trick like</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.710" end="00:12:40.570" style="s2">that both on your brother and on your</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.450" end="00:12:42.370" style="s2">blind father and the inclusion with your</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.570" end="00:12:44.170" style="s2">mother it&#39;s not the sort of thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.370" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">really designed to promote a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.170" end="00:12:49.630" style="s2">familial harmony and so especially</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:51.510" style="s2">because you&#39;ve already screwed him over</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.630" end="00:12:54.990" style="s2">in a big way once you know you&#39;d think</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.510" end="00:12:58.150" style="s2">you&#39;d think that would be sufficient so</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.990" end="00:13:01.030" style="s2">anyways he&#39;s successful and Esau loses</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.150" end="00:13:02.890" style="s2">his father&#39;s blessing and so that Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.030" end="00:13:04.240" style="s2">ends up really in the position of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.890" end="00:13:07.060" style="s2">firstborn and it&#39;s quite interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.240" end="00:13:09.339" style="s2">because you know God tells Rachel that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.060" end="00:13:11.820" style="s2">Jacob is going to be the dominant twin</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.339" end="00:13:14.200" style="s2">and you&#39;d think again with God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.820" end="00:13:16.750" style="s2">blessing or at least the prophecy that</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.200" end="00:13:19.000" style="s2">Jacob would end up being a good guy but</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.750" end="00:13:20.200" style="s2">he&#39;s certainly not presented that way to</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.000" end="00:13:21.940" style="s2">begin with which is also quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.200" end="00:13:23.830" style="s2">interesting given that he&#39;s the eventual</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.940" end="00:13:26.230" style="s2">founder of Israel and it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.830" end="00:13:28.240" style="s2">indication of the realism of these old</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.230" end="00:13:29.860" style="s2">stories you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.240" end="00:13:33.010" style="s2">amazing to me it&#39;s always been quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.860" end="00:13:35.140" style="s2">amazing to me how unpretty fight these</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.010" end="00:13:37.390" style="s2">stories have remained you know because</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.140" end="00:13:38.230" style="s2">you&#39;d think that if you&#39;re even the</p>

<p begin="00:13:38.230" end="00:13:41.980" style="s2">especially if you had the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:13:54.460" end="00:13:59.290" style="s2">interpretation is because the stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.800" end="00:14:01.840" style="s2">would be a lot prettier if that was the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.290" end="00:14:05.980" style="s2">case these characters wouldn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.840" end="00:14:08.140" style="s2">strange realistic moral ambiguity about</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.980" end="00:14:11.530" style="s2">them you know if you&#39;re gonna feed</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.140" end="00:14:13.720" style="s2">people a fantasy then it you want it to</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.530" end="00:14:15.910" style="s2">be like a Harlequin novel or or our</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.720" end="00:14:18.190" style="s2">greeting card or something like that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.910" end="00:14:20.290" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to be a story that&#39;s full</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.190" end="00:14:22.360" style="s2">of betrayal and deceit and murder and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.290" end="00:14:24.060" style="s2">mayhem and genocide and all of that if</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.360" end="00:14:26.890" style="s2">that just doesn&#39;t seem all that</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.060" end="00:14:28.630" style="s2">what would you say calming I guess would</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.890" end="00:14:32.530" style="s2">be the right right answer</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.630" end="00:14:35.800" style="s2">so anyways Jacob gets away with this but</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.530" end="00:14:37.870" style="s2">Esau is not happy and and Jacob is quite</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.800" end="00:14:39.670" style="s2">convinced that he might kill him and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.870" end="00:14:41.320" style="s2">think that was a reasonable fear because</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.670" end="00:14:43.480" style="s2">he saw was a tough guy and he was used</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.320" end="00:14:45.550" style="s2">to being outside and he knew how to hunt</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.480" end="00:14:47.040" style="s2">and he knew how to kill and he actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.550" end="00:14:50.020" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very happy about getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.040" end="00:14:52.630" style="s2">seriously screwed over by his you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.020" end="00:14:55.960" style="s2">stay-at-home younger brother twice and</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.630" end="00:14:58.180" style="s2">so Jacob runs off and goes to visit his</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.960" end="00:15:00.910" style="s2">uncle and on the way and this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.180" end="00:15:05.200" style="s2">interesting part of this story he stops</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.910" end="00:15:07.540" style="s2">and to sleep and he takes a stone for a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.200" end="00:15:10.870" style="s2">pillow and then he has this vision it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.540" end="00:15:13.750" style="s2">called a dream but the context makes it</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.870" end="00:15:17.260" style="s2">look like a vision of a ladder reaching</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.750" end="00:15:20.280" style="s2">up to heaven and with angels moving up</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.260" end="00:15:22.570" style="s2">and down the the ladder let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.280" end="00:15:24.490" style="s2">there&#39;s some representations of that I</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.570" end="00:15:27.430" style="s2">showed you some of them the last time we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.490" end="00:15:29.230" style="s2">met but I&#39;ll read it to you first he</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.430" end="00:15:30.820" style="s2">lighted upon a certain place and Ty read</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.230" end="00:15:32.380" style="s2">there all night because the Sun was set</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.820" end="00:15:34.330" style="s2">and he took of the stones of that place</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.380" end="00:15:36.610" style="s2">and put them for his pillows and lay</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.330" end="00:15:39.190" style="s2">down in that place to sleep and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.610" end="00:15:41.020" style="s2">dreamed and beheld a ladder set up on</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.190" end="00:15:42.940" style="s2">the earth and the top of it reached to</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.020" end="00:15:44.950" style="s2">heaven and behold the angels of God</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.940" end="00:15:46.990" style="s2">ascending and descending on it and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.950" end="00:15:48.940" style="s2">behold the Lord stood above it and said</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.990" end="00:15:51.510" style="s2">I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.940" end="00:15:53.850" style="s2">and the god of Isaac</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.510" end="00:15:56.130" style="s2">land whereon thou liest to thee I will</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.850" end="00:15:57.600" style="s2">give it and to thy seed and thy seed</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.130" end="00:15:59.400" style="s2">shall be as the dust of the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.600" end="00:16:00.780" style="s2">thou shalt spread abroad to the west and</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.400" end="00:16:02.910" style="s2">to the east and to the north and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.780" end="00:16:05.310" style="s2">south so that lays out the canonical</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.910" end="00:16:07.560" style="s2">directions right so now there&#39;s a center</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.310" end="00:16:08.880" style="s2">with the canonical directions like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.560" end="00:16:11.130" style="s2">thing that you see you know that little</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.880" end="00:16:13.830" style="s2">symbol you see on maps it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.130" end="00:16:15.720" style="s2">thing that symbolically placed upon the</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.830" end="00:16:19.800" style="s2">earth so a center has been established</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.720" end="00:16:22.740" style="s2">with radiating well with with what with</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:27.240" style="s2">with directional lines radiating from it</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.740" end="00:16:29.010" style="s2">so it establishes as a place and in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.240" end="00:16:30.900" style="s2">end I seed shall all the families of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.010" end="00:16:32.760" style="s2">earth be blessed so that&#39;s pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.900" end="00:16:35.040" style="s2">news for Jacob and it&#39;s not self-evident</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.760" end="00:16:37.200" style="s2">why God is rewarding him for running</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.040" end="00:16:39.600" style="s2">away after screwing over his brother but</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.200" end="00:16:41.910" style="s2">that seems to be what happens and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.600" end="00:16:45.150" style="s2">here&#39;s a couple of representations</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.910" end="00:16:46.590" style="s2">classic representations the one on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.150" end="00:16:49.770" style="s2">right is William Blake is what I</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.590" end="00:16:53.820" style="s2">particularly like you know and Blake</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.770" end="00:16:57.770" style="s2">assimilates God with the Sun and with</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.820" end="00:17:00.270" style="s2">light right so that&#39;s quite a common</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.770" end="00:17:08.370" style="s2">mythological idea that that God is</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.270" end="00:17:09.690" style="s2">associated with light and the day behold</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.370" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">I am with thee and will keep thee in all</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.690" end="00:17:13.380" style="s2">places whither thou goest and will bring</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:15.570" style="s2">me again into this land for I will not</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.380" end="00:17:17.430" style="s2">leave thee until I have done that which</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.570" end="00:17:18.750" style="s2">I have spoken to thee of and Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.430" end="00:17:21.209" style="s2">awaked out of his sleep and he said</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.750" end="00:17:23.520" style="s2">surely the Lord is in this place and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.209" end="00:17:26.430" style="s2">knew it not and he was afraid which is</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.520" end="00:17:28.860" style="s2">exactly the right response and said how</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.430" end="00:17:30.450" style="s2">dreadful is this place it is none other</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.860" end="00:17:33.060" style="s2">than the house of God and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.450" end="00:17:34.440" style="s2">gate of heaven and Jacob rose up early</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.060" end="00:17:36.300" style="s2">in the morning and took the stone that</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.440" end="00:17:38.580" style="s2">he had put for his pillows and set it up</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.300" end="00:17:40.440" style="s2">for a pillar and poured oil on the top</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.580" end="00:17:42.660" style="s2">of it and that&#39;s that&#39;s a more important</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.440" end="00:17:45.210" style="s2">thing than you think and we&#39;ll go into</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.660" end="00:17:46.950" style="s2">that a little bit more deeply because up</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.210" end="00:17:47.910" style="s2">to this point in this story there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.950" end="00:17:50.070" style="s2">anything really</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.910" end="00:17:52.440" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anything that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.070" end="00:17:54.120" style="s2">emerged to mark a sacred space right</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.440" end="00:17:56.220" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no cathedral there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.120" end="00:17:58.410" style="s2">no Church there&#39;s nothing like that but</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.220" end="00:18:01.110" style="s2">here&#39;s this idea that emerges that you</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.410" end="00:18:02.520" style="s2">can mark the center of something that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.110" end="00:18:03.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s important and you mark it</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.520" end="00:18:05.730" style="s2">with a stone</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.960" end="00:18:07.260" style="s2">and stones a good way to mark things</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.730" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">that that are important because the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.260" end="00:18:11.010" style="s2">stone is permanent right and we mark</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:13.140" style="s2">things with stones now like we mark</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.010" end="00:18:15.480" style="s2">graves with stones for example because</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.140" end="00:18:17.280" style="s2">we want to make a memory and to carve</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.480" end="00:18:18.600" style="s2">something into stone to carve a stone</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.280" end="00:18:21.180" style="s2">and then to carve something into stone</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.600" end="00:18:22.920" style="s2">is to make a memory and to use stone is</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.180" end="00:18:25.290" style="s2">to make a memory because stone is</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.920" end="00:18:29.040" style="s2">permanent and to set it up right is to</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.290" end="00:18:30.990" style="s2">to indicate a center and so that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.040" end="00:18:33.150" style="s2">happens and pours oil on the top of it</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.990" end="00:18:35.100" style="s2">which is kind of offering and he called</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.150" end="00:18:36.660" style="s2">the name of that place Bethel but the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.100" end="00:18:39.990" style="s2">name of the city was called Las at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.660" end="00:18:41.760" style="s2">first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.990" end="00:18:43.230" style="s2">God will be with me and will keep me in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.760" end="00:18:51.930" style="s2">this way that I go and will give me</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.230" end="00:18:54.990" style="s2">bread to eat and raiment to put on then</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.930" end="00:18:58.650" style="s2">a tenth of what I earned I will give him</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.990" end="00:19:00.420" style="s2">I missed that that&#39;s interesting too</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.650" end="00:19:03.320" style="s2">because now there&#39;s a transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.420" end="00:19:05.190" style="s2">sacrifice right because until that point</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.320" end="00:19:07.230" style="s2">sacrifices have had been pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.190" end="00:19:07.830" style="s2">concretize dit was the burning of</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.230" end="00:19:09.960" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.830" end="00:19:15.060" style="s2">whereas here all of a sudden it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.960" end="00:19:17.490" style="s2">offering of of productive labor per se</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.060" end="00:19:18.840" style="s2">like a tithe because it tithe is a form</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.490" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">of sacrifice and so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.840" end="00:19:23.250" style="s2">abstraction of the idea of sacrifice no</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:26.610" style="s2">sacrifice it&#39;s really important that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.250" end="00:19:28.770" style="s2">idea of sacrifice gets abstracted right</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.610" end="00:19:31.350" style="s2">because it should be abstracted to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.770" end="00:19:33.090" style="s2">point where it&#39;s it&#39;s used the way that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.350" end="00:19:34.800" style="s2">we use it today which is you know we</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.090" end="00:19:37.110" style="s2">make sacrifices to get ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.800" end="00:19:40.350" style="s2">everyone understands what that means but</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.110" end="00:19:43.290" style="s2">the sacrifices are generally some</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.350" end="00:19:45.930" style="s2">combination of psychological and and and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.290" end="00:19:48.870" style="s2">practical so we&#39;re not acting them out</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.930" end="00:19:50.550" style="s2">we&#39;re precisely we&#39;re not dramatizing</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.870" end="00:19:52.830" style="s2">them at ritualizing and we actually act</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.550" end="00:19:55.590" style="s2">them out in our in the covenant that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.830" end="00:19:57.330" style="s2">make with the future and we do that well</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.590" end="00:19:59.610" style="s2">unless we&#39;re extraordinarily impulsive</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.330" end="00:20:01.620" style="s2">and aimless in our lives and have really</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.610" end="00:20:04.050" style="s2">no conception whatsoever of the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.620" end="00:20:05.730" style="s2">and are likely to sacrifice the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.050" end="00:20:10.050" style="s2">for the present which is it what he saw</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.730" end="00:20:12.630" style="s2">does right then we make sacrifices and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.050" end="00:20:15.510" style="s2">you got to think like the idea of making</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.630" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">sacrifices to make the future better is</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.510" end="00:20:17.770" style="s2">an extraordinarily difficult lesson to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:19.990" style="s2">learn</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.770" end="00:20:23.560" style="s2">it took people god only knows how long</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.990" end="00:20:26.110" style="s2">to learn that you know like we have no</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.560" end="00:20:29.020" style="s2">idea it&#39;s not something that animals do</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.110" end="00:20:31.270" style="s2">easily chimpanzees don&#39;t store leftover</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.020" end="00:20:32.740" style="s2">meat you know they just and neither do</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.270" end="00:20:35.500" style="s2">wolves they just a wolf can eat about</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.740" end="00:20:37.240" style="s2">thirty pounds of meat in one sitting and</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.500" end="00:20:39.190" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s where the idea of wolfing</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.240" end="00:20:40.930" style="s2">it down comes from they&#39;re not hiding it</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.190" end="00:20:44.110" style="s2">saving it for later you know they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.930" end="00:20:46.690" style="s2">do that so they can&#39;t sacrifice the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.110" end="00:20:49.660" style="s2">present for the future so this is a big</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.690" end="00:20:51.160" style="s2">deal that this that this happens now I</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.660" end="00:20:53.950" style="s2">want to tell you a little bit about the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.160" end="00:20:58.690" style="s2">idea of the pillar because it&#39;s it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.950" end="00:21:01.120" style="s2">unbelievably deep idea and it Orient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.690" end="00:21:03.250" style="s2">us in ways that we still don&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.120" end="00:21:06.160" style="s2">still orienting us in ways that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.250" end="00:21:09.400" style="s2">understand and in fact it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.160" end="00:21:11.440" style="s2">mechanism by which we&#39;re oriented or and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.400" end="00:21:13.780" style="s2">if it&#39;s lacking then we become</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.440" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">disoriented and so I&#39;ll show you some</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.780" end="00:21:19.420" style="s2">pictures and describe them first okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:21.610" style="s2">first of all there&#39;s a walled city so</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.420" end="00:21:23.290" style="s2">let me tell you that you could think</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.610" end="00:21:25.570" style="s2">about that as an archetypal human</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.290" end="00:21:28.330" style="s2">habitation maybe it&#39;s a reflection of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.570" end="00:21:31.390" style="s2">something like a fire in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.330" end="00:21:32.680" style="s2">the plain or the forest or the jungle</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.390" end="00:21:35.470" style="s2">for that matter although it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.680" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">hard to get a fire going there imagine a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.470" end="00:21:40.270" style="s2">fire ringed around with logs and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:42.430" style="s2">ringed around with dwellings right so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.270" end="00:21:44.710" style="s2">the fire is in the center and the fire</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.430" end="00:21:46.330" style="s2">defines the center and then as you move</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.710" end="00:21:49.260" style="s2">away from the fire you move out into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.330" end="00:21:52.420" style="s2">darkness right so the fire is light and</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.260" end="00:21:54.040" style="s2">communion and safety and as you move</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.420" end="00:21:56.470" style="s2">away from the fire you move out into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.040" end="00:21:58.390" style="s2">darkness and what&#39;s terrifying out</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.470" end="00:22:00.190" style="s2">beyond the perimeter so what&#39;s beyond</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.390" end="00:22:01.810" style="s2">the perimeter is terrifying you can feel</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.190" end="00:22:03.580" style="s2">that if you go camping somewhere that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.810" end="00:22:04.930" style="s2">wild you know you&#39;re pretty damn happy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.580" end="00:22:07.900" style="s2">especially if the wolves are howling</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.930" end="00:22:09.820" style="s2">you&#39;re pretty damn happy to be sitting</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.900" end="00:22:13.000" style="s2">by the fire because you can see there</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.820" end="00:22:15.640" style="s2">the fire keeps the animals away and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.000" end="00:22:17.410" style="s2">know if you do wander into the bush into</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.640" end="00:22:19.570" style="s2">the darkness then you&#39;re on alert and</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.410" end="00:22:22.090" style="s2">you know you&#39;re predator detection</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.570" end="00:22:23.970" style="s2">systems are on alert and so you could</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.090" end="00:22:27.610" style="s2">think about the classical human</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.970" end="00:22:30.659" style="s2">habitation as two places one where your</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.610" end="00:22:32.249" style="s2">predator detection system isn&#39;t on alert</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.659" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">another where your predator textured</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.249" end="00:22:36.869" style="s2">detection system is alert on alert and</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:38.489" style="s2">you could think about that roughly as</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.869" end="00:22:41.309" style="s2">the distinction between explored</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.489" end="00:22:44.549" style="s2">territory and unexplored territory and</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.309" end="00:22:46.739" style="s2">really the the founding of a place is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.549" end="00:22:48.840" style="s2">precisely this is a lot of this I got</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.739" end="00:22:50.669" style="s2">from reading your chair le ah de the</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.840" end="00:22:54.869" style="s2">founding of a place is precisely the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.669" end="00:22:57.989" style="s2">definition of a explored center set</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.869" end="00:22:59.549" style="s2">against the unexplored periphery and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.989" end="00:23:01.019" style="s2">know what&#39;s interesting about that so</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.549" end="00:23:02.460" style="s2">you can kind of think about that with</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.019" end="00:23:05.749" style="s2">regards to the walled city right</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.460" end="00:23:09.529" style="s2">everything in the wall is cosmos and</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.749" end="00:23:12.169" style="s2">everything outside the wall is chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.529" end="00:23:15.090" style="s2">you know but it also extends to the</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.169" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">conceptual realm because imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.090" end="00:23:19.619" style="s2">you&#39;re the master of a field of study</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:21.809" style="s2">and so that&#39;s an interesting metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.619" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">because a field is a geographical</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.809" end="00:23:26.820" style="s2">metaphor right and if in the center of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:29.009" style="s2">the field are those things that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.820" end="00:23:32.849" style="s2">knows really well the axioms that</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.009" end="00:23:34.739" style="s2">everyone abides by in the field and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.849" end="00:23:37.349" style="s2">as you move towards the fringes you get</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.739" end="00:23:40.619" style="s2">to work towards the unknown towards the</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.349" end="00:23:42.269" style="s2">frontier of the discipline and as you</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.619" end="00:23:44.460" style="s2">become expert you move from the center</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.269" end="00:23:47.070" style="s2">to the frontier and so then you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.460" end="00:23:49.080" style="s2">the border when you&#39;re when you&#39;re when</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.070" end="00:23:50.460" style="s2">you&#39;re a scholar a competent school</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.080" end="00:23:53.249" style="s2">you&#39;re on the border between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.460" end="00:23:55.109" style="s2">unexplored or the explored and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.249" end="00:23:56.820" style="s2">unexplored and you&#39;re trying to further</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.109" end="00:23:59.759" style="s2">that border so even if you&#39;re just doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.820" end="00:24:02.489" style="s2">this abstractly it&#39;s the same thing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.759" end="00:24:06.059" style="s2">it&#39;s a reflection of the fact that every</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.489" end="00:24:08.359" style="s2">human environment concrete or abstract</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.059" end="00:24:12.989" style="s2">it makes no difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.359" end="00:24:15.899" style="s2">recapitulates the cosmos chaos dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.989" end="00:24:18.389" style="s2">or the order chaos dichotomy and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.899" end="00:24:19.950" style="s2">why in Taoism for example it&#39;s the union</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.389" end="00:24:22.739" style="s2">of chaos and order that constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.950" end="00:24:25.289" style="s2">being itself and that you stand on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.739" end="00:24:27.570" style="s2">border between chaos and order because</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.289" end="00:24:30.570" style="s2">that&#39;s the proper place to be to orderly</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.570" end="00:24:32.729" style="s2">to much in the explored you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.570" end="00:24:34.710" style="s2">learning anything too much out there</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.729" end="00:24:37.109" style="s2">where the Predators lurk then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.710" end="00:24:41.639" style="s2">frozen with terror and neither of those</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.109" end="00:24:43.710" style="s2">positions are desirable so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.639" end="00:24:44.370" style="s2">what you know and so you think and this</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.710" end="00:24:46.320" style="s2">is a concur</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.370" end="00:24:48.450" style="s2">reality obviously as well as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.320" end="00:24:52.020" style="s2">psychological reality there were reasons</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.450" end="00:24:54.390" style="s2">for those walls right because inside the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.020" end="00:24:56.520" style="s2">walls where all the people like us and</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.390" end="00:24:59.280" style="s2">so that begs the question what does it</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.520" end="00:25:01.050" style="s2">mean for people to be like us and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.280" end="00:25:04.350" style="s2">outside the wall there rose all those</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.050" end="00:25:06.150" style="s2">people because they were the worst forms</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.350" end="00:25:09.090" style="s2">of predators because people are actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.150" end="00:25:12.000" style="s2">the worst forms of predators who aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.090" end="00:25:14.850" style="s2">like us and the wall is there to draw a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.000" end="00:25:17.520" style="s2">distinction between like us and not like</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.850" end="00:25:19.860" style="s2">us and so and that was a matter of life</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.520" end="00:25:22.050" style="s2">and death if you can tell that because I</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.860" end="00:25:24.270" style="s2">mean look at those walls they had to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.050" end="00:25:26.670" style="s2">build those by hand and you know you do</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.270" end="00:25:29.880" style="s2">see walled cities that have three rings</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.670" end="00:25:32.400" style="s2">of walls so these people were terrified</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.880" end="00:25:34.230" style="s2">but not so terrified as the people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.400" end="00:25:37.910" style="s2">built three walls they were really</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.230" end="00:25:45.830" style="s2">terrified and they had their reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.910" end="00:25:48.990" style="s2">okay so now there&#39;s an idea that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.830" end="00:25:53.670" style="s2">that&#39;s reflected in the Jacob&#39;s Ladder</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.990" end="00:25:55.620" style="s2">story that the center where you put the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.670" end="00:25:59.220" style="s2">pillar is also the place where heaven</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.620" end="00:26:01.410" style="s2">and earth touch and so that&#39;s that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.220" end="00:26:03.990" style="s2">complicated idea I think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.410" end="00:26:05.370" style="s2">you know I&#39;m trying to look at these</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.990" end="00:26:08.220" style="s2">stories from a psychological perspective</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.370" end="00:26:10.080" style="s2">and so then you could say that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.220" end="00:26:13.380" style="s2">symbolic place where the lowest and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.080" end="00:26:17.490" style="s2">highest come together and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.380" end="00:26:19.130" style="s2">place where earthly being stretches up</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.490" end="00:26:21.540" style="s2">to the highest possible ethical</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.130" end="00:26:24.120" style="s2">abstraction and that&#39;s the center</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.540" end="00:26:27.840" style="s2">because one of the things that defines</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.120" end="00:26:32.220" style="s2">us say as opposed to them is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.840" end="00:26:35.010" style="s2">all united within a certain ethic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.220" end="00:26:39.320" style="s2">what makes us the same this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.010" end="00:26:39.320" style="s2">complicated line of reasoning and but</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.650" end="00:26:43.890" style="s2">I&#39;ll go back to it after I show you some</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.210" end="00:26:46.020" style="s2">more pictures but so that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.890" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">first idea is that the center is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.020" end="00:26:51.059" style="s2">place where the lowest and the highest</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:53.340" style="s2">touch simultaneously and so you could</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.059" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">say that in some sense it specifies the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.340" end="00:26:57.540" style="s2">aim of a group of people that&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:58.169" style="s2">way you know if you get together with</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.540" end="00:27:00.659" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.169" end="00:27:02.539" style="s2">make a group even at work you group</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.659" end="00:27:04.919" style="s2">yourself around a project and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.539" end="00:27:06.059" style="s2">unites you and it unites you because you</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.919" end="00:27:08.429" style="s2">all have the same aim you&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.059" end="00:27:10.259" style="s2">pointing to the same thing and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.429" end="00:27:12.899" style="s2">makes you the same in some ways because</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.259" end="00:27:13.950" style="s2">if you&#39;re after the same thing I am then</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.899" end="00:27:15.389" style="s2">the same things are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.950" end="00:27:17.039" style="s2">important to you that are important to</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.389" end="00:27:18.600" style="s2">me and the same things are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.039" end="00:27:20.190" style="s2">negative to you that are negative to me</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.600" end="00:27:22.169" style="s2">because our emotions work out that way</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.190" end="00:27:24.210" style="s2">and that means I can instantly predict</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.169" end="00:27:26.519" style="s2">you I know how you&#39;re going to behave</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.210" end="00:27:28.350" style="s2">and so our aim which is basically our</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.519" end="00:27:30.929" style="s2">ethical aim it&#39;s because we&#39;re aiming at</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.350" end="00:27:33.179" style="s2">something better at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.929" end="00:27:35.249" style="s2">we&#39;re aiming at something better so our</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.179" end="00:27:37.169" style="s2">ethical aim that unites our perceptions</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.249" end="00:27:39.239" style="s2">and that&#39;s what aligns our emotions and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.169" end="00:27:40.789" style="s2">so that sort of begs the question if</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.239" end="00:27:44.269" style="s2">you&#39;re going to build a community around</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.789" end="00:27:47.730" style="s2">what aim should the community congregate</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.269" end="00:27:49.049" style="s2">okay so the idea here is that the center</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.730" end="00:27:50.789" style="s2">of the community is the pillar that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.049" end="00:27:52.679" style="s2">unites heaven and earth so it unites the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.789" end="00:27:54.840" style="s2">lowest with the highest so there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.679" end="00:27:58.649" style="s2">intimation of the idea that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.840" end="00:28:02.009" style="s2">highest that unites the community okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.649" end="00:28:04.409" style="s2">and so keep that in mind and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.009" end="00:28:06.690" style="s2">very old idea as well that&#39;s the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.409" end="00:28:08.489" style="s2">the axis mundi which is the center pole</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.690" end="00:28:11.129" style="s2">that unites heaven and earth it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.489" end="00:28:13.109" style="s2">unbelievably old idea tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.129" end="00:28:17.159" style="s2">of years old it might even stretch back</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.109" end="00:28:17.909" style="s2">to whatever our archaic memories quasi</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.159" end="00:28:19.739" style="s2">memories</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.909" end="00:28:22.639" style="s2">I don&#39;t know how what you would describe</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.739" end="00:28:25.440" style="s2">them archetypal memories of our</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.639" end="00:28:28.019" style="s2">excessively old ancestry and trees when</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.440" end="00:28:30.539" style="s2">the tree itself was in fact the center</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.019" end="00:28:34.320" style="s2">of the world and that it was ringed by</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.539" end="00:28:36.119" style="s2">snakes and chaos and so well we have no</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.320" end="00:28:38.549" style="s2">idea how old these ideas are but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.119" end="00:28:41.220" style="s2">very very old and evolution is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.549" end="00:28:44.940" style="s2">conservative business once it builds a</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.220" end="00:28:46.679" style="s2">gadget then it builds new things on top</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.940" end="00:28:48.389" style="s2">of that gadgets like a medieval town</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.679" end="00:28:52.559" style="s2">right the center of the town is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.389" end="00:28:54.210" style="s2">old and new newer areas of the town get</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.559" end="00:28:56.129" style="s2">built around it but the center is still</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.210" end="00:28:59.879" style="s2">really old and that&#39;s what we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.129" end="00:29:03.259" style="s2">you know our platforms like our our</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.879" end="00:29:06.929" style="s2">basic physiological structure this this</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.259" end="00:29:09.059" style="s2">skeletal body is some tens of millions</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.929" end="00:29:10.649" style="s2">of years old or older than that if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.059" end="00:29:11.450" style="s2">think about vertebrates it&#39;s much older</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.649" end="00:29:15.740" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.450" end="00:29:17.870" style="s2">and that&#39;s all conserved so everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.740" end="00:29:19.669" style="s2">built on top of everything else alright</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.870" end="00:29:23.299" style="s2">so there there&#39;s a kind of a classic</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.669" end="00:29:25.370" style="s2">town and there&#39;s the idea I showed you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.299" end="00:29:26.960" style="s2">this is Scandinavian World Tree same</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.370" end="00:29:29.299" style="s2">idea at unites heaven and earth and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.960" end="00:29:31.700" style="s2">around the roots of that tree are snakes</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.299" end="00:29:34.490" style="s2">that eat this tree constantly so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.700" end="00:29:36.769" style="s2">the idea that there&#39;s stability but</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.490" end="00:29:39.769" style="s2">there&#39;s constant transformation around</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.769" end="00:29:41.080" style="s2">that stability and at the same time the</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.769" end="00:29:44.029" style="s2">snakes are knowing in the roots there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.080" end="00:29:46.519" style="s2">streams that are nourishing it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.029" end="00:29:48.559" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s sort of an echo of the idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.519" end="00:29:51.139" style="s2">that life depends on death and renewal</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.559" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">constantly because your cells are dying</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.139" end="00:29:55.789" style="s2">and being renewed constantly right if</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:29:57.860" style="s2">they are just proliferating then you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.789" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">have cancer if they&#39;re just dying then</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.860" end="00:30:02.299" style="s2">you die it you have to get the balance</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.080" end="00:30:04.250" style="s2">between death and life exactly right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.299" end="00:30:07.730" style="s2">that you can actually live which is also</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.250" end="00:30:10.100" style="s2">a very strange thing so and that tree is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.730" end="00:30:12.200" style="s2">something that reaches from the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.100" end="00:30:14.480" style="s2">layers of being maybe the microcosm all</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.200" end="00:30:18.080" style="s2">the way to the macrocosm that&#39;s the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.480" end="00:30:22.610" style="s2">anyways so then there&#39;s okay so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.080" end="00:30:24.529" style="s2">there&#39;s Jacob and his and his pillar</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.610" end="00:30:26.659" style="s2">he&#39;s got this idea that you can mark the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.529" end="00:30:28.309" style="s2">center with this stone like it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.659" end="00:30:29.750" style="s2">symbolizes what he was laying on when he</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.309" end="00:30:32.210" style="s2">dreamt but now he&#39;s got this idea you</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.750" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">put something erect and it marks the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.210" end="00:30:37.580" style="s2">center and it symbolizes his vision of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:40.010" style="s2">the highest good something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.580" end="00:30:43.130" style="s2">the promise that&#39;s been made to him and</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.010" end="00:30:46.789" style="s2">then this is an Egyptian obelisk the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.130" end="00:30:48.860" style="s2">pyramid on top of it that&#39;s in Paris it</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.789" end="00:30:54.279" style="s2">was taken from Luxor and it put in Paris</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.860" end="00:30:54.279" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a much more sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.970" end="00:31:00.710" style="s2">instance of the same idea okay and there</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.490" end="00:31:02.929" style="s2">was a Stone Age cultures across Eurasia</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.710" end="00:31:04.610" style="s2">that put up these huge obelisks</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.929" end="00:31:06.169" style="s2">everywhere these huge like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.610" end="00:31:07.639" style="s2">Stonehenge is a good example of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.169" end="00:31:10.970" style="s2">although it&#39;s it&#39;s very sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.639" end="00:31:12.289" style="s2">and there are also markers of places we</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.970" end="00:31:14.539" style="s2">don&#39;t know exactly what their function</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.289" end="00:31:19.340" style="s2">is but they&#39;re very much akin to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.539" end="00:31:21.980" style="s2">some permanent marker of place there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.340" end="00:31:23.870" style="s2">good one so that&#39;s in st. Peters and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.980" end="00:31:24.830" style="s2">really like this one because you can see</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.870" end="00:31:29.570" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.830" end="00:31:31.280" style="s2">echoes of jacob&#39;s vision for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.570" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">establishment of a territory there right</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.280" end="00:31:35.630" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the obelisk in the middle and</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:38.330" style="s2">then you&#39;ve got the directions radiating</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.630" end="00:31:40.160" style="s2">from the center and of course save</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.330" end="00:31:42.560" style="s2">Peters this is the st. Peter&#39;s Basilica</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.160" end="00:31:44.650" style="s2">in Rome which is an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.560" end="00:31:48.050" style="s2">unbelievable place it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.650" end="00:31:49.610" style="s2">jaw-dropping and so there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.050" end="00:31:51.500" style="s2">Cathedral at the back of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.610" end="00:31:53.540" style="s2">there&#39;s this circle of pillars that</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.500" end="00:31:56.720" style="s2">surrounds it you can just see them a</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.540" end="00:31:58.640" style="s2">little bit on on the middle left there</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.720" end="00:32:02.210" style="s2">that goes all the way around that entire</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.640" end="00:32:05.270" style="s2">enclosure and you know very large number</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.210" end="00:32:07.340" style="s2">of people can gather there and then so</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.270" end="00:32:08.990" style="s2">that pillar marks the center and that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.340" end="00:32:10.100" style="s2">would be the center of Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.990" end="00:32:12.680" style="s2">essentially that&#39;s what that represents</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.100" end="00:32:15.050" style="s2">right the the symbolic center of</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.680" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">Catholicism although you could make the</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.050" end="00:32:18.050" style="s2">case that the cathedral is the center it</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter they&#39;re very close</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.050" end="00:32:23.570" style="s2">together and it&#39;s it&#39;s half a dozen of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:26.030" style="s2">one and six or the other and then here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.570" end="00:32:28.010" style="s2">another representation of the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.030" end="00:32:29.630" style="s2">right is that this is why people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.010" end="00:32:31.790" style="s2">like the flag to be burned</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.630" end="00:32:34.550" style="s2">you know because conservative people see</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.790" end="00:32:37.490" style="s2">the flag as the sacred thing that binds</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.550" end="00:32:40.400" style="s2">people together and so they&#39;re not happy</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.490" end="00:32:42.170" style="s2">when that sacred thing is destroyed even</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.400" end="00:32:43.850" style="s2">if it&#39;s destroyed in the name of protest</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.170" end="00:32:46.340" style="s2">whereas the people who burn flags think</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.850" end="00:32:48.440" style="s2">well there are times to dramatize the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.340" end="00:32:51.560" style="s2">idea that the center has been corrupt</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.440" end="00:32:53.210" style="s2">and you can demonstrate that by putting</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.560" end="00:32:56.390" style="s2">it to the torch you know as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.210" end="00:33:00.200" style="s2">representation that that this that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.390" end="00:33:02.690" style="s2">corrupt center now has to be burned and</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.200" end="00:33:04.550" style="s2">transformed and the thing is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.690" end="00:33:06.740" style="s2">both right they&#39;re both right all the</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.550" end="00:33:08.870" style="s2">time because the center is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.740" end="00:33:11.770" style="s2">necessary and is sacred and is almost</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.870" end="00:33:14.210" style="s2">always also corrupt and in need of</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.770" end="00:33:16.550" style="s2">reparation that&#39;s also an archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.210" end="00:33:18.650" style="s2">idea and and that&#39;s a useful thing to</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.550" end="00:33:20.650" style="s2">know because you know it it&#39;s easy for</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.650" end="00:33:22.790" style="s2">young people in particular to think that</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.650" end="00:33:25.370" style="s2">well the world&#39;s going to hell in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.790" end="00:33:27.020" style="s2">handbasket and it&#39;s the pot fault of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.370" end="00:33:29.240" style="s2">last generation they&#39;ve left us this</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.020" end="00:33:30.740" style="s2">terrible mess and you know we&#39;ve feeling</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.240" end="00:33:32.450" style="s2">pretty betrayed about that and now we</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.740" end="00:33:33.860" style="s2">have to clean it up it&#39;s like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.450" end="00:33:37.470" style="s2">people have been thinking that for like</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.860" end="00:33:38.730" style="s2">thirty five thousand years it&#39;s not new</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.470" end="00:33:40.620" style="s2">and the reason it&#39;s not new is because</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.730" end="00:33:43.860" style="s2">it&#39;s always true you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.620" end="00:33:46.740" style="s2">handed is a sacred center with flaws</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.860" end="00:33:49.139" style="s2">always always that&#39;s partly because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.740" end="00:33:50.850" style="s2">the creation of the dead right and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.139" end="00:33:52.379" style="s2">dead can&#39;t see and they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.850" end="00:33:54.539" style="s2">communicate and so they&#39;re not in touch</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.379" end="00:33:56.879" style="s2">with the present and so what they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.539" end="00:33:58.590" style="s2">bequeathed to you apart from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.879" end="00:34:00.299" style="s2">that it might actually be corrupt which</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.590" end="00:34:03.000" style="s2">is a slightly different thing is at</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.299" end="00:34:04.440" style="s2">least blind in dead and so what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.000" end="00:34:06.539" style="s2">can you expect from something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.440" end="00:34:07.919" style="s2">blind and dead you know you&#39;re lucky if</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.539" end="00:34:10.919" style="s2">it just doesn&#39;t stomp you out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.919" end="00:34:12.929" style="s2">existence so so that&#39;s a lovely</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.919" end="00:34:16.889" style="s2">photograph obviously and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.929" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">establishment of a new centre then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.889" end="00:34:22.909" style="s2">the centre can be a cathedral too and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:25.669" style="s2">often is of course in in classic towns</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.909" end="00:34:27.929" style="s2">European towns in particular although</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.669" end="00:34:30.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not only European towns that are</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.929" end="00:34:31.800" style="s2">like this there there&#39;s a center that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.030" end="00:34:33.810" style="s2">made out of stone so that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.800" end="00:34:35.849" style="s2">Cathedral and it&#39;s got the highest tower</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.810" end="00:34:38.700" style="s2">on on top of the tower there&#39;s often a</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.849" end="00:34:41.250" style="s2">cross and that&#39;s the symbolic centre so</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.700" end="00:34:43.859" style="s2">people are are drawn together around</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.250" end="00:34:46.079" style="s2">whatever the cross represents now that</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.859" end="00:34:48.450" style="s2">the cross obviously represents a center</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.079" end="00:34:51.089" style="s2">because it&#39;s an X right x marks the spot</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.450" end="00:34:53.220" style="s2">so the centre of the cross is the center</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.089" end="00:34:55.710" style="s2">and then the Cathedral is often in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.220" end="00:34:58.260" style="s2">cross shape which also marks the center</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.710" end="00:35:01.520" style="s2">and then in the cathedral there&#39;s a dome</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.260" end="00:35:04.050" style="s2">often and that&#39;s the sky and that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.520" end="00:35:06.359" style="s2">ladder that reaches from earth to heaven</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.050" end="00:35:11.150" style="s2">so it&#39;s a recapitulation of the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.359" end="00:35:13.829" style="s2">idea so and people are drawn to that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.150" end="00:35:15.660" style="s2">Center and the centre is the symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.829" end="00:35:19.530" style="s2">what unites them and what unites them is</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.660" end="00:35:22.200" style="s2">the faith that the cathedral is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.530" end="00:35:23.940" style="s2">embodiment of and you think well what</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.200" end="00:35:25.560" style="s2">does the faith mean and again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.940" end="00:35:28.500" style="s2">approaching this psychologically and</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.560" end="00:35:30.569" style="s2">what it means is that we everyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.500" end="00:35:33.510" style="s2">a member of that group accepts the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.569" end="00:35:35.010" style="s2">transcendent ideal of the group now the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.510" end="00:35:36.990" style="s2">thing is if you&#39;re the member of a group</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.010" end="00:35:39.180" style="s2">you accept the transcendent ideal of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.990" end="00:35:41.190" style="s2">group that&#39;s what it means to be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.180" end="00:35:42.930" style="s2">member of a group so if you&#39;re in a work</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.190" end="00:35:45.119" style="s2">team and you&#39;re all working on a project</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.930" end="00:35:47.930" style="s2">what you&#39;ve essentially done is decided</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.119" end="00:35:49.859" style="s2">that you&#39;re going to make the goal</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.930" end="00:35:51.330" style="s2">unquestionable right I mean you might</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.859" end="00:35:52.980" style="s2">argue about the details but if</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.330" end="00:35:55.200" style="s2">are tasked with something you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.980" end="00:35:57.480" style="s2">here&#39;s a job for you ten people organize</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.200" end="00:35:59.520" style="s2">yourself around the job you can argue</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.480" end="00:36:01.860" style="s2">about how you&#39;re going to do the job but</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.520" end="00:36:04.650" style="s2">you can&#39;t argue about the job then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.860" end="00:36:08.280" style="s2">group falls apart and so there&#39;s an act</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.650" end="00:36:10.260" style="s2">of faith in some sense the reason that</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.280" end="00:36:12.090" style="s2">the act of faith is necessary is because</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.260" end="00:36:14.490" style="s2">it&#39;s very very difficult to specify</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.090" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">without error what that central aim</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.490" end="00:36:18.720" style="s2">should be given that there&#39;s any number</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">of aims right and it&#39;s a very very</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.720" end="00:36:21.450" style="s2">difficult thing to figure out and this</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.280" end="00:36:24.450" style="s2">is something we&#39;re gonna do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.450" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">tonight is like what should the aim be</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.450" end="00:36:29.790" style="s2">around which a group would congregate</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:32.070" style="s2">you know that so so especially if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.790" end="00:36:33.930" style="s2">large group and it&#39;s a large group that</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.070" end="00:36:36.650" style="s2">has to stay together across very large</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.930" end="00:36:39.060" style="s2">swathes of time and the group is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.650" end="00:36:41.460" style="s2">incredibly diverse you know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.060" end="00:36:44.130" style="s2">possible kind of ideal could unite a</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.460" end="00:36:46.260" style="s2">large group of diverse people across a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.130" end="00:36:48.180" style="s2">very large stretch of time that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.260" end="00:36:50.340" style="s2">really really hard question and I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.180" end="00:36:51.930" style="s2">part of the way that question has been</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.340" end="00:36:54.180" style="s2">answered is it&#39;s been answered</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.930" end="00:36:55.890" style="s2">symbolically and in images because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.180" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">so damn complicated that it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.890" end="00:37:01.620" style="s2">impossible to articulate so but</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:03.450" style="s2">obviously you need to have a center</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.620" end="00:37:05.730" style="s2">around which everyone can unite because</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.450" end="00:37:07.110" style="s2">if you don&#39;t then everyone&#39;s at odds</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.730" end="00:37:08.430" style="s2">with one another like if I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.110" end="00:37:09.270" style="s2">what you&#39;re up to and you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.430" end="00:37:11.700" style="s2">what he&#39;s up to</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.270" end="00:37:13.770" style="s2">we have no we&#39;re just strangers and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.700" end="00:37:16.080" style="s2">don&#39;t know that our ethics match at all</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.770" end="00:37:18.780" style="s2">then the probability that we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.080" end="00:37:21.630" style="s2">be able to exist harmoniously decreases</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.780" end="00:37:23.550" style="s2">rapidly to zero and that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.630" end="00:37:26.190" style="s2">just no good that&#39;s a state of total</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.550" end="00:37:30.510" style="s2">chaos so we can&#39;t have that it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.190" end="00:37:33.270" style="s2">not possible to exist without a central</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.510" end="00:37:35.010" style="s2">ideal it&#39;s not possible and it&#39;s deeper</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.270" end="00:37:39.900" style="s2">than that it&#39;s deeper than that partly</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.010" end="00:37:41.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s I don&#39;t know I&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.900" end="00:37:44.570" style="s2">get this right this is the sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.430" end="00:37:48.030" style="s2">that I was arguing with sam harris about</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.570" end="00:37:51.480" style="s2">you see your category system is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.030" end="00:37:53.850" style="s2">product of your aims that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.480" end="00:37:55.800" style="s2">like if you have a set of facts at hand</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.850" end="00:37:57.870" style="s2">the facts don&#39;t tell you how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.800" end="00:38:01.350" style="s2">categorize the facts because there&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.870" end="00:38:04.740" style="s2">damn many facts there&#39;s a trillion facts</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.350" end="00:38:05.100" style="s2">and there&#39;s no way without imposing some</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.740" end="00:38:07.290" style="s2">ape</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.100" end="00:38:08.760" style="s2">I already order on them of determining</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.290" end="00:38:10.440" style="s2">how it is that you should order them so</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.760" end="00:38:14.490" style="s2">how do you order them well that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.440" end="00:38:16.350" style="s2">you decide what you&#39;re aiming at now how</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.490" end="00:38:18.060" style="s2">do you do that well I&#39;m not answering</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.350" end="00:38:20.280" style="s2">that question at the moment I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.060" end="00:38:23.040" style="s2">saying that in order to organize those</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.280" end="00:38:25.290" style="s2">facts you need a name and then the aim</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.040" end="00:38:27.720" style="s2">instantly organizes the facts into those</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.290" end="00:38:29.880" style="s2">things relevant to the aim tools let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.720" end="00:38:32.190" style="s2">say those things that get in the way and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.880" end="00:38:33.810" style="s2">a very large number of things that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.190" end="00:38:37.050" style="s2">don&#39;t have to pay attention to at all</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.810" end="00:38:38.970" style="s2">right it excludes Verte like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.050" end="00:38:43.890" style="s2">working on an engineering problem you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.970" end="00:38:46.470" style="s2">don&#39;t have to worry about practicing</p>

<p begin="00:38:46.470" end="00:38:53.250" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.000" end="00:39:00.420" style="s2">focusing on a particular what would you</p>

<p begin="00:39:00.420" end="00:39:03.990" style="s2">implies that you&#39;re good at a small set</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.580" end="00:39:06.420" style="s2">of things and then not good at an</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.990" end="00:39:09.600" style="s2">incredibly large number of other skills</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.420" end="00:39:12.090" style="s2">it simplifies things and so you can use</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.600" end="00:39:14.910" style="s2">your aim as the basis of a category</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.090" end="00:39:16.830" style="s2">structure and so you also have to keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.910" end="00:39:18.900" style="s2">that in mind because what it means is as</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.830" end="00:39:22.440" style="s2">far as I can tell that what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.900" end="00:39:24.360" style="s2">that your category system itself which</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.440" end="00:39:26.310" style="s2">is what structures your perceptions is</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.360" end="00:39:29.220" style="s2">actually dependent on the ethics of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.310" end="00:39:31.890" style="s2">aim it&#39;s directly it&#39;s a moral thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.220" end="00:39:35.010" style="s2">it&#39;s directly dependent on your aim and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.890" end="00:39:36.930" style="s2">that&#39;s a stunning idea if it happens to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.010" end="00:39:39.900" style="s2">be true it&#39;s not how people think about</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.930" end="00:39:41.730" style="s2">thinking we don&#39;t think that way we like</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.900" end="00:39:44.580" style="s2">we think that we think deterministically</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.730" end="00:39:46.680" style="s2">let&#39;s say or that we think empirically</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.580" end="00:39:48.300" style="s2">or that we think rationally and none of</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.680" end="00:39:50.790" style="s2">that appears to be the case what we do</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.300" end="00:39:52.410" style="s2">is we pause it a valid aim and then we</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.790" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2">organize the world around the aim and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.410" end="00:39:56.700" style="s2">there&#39;s plenty of evidence from that in</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:39:58.830" style="s2">in in psychological studies of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.700" end="00:40:01.770" style="s2">perception right that that does look</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.830" end="00:40:04.290" style="s2">like how the the perceptual systems work</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.770" end="00:40:06.420" style="s2">mostly they ignore because the world is</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.290" end="00:40:09.750" style="s2">too complicated they focus on a small</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.420" end="00:40:11.550" style="s2">set of phenomena deemed relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.750" end="00:40:13.830" style="s2">whatever the aim is and then of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.550" end="00:40:16.470" style="s2">the aim is problematic again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.830" end="00:40:19.020" style="s2">complex because the aim I have has to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.470" end="00:40:21.450" style="s2">a name that some of you at</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.020" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">or at least don&#39;t object to because</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.450" end="00:40:25.020" style="s2">otherwise I&#39;m not gonna get anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:27.180" style="s2">with my damn aim it has to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.020" end="00:40:29.400" style="s2">implementable in the world it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.180" end="00:40:32.340" style="s2">sustainable across at least some amount</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.400" end="00:40:35.280" style="s2">of time it can&#39;t kill me like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.340" end="00:40:37.830" style="s2">really hedged in this aim it&#39;s it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.280" end="00:40:41.130" style="s2">any old thing there&#39;s hardly any things</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.830" end="00:40:45.720" style="s2">that it can be so you know Jacob&#39;s aim</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.130" end="00:40:47.970" style="s2">for example in undermining Esau almost</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.720" end="00:40:49.410" style="s2">gets him killed and you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.970" end="00:40:51.570" style="s2">why that&#39;s the other thing you think</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.410" end="00:40:54.090" style="s2">well that that was a nasty bit of work</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.570" end="00:40:55.920" style="s2">you can understand Esau&#39;s rage it&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.090" end="00:40:58.560" style="s2">though we&#39;re separated from the people</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.920" end="00:41:00.150" style="s2">in these stories by what four thousand</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.560" end="00:41:03.390" style="s2">years three thousand years something</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.150" end="00:41:05.430" style="s2">like that you know in immediately why</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.390" end="00:41:07.320" style="s2">everyone feels the way they do at least</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.430" end="00:41:09.690" style="s2">once you understand the context of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.320" end="00:41:14.460" style="s2">story that none of that&#39;s mysterious in</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.690" end="00:41:17.790" style="s2">the least so so there&#39;s the church and</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.460" end="00:41:19.830" style="s2">the church is underneath the cross right</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.790" end="00:41:22.560" style="s2">and so that&#39;s st. Peter&#39;s Basilica and</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.830" end="00:41:25.170" style="s2">so there&#39;s the cross on the globe on top</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.560" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">of the Basilica and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.170" end="00:41:33.030" style="s2">cross on the obelisk as well and so what</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:36.350" style="s2">that means is that and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.030" end="00:41:39.180" style="s2">things get insanely complicated is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.350" end="00:41:41.160" style="s2">the center is defined by whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.180" end="00:41:43.560" style="s2">cross represents now the cross</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.160" end="00:41:45.270" style="s2">represents a crossing point</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.560" end="00:41:47.820" style="s2">geographically it&#39;s it&#39;s certainly that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.270" end="00:41:50.160" style="s2">the cross probably represents the body</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.820" end="00:41:52.430" style="s2">to some degree but then the cross also</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.160" end="00:41:55.080" style="s2">represents the place of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.430" end="00:41:57.150" style="s2">obviously and more importantly it</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.080" end="00:42:00.119" style="s2">represents the place of voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.150" end="00:42:02.390" style="s2">suffering transcended I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.119" end="00:42:05.220" style="s2">psychologically right not theologically</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.390" end="00:42:07.609" style="s2">that&#39;s what it represents and so you</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.220" end="00:42:10.140" style="s2">might say so here&#39;s the idea behind</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.609" end="00:42:12.690" style="s2">putting down the obelisk with the cross</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.140" end="00:42:14.160" style="s2">and saying that that&#39;s the center so</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.690" end="00:42:16.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing that everyone&#39;s aiming</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.160" end="00:42:18.270" style="s2">at and so the the idea would be well if</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.440" end="00:42:20.520" style="s2">you&#39;re going to be a member of the group</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.270" end="00:42:23.970" style="s2">defined by this obelisk then what you do</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.520" end="00:42:26.250" style="s2">is accept your position at the center of</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.970" end="00:42:29.550" style="s2">suffering voluntarily and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.250" end="00:42:31.080" style="s2">transcend it that&#39;s the idea and that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.550" end="00:42:32.790" style="s2">one hell of an idea</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.080" end="00:42:35.490" style="s2">it really is man that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.790" end="00:42:37.770" style="s2">a killer idea because it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.490" end="00:42:39.990" style="s2">signal it&#39;s a really clear signal of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.770" end="00:42:41.220" style="s2">psychological health you know because</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.990" end="00:42:43.020" style="s2">one of the things you do if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.220" end="00:42:45.960" style="s2">clinical psychologist and someone is</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.020" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">paralyzed by fear is what you do is you</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.960" end="00:42:50.850" style="s2">break their fears down into relatively</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:53.940" style="s2">manageable bits and then you have them</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.850" end="00:42:55.260" style="s2">voluntarily confront their fears and it</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.940" end="00:42:56.820" style="s2">might also be things that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.260" end="00:42:58.380" style="s2">disgusted by it&#39;s a if they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.820" end="00:43:00.060" style="s2">obsessive compulsive disorder</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.380" end="00:43:02.430" style="s2">but it produces very strong negative</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.060" end="00:43:04.560" style="s2">emotion whatever it is and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.430" end="00:43:06.990" style="s2">them voluntarily confront whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.560" end="00:43:09.150" style="s2">that produces that overwhelming negative</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.990" end="00:43:11.910" style="s2">emotion and that makes them stronger</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.150" end="00:43:15.150" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens it doesn&#39;t make them</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.910" end="00:43:16.830" style="s2">less afraid it makes them more</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.150" end="00:43:18.600" style="s2">courageous and stronger and that is not</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.830" end="00:43:21.210" style="s2">the same thing it&#39;s seriously not it</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.600" end="00:43:24.060" style="s2">doesn&#39;t decrease the fear it increases</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.210" end="00:43:27.180" style="s2">the courage and so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.060" end="00:43:28.440" style="s2">mind-boggling idea and it&#39;s deeper you</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.180" end="00:43:30.330" style="s2">know one of the things that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.440" end="00:43:32.280" style="s2">interesting about these archetypal ideas</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.330" end="00:43:34.230" style="s2">is that and maybe it&#39;s partly because of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.280" end="00:43:36.060" style="s2">the hyperlink nature of the Bible that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.230" end="00:43:38.010" style="s2">part of it but it&#39;s not the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.060" end="00:43:40.110" style="s2">is that no matter how deep you dig into</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.010" end="00:43:42.000" style="s2">them you&#39;ll never get to the bottom you</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.110" end="00:43:44.520" style="s2">know you hit a bottom you think god</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:46.110" style="s2">that&#39;s so unbelievably profound and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.520" end="00:43:47.760" style="s2">if you excavate a little underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.110" end="00:43:49.710" style="s2">you find something else that&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.760" end="00:43:51.360" style="s2">profound and you think wow that&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.710" end="00:43:53.520" style="s2">be the bottom and then you dig under</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.360" end="00:43:55.530" style="s2">that&#39;s like there&#39;s no bottom you can</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.520" end="00:43:57.240" style="s2">just keep digging down well as far as I</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.530" end="00:43:59.490" style="s2">can tell you can keep digging down layer</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.240" end="00:44:01.350" style="s2">after layer and we&#39;ll talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.490" end="00:44:05.100" style="s2">about more a little more about what the</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.350" end="00:44:06.450" style="s2">cross signifies as the center because</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.100" end="00:44:09.450" style="s2">you see what people were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.450" end="00:44:11.970" style="s2">figure out is what is it that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.450" end="00:44:13.800" style="s2">unite under right what&#39;s the proper</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.970" end="00:44:16.110" style="s2">thing to unite under I can give you</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.800" end="00:44:20.880" style="s2">another example so in the Mesopotamian</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.110" end="00:44:23.550" style="s2">societies the Emperor you know who was</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.880" end="00:44:25.770" style="s2">more or less an an absolute monarch he</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.550" end="00:44:28.950" style="s2">lived inside what was essentially a</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.770" end="00:44:31.560" style="s2">walled city and the god of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.950" end="00:44:34.200" style="s2">Mesopotamians was mardik and Marduk was</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.560" end="00:44:35.940" style="s2">the figure who had eyes all the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.200" end="00:44:37.350" style="s2">around his head and he spoke magic words</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.940" end="00:44:39.570" style="s2">who is very attentive and very</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.350" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">articulate and it was Marduk who went</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.570" end="00:44:44.430" style="s2">out and confronted the goddess of chaos</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:46.080" style="s2">the dragon of chaos and cut her into</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.430" end="00:44:47.970" style="s2">pieces and made up the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.080" end="00:44:50.670" style="s2">okay so you can kind of understand what</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.970" end="00:44:53.910" style="s2">that means so mardik goes beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.670" end="00:44:56.850" style="s2">frontier into the place of predatory</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.910" end="00:44:59.100" style="s2">chaos and encounters the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.850" end="00:45:01.290" style="s2">terrifying and then make something</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.100" end="00:45:04.020" style="s2">productive out of it so it&#39;s a hero myth</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.290" end="00:45:06.150" style="s2">and an mardik is elected to the position</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.020" end="00:45:08.250" style="s2">of preeminent God by all the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:11.190" style="s2">Mesopotamian gods because he manages</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.250" end="00:45:15.210" style="s2">that so the the mardik idea emerges up</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.190" end="00:45:17.280" style="s2">the Holy dominance hierarchy and hits</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.210" end="00:45:19.140" style="s2">the pinnacle so that and god only knows</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.280" end="00:45:21.600" style="s2">how long that took it would be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.140" end="00:45:26.850" style="s2">amalgamation of many tribes and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.600" end="00:45:28.980" style="s2">that the what the the distillation of</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.850" end="00:45:31.740" style="s2">all the tribal myths to produce this</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.980" end="00:45:34.050" style="s2">emergent story of what constitutes Tok</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.740" end="00:45:36.630" style="s2">God and then the job of the Emperor was</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.050" end="00:45:38.880" style="s2">to act out Marduk that&#39;s what gave him</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.630" end="00:45:41.220" style="s2">sovereignty so the reason that he was</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.880" end="00:45:43.650" style="s2">the center around which people organized</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.220" end="00:45:45.000" style="s2">themselves wasn&#39;t because he was when he</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.650" end="00:45:46.110" style="s2">was being a proper Emperor it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.000" end="00:45:48.540" style="s2">because there was something super</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.110" end="00:45:50.970" style="s2">special about him like the power didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.540" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">exactly reside in him which is a really</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.970" end="00:45:54.600" style="s2">useful thing to separate right you want</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:57.900" style="s2">the power which is why it&#39;s kind of nice</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.600" end="00:46:00.180" style="s2">to have a symbolic monarch you get the</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.900" end="00:46:01.590" style="s2">symbolic power separated from the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.180" end="00:46:03.480" style="s2">personality power right because</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.590" end="00:46:05.700" style="s2">otherwise they get conflated that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.480" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">happened in Rome it&#39;s a very you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.700" end="00:46:09.300" style="s2">you can see it tending to happen now and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:11.960" style="s2">then in the u.s. like with the Kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.300" end="00:46:14.550" style="s2">dynasty&#39;s and that sort of thing so the</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.960" end="00:46:16.230" style="s2">idea was the Emperor had sovereignty as</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.550" end="00:46:18.840" style="s2">long as he was acting out Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.230" end="00:46:21.090" style="s2">properly and going out into the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.840" end="00:46:22.980" style="s2">and cutting it into pieces and making</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.090" end="00:46:25.230" style="s2">order that was his job so they used to</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.980" end="00:46:27.450" style="s2">take him outside the city on the new</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.230" end="00:46:30.660" style="s2">year&#39;s festival and strip him of all his</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.450" end="00:46:36.030" style="s2">Emperor garments and humiliate him and</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.660" end="00:46:37.890" style="s2">then force him to to confess all the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.030" end="00:46:41.370" style="s2">ways that year he hadn&#39;t been a good</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.890" end="00:46:42.720" style="s2">Marduk so he wasn&#39;t a good ruler and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.370" end="00:46:44.610" style="s2">that was supposed to clue him in and</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.720" end="00:46:47.970" style="s2">wake him up right and then they would</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.610" end="00:46:51.270" style="s2">ritually reenact the Battle of Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.970" end="00:46:54.450" style="s2">against time out the chaos monster using</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.270" end="00:46:56.280" style="s2">statues and then if that all went well</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.450" end="00:46:58.410" style="s2">then the Emperor would go back in and</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.280" end="00:46:59.579" style="s2">the city would be renewed for another</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.410" end="00:47:00.809" style="s2">year and we still have</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.579" end="00:47:02.430" style="s2">echoes of that in our New Year&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.809" end="00:47:04.589" style="s2">celebration right it&#39;s the same idea</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.430" end="00:47:07.469" style="s2">that&#39;s echoed down all those all those</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.589" end="00:47:09.930" style="s2">centuries thousands of years so it says</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.469" end="00:47:12.719" style="s2">such a staggeringly brilliant idea right</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.930" end="00:47:14.309" style="s2">because so part of the idea is that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.719" end="00:47:16.410" style="s2">thing that&#39;s sovereign so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.309" end="00:47:19.499" style="s2">pillar at the center that that everyone</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.410" end="00:47:21.209" style="s2">gathers around is at least in part the</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.499" end="00:47:23.160" style="s2">thing that courageously goes out into</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.209" end="00:47:28.519" style="s2">the unknown and make something useful</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.160" end="00:47:28.519" style="s2">out out of it for the community so</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.609" end="00:47:35.369" style="s2">that&#39;s very very smart it&#39;s very smart</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.599" end="00:47:37.140" style="s2">so this is another example of a center</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.369" end="00:47:39.779" style="s2">so these this is the flag this is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.140" end="00:47:41.940" style="s2">Union Jack and so it&#39;s made up of a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.779" end="00:47:44.700" style="s2">bunch of crosses right and so the first</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.940" end="00:47:46.499" style="s2">cross the English cross that&#39;s the flag</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.700" end="00:47:50.369" style="s2">of st. George that&#39;s the flag of England</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.499" end="00:47:52.890" style="s2">and st. what is st. George do slaves the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.369" end="00:47:54.779" style="s2">dragon exactly same idea right so safe</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.890" end="00:47:56.309" style="s2">George patron saint of England goes out</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.779" end="00:47:58.890" style="s2">and slays the dragon and frees the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.309" end="00:48:01.170" style="s2">Virgin from the grip of the dragon same</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.890" end="00:48:06.089" style="s2">idea right so that&#39;s the center and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.170" end="00:48:08.609" style="s2">the second cross is called a saltier</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.089" end="00:48:10.729" style="s2">but it&#39;s another crucifix so it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.609" end="00:48:13.380" style="s2">cross on which st. Andrew was crucified</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.729" end="00:48:15.979" style="s2">says so it&#39;s the same idea it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.380" end="00:48:18.479" style="s2">center is the center of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.979" end="00:48:20.969" style="s2">voluntarily undertaken cuz Saint Andrew</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.479" end="00:48:23.369" style="s2">was a martyr and then st. Patrick is the</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.969" end="00:48:27.539" style="s2">third cross what did st. Patrick do in</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.369" end="00:48:30.479" style="s2">Ireland chased out all the snakes right</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.539" end="00:48:33.089" style="s2">so it&#39;s the same thing right and so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.479" end="00:48:34.859" style="s2">flag of Great Britain is the combination</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.089" end="00:48:36.900" style="s2">of all of these three crosses that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.859" end="00:48:39.619" style="s2">defines the center and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.900" end="00:48:43.259" style="s2">flag is so that symbolizes all of that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.619" end="00:48:46.890" style="s2">so that&#39;s you know completely</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.259" end="00:48:49.229" style="s2">mind-boggling so and there&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.890" end="00:48:51.869" style="s2">st. Patrick - so he banishes the snakes</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.229" end="00:48:54.390" style="s2">after a 40-day fast and so that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.869" end="00:48:56.549" style="s2">allusion to the 40 years that Moses</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.390" end="00:48:58.410" style="s2">spends in the desert and also the 40</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.549" end="00:49:00.900" style="s2">days that Christ fasts in the New</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.410" end="00:49:03.209" style="s2">Testament and his walking stick when he</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.900" end="00:49:05.579" style="s2">plants it grows into a tree so that</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.209" end="00:49:07.589" style="s2">echoes all of this ideas about the</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.579" end="00:49:09.709" style="s2">center that we just described and he</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.589" end="00:49:12.299" style="s2">also speaks with the ancient Irish</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.709" end="00:49:13.170" style="s2">ancestors which if you remember is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.299" end="00:49:17.160" style="s2">characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.170" end="00:49:18.990" style="s2">of the shamanic rituals where we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.160" end="00:49:23.579" style="s2">in the typical shamanic ritual which</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.990" end="00:49:27.690" style="s2">seems to be elicited by psychedelic use</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.579" end="00:49:29.400" style="s2">the shaman dissolved down past their</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.690" end="00:49:31.619" style="s2">bones and then they go up into heaven</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.400" end="00:49:33.599" style="s2">and speak with the ancestors and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.619" end="00:49:36.839" style="s2">they&#39;re introduced into the heavenly</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.599" end="00:49:38.670" style="s2">kingdom and then the flesh is put back</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.839" end="00:49:40.530" style="s2">on their bones and they come back and</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.670" end="00:49:43.500" style="s2">tell everybody what happened and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.530" end="00:49:45.930" style="s2">a repeatable experience right the</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.500" end="00:49:49.710" style="s2">shamanic tradition is unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.930" end="00:49:52.380" style="s2">widespread so all over Europe ancient</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.710" end="00:49:54.540" style="s2">Europe and Asia and perhaps as far down</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.380" end="00:49:56.520" style="s2">as South America right it&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.540" end="00:49:58.950" style="s2">conserved and it&#39;s out of that tradition</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.520" end="00:50:01.589" style="s2">in all likelihood that our religious</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.950" end="00:50:07.770" style="s2">city Asian emerged so and you can see</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.589" end="00:50:10.380" style="s2">echoes of that here so so back to the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.770" end="00:50:12.180" style="s2">story of Jacob and his ladder so that I</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.380" end="00:50:14.460" style="s2">can come again to my father&#39;s house in</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.180" end="00:50:15.960" style="s2">peace then shall the Lord be my god and</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.460" end="00:50:17.910" style="s2">this stone which I have set for a pillar</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.960" end="00:50:19.410" style="s2">shall be God&#39;s house and of all that</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.910" end="00:50:22.500" style="s2">that thou shalt give me I will surely</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.410" end="00:50:25.099" style="s2">give the tenth unto thee so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.500" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">that&#39;s also an echo I would say of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.099" end="00:50:30.750" style="s2">obligation of those who climb the power</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:33.480" style="s2">higher hierarchy to attend to those who</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.750" end="00:50:35.220" style="s2">are at the bottom right because if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.480" end="00:50:37.619" style="s2">think about the tithing as a form of</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.220" end="00:50:40.619" style="s2">wealth distribution which is essentially</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.619" end="00:50:43.650" style="s2">what it is the part of the ethic that</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.619" end="00:50:48.150" style="s2">defines the proper moral endeavor that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.650" end="00:50:50.250" style="s2">related to that Center is not to advance</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.150" end="00:50:52.829" style="s2">yourself at the expense of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.250" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">community so if you&#39;re if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.829" end="00:50:58.260" style="s2">fortunate enough so that you can rise in</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:51:00.540" style="s2">in authority and power and competence</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.260" end="00:51:04.230" style="s2">within the confines of a community you</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.540" end="00:51:05.970" style="s2">still have a obligation to maintain the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.230" end="00:51:07.559" style="s2">structure maintain and further the</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.970" end="00:51:09.630" style="s2">structure of the community within which</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.559" end="00:51:11.790" style="s2">you rose now that&#39;s obvious right</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.630" end="00:51:13.140" style="s2">because if people didn&#39;t do that after a</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.790" end="00:51:16.140" style="s2">couple of generations the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.140" end="00:51:19.559" style="s2">would fall apart so you know you you you</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.140" end="00:51:22.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not reasonable to destroy the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.559" end="00:51:23.549" style="s2">game that you&#39;re winning it&#39;s reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.020" end="00:51:26.810" style="s2">to strengthen the game that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.549" end="00:51:28.460" style="s2">winning and so that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.810" end="00:51:30.530" style="s2">that also describes the ethic that</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.460" end="00:51:34.490" style="s2">should allow you to be an active member</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.530" end="00:51:38.510" style="s2">of the community around which that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.490" end="00:51:39.740" style="s2">gathers around that Center so so so one</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.510" end="00:51:41.600" style="s2">of the things I&#39;ve learned about the</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.740" end="00:51:44.300" style="s2">hero mythology that I really really like</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.600" end="00:51:46.850" style="s2">is so you see this pretty clearly in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.300" end="00:51:50.390" style="s2">figure of Christ but because two things</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.850" end="00:51:52.910" style="s2">are conjoined in that story but Christ</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.390" end="00:51:54.230" style="s2">is also the here there&#39;s two kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.910" end="00:51:56.720" style="s2">heroes say there&#39;s the hero that goes</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.230" end="00:51:59.990" style="s2">out into chaos and confronts the dragon</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.720" end="00:52:01.460" style="s2">of chaos and gathers the the treasure as</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.990" end="00:52:03.710" style="s2">a consequence and then shares it with</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.460" end="00:52:05.630" style="s2">the community that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.710" end="00:52:08.530" style="s2">the other form of hero is the hero who</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.630" end="00:52:11.540" style="s2">stands up against the corrupt state and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.530" end="00:52:13.610" style="s2">rattles the foundation of the state has</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.540" end="00:52:15.710" style="s2">it collapse and then reconstructs it</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.610" end="00:52:19.340" style="s2">right so because the two great dangers</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.710" end="00:52:21.410" style="s2">to human beings are unprotected exposure</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.340" end="00:52:24.170" style="s2">to the catastrophes of the natural world</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.410" end="00:52:26.930" style="s2">and subjugation to tyranny right those</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.170" end="00:52:30.610" style="s2">are the two major dangers and so a hero</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.930" end="00:52:32.840" style="s2">is their ultimate hero is the person who</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.610" end="00:52:34.790" style="s2">reconstructs the structure of the state</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.840" end="00:52:36.320" style="s2">by using the information that he</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.790" end="00:52:39.200" style="s2">gathered by going out into the unknown</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.320" end="00:52:43.850" style="s2">that unites them both and so what that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.200" end="00:52:46.610" style="s2">means here&#39;s that here&#39;s the rub as far</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.850" end="00:52:50.900" style="s2">as I can tell so a structure a center</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.610" end="00:52:52.970" style="s2">has two risks associated with it one is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.900" end="00:52:55.310" style="s2">that it will degenerate into chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.970" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">the other is that we&#39;ll rigidify into</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.310" end="00:53:02.450" style="s2">tyranny and it&#39;ll degenerate into chaos</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:04.520" style="s2">even if it just stays doing what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.450" end="00:53:06.710" style="s2">doing so if it just does exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.520" end="00:53:07.340" style="s2">it&#39;s doing and it doesn&#39;t change it will</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.710" end="00:53:10.430" style="s2">degenerate</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.340" end="00:53:12.560" style="s2">because things change and if it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.430" end="00:53:14.330" style="s2">change to keep up then it gets farther</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.560" end="00:53:17.540" style="s2">and farther away from the environment</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.330" end="00:53:19.280" style="s2">and it&#39;ll precipitously collapse and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.540" end="00:53:23.000" style="s2">and then if it just changes willy-nilly</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.280" end="00:53:25.550" style="s2">so that nobody can establish a stable</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.000" end="00:53:27.770" style="s2">centralized a game then it degenerates</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.550" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">into chaos immediately and no one can</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.770" end="00:53:33.050" style="s2">get along so there&#39;s a rule for being</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:35.900" style="s2">longing to the community and the rule</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.050" end="00:53:39.860" style="s2">has to be that you have to act in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.900" end="00:53:40.730" style="s2">manner that sustains and that sustains</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.860" end="00:53:42.830" style="s2">the community and</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.730" end="00:53:45.110" style="s2">increases its competence that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.830" end="00:53:47.630" style="s2">fundamental moral obligation for</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.110" end="00:53:49.760" style="s2">belonging and well and obviously soul</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.630" end="00:53:51.920" style="s2">right because why would you belong to a</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.760" end="00:53:54.440" style="s2">why would you walk into a clubhouse that</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.920" end="00:53:56.480" style="s2">was on fire like that&#39;s just not smart</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.440" end="00:53:59.030" style="s2">right if you&#39;re gonna be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.480" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">game if you&#39;ve decided that being part</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.030" end="00:54:05.540" style="s2">of the game is worthwhile you&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:07.580" style="s2">taken on the moral you&#39;ve also decided</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.540" end="00:54:09.200" style="s2">even if you didn&#39;t notice it that you</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.580" end="00:54:11.090" style="s2">have to work to support that game</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.200" end="00:54:14.060" style="s2">because by deciding to play that game</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.090" end="00:54:15.650" style="s2">you&#39;ve said that it&#39;s valuable and if</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.060" end="00:54:18.500" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable then obviously you should</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.650" end="00:54:20.240" style="s2">work to sustain and expand it because</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.500" end="00:54:21.470" style="s2">that&#39;s the definition of having a</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.240" end="00:54:25.630" style="s2">relationship with something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.470" end="00:54:28.820" style="s2">valuable and so that&#39;s the criteria for</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.630" end="00:54:32.360" style="s2">membership in the community and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.820" end="00:54:35.450" style="s2">partly why if you regard the cross say</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.360" end="00:54:37.220" style="s2">as the symbol of voluntary suffering you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.450" end="00:54:39.920" style="s2">know suffering accept it voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.220" end="00:54:41.720" style="s2">something like that which is means that</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.920" end="00:54:43.970" style="s2">there&#39;s another element of that too</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.720" end="00:54:45.980" style="s2">that&#39;s worth thinking about so you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.970" end="00:54:48.590" style="s2">the reason that cane gets so out of hand</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.980" end="00:54:50.270" style="s2">is because he&#39;s suffering and he won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.590" end="00:54:52.310" style="s2">accept it he certainly won&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.270" end="00:54:54.590" style="s2">responsibility for it he&#39;s angry and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.310" end="00:54:56.480" style="s2">bitter about it and no wonder right I</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.590" end="00:54:58.670" style="s2">mean we have to be realistic about these</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.480" end="00:55:00.110" style="s2">sorts of things there you guys all of</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.670" end="00:55:02.510" style="s2">you people are gonna suffer at some</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.110" end="00:55:04.460" style="s2">point in your life to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.510" end="00:55:05.930" style="s2">you&#39;re angry and bitter about it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.460" end="00:55:07.970" style="s2">there&#39;s just absolutely no doubt about</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.930" end="00:55:10.370" style="s2">that and you&#39;re even gonna think well</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.970" end="00:55:12.320" style="s2">it&#39;s no bloody wonder that I&#39;m angry and</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.370" end="00:55:15.140" style="s2">bitter about it everyone would be and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.320" end="00:55:17.030" style="s2">things are so god-awful that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.140" end="00:55:19.820" style="s2">excuse for them to even exist</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.030" end="00:55:22.280" style="s2">and like that&#39;s a powerful argument</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.820" end="00:55:24.440" style="s2">although I think it&#39;s ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.280" end="00:55:27.950" style="s2">self-defeating well that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.440" end="00:55:29.960" style="s2">the story of Cain and Abel that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.950" end="00:55:31.970" style="s2">of what the story of Cain and Abel what</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.960" end="00:55:36.710" style="s2">would you say that&#39;s the moral of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.970" end="00:55:38.480" style="s2">story of Cain and Abel essentially so</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.710" end="00:55:40.010" style="s2">what that means instead is that even</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.480" end="00:55:42.140" style="s2">under those conditions of relatively</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.010" end="00:55:43.940" style="s2">intense suffering you have to accept it</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.140" end="00:55:46.820" style="s2">voluntarily because otherwise it turns</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.940" end="00:55:49.220" style="s2">you against being and then you start to</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.820" end="00:55:51.530" style="s2">act in this terrible manner that makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.220" end="00:55:53.240" style="s2">everything worse and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.530" end="00:55:54.560" style="s2">there&#39;s a contradiction in that if if</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.240" end="00:55:57.320" style="s2">the reason you&#39;re complaining</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.560" end="00:55:59.240" style="s2">that things are bad then it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.320" end="00:56:02.330" style="s2">reasonable for you to act in a manner</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.240" end="00:56:04.310" style="s2">that makes them worse right I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.330" end="00:56:07.130" style="s2">if it&#39;s no wonder that people do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.310" end="00:56:10.670" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s a degenerating game and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.130" end="00:56:12.950" style="s2">that&#39;s so the the idea</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.670" end="00:56:15.620" style="s2">part of the idea of the cross and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.950" end="00:56:17.560" style="s2">suffering that it represents is that if</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.620" end="00:56:20.990" style="s2">you can accept that voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.560" end="00:56:24.290" style="s2">regardless of its intensity then you</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.990" end="00:56:27.170" style="s2">won&#39;t become embittered and resentful</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.290" end="00:56:28.880" style="s2">and vengeful to the point where you pose</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.170" end="00:56:32.060" style="s2">a danger to the stability of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.880" end="00:56:34.010" style="s2">community so or to your own stability</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.060" end="00:56:35.390" style="s2">for that matter cuz it&#39;s you know it</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.010" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">might be your own stability the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.390" end="00:56:38.420" style="s2">stability of your family the stability</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:40.750" style="s2">of the community and the stability of</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.420" end="00:56:42.880" style="s2">the world it might be all of that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.750" end="00:56:52.280" style="s2">increasingly I think it is all of that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.880" end="00:56:58.640" style="s2">so okay so now Jacob we get the second</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.280" end="00:57:02.840" style="s2">part of Jacob story he goes to meet his</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.640" end="00:57:05.630" style="s2">uncle Lebon and he meets Rachel there</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.840" end="00:57:06.770" style="s2">again by oh well he falls in love and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.630" end="00:57:09.770" style="s2">goes to live with</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.770" end="00:57:13.910" style="s2">levan there are two daughters there Leah</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.770" end="00:57:16.250" style="s2">as well as Rachel Leah is not a</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.910" end="00:57:18.650" style="s2">particularly attractive person it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.250" end="00:57:20.090" style="s2">exactly clear why but the story makes it</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.650" end="00:57:23.570" style="s2">quite clear she&#39;s definitely the least</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.090" end="00:57:25.880" style="s2">desirable of the two daughters and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.570" end="00:57:27.230" style="s2">story makes reference to her eyes and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.880" end="00:57:28.790" style="s2">isn&#39;t clear if there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.230" end="00:57:30.950" style="s2">with her physiologically or if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.790" end="00:57:32.300" style="s2">something wrong with her attitude it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.950" end="00:57:34.790" style="s2">not obvious but doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.300" end="00:57:38.420" style="s2">the point is she&#39;s the older daughter</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.790" end="00:57:40.940" style="s2">but she&#39;s the less desirable one Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.420" end="00:57:44.150" style="s2">stays a month which is the limit of</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.940" end="00:57:46.010" style="s2">hospitality in in that time if you</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.150" end="00:57:47.360" style="s2">stayed for a month you were welcome but</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.010" end="00:57:49.130" style="s2">you had to work for your keep I think</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.360" end="00:57:50.960" style="s2">after about three days something like</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.130" end="00:57:55.220" style="s2">that which seems rather reasonable and</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.960" end="00:57:58.100" style="s2">so he stays a month and then he has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.220" end="00:57:59.630" style="s2">chat with Lebon and he says he&#39;s fallen</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.100" end="00:58:03.410" style="s2">in love with Rachel by this time and he</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.630" end="00:58:06.920" style="s2">says I&#39;ll stay with you and work for</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.410" end="00:58:07.700" style="s2">seven years and then all weird Rachel if</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.920" end="00:58:09.380" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.700" end="00:58:13.940" style="s2">the band says that&#39;s a fine deal and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.380" end="00:58:15.380" style="s2">then the seven years passes and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.940" end="00:58:22.339" style="s2">a wedding ceremony it&#39;s quite a long</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.380" end="00:58:25.160" style="s2">thing and the bride is veiled and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.339" end="00:58:27.500" style="s2">bride goes into the tent with with Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.160" end="00:58:30.609" style="s2">and if I remember the story correctly I</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.500" end="00:58:35.900" style="s2">haven&#39;t looked at it for a month or so</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.609" end="00:58:39.109" style="s2">rachel is outside the tent speaking but</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.900" end="00:58:41.480" style="s2">leah is inside the tent and so Jacob</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.109" end="00:58:42.770" style="s2">thinks he&#39;s getting married to Rachel</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.480" end="00:58:45.950" style="s2">but he&#39;s actually getting married to</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.770" end="00:58:48.560" style="s2">Leah and this is it&#39;s an inversion a</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.950" end="00:58:51.260" style="s2">because he&#39;s in the dark like Isaac was</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.560" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">when he fooled Isaac so now it&#39;s Jacob&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.260" end="00:58:55.450" style="s2">turn to be in the dark and he gets</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:59.390" style="s2">betrayed by his uncle and his</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.450" end="00:59:01.730" style="s2">bride-to-be Rachel and her sister in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.390" end="00:59:04.250" style="s2">manner that&#39;s broadly parallel to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.730" end="00:59:07.099" style="s2">trick that he pulled on Esau and so</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.250" end="00:59:09.079" style="s2">there&#39;s a karma notion there which I</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.099" end="00:59:13.099" style="s2">which I&#39;d like you know I mean you might</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.079" end="00:59:17.359" style="s2">think of karma as a superstitious idea</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.099" end="00:59:19.160" style="s2">but and there are ways of interpreting</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:21.520" style="s2">it that might make it the case but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.160" end="00:59:24.410" style="s2">don&#39;t think that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.520" end="00:59:29.780" style="s2">no bad deed goes unpunished it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.410" end="00:59:31.190" style="s2">something like that it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.780" end="00:59:33.680" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ve done something bad to</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.190" end="00:59:35.319" style="s2">someone and therefore there&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.680" end="00:59:40.520" style="s2">you that feels quite guilty about that</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.319" end="00:59:43.730" style="s2">hopefully and that part is looking for</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.520" end="00:59:47.599" style="s2">punishment to set the stage right and</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.730" end="00:59:50.030" style="s2">you might think well no but things are</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.599" end="00:59:52.190" style="s2">yes unless you&#39;re a psychopath that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.030" end="00:59:53.270" style="s2">how things work if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.190" end="00:59:54.410" style="s2">that kind of thing you should read</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.270" end="00:59:56.599" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s Crime and Punishment</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.410" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">because it&#39;s the definitive study of</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.599" end="01:00:00.290" style="s2">that sort of phenomena right because in</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:02.990" style="s2">that book the main protagonist</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.290" end="01:00:05.900" style="s2">Raskolnikov gets away with murder like</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.990" end="01:00:08.420" style="s2">he does it successfully no one suspects</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.900" end="01:00:12.140" style="s2">him and he drives himself so crazy with</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.420" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">guilt that he basically falls into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.140" end="01:00:16.220" style="s2">hands of the police he drives himself</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:18.140" style="s2">into the hands of the police because he</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.220" end="01:00:20.390" style="s2">can&#39;t tolerate what he did it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.140" end="01:00:23.060" style="s2">it&#39;s amazing it&#39;s amazing book but</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.390" end="01:00:26.000" style="s2">anyways the point is he</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.060" end="01:00:29.550" style="s2">Jakub falls prey to the same sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.000" end="01:00:33.000" style="s2">crookedness that he used to ratchet</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.550" end="01:00:35.070" style="s2">himself up the ladder and that happens</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.000" end="01:00:36.900" style="s2">far more often in life and people think</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.070" end="01:00:38.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s really not like he can complain</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.900" end="01:00:42.300" style="s2">about it right not if he has any sense</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.760" end="01:00:46.500" style="s2">it&#39;s like he does he brings Leah out to</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.300" end="01:00:49.530" style="s2">see Lebon and he says what&#39;s what&#39;s with</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.500" end="01:00:54.200" style="s2">this sister you know and Lebon basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.530" end="01:00:56.880" style="s2">says to him in our culture it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.200" end="01:00:59.490" style="s2">custom to marry the eldest daughter</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.880" end="01:01:01.080" style="s2">first which is exactly right and he said</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.490" end="01:01:02.760" style="s2">well it would bring you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.080" end="01:01:05.310" style="s2">rationalizing obviously because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.760" end="01:01:08.990" style="s2">just screwed over Jacob in a major way</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.310" end="01:01:11.160" style="s2">but it&#39;s a little late to take it back</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.990" end="01:01:13.770" style="s2">that the marriage has been consummated</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.160" end="01:01:15.840" style="s2">and the ceremony has been complete and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.770" end="01:01:20.420" style="s2">all hell would break out if there was</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.840" end="01:01:22.170" style="s2">any attempt to sever the relationship so</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.420" end="01:01:26.010" style="s2">that&#39;s how it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.170" end="01:01:29.520" style="s2">so Leah&#39;s married and Jacob has the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.010" end="01:01:32.070" style="s2">wrong wife so then so this is Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.520" end="01:01:34.020" style="s2">there you see on the left he&#39;s got the</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.070" end="01:01:37.200" style="s2">little flowery hat and he&#39;s pointing to</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.020" end="01:01:39.650" style="s2">Leah and he&#39;s saying like what what&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.200" end="01:01:39.650" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.579" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">and love the band you know Laband &#39;is</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.859" end="01:01:49.150" style="s2">tough old goat and he&#39;s not really all</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:54.190" style="s2">that sad about it in fact you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.150" end="01:01:57.420" style="s2">imagine that he&#39;s kinda good so so okay</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.190" end="01:02:02.050" style="s2">then he has to work another seven years</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.420" end="01:02:05.320" style="s2">and he gains rachel but because god is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.050" end="01:02:07.800" style="s2">tricky character there&#39;s another twist</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.320" end="01:02:10.599" style="s2">in this story Rachel</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.800" end="01:02:13.359" style="s2">turns out not to be very good at having</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.599" end="01:02:14.619" style="s2">children or Rachel and Jacob turn out</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.359" end="01:02:18.010" style="s2">not to be very good at having children</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.619" end="01:02:23.950" style="s2">but Leah she&#39;s really good at having</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.010" end="01:02:26.859" style="s2">kids so she provides Jacob with Reuben</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.950" end="01:02:30.220" style="s2">Simeon Levi or let&#39;s leave I believe and</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.859" end="01:02:32.109" style="s2">Judah and the names of those meanings of</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.220" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">those names are there Reuben means see a</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.109" end="01:02:36.460" style="s2">son Simeon means hearing though I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:37.990" style="s2">that was the Lord heard my prayer I</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.460" end="01:02:40.510" style="s2">think that&#39;s what that was</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.990" end="01:02:44.859" style="s2">Levi means joined Judah means praise to</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.510" end="01:02:47.290" style="s2">yahwah and it&#39;s Judah from whose tribe</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.859" end="01:02:49.180" style="s2">Christ arises Judah is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.290" end="01:02:51.460" style="s2">promoted to the status of firstborn</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.180" end="01:02:55.869" style="s2">later in the story this is important</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.460" end="01:02:58.180" style="s2">because Reuben Simeon and Levy all do</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.869" end="01:03:02.230" style="s2">something reprehensible and so Judah</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.180" end="01:03:05.619" style="s2">gets gets promoted to firstborn and</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.230" end="01:03:07.630" style="s2">that&#39;s partly why in the logic of this</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.619" end="01:03:13.750" style="s2">narrative that it&#39;s from the tribe of</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.630" end="01:03:15.490" style="s2">Judah that Christ arises so so now while</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.750" end="01:03:17.530" style="s2">this is going on Rachel is like</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.490" end="01:03:19.839" style="s2">suicidally desperate for children she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.530" end="01:03:21.910" style="s2">jealous of her older sister who&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.839" end="01:03:24.069" style="s2">ill-favored as we pointed out but who</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.910" end="01:03:28.060" style="s2">seems to be damn good at producing sons</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.069" end="01:03:30.220" style="s2">and she&#39;s really not happy with Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.060" end="01:03:31.630" style="s2">and so she choose him out and Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.220" end="01:03:33.670" style="s2">basically says like what do you want me</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.630" end="01:03:37.119" style="s2">to do about it I&#39;m not God which is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.670" end="01:03:40.240" style="s2">reasonable response I would say and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.119" end="01:03:43.000" style="s2">in her desperation she gives Jacob illa</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.240" end="01:03:47.829" style="s2">who&#39;s her maidservant we&#39;ve seen that</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.000" end="01:03:50.380" style="s2">sort of thing happened before and -</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.829" end="01:03:51.849" style="s2">Billa produces two children Dan and Neff</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.380" end="01:03:53.710" style="s2">Kelly</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.849" end="01:03:54.789" style="s2">the reason I&#39;m detailing out all these</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.710" end="01:03:57.009" style="s2">sons it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.789" end="01:04:00.279" style="s2">Gordon because Jacob is the founder of</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.009" end="01:04:03.339" style="s2">Israel and his sons are the founder of</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.279" end="01:04:05.439" style="s2">the 12 tribes so it&#39;s a pivotal moment</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.339" end="01:04:08.199" style="s2">in the story right it&#39;s it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.439" end="01:04:11.169" style="s2">he&#39;s that he&#39;s the fundamental patriarch</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.199" end="01:04:13.059" style="s2">of of those who wrestle with God because</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.169" end="01:04:15.640" style="s2">as we&#39;ll see that&#39;s what the name Israel</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.059" end="01:04:19.119" style="s2">means he gets the name Israel you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.640" end="01:04:21.039" style="s2">why in a while but but it&#39;s you need to</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.119" end="01:04:23.499" style="s2">know these genealogies in this situation</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.039" end="01:04:28.319" style="s2">because they play an important role in</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.499" end="01:04:28.319" style="s2">everything that happens afterwards so</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.859" end="01:04:35.019" style="s2">Naphtali is the second and her name or</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.979" end="01:04:36.729" style="s2">his name means with great wrestling&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.019" end="01:04:40.619" style="s2">have wrestled with my sister right</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.729" end="01:04:42.969" style="s2">contended with her and have prevailed so</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.619" end="01:04:45.699" style="s2">that gives you some indication of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.969" end="01:04:47.859" style="s2">tension in the household now</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.699" end="01:04:51.279" style="s2">leah is now past bearing children she</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.859" end="01:04:53.499" style="s2">gives Jake Jacob her maidservant to</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.279" end="01:04:59.799" style="s2">Zilpah to keep up with her sister I</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.499" end="01:05:02.049" style="s2">guess and now Zilpah bares to children</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.799" end="01:05:05.650" style="s2">for Jacob so he&#39;s piling up the kids</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.049" end="01:05:07.479" style="s2">left right and center here one of them</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.650" end="01:05:11.309" style="s2">is named gad good fortune and the other</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.479" end="01:05:13.839" style="s2">is named Asher happy or blessed so</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.309" end="01:05:15.609" style="s2">there&#39;s more rivalry going on between</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.839" end="01:05:18.939" style="s2">the sisters this is quite an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.609" end="01:05:21.999" style="s2">little story so Reuben who&#39;s Lea&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.939" end="01:05:24.189" style="s2">daughter goes out and looks for</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.999" end="01:05:26.199" style="s2">Mandrake&#39;s now Mandrake&#39;s have</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.189" end="01:05:28.929" style="s2">aphrodisiac property so that&#39;s a little</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.199" end="01:05:35.079" style="s2">odd to begin with but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.929" end="01:05:36.759" style="s2">that&#39;s what happens and Rachel is Rachel</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.079" end="01:05:38.499" style="s2">wants the Mandrake&#39;s because she&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.759" end="01:05:41.259" style="s2">interested in having some children and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.499" end="01:05:43.269" style="s2">so she bargains with Leah to give her a</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.259" end="01:05:47.589" style="s2">night with Jacob in exchange for the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.269" end="01:05:48.819" style="s2">Mandrake&#39;s and more sons emerge as a</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.589" end="01:05:53.729" style="s2">consequence of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.819" end="01:05:57.819" style="s2">so then Rachel finally gives birth</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.729" end="01:06:01.269" style="s2">Joseph and Joseph plays a key role in</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.819" end="01:06:02.949" style="s2">the last story in Genesis which I hope</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.269" end="01:06:05.439" style="s2">we&#39;ll get to in the next lecture and</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.949" end="01:06:08.780" style="s2">then we can close off Genesis that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.439" end="01:06:11.300" style="s2">plan anyways so now</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.780" end="01:06:13.250" style="s2">Jacob isn&#39;t really very happy about the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.300" end="01:06:15.350" style="s2">whole arrangement because he he&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.250" end="01:06:17.420" style="s2">there 14 years and he&#39;s got two wives</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.350" end="01:06:20.090" style="s2">it&#39;s not too bad but he you know he got</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.420" end="01:06:21.980" style="s2">he the bargain wasn&#39;t exactly clean</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.090" end="01:06:25.540" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t really trust la Bannon and</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.980" end="01:06:28.580" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason for him to do so</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.540" end="01:06:31.880" style="s2">levan was poor before Jacob came Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.580" end="01:06:34.700" style="s2">turns out to be a very useful person to</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.880" end="01:06:36.080" style="s2">have around and so he tells Lebon he</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.700" end="01:06:38.960" style="s2">wants to leave and go back to his home</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.080" end="01:06:41.060" style="s2">country and that he&#39;ll take the speckled</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.960" end="01:06:43.340" style="s2">and spotted cattle the brown sheep and</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.060" end="01:06:45.260" style="s2">the spotted and speckled goats from the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.340" end="01:06:48.530" style="s2">flock and they&#39;re in the minority so</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.260" end="01:06:50.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the idea and sola ban or lab and</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.530" end="01:06:53.420" style="s2">takes all those animals out of his flock</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.810" end="01:06:55.700" style="s2">so there was an idea that the speckled</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.420" end="01:07:00.470" style="s2">goats and the brown sheep would breed</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.700" end="01:07:02.270" style="s2">true so if you have two male goat and a</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.470" end="01:07:03.770" style="s2">female goat and they&#39;re both speckled</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.270" end="01:07:06.050" style="s2">they&#39;ll have speckled kids that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.770" end="01:07:07.700" style="s2">theory and the same with brown sheep and</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.050" end="01:07:11.600" style="s2">so what Lebon does is he takes all the</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.700" end="01:07:13.640" style="s2">speckled animals out of the flocks gives</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.600" end="01:07:15.410" style="s2">them to his son and they go three days</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.640" end="01:07:18.560" style="s2">away with them so that Jacob is left</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.410" end="01:07:20.420" style="s2">with the flock but with no with none of</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.560" end="01:07:22.160" style="s2">these animals now the idea was that all</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.420" end="01:07:24.290" style="s2">the what newborns were going to be his</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.160" end="01:07:28.010" style="s2">and so what Lebon is basically done is</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.290" end="01:07:30.110" style="s2">set it up so that in principle Jacob is</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.010" end="01:07:32.260" style="s2">going to get nothing for his work so</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.110" end="01:07:35.630" style="s2">that&#39;s another time when Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.260" end="01:07:37.180" style="s2">experiences betrayal you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.630" end="01:07:40.340" style="s2">almost as if God isn&#39;t done with</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.180" end="01:07:43.010" style="s2">reminding him of the magnitude of what</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.340" end="01:07:45.320" style="s2">he did in the past that that&#39;s the moral</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.010" end="01:07:47.030" style="s2">of the story in some sense now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.320" end="01:07:49.070" style="s2">weird little twist in the story here so</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.030" end="01:07:51.740" style="s2">what Jacob does is some sympathetic</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.070" end="01:07:54.830" style="s2">magic and so when the animals are</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.740" end="01:07:56.630" style="s2">rutting he puts speckled objects in</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.830" end="01:07:58.700" style="s2">front of them speckled branches and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.630" end="01:08:00.050" style="s2">forth I guess to remind them about what</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.700" end="01:08:02.630" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be producing</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.050" end="01:08:05.210" style="s2">something like that and it works and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.630" end="01:08:08.630" style="s2">all these animals that Lebon left are</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.210" end="01:08:11.660" style="s2">are producing spotted animals like mad</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.630" end="01:08:14.870" style="s2">and so that&#39;s I guess God&#39;s changed his</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.660" end="01:08:19.670" style="s2">mind and let Jacob off the hook slightly</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.870" end="01:08:22.060" style="s2">here so soon he was very wealthy much</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.670" end="01:08:25.240" style="s2">cattle maidservants men servants camels</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.060" end="01:08:27.069" style="s2">analysis Laban&#39;s son sons become jealous</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.240" end="01:08:28.660" style="s2">and Lebon is outraged well you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.069" end="01:08:30.280" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s some competition there</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.660" end="01:08:32.170" style="s2">between Jacob and the sons which is</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.280" end="01:08:34.390" style="s2">hardly surprising and the blonde played</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.170" end="01:08:36.580" style="s2">this trick to strip Jacob of all his</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.390" end="01:08:37.960" style="s2">property and instead he got far more</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.580" end="01:08:39.460" style="s2">than he was going to get to begin with</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.960" end="01:08:41.770" style="s2">so you can imagine that&#39;s been a bit</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.460" end="01:08:44.109" style="s2">annoying so Jacob thinks he better get</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.770" end="01:08:46.839" style="s2">out of there so he tells Rachel and Leah</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.109" end="01:08:48.970" style="s2">and said unto them I see your father&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.839" end="01:08:51.609" style="s2">countenance that is not toward me as</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.970" end="01:08:53.530" style="s2">before but the god of my father has been</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.609" end="01:08:55.359" style="s2">with me and you know with all my power</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.530" end="01:08:57.280" style="s2">I&#39;ve served your father and your father</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.359" end="01:09:00.040" style="s2">has deceived me and changed my wages ten</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.280" end="01:09:00.970" style="s2">times but God so far has suffered him</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.040" end="01:09:04.030" style="s2">not to hurt me</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.970" end="01:09:06.100" style="s2">if he said thus the speckled shall be</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.030" end="01:09:08.140" style="s2">thy wages then all the cattle bore</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.100" end="01:09:10.480" style="s2">speckled and if he said thus the</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.140" end="01:09:12.940" style="s2">ringstraked shall be thy hire then all</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.480" end="01:09:14.800" style="s2">the cattle bore ringstraked thus God has</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.940" end="01:09:17.620" style="s2">taken away the cattle of your father and</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.800" end="01:09:20.500" style="s2">given them to me and they decide to</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.620" end="01:09:22.420" style="s2">sneak away and they&#39;re unhappy with the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.500" end="01:09:23.800" style="s2">inheritance lack of inheritance from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.420" end="01:09:26.650" style="s2">man so as they sneak away</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.800" end="01:09:29.470" style="s2">Rachel steals the idols that her father</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.650" end="01:09:31.990" style="s2">has in his house and it&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.470" end="01:09:33.609" style="s2">obvious why there&#39;s a lot of contention</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.990" end="01:09:36.910" style="s2">about why she&#39;s doing that some of them</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.609" end="01:09:38.680" style="s2">is to punish him to bring with her the</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.910" end="01:09:40.359" style="s2">images of her ancestors you know maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.680" end="01:09:42.970" style="s2">she&#39;s lonesome moving away from home</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.359" end="01:09:45.520" style="s2">just out of spite to show him that the</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.970" end="01:09:47.530" style="s2">idols were actually powerless for</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.520" end="01:09:49.690" style="s2">protection to stop her father from</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.530" end="01:09:51.520" style="s2">divining the route of their escape that</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.690" end="01:09:53.710" style="s2">last one is the strangest one because</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.520" end="01:09:57.850" style="s2">the idea would be that Lebon would have</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.710" end="01:09:59.980" style="s2">used some sort of ritual with the idols</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.850" end="01:10:01.510" style="s2">that would help him infer their escape</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.980" end="01:10:03.070" style="s2">route and then could chase them so</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.510" end="01:10:05.530" style="s2">anyways that&#39;s the range of speculation</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.070" end="01:10:08.310" style="s2">about that I think it sounds to me</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.530" end="01:10:12.840" style="s2">mostly like a little act of revenge</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.310" end="01:10:16.630" style="s2">maybe with a bit of loneliness mixed in</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.840" end="01:10:17.950" style="s2">Laband pursues them but God comes in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.630" end="01:10:20.890" style="s2">dream to tell him to leave Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.950" end="01:10:22.570" style="s2">unharmed hmm LaVon catches up with him</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.890" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">and reproaches Jacob saying that he</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.570" end="01:10:26.590" style="s2">would have thrown a great party if he</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:28.360" style="s2">would have known that they were going to</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.590" end="01:10:30.250" style="s2">leave you know he didn&#39;t want them to</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.360" end="01:10:31.990" style="s2">sneak away in the night and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.250" end="01:10:33.760" style="s2">tell from the story whether that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.990" end="01:10:35.679" style="s2">or not and you know these people were</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.760" end="01:10:37.810" style="s2">pretty rough and</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.679" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">pulse of I would say and maybe there was</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.810" end="01:10:42.940" style="s2">a 50% chance of a slaughter and a 50%</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">chance of a party who knows I&#39;ve been to</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.940" end="01:10:49.510" style="s2">parties like that actually so Laband</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.850" style="s2">complains that his gods are gone and</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.510" end="01:10:52.780" style="s2">Jacob says that whoever has them he will</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.850" end="01:10:55.659" style="s2">have them killed</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.780" end="01:10:58.540" style="s2">and Rachel who&#39;s really quite a sneaky</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.659" end="01:11:01.480" style="s2">character all things consider basically</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.540" end="01:11:05.170" style="s2">claims that she&#39;s having her period and</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.480" end="01:11:07.120" style="s2">she&#39;s sitting on the carpet with all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.170" end="01:11:08.739" style="s2">idols underneath and she can&#39;t move and</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.120" end="01:11:10.870" style="s2">so they search everywhere and can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.739" end="01:11:12.969" style="s2">them and she&#39;s like laughing away behind</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.870" end="01:11:16.120" style="s2">her hand about that sneaky little</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.969" end="01:11:17.489" style="s2">maneuver but she doesn&#39;t die so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.120" end="01:11:22.060" style="s2">probably a good thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.489" end="01:11:23.560" style="s2">so the ban checks everything out checks</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.060" end="01:11:25.929" style="s2">the camp out and he can&#39;t find anything</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.560" end="01:11:29.770" style="s2">so they reconcile and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.929" end="01:11:37.300" style="s2">first reconciliation that Jacob engages</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.770" end="01:11:39.610" style="s2">in it&#39;s sort of like the what would you</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.300" end="01:11:41.980" style="s2">say the karmic dad is being paid that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.610" end="01:11:45.760" style="s2">one way of thinking about it that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.980" end="01:11:49.980" style="s2">he got punished for his wrongdoing he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.760" end="01:11:52.300" style="s2">learned his lesson perhaps and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.980" end="01:11:54.190" style="s2">that&#39;s good enough as far as he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.300" end="01:12:00.100" style="s2">concerned you know he got away good</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.190" end="01:12:02.260" style="s2">enough and they make peace so then the</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.100" end="01:12:04.210" style="s2">next thing that happens as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.260" end="01:12:08.679" style="s2">travelling is that Jacob was left alone</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.210" end="01:12:14.650" style="s2">and there wrestled a man man angel God</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.679" end="01:12:16.179" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear we&#39;ll go with angel with</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.650" end="01:12:18.280" style="s2">them until the breaking of the day or</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.179" end="01:12:20.110" style="s2">God and when he saw that he prevailed</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.280" end="01:12:21.340" style="s2">not against him he touched the hollow of</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.110" end="01:12:23.020" style="s2">his thigh and the hollow of Jacob&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.340" end="01:12:25.300" style="s2">thigh was out of joint as he wrestled</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.020" end="01:12:27.820" style="s2">with him and he said let me go for the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.300" end="01:12:30.400" style="s2">day breaks and Jacob said I will not let</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.820" end="01:12:32.860" style="s2">you go unless you bless me and the angel</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.400" end="01:12:35.909" style="s2">said unto him what is thy name and Jacob</p>

<p begin="01:12:49.730" end="01:12:55.670" style="s2">right the the overthrow ur with that</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.190" end="01:12:58.160" style="s2">kind of intonation of or implication of</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.670" end="01:13:00.620" style="s2">crookedness but Israel which means Hui</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.160" end="01:13:02.870" style="s2">who wrestles or strives successfully</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.620" end="01:13:05.210" style="s2">with God for as a prince</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.870" end="01:13:07.790" style="s2">hast thou power with God and with men</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.210" end="01:13:09.860" style="s2">and has prevailed that&#39;s quite a story I</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.790" end="01:13:11.690" style="s2">like it&#39;s it&#39;s I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.860" end="01:13:14.270" style="s2">exactly what to make of it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.690" end="01:13:17.030" style="s2">obviously a symbolic level of meaning</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.270" end="01:13:19.880" style="s2">which is that that is what human beings</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.030" end="01:13:22.010" style="s2">do in some sense is they they wrestle I</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.880" end="01:13:24.620" style="s2">would say they wrestle with the divine</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.010" end="01:13:30.050" style="s2">even with the concept of the divine for</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.620" end="01:13:32.150" style="s2">that matter and but the question is do</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.050" end="01:13:34.970" style="s2">they prevail like it&#39;s got an odd thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.150" end="01:13:36.590" style="s2">that Jacob actually seems to win this</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.970" end="01:13:39.410" style="s2">battle right or at least he wins it</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.590" end="01:13:41.060" style="s2">enough so that whoever he&#39;s wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.410" end="01:13:43.340" style="s2">this divine figure that he&#39;s wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.060" end="01:13:45.230" style="s2">is willing to bestow a blessing on him I</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.340" end="01:13:47.630" style="s2">guess maybe that&#39;s a testament to his</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.230" end="01:13:50.930" style="s2">courage it&#39;s something like that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.630" end="01:13:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s an indication that he has paid for</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.930" end="01:13:56.450" style="s2">his sins sufficiently so that he&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.000" end="01:13:58.340" style="s2">of back on the moral high ground but but</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.450" end="01:14:00.800" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really telling that the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.340" end="01:14:03.920" style="s2">transformation of the name from Jacob to</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.800" end="01:14:06.590" style="s2">Israel and that what Israel means is he</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.920" end="01:14:09.800" style="s2">who wrestles with God or who struggles</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.590" end="01:14:11.120" style="s2">with God and perhaps successfully but</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.800" end="01:14:13.550" style="s2">it&#39;s also so interesting that he</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.120" end="01:14:14.900" style="s2">actually emerges victorious you know you</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.550" end="01:14:16.790" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t necessarily think that that</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.900" end="01:14:19.520" style="s2">would be a possibility especially given</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.790" end="01:14:21.110" style="s2">you know God&#39;s rather hot-headed nature</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.520" end="01:14:24.080" style="s2">in the Old Testament you don&#39;t wanna</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.110" end="01:14:26.270" style="s2">mess with him too much but but Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.080" end="01:14:28.730" style="s2">does it successfully but even more</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.270" end="01:14:31.310" style="s2">importantly is the idea that whatever</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.730" end="01:14:34.880" style="s2">Israel constitutes which would be to say</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.310" end="01:14:37.490" style="s2">the land that Jacob founds is actually</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.880" end="01:14:40.280" style="s2">composed of those who wrestle with God I</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.490" end="01:14:43.600" style="s2">think that&#39;s an amazing idea because it</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.280" end="01:14:46.340" style="s2">also seems to me to shed some light on</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.600" end="01:14:48.110" style="s2">perhaps what was meant by belief in</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.340" end="01:14:49.850" style="s2">those days you know like I&#39;ve often</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.110" end="01:14:52.100" style="s2">thought of Rett of marriage as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.850" end="01:14:53.720" style="s2">wrestling match right if you&#39;re lucky</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.100" end="01:14:56.390" style="s2">the person that you marry is someone you</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.720" end="01:14:58.079" style="s2">contend with it&#39;s not exactly I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.390" end="01:15:01.710" style="s2">think it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.079" end="01:15:03.980" style="s2">it&#39;s not tranquil precisely you know you</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.710" end="01:15:06.210" style="s2">might have noticed that some of you and</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.980" end="01:15:08.820" style="s2">but but the thing is if you have</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.210" end="01:15:12.210" style="s2">something to contend against then that</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.820" end="01:15:14.040" style="s2">strengthens you and and that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.210" end="01:15:18.150" style="s2">better than having nothing to contend</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.040" end="01:15:20.309" style="s2">against and so Jakob is the person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.150" end="01:15:23.130" style="s2">also strengthened by the necessity of</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.309" end="01:15:25.380" style="s2">this contending and that seems to be the</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.130" end="01:15:28.170" style="s2">proper relationship with God or the</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.380" end="01:15:31.309" style="s2">angel is that contending the battling</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.170" end="01:15:36.659" style="s2">right rather than some sort of kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.309" end="01:15:38.309" style="s2">loose weak statement of belief I mean</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.659" end="01:15:39.570" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to denigrate that to any</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.309" end="01:15:41.940" style="s2">great degree it just doesn&#39;t seem like</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.570" end="01:15:44.429" style="s2">the right mode of conceptualization</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.940" end="01:15:48.510" style="s2">right because human beings are aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.429" end="01:15:50.280" style="s2">like that were contentious creatures and</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.510" end="01:15:52.020" style="s2">that&#39;s actually seems to be something</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.280" end="01:15:54.179" style="s2">that meets with God&#39;s favor in this</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.020" end="01:15:56.369" style="s2">situation so especially given that</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.179" end="01:15:58.199" style="s2">that&#39;s actually what he names the well</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.369" end="01:16:01.440" style="s2">the whole kingdom of the chosen people</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.199" end="01:16:04.949" style="s2">is the idea is that that&#39;s composed of</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.440" end="01:16:07.290" style="s2">those who contend with God so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.949" end="01:16:13.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a hell of an idea that that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.290" end="01:16:15.000" style="s2">sure and Jacob asked him and said tell</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.079" end="01:16:17.790" style="s2">me I pray thee thy name and he said</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.000" end="01:16:19.619" style="s2">wherefore is it thou dost ask after my</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.790" end="01:16:21.540" style="s2">name so there&#39;s no that&#39;s not happening</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.619" end="01:16:22.980" style="s2">and he blessed him there and Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.540" end="01:16:25.349" style="s2">called the place of the name of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.980" end="01:16:27.329" style="s2">place Peniel for I or penny&#39;ll for I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.349" end="01:16:30.750" style="s2">seen God face to face and my life is</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.329" end="01:16:32.520" style="s2">preserved and he passed over Peniel the</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.750" end="01:16:36.690" style="s2">Sun rose upon him and he halted upon his</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.520" end="01:16:39.179" style="s2">thigh now Jacob does walk away it</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.690" end="01:16:41.610" style="s2">injured from this right so he has a</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.179" end="01:16:44.130" style="s2">permanent limp after that and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.610" end="01:16:46.590" style="s2">also an indication of just how dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.130" end="01:16:48.360" style="s2">that contention actually is like he gets</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.590" end="01:16:53.790" style="s2">blast he wins but he doesn&#39;t get away</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.360" end="01:16:57.179" style="s2">scot-free and so now so Jacob goes back</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.790" end="01:16:59.309" style="s2">to Esau and he&#39;s terrified even though</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.179" end="01:17:00.750" style="s2">it&#39;s been 14 years he thinks maybe his</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.309" end="01:17:02.849" style="s2">heart headed brother hasn&#39;t calmed down</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.750" end="01:17:05.420" style="s2">yet and he has good reason to think that</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.849" end="01:17:05.420" style="s2">I would say</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.130" end="01:17:12.710" style="s2">so he sends messengers to Esau who then</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.890" end="01:17:14.720" style="s2">sets out with 400 men and so Jacob is</p>
<p begin="01:17:12.710" end="01:17:17.000" style="s2">not very happy with this whole idea and</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.720" end="01:17:18.740" style="s2">he breaks his people into two bands so</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.000" end="01:17:21.620" style="s2">that maybe half of them cannot be killed</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.740" end="01:17:24.740" style="s2">and then he takes from his large flocks</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.620" end="01:17:26.180" style="s2">a bunch of animals and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.740" end="01:17:29.690" style="s2">servants and he sends them out to meet</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.180" end="01:17:31.940" style="s2">he saw basically to say look I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.690" end="01:17:35.810" style="s2">a jerk and sorry about the whole</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.940" end="01:17:38.450" style="s2">birthright thing and and here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.810" end="01:17:41.030" style="s2">animals and you know maybe maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.450" end="01:17:43.400" style="s2">the beginnings of an apology it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.030" end="01:17:45.740" style="s2">something like that and so but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.400" end="01:17:49.160" style="s2">very convinced that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.740" end="01:17:51.680" style="s2">going to work but he saw who actually</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.160" end="01:17:53.750" style="s2">turns out to perhaps have matured in the</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.680" end="01:17:57.260" style="s2">interim perhaps that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.750" end="01:17:59.690" style="s2">thinking about it meets Jacob and says</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.260" end="01:18:02.410" style="s2">that just seeing him is enough but Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.690" end="01:18:05.750" style="s2">insists that he takes the gift and Esau</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.410" end="01:18:09.740" style="s2">accepts and which is probably a wise</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.750" end="01:18:11.570" style="s2">thing because even if he saw is 95%</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.740" end="01:18:14.030" style="s2">convinced that just seeing his brother</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.570" end="01:18:15.950" style="s2">is enough there&#39;s probably 5% of him</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.030" end="01:18:18.530" style="s2">that&#39;s still really not all that happy</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.950" end="01:18:20.570" style="s2">and so you have to be careful you know</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.530" end="01:18:22.790" style="s2">when you say that you forgive someone</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.570" end="01:18:24.320" style="s2">because there might be a part of you</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.790" end="01:18:26.150" style="s2">that really doesn&#39;t that really needs</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.320" end="01:18:29.990" style="s2">something else before you can actually</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.150" end="01:18:31.280" style="s2">say okay look fine you know and you</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.990" end="01:18:34.340" style="s2">don&#39;t want to fool yourself about that</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.280" end="01:18:36.470" style="s2">because that 5% that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.340" end="01:18:38.630" style="s2">completely convinced will find its voice</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.470" end="01:18:41.540" style="s2">at some point and then maybe undermine</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.630" end="01:18:42.680" style="s2">the whole reconciliation process you</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.540" end="01:18:44.630" style="s2">don&#39;t want to think that you&#39;re any</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.680" end="01:18:47.810" style="s2">better than you are or any nicer than</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.630" end="01:18:50.150" style="s2">you are it&#39;s not helpful and so he saw a</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.810" end="01:18:52.880" style="s2">smart I think so while Jacob smart to</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.150" end="01:18:58.190" style="s2">say no no like thanks a lot but take the</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.880" end="01:19:00.470" style="s2">damn goats and Jacob and Esau is smart</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.190" end="01:19:05.480" style="s2">enough to accept that and he might do</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.470" end="01:19:07.760" style="s2">that maybe - you know - please Jacob but</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.480" end="01:19:09.500" style="s2">also I think so that there really is the</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.760" end="01:19:11.960" style="s2">possibility of establishing peace</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.500" end="01:19:14.150" style="s2">because hypothetically the gift that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.960" end="01:19:17.450" style="s2">being offered is of sufficient magnitude</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.150" end="01:19:18.860" style="s2">to erase the debt of the loss of the</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.450" end="01:19:20.420" style="s2">birthright it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.860" end="01:19:22.790" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.420" end="01:19:29.330" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the payment of the real debt</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.790" end="01:19:31.730" style="s2">and Esau said what meanest thou by all</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.330" end="01:19:33.500" style="s2">this drove which I met and Jacob said</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.730" end="01:19:36.650" style="s2">these are to find grace in the sight of</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.500" end="01:19:38.810" style="s2">my Lord and Esau says I have enough</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.650" end="01:19:48.890" style="s2">brother keep thou keep that that thou</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.810" end="01:19:50.960" style="s2">hast unto thyself and Jacob said and</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.890" end="01:19:53.330" style="s2">this is interesting statement I think no</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.960" end="01:19:56.440" style="s2">I pray you if if I have now found grace</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.330" end="01:19:59.330" style="s2">in thy sight take the present at my hand</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.440" end="01:20:01.250" style="s2">for therefore I have seen thy face as</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.330" end="01:20:04.340" style="s2">though I had seen the face of God and</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.250" end="01:20:08.630" style="s2">now was pleased with me and so that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.340" end="01:20:10.100" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s taking the Honorable judgment</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.630" end="01:20:12.949" style="s2">of his brother because it is honorable</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.100" end="01:20:14.719" style="s2">because he saw did get betrayed so he</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.949" end="01:20:19.760" style="s2">has a right to be standing in judgment</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.719" end="01:20:21.860" style="s2">and he equates that judgment with with</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.760" end="01:20:24.530" style="s2">what would you say with the highest of</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.860" end="01:20:29.150" style="s2">virtues it&#39;s appropriate judgment and so</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.530" end="01:20:31.160" style="s2">he wants to make complete amends to Esau</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.150" end="01:20:36.170" style="s2">as if Esau as a representative of the</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.160" end="01:20:38.330" style="s2">divine element of justice and I guess</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.170" end="01:20:40.969" style="s2">that&#39;s convincing to ease so it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.330" end="01:20:42.739" style="s2">a thing to say you know that I need to</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.969" end="01:20:44.600" style="s2">be reconciled to you because that would</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.739" end="01:20:47.570" style="s2">simultaneously reconcile me with God</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.600" end="01:20:49.250" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s crucial this is between</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.570" end="01:20:51.469" style="s2">us but it&#39;s there&#39;s a higher principle</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.250" end="01:20:53.540" style="s2">at stake that&#39;s vital and I think that</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.469" end="01:20:55.190" style="s2">is the case with betrayal that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.540" end="01:20:57.260" style="s2">frequently the case because if you</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.190" end="01:20:59.929" style="s2">betray someone you really have violated</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.260" end="01:21:02.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve deeply violated what can only be</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.929" end="01:21:05.060" style="s2">called a sacred trust it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.120" end="01:21:07.130" style="s2">terminology for that take it I pray the</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.060" end="01:21:09.230" style="s2">my blessing that is brought to thee</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.130" end="01:21:11.030" style="s2">because God has dealt graciously with me</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.230" end="01:21:14.929" style="s2">and because I have enough and he urged</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.030" end="01:21:18.350" style="s2">him and he took it so you know the story</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.929" end="01:21:22.850" style="s2">seems to be something like well Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.350" end="01:21:25.640" style="s2">was kind of an arrogant crooked</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.850" end="01:21:27.560" style="s2">deceitful character maybe / impressed</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.640" end="01:21:30.530" style="s2">with his own ability he thought it was</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.560" end="01:21:33.170" style="s2">pretty amusing to pull a fast trick or</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.530" end="01:21:34.290" style="s2">two on his brother then he ran off which</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.170" end="01:21:37.140" style="s2">is not all that</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.290" end="01:21:39.900" style="s2">brave and then he got walloped of a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.140" end="01:21:41.340" style="s2">and perhaps learned something and then</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.900" end="01:21:47.190" style="s2">when he came back you know he was a</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.340" end="01:21:50.850" style="s2">different person and so that&#39;s a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.190" end="01:21:55.080" style="s2">a reasonable story and you know he he</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.850" end="01:21:55.650" style="s2">has to repent completely of about what</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.080" end="01:21:58.290" style="s2">he did</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.650" end="01:22:01.640" style="s2">before he can rectify the situation</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.290" end="01:22:04.260" style="s2">properly and he&#39;s willing to do that so</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.640" end="01:22:07.290" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting idea too because</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.260" end="01:22:09.660" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the early reflection of</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.290" end="01:22:12.300" style="s2">the idea that it is if you do something</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.660" end="01:22:13.890" style="s2">wrong in the past a that you can learn</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.300" end="01:22:16.470" style="s2">from it right so that you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.890" end="01:22:19.920" style="s2">capable of learning and be that you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.470" end="01:22:22.440" style="s2">set the balance right in the present</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.920" end="01:22:24.750" style="s2">those are very optimistic ideas you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.440" end="01:22:27.480" style="s2">because you might say well once you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.750" end="01:22:28.650" style="s2">committed some sort of crime that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.480" end="01:22:31.050" style="s2">there&#39;s no hope for you but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.650" end="01:22:33.540" style="s2">pretty rough because the probability</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.050" end="01:22:35.070" style="s2">that you&#39;ve done unethical things at</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.540" end="01:22:38.360" style="s2">some point in your life is a hundred</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.070" end="01:22:41.280" style="s2">percent and so if there was no way of</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.360" end="01:22:48.030" style="s2">setting the balance right after that</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.280" end="01:22:49.740" style="s2">then everybody would be doomed so so</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.030" end="01:22:53.730" style="s2">then the story gets rough again Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.740" end="01:22:55.850" style="s2">settles in Shalem Shalem Dinah his</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.730" end="01:22:58.530" style="s2">daughter goes looking around for friends</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.850" end="01:23:01.020" style="s2">Shechem the son of Hamor lays with her</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.530" end="01:23:02.790" style="s2">and then once her for his wife he</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.020" end="01:23:04.380" style="s2">actually has the order reversed there</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.790" end="01:23:08.220" style="s2">that turns out to be a problem</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.380" end="01:23:12.120" style="s2">Jacob hears of this the fathers talk and</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.220" end="01:23:14.730" style="s2">so they make an agreement the agreement</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.120" end="01:23:17.060" style="s2">is is that if all of hammers men</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.730" end="01:23:19.650" style="s2">including hammer and his son are</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.060" end="01:23:21.480" style="s2">circumcised so that&#39;s the proper</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.650" end="01:23:24.120" style="s2">offering I guess that brings them into</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.480" end="01:23:26.100" style="s2">the familial fold and indicates that</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.120" end="01:23:29.340" style="s2">they&#39;re willing to make a sacrifice to</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.100" end="01:23:31.790" style="s2">do so especially after you know Shechem</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.340" end="01:23:34.260" style="s2">put the cart before the horse let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.790" end="01:23:36.510" style="s2">the man of hammer or circumcised they</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.260" end="01:23:38.430" style="s2">agree to do so that turns out to be a</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.510" end="01:23:41.250" style="s2">big mistake so well they&#39;re laying</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.430" end="01:23:45.210" style="s2">around the next day suffering madly from</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.250" end="01:23:47.300" style="s2">the circumcision Simeon and Levi come in</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.210" end="01:23:48.800" style="s2">they sneak in and kill all of them</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.300" end="01:23:53.619" style="s2">and take their wealth and their women</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.800" end="01:23:53.619" style="s2">and children that&#39;s rough it&#39;s rough</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.860" end="01:24:02.599" style="s2">yeah I guess you guys noticed that a</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.040" end="01:24:04.429" style="s2">so-so at their honor societies right and</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.599" end="01:24:06.170" style="s2">there&#39;s still lots of honor societies in</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.429" end="01:24:08.270" style="s2">the world and so they don&#39;t take kindly</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.170" end="01:24:13.540" style="s2">to what happened to their to their</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.270" end="01:24:13.540" style="s2">sister although they don&#39;t kill her so</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.690" end="01:24:18.710" style="s2">now it turns out that yeah it says as it</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.059" end="01:24:21.050" style="s2">came to pass on the third day when they</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.710" end="01:24:22.099" style="s2">were sore the two of the sons of Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.050" end="01:24:24.440" style="s2">Simeon and Levi</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.099" end="01:24:26.420" style="s2">Dinah&#39;s brethren took each man his sword</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.440" end="01:24:28.550" style="s2">and came upon the city boldly and slew</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.420" end="01:24:30.050" style="s2">all the males and they slew hamor and</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.550" end="01:24:32.150" style="s2">shechem his son with the edge of the</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.050" end="01:24:35.150" style="s2">sword and took Dinah out of Chekhov&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.150" end="01:24:37.010" style="s2">house and went out the sons of Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.150" end="01:24:40.280" style="s2">came upon the slain and spoiled the city</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.010" end="01:24:41.690" style="s2">because they had defiled their sister it</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.280" end="01:24:43.219" style="s2">took the sheep and the oxen and the</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.690" end="01:24:44.840" style="s2">alysus and that which was in the city</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.219" end="01:24:46.610" style="s2">and that was which it was in the field</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.840" end="01:24:48.710" style="s2">and all their wealth and all their</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.610" end="01:24:50.869" style="s2">little ones and their wives took they</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.710" end="01:24:53.420" style="s2">came captive and spoiled everything else</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.869" end="01:24:54.829" style="s2">that was in the house and Jacob actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.420" end="01:24:57.020" style="s2">turns out not to be very happy about</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.829" end="01:24:59.929" style="s2">that because he&#39;d met with hammer and</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.020" end="01:25:02.270" style="s2">they&#39;d like hammered out a deal and that</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.929" end="01:25:04.730" style="s2">and that&#39;s where they were living and so</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.270" end="01:25:07.550" style="s2">he figured well that he was making the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.730" end="01:25:11.510" style="s2">best of a bad law let&#39;s say and his sons</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.550" end="01:25:13.550" style="s2">went behind his back and Jacob says to</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.510" end="01:25:15.500" style="s2">Simeon and Levi you have troubled me to</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.550" end="01:25:17.179" style="s2">make me meat to make me stink among the</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.500" end="01:25:19.040" style="s2">inhabitants of the land among the</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.179" end="01:25:21.170" style="s2">Canaanites and the perizzites and I</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.040" end="01:25:23.239" style="s2">being few in number they shall gather</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.170" end="01:25:25.699" style="s2">themselves now together against me and</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.239" end="01:25:28.730" style="s2">slay me and I shall be destroyed I had</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.699" end="01:25:33.920" style="s2">my house and they said should he deal</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.730" end="01:25:35.900" style="s2">with our sister as with a harlot and God</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.920" end="01:25:38.420" style="s2">said unto Jacob and this is where we get</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.900" end="01:25:41.719" style="s2">back to the idea of the center God says</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.420" end="01:25:43.670" style="s2">to Jacob arise go to Bethel and dwell</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.719" end="01:25:46.250" style="s2">there okay so Bethel was where Jacob had</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.670" end="01:25:48.980" style="s2">originally put that pillar so now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.250" end="01:25:50.989" style="s2">back so he it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a real hero&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.980" end="01:25:53.900" style="s2">journey right there&#39;s there&#39;s the place</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.989" end="01:25:56.510" style="s2">that he has a set place he goes out and</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.900" end="01:25:59.630" style="s2">has these adventures and and undergoes a</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.510" end="01:26:01.670" style="s2">moral transformation reconciles and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.630" end="01:26:01.849" style="s2">he comes back to the same place right as</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.670" end="01:26:04.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.849" end="01:26:07.099" style="s2">transformed person so that&#39;s a full hero</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.159" end="01:26:09.559" style="s2">cycle arise go to Bethel and dwell there</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.099" end="01:26:11.659" style="s2">and make that there an altar unto God</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.559" end="01:26:13.659" style="s2">that appeared to thee when thou fled us</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.659" end="01:26:16.039" style="s2">from the face of Esau thy brother and</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.659" end="01:26:17.570" style="s2">Jacob said to his household and to all</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.039" end="01:26:21.559" style="s2">that were with him put away the strange</p>

<p begin="01:26:21.559" end="01:26:26.389" style="s2">change your garments and let us arise</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.199" end="01:26:28.609" style="s2">and go up to Bethel and I will make</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.389" end="01:26:30.469" style="s2">there an altar unto God who answered me</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.609" end="01:26:34.219" style="s2">in the day of my distress and was with</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.469" end="01:26:35.959" style="s2">me in the way which I went and they gave</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.219" end="01:26:37.669" style="s2">unto Jacob all the strange gods which</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.959" end="01:26:39.320" style="s2">were in their hand and all their</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.669" end="01:26:41.359" style="s2">earrings which were in their ears and</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.320" end="01:26:44.539" style="s2">Jacob hid them under the oak which was</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.359" end="01:26:46.159" style="s2">by Shechem and they journeyed and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.539" end="01:26:47.570" style="s2">terror of God was upon the cities that</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.159" end="01:26:49.579" style="s2">were round about them and they did not</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.570" end="01:26:51.889" style="s2">pursue after the sons of Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.579" end="01:26:54.229" style="s2">so Jacob came to laws which is in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.889" end="01:26:55.999" style="s2">land of Canaan that is Bethel so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.229" end="01:26:57.769" style="s2">the place where he put up the pillar to</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.999" end="01:26:59.659" style="s2">begin with he and all the people that</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.769" end="01:27:02.239" style="s2">were there with him and he built there</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.659" end="01:27:04.219" style="s2">an altar and called the place el Bethel</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.239" end="01:27:06.369" style="s2">because their God appeared to him when</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.219" end="01:27:09.260" style="s2">he fled from the face of his brother and</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.369" end="01:27:10.999" style="s2">God appeared to Jacob again when he came</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.260" end="01:27:15.379" style="s2">out of peda an aram and blessed him and</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.999" end="01:27:17.780" style="s2">God said unto Him thy name is Jacob thy</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.379" end="01:27:19.579" style="s2">name shall not be called any more Jacob</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.780" end="01:27:22.879" style="s2">which you remember means usurper</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.579" end="01:27:26.300" style="s2">but Israel shall be thy name he who</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.879" end="01:27:28.399" style="s2">wrestles with God and he called his name</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.300" end="01:27:30.199" style="s2">Israel and God said to him I am God</p>

<p begin="01:27:38.780" end="01:27:44.209" style="s2">thy seed after thee will I give the land</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.449" end="01:27:46.039" style="s2">and God went up from him in the place</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.209" end="01:27:48.439" style="s2">where he talked with him and God set up</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.039" end="01:27:50.479" style="s2">Jacob set up a pillar in the place where</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.439" end="01:27:52.309" style="s2">he talked with him a pillar of stone and</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.479" end="01:27:54.889" style="s2">he poured a drink offering thereon and</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.309" end="01:27:56.269" style="s2">he poured oil thereon and Jacob called</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.889" end="01:27:59.469" style="s2">the name of the place where God spake</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.269" end="01:27:59.469" style="s2">with him Bethel</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.660" end="01:28:11.760" style="s2">so he&#39;s returned to the central place</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.969" end="01:28:16.469" style="s2">which had been given to him as his</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.760" end="01:28:20.040" style="s2">territory Rachel dies in labor in the</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.469" end="01:28:22.230" style="s2">process giving birth to an only son of</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.040" end="01:28:27.150" style="s2">my sorrow whose name was then changed to</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.230" end="01:28:31.699" style="s2">Benjamin son of the right hand now</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.150" end="01:28:33.960" style="s2">Reuben so Simeon and Levi have already</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.699" end="01:28:36.420" style="s2">done something unforgivable</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.960" end="01:28:39.239" style="s2">now Reuben it&#39;s Reubens term he sleeps</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.420" end="01:28:40.050" style="s2">with Bilhah who&#39;s Jacob Israel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.239" end="01:28:42.300" style="s2">concubine</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.050" end="01:28:45.390" style="s2">so he&#39;s the third of the sons to make an</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.300" end="01:28:47.840" style="s2">unforgivable error and Jacob / Israel</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.390" end="01:28:50.489" style="s2">gets wind of it so Reuben is no longer</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.840" end="01:28:53.370" style="s2">he would have been the premier son given</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.489" end="01:28:55.890" style="s2">that the two older sons were put out of</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.370" end="01:28:59.760" style="s2">the running so to speak because of their</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.890" end="01:29:03.020" style="s2">disobedience and impulsive vengeful</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.760" end="01:29:07.010" style="s2">cruelty and then Reuben can&#39;t keep is</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.020" end="01:29:10.650" style="s2">what do they say well you get the idea</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.010" end="01:29:15.870" style="s2">yeah yeah seems to be something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.650" end="01:29:19.469" style="s2">still quite surprisingly common so then</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.870" end="01:29:21.510" style="s2">we have this story that that basically</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.469" end="01:29:24.540" style="s2">ends with this establishment of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.510" end="01:29:26.300" style="s2">twelve tribes of Israel from Leah</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.540" end="01:29:29.610" style="s2">there&#39;s Reuben Simeon Levi Judah</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.300" end="01:29:31.980" style="s2">Issachar and Zebulun from Zilpah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.610" end="01:29:34.260" style="s2">gad and ashur from billah there&#39;s Dan</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.980" end="01:29:36.360" style="s2">and Naphtali and from Rachel there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.260" end="01:29:38.880" style="s2">Joseph who figures extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.360" end="01:29:40.410" style="s2">importantly in the next story that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.880" end="01:29:46.460" style="s2">going to cover which hopefully will wrap</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.410" end="01:29:46.460" style="s2">up Genesis and Benjamin and so now</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.520" end="01:29:56.070" style="s2">Israel itself is established and so then</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.400" end="01:29:57.600" style="s2">we turn to actually going to end this</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.070" end="01:30:03.150" style="s2">early tonight that&#39;s quite bloody</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.600" end="01:30:08.340" style="s2">miracle so the story then turns to</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.150" end="01:30:10.260" style="s2">Joseph and the story begins essentially</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.340" end="01:30:11.760" style="s2">now Israel loved Joseph more than all</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.260" end="01:30:14.160" style="s2">his children because he was the son of</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.760" end="01:30:15.680" style="s2">his old age and he made him a coat of</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.160" end="01:30:18.220" style="s2">many colors</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.680" end="01:30:21.350" style="s2">and so what that seems to me to indicate</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.220" end="01:30:23.720" style="s2">you know coats in dreams very often</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.350" end="01:30:25.190" style="s2">seems to be particularly true of women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.720" end="01:30:27.920" style="s2">dreams that&#39;s that&#39;s been like my</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.190" end="01:30:31.930" style="s2">clinical observation clothing and</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.920" end="01:30:34.310" style="s2">footwear in particular symbolizes a role</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.930" end="01:30:36.020" style="s2">and that makes sense right because you</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.310" end="01:30:38.540" style="s2">address for the roles it&#39;s not that big</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.020" end="01:30:40.820" style="s2">a mystery but so then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.540" end="01:30:44.690" style="s2">what does a coat of many colors indicate</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.820" end="01:30:47.210" style="s2">and you know if you think of that</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.690" end="01:30:49.940" style="s2">multiplicity there it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.210" end="01:30:52.430" style="s2">the mastery of multiple domains right or</p>
<p begin="01:30:49.940" end="01:30:56.690" style="s2">maybe something like plural potentiality</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.430" end="01:30:59.870" style="s2">and so Jacob is is Israel&#39;s or Joseph is</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.690" end="01:31:03.080" style="s2">Israel&#39;s favorite and because he sees in</p>
<p begin="01:30:59.870" end="01:31:05.080" style="s2">him this excess possibility and he</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.080" end="01:31:08.660" style="s2">basically tells his other sons that</p>
<p begin="01:31:05.080" end="01:31:10.490" style="s2">Jacob is going to be the head son which</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.660" end="01:31:12.650" style="s2">they are not happy with right because</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.490" end="01:31:14.480" style="s2">he&#39;s just this young punk fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.650" end="01:31:16.190" style="s2">and he&#39;s clearly his father&#39;s favorite</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.480" end="01:31:19.060" style="s2">and he gets this coat that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.190" end="01:31:23.840" style="s2">indicative of this higher status and so</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.060" end="01:31:26.210" style="s2">Israel inadvertently sets up a</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.840" end="01:31:30.700" style="s2">tremendous amount of sibling rivalry in</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.210" end="01:31:35.510" style="s2">the household again and that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.700" end="01:31:39.110" style="s2">the understructure of the last story in</p>
<p begin="01:31:35.510" end="01:31:43.760" style="s2">Genesis and so in in the last of this</p>
<p begin="01:31:39.110" end="01:31:46.730" style="s2">lecture series for 2017 we&#39;ll cover the</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.760" end="01:31:48.740" style="s2">story of Joseph and and his coat of many</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.730" end="01:31:52.220" style="s2">colors and what happens as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.740" end="01:31:56.480" style="s2">of his of the favoritism shown to him by</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.220" end="01:31:59.810" style="s2">his father and we&#39;ll track what happens</p>
<p begin="01:31:56.480" end="01:32:01.880" style="s2">as a consequence of that and so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.810" end="01:32:04.570" style="s2">going to stop there because I&#39;m finished</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.880" end="01:32:04.570" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.460" end="01:32:12.150" style="s2">hello dr. Pearson</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.659" end="01:32:17.090" style="s2">this is an idea I&#39;ve been wrestling with</p>
<p begin="01:32:12.150" end="01:32:19.350" style="s2">for quite some time now this idea of a</p>

<p begin="01:32:31.830" end="01:32:37.320" style="s2">coming back so I&#39;ve had a hard time</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.980" end="01:32:39.480" style="s2">trying to figure out from a scientific</p>

<p begin="01:33:10.460" end="01:33:16.050" style="s2">neuroscientist neuropsychologist named</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.690" end="01:33:18.780" style="s2">el Conan Goldberg and Goldberg was a</p>

<p begin="01:33:50.580" end="01:33:55.560" style="s2">Luria was a big deal and he was the</p>
<p begin="01:33:53.940" end="01:33:56.820" style="s2">first person who really established the</p>
<p begin="01:33:55.560" end="01:34:02.280" style="s2">functional role of the prefrontal cortex</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.820" end="01:34:04.290" style="s2">as well so and had it very nice overall</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.280" end="01:34:06.030" style="s2">view of how the brain function his book</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.290" end="01:34:08.130" style="s2">was written in 1980 and it&#39;s still</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.030" end="01:34:10.080" style="s2">there&#39;s still loss in it that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.130" end="01:34:11.760" style="s2">useful which is pretty strange for a</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.080" end="01:34:15.570" style="s2">science that&#39;s advanced that quickly</p>
<p begin="01:34:11.760" end="01:34:19.500" style="s2">anyways so Goldberg came from a great</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.570" end="01:34:20.370" style="s2">pedigree I believe Maria&#39;s teacher was</p>
<p begin="01:34:19.500" end="01:34:25.520" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.370" end="01:34:25.520" style="s2">if I remember correctly so anyways</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.700" end="01:34:35.070" style="s2">Goldberg you know you hear some of you</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.670" end="01:34:38.790" style="s2">may have heard the idea that the left</p>
<p begin="01:34:35.070" end="01:34:40.290" style="s2">hemisphere is more or linguistic than</p>
<p begin="01:34:38.790" end="01:34:41.910" style="s2">the right hemisphere is that left</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.290" end="01:34:43.860" style="s2">hemisphere is specialized for language</p>
<p begin="01:34:41.910" end="01:34:47.370" style="s2">and the right hemisphere is specialized</p>
<p begin="01:34:43.860" end="01:34:51.180" style="s2">for nonverbal imagistic communication</p>
<p begin="01:34:47.370" end="01:34:52.920" style="s2">the left hemisphere has a pretty well</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.180" end="01:34:57.170" style="s2">organized microstructure and the right</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.920" end="01:34:59.700" style="s2">hemisphere is more diffuse as well and</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.170" end="01:35:01.500" style="s2">that&#39;s true in left-handed males in</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.700" end="01:35:03.840" style="s2">particular so the circuitry can be</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.500" end="01:35:05.790" style="s2">switched around a bit but it&#39;s okay the</p>
<p begin="01:35:03.840" end="01:35:07.890" style="s2">modules are basically the same although</p>
<p begin="01:35:05.790" end="01:35:09.870" style="s2">they can be moved a little bit but</p>
<p begin="01:35:07.890" end="01:35:13.440" style="s2">Goldberg thought that it isn&#39;t language</p>
<p begin="01:35:09.870" end="01:35:16.320" style="s2">versus non language it&#39;s routine versus</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.440" end="01:35:19.590" style="s2">novelty and so the left hemisphere and</p>
<p begin="01:35:16.320" end="01:35:21.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a neuropsychologist physician</p>
<p begin="01:35:19.590" end="01:35:25.650" style="s2">named Ramachandran who&#39;s done some very</p>
<p begin="01:35:21.510" end="01:35:26.940" style="s2">interesting work that&#39;s pertinent to</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.650" end="01:35:30.510" style="s2">this maybe I&#39;ll tell you a story about</p>
<p begin="01:35:26.940" end="01:35:35.130" style="s2">him anyways Goldberg believed that the</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.510" end="01:35:38.070" style="s2">right hemisphere say you have very old</p>
<p begin="01:35:35.130" end="01:35:40.410" style="s2">systems underneath both both cortical</p>
<p begin="01:35:38.070" end="01:35:42.600" style="s2">hemispheres that do things like respond</p>
<p begin="01:35:40.410" end="01:35:45.900" style="s2">to anomaly to the thing that doesn&#39;t fit</p>
<p begin="01:35:42.600" end="01:35:47.610" style="s2">to the predator in the distance some of</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.900" end="01:35:49.320" style="s2">that&#39;s extraordinarily fast so that</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.610" end="01:35:51.630" style="s2">would be like a snake reflex that can</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.320" end="01:35:53.370" style="s2">move you away from a snake in less time</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.630" end="01:35:54.960" style="s2">than it takes the snake to bite and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:35:53.370" end="01:35:57.690" style="s2">really a reflex it doesn&#39;t even hit your</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.960" end="01:36:00.570" style="s2">brain it&#39;s really super fast and then</p>
<p begin="01:35:57.690" end="01:36:02.820" style="s2">there&#39;s a defensive Crouch that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.570" end="01:36:04.830" style="s2">instantiated higher up in the nervous</p>
<p begin="01:36:02.820" end="01:36:06.870" style="s2">system but that&#39;s still remarkably fast</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.830" end="01:36:09.750" style="s2">and then there&#39;s fear as an emotion and</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.870" end="01:36:11.700" style="s2">and the orientation of attention and</p>
<p begin="01:36:09.750" end="01:36:13.890" style="s2">then there&#39;s the cognitive processing</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.700" end="01:36:15.750" style="s2">and that all streams out across a time</p>
<p begin="01:36:13.890" end="01:36:17.970" style="s2">span right and maybe that time span is</p>
<p begin="01:36:15.750" end="01:36:19.740" style="s2">half a second so you and that&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="01:36:17.970" end="01:36:22.560" style="s2">long time if something is attacking you</p>
<p begin="01:36:19.740" end="01:36:23.790" style="s2">so you got those initial responses are</p>
<p begin="01:36:22.560" end="01:36:26.400" style="s2">quite primitive but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.790" end="01:36:28.530" style="s2">extraordinarily fast all right so</p>
<p begin="01:36:26.400" end="01:36:31.050" style="s2">there&#39;s subcortical structures that</p>
<p begin="01:36:28.530" end="01:36:34.690" style="s2">orient you towards novelty and prepare</p>
<p begin="01:36:31.050" end="01:36:36.700" style="s2">you for for freezing or for it</p>
<p begin="01:36:34.690" end="01:36:39.460" style="s2">and the right hemisphere seems to be</p>
<p begin="01:36:36.700" end="01:36:42.490" style="s2">dominated by those systems so imagine</p>
<p begin="01:36:39.460" end="01:36:44.620" style="s2">that what happens is that something</p>
<p begin="01:36:42.490" end="01:36:46.270" style="s2">threatens you you orient towards it</p>
<p begin="01:36:44.620" end="01:36:47.890" style="s2">the right hemisphere produces a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.270" end="01:36:49.660" style="s2">images about what it might be</p>
<p begin="01:36:47.890" end="01:36:51.220" style="s2">so imagine that&#39;s what happens when a</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.660" end="01:36:53.260" style="s2">child is afraid of the dark</p>
<p begin="01:36:51.220" end="01:36:54.760" style="s2">the child&#39;s on the bed they&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:36:53.260" end="01:36:56.380" style="s2">the dark they&#39;re crouched because</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.760" end="01:36:58.300" style="s2">they&#39;re frozen like a prey animal and</p>
<p begin="01:36:56.380" end="01:37:01.570" style="s2">their right hemisphere is producing</p>
<p begin="01:36:58.300" end="01:37:04.090" style="s2">monsters to inhabit the the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.570" end="01:37:07.900" style="s2">that are the child&#39;s hypotheses about</p>
<p begin="01:37:04.090" end="01:37:10.180" style="s2">what might be out there okay because</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.900" end="01:37:11.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what you want to know right you</p>
<p begin="01:37:10.180" end="01:37:13.900" style="s2">want to know what&#39;s out there and then</p>
<p begin="01:37:11.470" end="01:37:16.270" style="s2">you want to know what to do about it I</p>
<p begin="01:37:13.900" end="01:37:19.420" style="s2">can tell you two kids dreams that are</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.270" end="01:37:22.650" style="s2">sort of relevant to that so when my</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.420" end="01:37:25.240" style="s2">daughter was about three she came into</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.650" end="01:37:27.940" style="s2">the bedroom that my wife and I had and</p>
<p begin="01:37:25.240" end="01:37:32.020" style="s2">she was crying she&#39;d had a nightmare and</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.940" end="01:37:34.600" style="s2">she said that she saw a stream and there</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.020" end="01:37:36.490" style="s2">was garbage all over the stream and she</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.600" end="01:37:39.610" style="s2">didn&#39;t like that and so I sat her down I</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.490" end="01:37:40.960" style="s2">said okay so imagine the stream with the</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.610" end="01:37:42.370" style="s2">garbage in it now imagine that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.960" end="01:37:45.670" style="s2">taking the garbage out and throwing it</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.370" end="01:37:47.620" style="s2">in the garbage bin and so she and I got</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.670" end="01:37:49.270" style="s2">her to like visualize that because that</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.620" end="01:37:51.340" style="s2">kind of puts her back in the semi dream</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.270" end="01:37:53.350" style="s2">state and then she cleaned up the mess</p>
<p begin="01:37:51.340" end="01:37:55.030" style="s2">and then she could go off to sleep now</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.350" end="01:37:56.500" style="s2">you you could tell the child don&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.030" end="01:37:58.690" style="s2">about the dream isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.500" end="01:38:01.570" style="s2">that&#39;s not that&#39;s true because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.690" end="01:38:04.210" style="s2">real like other daytime things are but</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.570" end="01:38:06.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not real it&#39;s a dream</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.210" end="01:38:10.360" style="s2">like a dream is real it&#39;s just not the</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.700" end="01:38:13.210" style="s2">same kind of real and so what I did with</p>
<p begin="01:38:10.360" end="01:38:15.790" style="s2">her was to indicate to her practically</p>
<p begin="01:38:13.210" end="01:38:17.500" style="s2">that if she saw something a normal uh</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.790" end="01:38:19.900" style="s2">something that was out of place right</p>
<p begin="01:38:17.500" end="01:38:23.650" style="s2">something that was a mess that it was</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.900" end="01:38:26.440" style="s2">within her capacity to set it right okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.650" end="01:38:28.900" style="s2">and so okay so now your right hemisphere</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.440" end="01:38:32.650" style="s2">tells you what monsters might inhabit</p>
<p begin="01:38:28.900" end="01:38:34.210" style="s2">the the darkness now what you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.650" end="01:38:36.910" style="s2">is figure out there&#39;s two things you</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.210" end="01:38:40.330" style="s2">have to figure out one is what to do</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.910" end="01:38:42.370" style="s2">about a given monster and now there is</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.330" end="01:38:44.380" style="s2">to do what about is to figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.370" end="01:38:47.980" style="s2">to do about the class of all possible</p>
<p begin="01:38:44.380" end="01:38:48.450" style="s2">monsters right that&#39;s a whole different</p>
<p begin="01:38:47.980" end="01:38:49.680" style="s2">thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.450" end="01:38:51.770" style="s2">something that only human beings are</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.680" end="01:38:54.360" style="s2">capable of that level of abstraction</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.770" end="01:38:57.150" style="s2">right and so what you might do about a</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.360" end="01:39:00.090" style="s2">particular monster is hide or go out and</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.150" end="01:39:02.250" style="s2">get rid of it if it was just an actual</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.090" end="01:39:03.750" style="s2">animal right but that doesn&#39;t help</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.250" end="01:39:06.000" style="s2">because there&#39;s all the other potential</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.750" end="01:39:08.100" style="s2">predators that are still there and so</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.000" end="01:39:09.210" style="s2">maybe you can go hunt all them down but</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.100" end="01:39:11.730" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t help either because you</p>
<p begin="01:39:09.210" end="01:39:13.950" style="s2">can&#39;t hunt them all down it&#39;s not or</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.730" end="01:39:15.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not very likely anyways so instead</p>
<p begin="01:39:13.950" end="01:39:17.160" style="s2">what you have to do is figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.510" end="01:39:19.320" style="s2">configure yourself so that you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:17.160" end="01:39:21.480" style="s2">best possible position to fight off the</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.320" end="01:39:21.870" style="s2">monsters when they come that&#39;s your best</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.480" end="01:39:24.210" style="s2">bet</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.870" end="01:39:26.430" style="s2">all right so now people are trying to</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.210" end="01:39:28.350" style="s2">figure this out forever they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.430" end="01:39:31.410" style="s2">to figure out what&#39;s the answer to the</p>
<p begin="01:39:28.350" end="01:39:33.780" style="s2">problem of the class of all possible</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.410" end="01:39:38.400" style="s2">monsters part of that sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.780" end="01:39:41.160" style="s2">so there are routines for example in in</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.400" end="01:39:43.290" style="s2">Hinduism with the goddess Kali you make</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.160" end="01:39:45.570" style="s2">offerings to Kelly who&#39;s this devouring</p>
<p begin="01:39:43.290" end="01:39:48.240" style="s2">goddess and then she turns into her</p>
<p begin="01:39:45.570" end="01:39:50.220" style="s2">benevolent counterpart and so sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.240" end="01:39:52.770" style="s2">is actually one way that you can tame</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.220" end="01:39:55.350" style="s2">the monsters if you think about the</p>
<p begin="01:39:52.770" end="01:39:57.570" style="s2">monster has the set of all negative</p>
<p begin="01:39:55.350" end="01:39:59.340" style="s2">future potentialities you make the</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.570" end="01:40:01.800" style="s2">proper sacrifice as those monsters stay</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.340" end="01:40:05.310" style="s2">at bay but then there&#39;s heroism as an</p>
<p begin="01:40:01.800" end="01:40:07.410" style="s2">alternative to which which means the act</p>
<p begin="01:40:05.310" end="01:40:09.120" style="s2">of confrontation of the class of all</p>
<p begin="01:40:07.410" end="01:40:10.410" style="s2">possible monsters and the building of</p>
<p begin="01:40:09.120" end="01:40:12.540" style="s2">yourself up and into this sort of</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.410" end="01:40:15.140" style="s2">courageous person that can do that it</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.540" end="01:40:19.410" style="s2">took a tremendous amount of meditation</p>
<p begin="01:40:15.140" end="01:40:25.110" style="s2">to transform those images say of the</p>
<p begin="01:40:19.410" end="01:40:27.510" style="s2">monsters in into it or to solve the</p>
<p begin="01:40:25.110" end="01:40:29.070" style="s2">problem of the class of those monsters</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.510" end="01:40:31.410" style="s2">so now I&#39;ll tell you another child</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.070" end="01:40:33.270" style="s2">stream so some of you have probably</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.410" end="01:40:37.460" style="s2">heard this before but it&#39;s such a great</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.270" end="01:40:37.460" style="s2">dream that it&#39;s worth it&#39;s worth telling</p>
<p begin="01:40:37.970" end="01:40:43.980" style="s2">so now is that my sister-in-law&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.370" end="01:40:46.680" style="s2">once and her son was running around he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.980" end="01:40:49.770" style="s2">about four very precocious very verbal</p>
<p begin="01:40:46.680" end="01:40:51.320" style="s2">very intelligent running around with a</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.770" end="01:40:54.000" style="s2">knight hat on and a sword</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.320" end="01:40:56.550" style="s2">so he&#39;s engaged in this pretty intense</p>
<p begin="01:40:54.000" end="01:40:58.650" style="s2">play world and when he goes to sleep he</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.550" end="01:41:00.690" style="s2">puts the knight hat on his pillow and</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.650" end="01:41:01.860" style="s2">the sword by his pillow and at the same</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.690" end="01:41:04.260" style="s2">time he</p>
<p begin="01:41:01.860" end="01:41:06.210" style="s2">having night terrors so he&#39;s waking up</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.260" end="01:41:09.719" style="s2">and had been for a number of weeks</p>
<p begin="01:41:06.210" end="01:41:12.810" style="s2">Nate waking up screaming and then but he</p>
<p begin="01:41:09.719" end="01:41:14.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know why there&#39;s some things</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.810" end="01:41:15.869" style="s2">that aren&#39;t going so well in the</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.100" end="01:41:18.449" style="s2">household and the parents get divorced</p>
<p begin="01:41:15.869" end="01:41:20.400" style="s2">shortly afterwards okay so that&#39;s oh</p>
<p begin="01:41:18.449" end="01:41:23.070" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s going on underneath</p>
<p begin="01:41:20.400" end="01:41:24.690" style="s2">right and he&#39;s also gonna go to</p>
<p begin="01:41:23.070" end="01:41:26.940" style="s2">kindergarten and so he&#39;s about to go</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.690" end="01:41:31.800" style="s2">into the world and so he&#39;s coping with</p>
<p begin="01:41:26.940" end="01:41:33.389" style="s2">this you know so I&#39;m watching him zoom</p>
<p begin="01:41:31.800" end="01:41:37.469" style="s2">around as this night and thinking that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:33.389" end="01:41:40.139" style="s2">pretty cool and that night he woke up</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.469" end="01:41:42.869" style="s2">and had a it was screaming and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:41:40.139" end="01:41:46.050" style="s2">all at breakfast the next morning and I</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.869" end="01:41:49.139" style="s2">said did you dream anything and he got</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.050" end="01:41:51.690" style="s2">really intense and he said yes I had a</p>
<p begin="01:41:49.139" end="01:41:54.690" style="s2">dream and I said well what was the dream</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.690" end="01:41:59.369" style="s2">and he said well I was out on this field</p>
<p begin="01:41:54.690" end="01:42:00.780" style="s2">and all these like dwarfs came up to me</p>
<p begin="01:41:59.369" end="01:42:03.780" style="s2">they were only about as high as my knees</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.780" end="01:42:06.570" style="s2">and they didn&#39;t have any arms they have</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.780" end="01:42:09.600" style="s2">powerful legs and they were covered with</p>
<p begin="01:42:06.570" end="01:42:11.280" style="s2">like hairy feathers and grease and there</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.600" end="01:42:15.480" style="s2">was cross carved in the top of their</p>
<p begin="01:42:11.280" end="01:42:16.830" style="s2">head and they had beaks and whenever he</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.480" end="01:42:18.989" style="s2">moved anywhere they would jump at him</p>
<p begin="01:42:16.830" end="01:42:21.630" style="s2">with his with their beaks and there were</p>
<p begin="01:42:18.989" end="01:42:24.830" style="s2">lots of them and everyone like just said</p>
<p begin="01:42:21.630" end="01:42:27.869" style="s2">nothing at breakfast it was like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:42:24.830" end="01:42:30.389" style="s2">cuz and he was right into this story and</p>
<p begin="01:42:27.869" end="01:42:31.650" style="s2">so we were all like yeah well huh there</p>
<p begin="01:42:30.389" end="01:42:36.210" style="s2">are that accounts for all the screaming</p>
<p begin="01:42:31.650" end="01:42:38.630" style="s2">and so and then he said yeah and then in</p>
<p begin="01:42:36.210" end="01:42:42.150" style="s2">the background there was a dragon and</p>
<p begin="01:42:38.630" end="01:42:45.869" style="s2">every time the dragon puffed out smoke</p>
<p begin="01:42:42.150" end="01:42:47.610" style="s2">it would turn into these dwarves it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:42:45.869" end="01:42:50.310" style="s2">like oh man kid you really got a problem</p>
<p begin="01:42:47.610" end="01:42:53.010" style="s2">there you got you got beat things that</p>
<p begin="01:42:50.310" end="01:42:55.920" style="s2">are biting you and you can kill them and</p>
<p begin="01:42:53.010" end="01:42:57.840" style="s2">that&#39;s fine but then there&#39;s the dragon</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.920" end="01:43:00.060" style="s2">just puffing out new ones so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.840" end="01:43:01.650" style="s2">Hydra problem right the old Hydra is the</p>
<p begin="01:43:00.060" end="01:43:04.409" style="s2">serpent you cut off one had seven more</p>
<p begin="01:43:01.650" end="01:43:07.260" style="s2">grow it&#39;s not a good thing and it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.409" end="01:43:09.659" style="s2">a cool dream because it really portrayed</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.260" end="01:43:11.880" style="s2">this class of all possible monsters</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.659" end="01:43:14.040" style="s2">problem so you&#39;ve got the specific</p>
<p begin="01:43:11.880" end="01:43:15.390" style="s2">monsters and that&#39;s a problem so you got</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.040" end="01:43:16.740" style="s2">to get rid of them but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:43:15.390" end="01:43:18.390" style="s2">not the problem the problem is is that</p>
<p begin="01:43:16.740" end="01:43:19.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s something in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:18.390" end="01:43:23.000" style="s2">background that&#39;s just generating</p>
<p begin="01:43:19.860" end="01:43:25.290" style="s2">monsters like mad and so I said to him</p>
<p begin="01:43:23.000" end="01:43:27.990" style="s2">what do you think you could do about</p>
<p begin="01:43:25.290" end="01:43:29.670" style="s2">that and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a loaded</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.990" end="01:43:31.560" style="s2">question right that&#39;s like leading the</p>
<p begin="01:43:29.670" end="01:43:33.630" style="s2">witness in the trial you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.560" end="01:43:36.870" style="s2">ask a question like that because it</p>
<p begin="01:43:33.630" end="01:43:38.190" style="s2">implies that it implies the answer what</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.870" end="01:43:40.410" style="s2">could you do about that</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.190" end="01:43:43.350" style="s2">is not any different than saying you</p>
<p begin="01:43:40.410" end="01:43:47.340" style="s2">could do something about that right so</p>
<p begin="01:43:43.350" end="01:43:48.660" style="s2">so I hinted at that as a possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.340" end="01:43:50.130" style="s2">his eyes lit up</p>
<p begin="01:43:48.660" end="01:43:52.380" style="s2">now you remember he&#39;s already running</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.130" end="01:43:54.180" style="s2">around as at night Hey so he kind of</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.380" end="01:43:56.580" style="s2">already knew what to do because he had</p>
<p begin="01:43:54.180" end="01:43:58.380" style="s2">the whole sword in the Hat and with that</p>
<p begin="01:43:56.580" end="01:44:01.440" style="s2">you know that you can go after the drag</p>
<p begin="01:43:58.380" end="01:44:05.280" style="s2">and he kind of got that and he said I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:44:01.440" end="01:44:07.350" style="s2">get my dad and then I jump up on top of</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.280" end="01:44:09.450" style="s2">the dragon and I&#39;d poke out both of its</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.350" end="01:44:12.060" style="s2">eyes with my sword and then he&#39;d go</p>
<p begin="01:44:09.450" end="01:44:14.190" style="s2">right down its throat to the fire box</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.060" end="01:44:16.230" style="s2">where the fire comes out and I carve out</p>
<p begin="01:44:14.190" end="01:44:21.470" style="s2">a piece of the fire box and then I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:44:16.230" end="01:44:21.470" style="s2">used that as a shield and I thought yes</p>
<p begin="01:44:21.530" end="01:44:29.130" style="s2">right right man it&#39;s so smart eh because</p>
<p begin="01:44:26.940" end="01:44:31.530" style="s2">he got the thing instantly he knew that</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.130" end="01:44:32.850" style="s2">he knew so imagine first of all he</p>
<p begin="01:44:31.530" end="01:44:35.160" style="s2">thought okay I have to go to the heart</p>
<p begin="01:44:32.850" end="01:44:37.440" style="s2">of the problem right and really to the</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.160" end="01:44:40.050" style="s2">heart not to the dragon but right down</p>
<p begin="01:44:37.440" end="01:44:42.900" style="s2">the dam thanks gullet right to the place</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.050" end="01:44:44.970" style="s2">where the fire was actually being it was</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.900" end="01:44:46.800" style="s2">actually being created because there it</p>
<p begin="01:44:44.970" end="01:44:48.420" style="s2">was there you could find the shield and</p>
<p begin="01:44:46.800" end="01:44:50.220" style="s2">that he&#39;d take this thing that was</p>
<p begin="01:44:48.420" end="01:44:51.540" style="s2">fireproof and make a shield out of it</p>
<p begin="01:44:50.220" end="01:44:54.870" style="s2">and so that was just</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.540" end="01:44:56.460" style="s2">he had bloody perfect it was so cool and</p>
<p begin="01:44:54.870" end="01:44:58.650" style="s2">you think well how could a kid come up</p>
<p begin="01:44:56.460" end="01:45:00.810" style="s2">with that and there&#39;s a bunch of answers</p>
<p begin="01:44:58.650" end="01:45:02.310" style="s2">I mean one is we know snake fear is</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.810" end="01:45:05.070" style="s2">innate we know that now there&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.310" end="01:45:07.620" style="s2">recent research data that that has</p>
<p begin="01:45:05.070" end="01:45:09.720" style="s2">demonstrated that okay so and we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.620" end="01:45:12.750" style="s2">preyed on and been predators for a very</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.720" end="01:45:14.670" style="s2">long period of time so the idea that and</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.750" end="01:45:16.800" style="s2">I found something else interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:45:14.670" end="01:45:18.570" style="s2">the brain out that dubrow out about the</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.800" end="01:45:20.970" style="s2">brain recently - and book I was reading</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.570" end="01:45:22.230" style="s2">by Ray Kurzweil called how to build a</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.970" end="01:45:25.590" style="s2">mind I think that&#39;s what it was called</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.230" end="01:45:27.000" style="s2">it was quite a good book so I think it</p>
<p begin="01:45:25.590" end="01:45:28.680" style="s2">was in that book or it was in the</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.000" end="01:45:29.099" style="s2">neuroscience paper I was reading doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.680" end="01:45:31.229" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.099" end="01:45:33.929" style="s2">but it was in one of those two places so</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.229" end="01:45:35.609" style="s2">you know that scanning technology has</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.929" end="01:45:37.109" style="s2">got more and more high resolution over</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.609" end="01:45:38.489" style="s2">the last few years right it just gets</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.109" end="01:45:40.889" style="s2">more and more high-resolution all the</p>
<p begin="01:45:38.489" end="01:45:42.929" style="s2">time and so people are now able to look</p>
<p begin="01:45:40.889" end="01:45:44.849" style="s2">at the micro structures of the brain in</p>
<p begin="01:45:42.929" end="01:45:47.189" style="s2">a way that hasn&#39;t been possible before</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.849" end="01:45:49.349" style="s2">and so the old idea with the cortex</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.189" end="01:45:51.809" style="s2">basically was that cortex was full of a</p>
<p begin="01:45:49.349" end="01:45:53.669" style="s2">bunch of neurons and then when one</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.809" end="01:45:55.709" style="s2">neuron and another fired at the same</p>
<p begin="01:45:53.669" end="01:45:57.539" style="s2">time they would wire together and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:45:55.709" end="01:45:59.909" style="s2">kind of how your brain learned to make</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.539" end="01:46:01.709" style="s2">connections it&#39;s a bit more complicated</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.909" end="01:46:03.169" style="s2">than that but that will do and then it</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.709" end="01:46:06.929" style="s2">was found that it wasn&#39;t quite that</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.169" end="01:46:09.300" style="s2">simple because what your cortex is made</p>
<p begin="01:46:06.929" end="01:46:11.579" style="s2">out of are these columns of neurons that</p>
<p begin="01:46:09.300" end="01:46:14.789" style="s2">are duplicated sort of like a like</p>
<p begin="01:46:11.579" end="01:46:16.769" style="s2">centipedes legs you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.789" end="01:46:18.989" style="s2">simple genetic code to add another leg</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.769" end="01:46:20.369" style="s2">set of legs to a centipede it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.989" end="01:46:22.439" style="s2">like that with your brain it&#39;s made out</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.369" end="01:46:25.169" style="s2">of all these columns and the columns are</p>
<p begin="01:46:22.439" end="01:46:27.449" style="s2">basically already quite wired up and</p>
<p begin="01:46:25.169" end="01:46:28.050" style="s2">then as you learn the columns wired</p>
<p begin="01:46:27.449" end="01:46:30.269" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.050" end="01:46:31.499" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s some pre-existence</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.269" end="01:46:33.449" style="s2">structure there but there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:46:31.499" end="01:46:36.840" style="s2">preexisting structure than what that was</p>
<p begin="01:46:33.449" end="01:46:39.590" style="s2">thought so it&#39;s it&#39;s basically that</p>
<p begin="01:46:36.840" end="01:46:42.119" style="s2">there are already tracts that link</p>
<p begin="01:46:39.590" end="01:46:44.879" style="s2">columns together that are in different</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.119" end="01:46:46.849" style="s2">parts of the brain and the columns can</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.879" end="01:46:50.879" style="s2">or the columns themselves can send out</p>
<p begin="01:46:46.849" end="01:46:51.869" style="s2">dendrites to these superhighways which</p>
<p begin="01:46:50.879" end="01:46:53.699" style="s2">are already there and then the</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.869" end="01:46:56.519" style="s2">superhighway is there and then it can</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.699" end="01:46:58.619" style="s2">generate connections to the columns at</p>
<p begin="01:46:56.519" end="01:47:00.419" style="s2">the end of the superhighway so what that</p>
<p begin="01:46:58.619" end="01:47:02.189" style="s2">means is that there&#39;s a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:47:00.419" end="01:47:04.349" style="s2">amount of cortical structure already in</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.189" end="01:47:05.579" style="s2">place but there&#39;s plasticity around that</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.349" end="01:47:06.629" style="s2">and when I read that I thought well</p>
<p begin="01:47:05.579" end="01:47:08.219" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the source of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.629" end="01:47:10.109" style="s2">archetypes there&#39;s already an archetypal</p>
<p begin="01:47:08.219" end="01:47:12.689" style="s2">structure there that as well as the</p>
<p begin="01:47:10.109" end="01:47:15.469" style="s2">subcortical structures so you could say</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.689" end="01:47:19.349" style="s2">that like the kid already had within him</p>
<p begin="01:47:15.469" end="01:47:21.419" style="s2">not only the capacity to represent not</p>
<p begin="01:47:19.349" end="01:47:23.550" style="s2">only the monster but the class of all</p>
<p begin="01:47:21.419" end="01:47:25.590" style="s2">possible monsters and the fact that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.550" end="01:47:27.239" style="s2">problem wasn&#39;t monsters the problem was</p>
<p begin="01:47:25.590" end="01:47:29.609" style="s2">that monsters could continually be</p>
<p begin="01:47:27.239" end="01:47:31.469" style="s2">generated which is a way worse problem</p>
<p begin="01:47:29.609" end="01:47:33.599" style="s2">and then the answer to that isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.469" end="01:47:35.159" style="s2">kill an individual monster the answer to</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.599" end="01:47:38.579" style="s2">that is go to the source of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.159" end="01:47:40.379" style="s2">monstrous itself and defeat it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.579" end="01:47:41.459" style="s2">absolutely staggering and you could</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.379" end="01:47:42.929" style="s2">imagine that it would take a tremendous</p>
<p begin="01:47:41.459" end="01:47:45.119" style="s2">amount of meditate</p>
<p begin="01:47:42.929" end="01:47:46.739" style="s2">of effort for people to have come up</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.119" end="01:47:51.510" style="s2">with that solution over a very long</p>
<p begin="01:47:46.739" end="01:47:54.599" style="s2">period of time so now the point of the</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.510" end="01:47:57.269" style="s2">representation is to formulate a picture</p>
<p begin="01:47:54.599" end="01:47:59.820" style="s2">of what it is that&#39;s the threat so that</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.269" end="01:48:03.059" style="s2">you can then formulate a general purpose</p>
<p begin="01:47:59.820" end="01:48:05.459" style="s2">solution and so there&#39;s this image of</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.059" end="01:48:07.349" style="s2">Kali which I really like because Kelly</p>
<p begin="01:48:05.459" end="01:48:10.249" style="s2">is sort of the goddess of the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:48:07.349" end="01:48:13.860" style="s2">let&#39;s say in destruction and so Kelly is</p>
<p begin="01:48:10.249" end="01:48:15.119" style="s2">she has a headdress of fire her hair is</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.860" end="01:48:17.519" style="s2">on fire and she has a headdress of</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.119" end="01:48:19.409" style="s2">skulls and she has hands cut off all</p>
<p begin="01:48:17.519" end="01:48:21.590" style="s2">around her neck and she has a belt</p>
<p begin="01:48:19.409" end="01:48:24.420" style="s2">that&#39;s often snakes but it&#39;s sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.590" end="01:48:26.309" style="s2">she sometimes eating the intestines of</p>
<p begin="01:48:24.420" end="01:48:28.170" style="s2">this guy that she&#39;s just given birth to</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.309" end="01:48:30.479" style="s2">and that she&#39;s sitting on she has eight</p>
<p begin="01:48:28.170" end="01:48:33.119" style="s2">legs like a spider and she&#39;s in a web of</p>
<p begin="01:48:30.479" end="01:48:35.939" style="s2">fire and so she&#39;s a monster in some</p>
<p begin="01:48:33.119" end="01:48:38.610" style="s2">sense that represents everything that</p>
<p begin="01:48:35.939" end="01:48:40.459" style="s2">might terrify and devour you and the</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.610" end="01:48:42.539" style="s2">question is so you come up with that</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.459" end="01:48:45.059" style="s2">representation as an image to represent</p>
<p begin="01:48:42.539" end="01:48:47.159" style="s2">the class of all terrifying things and</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.059" end="01:48:49.949" style="s2">then you have to generate a solution in</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.159" end="01:48:51.989" style="s2">the face of that class and sacrifice is</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.949" end="01:48:54.209" style="s2">one of the solutions but that heroic</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.989" end="01:48:56.090" style="s2">encounter is another one of the</p>
<p begin="01:48:54.209" end="01:48:58.679" style="s2">solutions and that&#39;s the one that he</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.090" end="01:49:00.689" style="s2">catalyzed now he&#39;d been read lots of</p>
<p begin="01:48:58.679" end="01:49:04.050" style="s2">books he&#39;d watched lots of Disney movies</p>
<p begin="01:49:00.689" end="01:49:06.659" style="s2">you know and and he&#39;d seen the heroic</p>
<p begin="01:49:04.050" end="01:49:09.659" style="s2">pattern portrayed many many places and</p>
<p begin="01:49:06.659" end="01:49:12.239" style="s2">his little brain was working like mad to</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.659" end="01:49:14.099" style="s2">extract out the essence of that and to</p>
<p begin="01:49:12.239" end="01:49:17.219" style="s2">embody it and when I asked him that</p>
<p begin="01:49:14.099" end="01:49:19.380" style="s2">question it just went snap and all those</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.219" end="01:49:22.260" style="s2">things lined up and his night terrors</p>
<p begin="01:49:19.380" end="01:49:23.909" style="s2">went away that was it and I followed up</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.260" end="01:49:26.070" style="s2">with his mom because it was really quite</p>
<p begin="01:49:23.909" end="01:49:27.900" style="s2">remarkable the whole set of occurrences</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.070" end="01:49:29.340" style="s2">you know and he didn&#39;t have night</p>
<p begin="01:49:27.900" end="01:49:30.989" style="s2">terrors that night even though he&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="01:49:29.340" end="01:49:32.969" style="s2">having the nightly and that was the end</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.989" end="01:49:35.760" style="s2">of them because he&#39;d solved his problem</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.969" end="01:49:38.789" style="s2">like he needed to be the courageous</p>
<p begin="01:49:35.760" end="01:49:42.360" style="s2">knight that went after the dragon and so</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.789" end="01:49:47.489" style="s2">that is what people need to be so I</p>
<p begin="01:49:42.360" end="01:49:50.309" style="s2">think when we go into solitude we shut</p>
<p begin="01:49:47.489" end="01:49:53.219" style="s2">off the external stimulation and we let</p>
<p begin="01:49:50.309" end="01:49:56.610" style="s2">the Dreaming part of our mind emerge and</p>
<p begin="01:49:53.219" end="01:50:00.139" style="s2">that&#39;s this nonverbal pattern</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.610" end="01:50:02.820" style="s2">detector that thinks in images and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:50:00.139" end="01:50:04.679" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that mediates between</p>
<p begin="01:50:02.820" end="01:50:06.360" style="s2">what we don&#39;t understand and what we do</p>
<p begin="01:50:04.679" end="01:50:07.889" style="s2">understand like if you understand it</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.360" end="01:50:10.080" style="s2">completely you can say it and you can</p>
<p begin="01:50:07.889" end="01:50:11.850" style="s2">act it out if you don&#39;t understand it</p>
<p begin="01:50:10.080" end="01:50:15.320" style="s2">you represent it in images and there</p>
<p begin="01:50:11.850" end="01:50:17.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s the emotion fear</p>
<p begin="01:50:15.320" end="01:50:19.889" style="s2">withdrawal paralysis and then that</p>
<p begin="01:50:17.940" end="01:50:22.679" style="s2">manifests itself in an image of what</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.889" end="01:50:24.900" style="s2">that might be and that image is the</p>
<p begin="01:50:22.679" end="01:50:27.080" style="s2">basis for the story and it&#39;s the basis</p>
<p begin="01:50:24.900" end="01:50:29.880" style="s2">for further development of the idea and</p>
<p begin="01:50:27.080" end="01:50:32.010" style="s2">to go into isolation is to let those</p>
<p begin="01:50:29.880" end="01:50:35.010" style="s2">images emerge and to dream a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.010" end="01:50:39.030" style="s2">and then that moves you that moves you</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.010" end="01:50:42.300" style="s2">ahead into the future so language they</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.030" end="01:50:45.000" style="s2">use before it&#39;s enough just to map out</p>
<p begin="01:50:42.300" end="01:50:46.949" style="s2">the danger that is imminent in front of</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.000" end="01:50:48.980" style="s2">you but all the potential dangers that</p>
<p begin="01:50:46.949" end="01:50:53.460" style="s2">you could come up with in abstract form</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.980" end="01:50:55.800" style="s2">yeah well remember what happens when God</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.460" end="01:50:58.619" style="s2">throws Adam and Eve out of out of</p>
<p begin="01:50:55.800" end="01:51:01.170" style="s2">paradise they become aware that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:50:58.619" end="01:51:03.480" style="s2">going to die right the future becomes a</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.170" end="01:51:05.659" style="s2">problem because you could say the future</p>
<p begin="01:51:03.480" end="01:51:08.040" style="s2">is the place of all potential monsters</p>
<p begin="01:51:05.659" end="01:51:09.270" style="s2">right and so just the monster that you</p>
<p begin="01:51:08.040" end="01:51:10.739" style="s2">have right in front of you it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.270" end="01:51:12.780" style="s2">yeah well you get rid of that but that</p>
<p begin="01:51:10.739" end="01:51:14.940" style="s2">doesn&#39;t solve your problem does it the</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.780" end="01:51:17.610" style="s2">problem is how do you exist in a world</p>
<p begin="01:51:14.940" end="01:51:19.590" style="s2">full of monsters and part of that answer</p>
<p begin="01:51:17.610" end="01:51:22.920" style="s2">is well you become a monster yourself</p>
<p begin="01:51:19.590" end="01:51:24.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a big part of the answer but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:22.920" end="01:51:26.489" style="s2">an incomplete answer because if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:51:24.780" end="01:51:28.889" style="s2">just a monster then you&#39;re just as bad</p>
<p begin="01:51:26.489" end="01:51:31.080" style="s2">as the monsters so you have to trance</p>
<p begin="01:51:28.889" end="01:51:32.760" style="s2">you have to be a monstrous enough to</p>
<p begin="01:51:31.080" end="01:51:34.260" style="s2">contend with the monsters but then you</p>
<p begin="01:51:32.760" end="01:51:36.150" style="s2">have to be civilized enough so that</p>
<p begin="01:51:34.260" end="01:51:38.639" style="s2">you&#39;re not a monster yourself and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:51:36.150" end="01:51:42.960" style="s2">more or less equivalent to the Union</p>
<p begin="01:51:38.639" end="01:51:45.500" style="s2">inter integration of the shadow so yep</p>
<p begin="01:51:42.960" end="01:51:45.500" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="01:51:51.130" end="01:51:55.880" style="s2">hiya dr. Peterson now I&#39;ve been wanting</p>
<p begin="01:51:53.480" end="01:51:58.850" style="s2">to ask you this for a while now since I</p>
<p begin="01:51:55.880" end="01:52:01.130" style="s2">started watching your lectures after I</p>
<p begin="01:51:58.850" end="01:52:05.350" style="s2">started reading and nici&#39;s Beyond Good</p>
<p begin="01:52:01.130" end="01:52:08.390" style="s2">and Evil I came upon a paragraph in his</p>
<p begin="01:52:05.350" end="01:52:10.130" style="s2">chapter on scholars that really really</p>
<p begin="01:52:08.390" end="01:52:12.770" style="s2">bothered me and it actually bothers me</p>
<p begin="01:52:10.130" end="01:52:15.010" style="s2">to this day he talked about this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:52:12.770" end="01:52:17.780" style="s2">person like they were just a mirror-like</p>
<p begin="01:52:15.010" end="01:52:19.910" style="s2">they stretched he said every part of</p>
<p begin="01:52:17.780" end="01:52:22.640" style="s2">their skin basically to allow every new</p>
<p begin="01:52:19.910" end="01:52:25.130" style="s2">piece of information that they took on</p>
<p begin="01:52:22.640" end="01:52:26.720" style="s2">and that all they ever were was just an</p>
<p begin="01:52:25.130" end="01:52:29.030" style="s2">instrument they were just a mirror on</p>
<p begin="01:52:26.720" end="01:52:31.400" style="s2">reflecting what they had learned never</p>
<p begin="01:52:29.030" end="01:52:32.960" style="s2">actually having generated anything on</p>
<p begin="01:52:31.400" end="01:52:34.700" style="s2">their own and it&#39;s it&#39;s bothered me</p>
<p begin="01:52:32.960" end="01:52:37.700" style="s2">because I feel like in a way it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="01:52:34.700" end="01:52:39.530" style="s2">of like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s impacted my</p>
<p begin="01:52:37.700" end="01:52:42.140" style="s2">identity a lot because I don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="01:52:39.530" end="01:52:44.720" style="s2">are you supposed to create something you</p>
<p begin="01:52:42.140" end="01:52:45.590" style="s2">know ok well that&#39;s ok that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:52:44.720" end="01:52:48.020" style="s2">really good question</p>
<p begin="01:52:45.590" end="01:52:50.510" style="s2">I mean Nietzsche is often classed with</p>
<p begin="01:52:48.020" end="01:52:52.310" style="s2">the existentialists right and so one of</p>
<p begin="01:52:50.510" end="01:52:54.280" style="s2">the tenants of existentialist there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:52:54.280" end="01:52:59.480" style="s2">there&#39;s more but obviously we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:52:56.870" end="01:53:01.820" style="s2">oversimplifying but one is that life is</p>
<p begin="01:52:59.480" end="01:53:04.640" style="s2">a problem it isn&#39;t because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:01.820" end="01:53:06.680" style="s2">something wrong with you it&#39;s that life</p>
<p begin="01:53:04.640" end="01:53:09.260" style="s2">is a problem and so that&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="01:53:06.680" end="01:53:10.850" style="s2">contrasted with the Freudian view which</p>
<p begin="01:53:09.260" end="01:53:13.070" style="s2">is that if you have a problem it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:53:10.850" end="01:53:15.230" style="s2">because something went wrong during your</p>
<p begin="01:53:13.070" end="01:53:18.680" style="s2">development the existentialist said no</p>
<p begin="01:53:15.230" end="01:53:22.840" style="s2">no it&#39;s like life is a problem make no</p>
<p begin="01:53:18.680" end="01:53:22.840" style="s2">mistake about it and that</p>
<p begin="01:53:28.690" end="01:53:35.000" style="s2">the purpose of the purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:53:33.020" end="01:53:38.900" style="s2">scholarship is in some sense to solve</p>
<p begin="01:53:35.000" end="01:53:40.880" style="s2">that problem and so for Nietzsche like</p>
<p begin="01:53:38.900" end="01:53:44.090" style="s2">he said all truths are bloody truths to</p>
<p begin="01:53:40.880" end="01:53:47.120" style="s2">me and what he meant by that was that if</p>
<p begin="01:53:44.090" end="01:53:49.550" style="s2">an idea didn&#39;t incarnate itself in you</p>
<p begin="01:53:47.120" end="01:53:51.860" style="s2">and transform your perceptions and your</p>
<p begin="01:53:49.550" end="01:53:53.150" style="s2">actions then you were merely possessed</p>
<p begin="01:53:51.860" end="01:53:55.730" style="s2">by the idea you were merely a</p>
<p begin="01:53:53.150" end="01:53:57.710" style="s2">spokesperson for the idea or you could</p>
<p begin="01:53:55.730" end="01:54:01.790" style="s2">say that the idea possessed you you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="01:53:57.710" end="01:54:03.830" style="s2">puppet for the idea it&#39;s not you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:01.790" end="01:54:06.530" style="s2">the idea is in you and it has you you</p>
<p begin="01:54:03.830" end="01:54:08.000" style="s2">haven&#39;t taken the idea and incorporated</p>
<p begin="01:54:06.530" end="01:54:11.000" style="s2">with you and made it part of your life</p>
<p begin="01:54:08.000" end="01:54:12.650" style="s2">and so there&#39;s a romanticism that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:54:11.000" end="01:54:15.020" style="s2">associated with that right that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="01:54:15.020" end="01:54:22.090" style="s2">ideas are not merely they&#39;re not merely</p>
<p begin="01:54:19.070" end="01:54:24.800" style="s2">what would you call abstracted</p>
<p begin="01:54:22.090" end="01:54:28.700" style="s2">representations that can be tossed about</p>
<p begin="01:54:24.800" end="01:54:30.440" style="s2">as if they&#39;re commodities there there</p>
<p begin="01:54:28.700" end="01:54:32.000" style="s2">there are more like pert they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:54:30.440" end="01:54:35.930" style="s2">like personalities that might be another</p>
<p begin="01:54:32.000" end="01:54:38.480" style="s2">way of thinking about it and so if</p>
<p begin="01:54:35.930" end="01:54:42.380" style="s2">you&#39;re if if those ideas are compelling</p>
<p begin="01:54:38.480" end="01:54:44.660" style="s2">then you don&#39;t like one thing I learned</p>
<p begin="01:54:42.380" end="01:54:46.940" style="s2">a long time ago and I think this is</p>
<p begin="01:54:44.660" end="01:54:49.640" style="s2">probably relevant I know when I was a</p>
<p begin="01:54:46.940" end="01:54:52.640" style="s2">kid I like to argue and I like to win</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.640" end="01:54:54.350" style="s2">arguments or or or lose them although I</p>
<p begin="01:54:52.640" end="01:54:56.420" style="s2">like winning them a lot better but I</p>
<p begin="01:54:54.350" end="01:54:58.970" style="s2">didn&#39;t really mind so much what the</p>
<p begin="01:54:56.420" end="01:55:02.600" style="s2">content of the argument was you know I</p>
<p begin="01:54:58.970" end="01:55:04.520" style="s2">could engage in it like a sparring match</p>
<p begin="01:55:02.600" end="01:55:05.600" style="s2">and it was in some sense to establish</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.520" end="01:55:07.670" style="s2">dominance right to establish</p>
<p begin="01:55:05.600" end="01:55:10.510" style="s2">intellectual dominance I quit doing that</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.670" end="01:55:13.760" style="s2">when I was in my mid-20s because I</p>
<p begin="01:55:10.510" end="01:55:16.220" style="s2">thought that that was too shallow an</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.760" end="01:55:20.240" style="s2">approach to the ideas they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.220" end="01:55:23.450" style="s2">commodities of that sort they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="01:55:20.240" end="01:55:24.920" style="s2">they have tendrils that reach down into</p>
<p begin="01:55:23.450" end="01:55:27.620" style="s2">the living that&#39;s the right way to think</p>
<p begin="01:55:24.920" end="01:55:29.920" style="s2">about it and so Nietzsche&#39;s criticism of</p>
<p begin="01:55:27.620" end="01:55:32.930" style="s2">scholars and he did this a lot was that</p>
<p begin="01:55:29.920" end="01:55:34.940" style="s2">they were bloodless you know they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:32.930" end="01:55:36.470" style="s2">they were full of performative</p>
<p begin="01:55:34.940" end="01:55:38.000" style="s2">contradictions that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="01:55:36.470" end="01:55:39.920" style="s2">thinking about they&#39;d say one thing and</p>
<p begin="01:55:38.000" end="01:55:41.809" style="s2">do another because their intellect was</p>
<p begin="01:55:39.920" end="01:55:44.929" style="s2">completely dissociated from their</p>
<p begin="01:55:41.809" end="01:55:47.750" style="s2">from their actions and Heath he he</p>
<p begin="01:55:44.929" end="01:55:50.389" style="s2">thought that was a very bad idea and I</p>
<p begin="01:55:47.750" end="01:55:52.250" style="s2">think that that&#39;s a good criticism I</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.389" end="01:55:53.869" style="s2">think it is a bad idea I also think it</p>
<p begin="01:55:52.250" end="01:55:56.329" style="s2">makes for an extraordinarily boring</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.869" end="01:55:58.130" style="s2">lecturer you know because you can tell</p>
<p begin="01:55:56.329" end="01:55:59.659" style="s2">if you&#39;re listening to someone whether</p>
<p begin="01:55:58.130" end="01:56:01.820" style="s2">the idea is that you&#39;re hearing are</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.659" end="01:56:04.039" style="s2">merely being passed through the person</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.820" end="01:56:06.530" style="s2">as if they&#39;re being memorized say or</p>
<p begin="01:56:04.039" end="01:56:09.349" style="s2">whether they&#39;re part of the dynamic core</p>
<p begin="01:56:06.530" end="01:56:10.969" style="s2">of the person and if they&#39;re part of the</p>
<p begin="01:56:09.349" end="01:56:13.219" style="s2">dynamic core of the person then they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:56:10.969" end="01:56:16.550" style="s2">almost always engaging and gripping and</p>
<p begin="01:56:13.219" end="01:56:18.230" style="s2">so he wasn&#39;t a fan of bloodless scholars</p>
<p begin="01:56:16.550" end="01:56:21.980" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s correct because one</p>
<p begin="01:56:18.230" end="01:56:25.119" style="s2">of the things that I see it&#39;s not a good</p>
<p begin="01:56:21.980" end="01:56:27.639" style="s2">idea to have ideas possess you unless</p>
<p begin="01:56:25.119" end="01:56:31.010" style="s2">you know what the ideas are up to and</p>
<p begin="01:56:27.639" end="01:56:32.510" style="s2">lots of people are possessed by ideas</p>
<p begin="01:56:31.010" end="01:56:34.070" style="s2">rather than possessing them and that</p>
<p begin="01:56:32.510" end="01:56:36.199" style="s2">what that means is they haven&#39;t taken</p>
<p begin="01:56:34.070" end="01:56:36.920" style="s2">the ideas and integrated them into their</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.199" end="01:56:40.400" style="s2">own being</p>
<p begin="01:56:36.920" end="01:56:42.170" style="s2">they haven&#39;t it&#39;s like an incarnation in</p>
<p begin="01:56:40.400" end="01:56:46.610" style="s2">a sense they haven&#39;t incarnated the</p>
<p begin="01:56:42.170" end="01:56:47.630" style="s2">ideas in an embodied form and and so</p>
<p begin="01:56:46.610" end="01:56:50.329" style="s2">they&#39;re incomplete</p>
<p begin="01:56:47.630" end="01:56:52.309" style="s2">you know Nietzsche also in thus spake</p>
<p begin="01:56:50.329" end="01:56:54.380" style="s2">Zarathustra when Zarathustra comes down</p>
<p begin="01:56:52.309" end="01:56:56.780" style="s2">the mountain he sees a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="01:56:54.380" end="01:56:58.340" style="s2">gathered around a famous individual I</p>
<p begin="01:56:56.780" end="01:56:58.699" style="s2">think maybe a scholar but doesn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.340" end="01:57:01.099" style="s2">matter</p>
<p begin="01:56:58.699" end="01:57:02.599" style="s2">and when Zarathustra goes in looks at</p>
<p begin="01:57:01.099" end="01:57:05.719" style="s2">the person all he sees his little tiny</p>
<p begin="01:57:02.599" end="01:57:07.909" style="s2"> with a gigantic ear and so he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:57:05.719" end="01:57:10.099" style="s2">hyper specialist right and so he has a</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.909" end="01:57:12.800" style="s2">pretty impressive ear but he&#39;s only this</p>
<p begin="01:57:10.099" end="01:57:14.539" style="s2">big and that was Nietzsche&#39;s imagistic</p>
<p begin="01:57:12.800" end="01:57:17.179" style="s2">commentary on the danger of hyper</p>
<p begin="01:57:14.539" end="01:57:19.340" style="s2">specialization and also on the danger of</p>
<p begin="01:57:17.179" end="01:57:21.619" style="s2">adulation for hyperspecialization</p>
<p begin="01:57:19.340" end="01:57:22.750" style="s2">and and because he thought about it as a</p>
<p begin="01:57:21.619" end="01:57:27.369" style="s2">kind of deformity</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.750" end="01:57:27.369" style="s2">now Nietzsche was a pretty harsh guy but</p>
<p begin="01:57:28.239" end="01:57:33.050" style="s2">but he did address the issue of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:30.739" end="01:57:35.630" style="s2">relationship between intellectual</p>
<p begin="01:57:33.050" end="01:57:37.429" style="s2">knowledge and and action because for</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.630" end="01:57:42.230" style="s2">Nietzsche those things are not to be</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.429" end="01:57:44.690" style="s2">separated in some sense so yeah so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:57:42.230" end="01:57:47.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t know why it maybe it bothered</p>
<p begin="01:57:44.690" end="01:57:49.159" style="s2">you like it&#39;s hard to say why it</p>
<p begin="01:57:47.420" end="01:57:51.409" style="s2">bothered you it might have bothered you</p>
<p begin="01:57:49.159" end="01:57:53.599" style="s2">because it&#39;s sort of undermined the idea</p>
<p begin="01:57:51.409" end="01:57:54.920" style="s2">of scholar but the other possibility and</p>
<p begin="01:57:53.599" end="01:57:55.520" style="s2">this isn&#39;t an accusation because</p>
<p begin="01:57:54.920" end="01:57:57.080" style="s2">obviously</p>
<p begin="01:57:55.520" end="01:57:59.300" style="s2">I don&#39;t know anything about you but it</p>
<p begin="01:57:57.080" end="01:58:02.200" style="s2">might also be that it struck a chord you</p>
<p begin="01:57:59.300" end="01:58:07.360" style="s2">know and that maybe you were doubtful or</p>
<p begin="01:58:02.200" end="01:58:11.540" style="s2">questioning how tightly associated your</p>
<p begin="01:58:07.360" end="01:58:14.900" style="s2">intellectual endeavor was with your</p>
<p begin="01:58:11.540" end="01:58:16.520" style="s2">actual character and your practice so</p>
<p begin="01:58:14.900" end="01:58:17.600" style="s2">that&#39;s another possibility I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:16.520" end="01:58:19.370" style="s2">a really good thing to think about</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.600" end="01:58:21.590" style="s2">because generally speaking that</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.370" end="01:58:24.500" style="s2">integration is it is very much lacking</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.590" end="01:58:26.690" style="s2">people are a lot smarter and fluid with</p>
<p begin="01:58:24.500" end="01:58:29.900" style="s2">their ideas than they are ethical and</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.690" end="01:58:34.840" style="s2">consistent and characterized by</p>
<p begin="01:58:29.900" end="01:58:34.840" style="s2">integrity so yep</p>
<p begin="01:58:42.020" end="01:58:47.099" style="s2">hey um so last week you talked about how</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.360" end="01:58:48.570" style="s2">you hated people asking you if you</p>
<p begin="01:58:47.099" end="01:58:49.800" style="s2">believe in God or do you believe in</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.570" end="01:58:51.960" style="s2">miracles or you just like those</p>
<p begin="01:58:49.800" end="01:58:53.699" style="s2">questions elytis but you also talked</p>
<p begin="01:58:51.960" end="01:58:54.449" style="s2">about how and I want to put words in</p>
<p begin="01:58:53.699" end="01:58:56.699" style="s2">your mouth but I think you said</p>
<p begin="01:58:54.449" end="01:58:59.070" style="s2">something about the idea of an empirical</p>
<p begin="01:58:56.699" end="01:59:01.110" style="s2">evidence for religious experiences or</p>
<p begin="01:58:59.070" end="01:59:04.170" style="s2">spiritual experiences and I wonder how</p>
<p begin="01:59:01.110" end="01:59:06.060" style="s2">those two ideas can a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:59:04.170" end="01:59:11.449" style="s2">existence or can a spiritual experience</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.060" end="01:59:13.920" style="s2">exist without God or who knows who knows</p>
<p begin="01:59:11.449" end="01:59:15.659" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.920" end="01:59:17.429" style="s2">what to make of that I mean you could it</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.659" end="01:59:20.429" style="s2">depends on what you&#39;re willing to accept</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.429" end="01:59:22.770" style="s2">as proof I suppose that&#39;s where things</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.429" end="01:59:24.719" style="s2">get tricky you know if you have to</p>
<p begin="01:59:22.770" end="01:59:27.360" style="s2">demonstrate the existence of God</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.719" end="01:59:30.300" style="s2">objectively then subjective experiences</p>
<p begin="01:59:27.360" end="01:59:33.329" style="s2">of the transcendent are irrelevant right</p>
<p begin="01:59:30.300" end="01:59:35.099" style="s2">but and and that&#39;s a perfectly</p>

<p begin="01:59:35.099" end="01:59:39.449" style="s2">presupposition is the only thing that</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.679" end="01:59:41.460" style="s2">has actual existence is those things</p>
<p begin="01:59:39.449" end="01:59:44.130" style="s2">that can be demonstrated objectively and</p>
<p begin="01:59:41.460" end="01:59:46.590" style="s2">I&#39;m not putting that down like that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:59:46.590" end="01:59:50.940" style="s2">basically dependent on the acceptance at</p>

<p begin="01:59:50.940" end="01:59:59.190" style="s2">axioms but I also think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:54.179" end="02:00:01.949" style="s2">difficult for me to deny the existence</p>
<p begin="01:59:59.190" end="02:00:04.650" style="s2">of these patterns of thinking that seem</p>
<p begin="02:00:01.949" end="02:00:06.480" style="s2">to exist cross-culturally like the</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.650" end="02:00:09.570" style="s2">existence of the representation of the</p>
<p begin="02:00:06.480" end="02:00:11.969" style="s2">Dragon for example especially given that</p>
<p begin="02:00:09.570" end="02:00:14.150" style="s2">I can see an evolutionary rationale for</p>
<p begin="02:00:11.969" end="02:00:17.570" style="s2">the emergence of these representations</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.150" end="02:00:20.280" style="s2">so and then there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="02:00:17.570" end="02:00:23.360" style="s2">indisputable fact that religious</p>
<p begin="02:00:20.280" end="02:00:25.760" style="s2">experiences are accessible to people</p>
<p begin="02:00:23.360" end="02:00:28.760" style="s2">through a number of different avenues</p>
<p begin="02:00:25.760" end="02:00:31.260" style="s2">now and one of the things I mentioned</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.760" end="02:00:32.969" style="s2">when I discussed this before is well you</p>
<p begin="02:00:31.260" end="02:00:36.750" style="s2">could say well those are no different</p>
<p begin="02:00:32.969" end="02:00:38.099" style="s2">than experiences of psychopathology but</p>
<p begin="02:00:36.750" end="02:00:40.409" style="s2">they are different because the</p>
<p begin="02:00:38.099" end="02:00:43.079" style="s2">experiences of psychopathology damage</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.409" end="02:00:45.270" style="s2">people whereas the evidence is that the</p>
<p begin="02:00:43.079" end="02:00:47.849" style="s2">transcendent experiences actually help</p>
<p begin="02:00:45.270" end="02:00:49.469" style="s2">people so unless you can unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:47.849" end="02:00:51.360" style="s2">willing to say well there are some forms</p>
<p begin="02:00:49.469" end="02:00:54.690" style="s2">of psychopathological experience that</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.360" end="02:00:56.400" style="s2">actually facilitate health which is</p>
<p begin="02:00:54.690" end="02:00:59.280" style="s2">possibility but you know I think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.400" end="02:01:06.540" style="s2">you&#39;re pushing your hypothesis at that</p>
<p begin="02:00:59.280" end="02:01:09.500" style="s2">point I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="02:01:06.540" end="02:01:12.449" style="s2">about a religious experience is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:01:09.500" end="02:01:15.330" style="s2">well generally a religious experience is</p>
<p begin="02:01:12.449" end="02:01:17.520" style="s2">something like an experience of the of</p>
<p begin="02:01:15.330" end="02:01:19.469" style="s2">the renewal of the world that might be</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.520" end="02:01:21.770" style="s2">one way of thinking about it so that</p>
<p begin="02:01:19.469" end="02:01:25.020" style="s2">everything sort of leaps forward as</p>
<p begin="02:01:21.770" end="02:01:26.820" style="s2">crystalline and perfect as if you had</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.020" end="02:01:30.540" style="s2">been viewing it from behind a mask</p>
<p begin="02:01:26.820" end="02:01:33.210" style="s2">before another would be a sense of the</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.540" end="02:01:35.250" style="s2">union of everything and so you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="02:01:33.210" end="02:01:36.989" style="s2">singular being and you&#39;re isolated and</p>
<p begin="02:01:35.250" end="02:01:38.580" style="s2">in the religious experiences so for</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.989" end="02:01:44.610" style="s2">example there&#39;s a book written recently</p>
<p begin="02:01:38.580" end="02:01:47.610" style="s2">by a neuroscientist my stroke of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:01:44.610" end="02:01:49.860" style="s2">it called my stroke of insight yeah</p>
<p begin="02:01:47.610" end="02:01:52.290" style="s2">that&#39;s right and I believe she had a</p>
<p begin="02:01:49.860" end="02:01:56.870" style="s2">left hemisphere stroke if I remember</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.290" end="02:01:58.980" style="s2">correctly and she was sufficiently</p>
<p begin="02:01:56.870" end="02:02:00.840" style="s2">well-developed neuroscientists to</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.980" end="02:02:04.800" style="s2">understand what was happening as she had</p>
<p begin="02:02:00.840" end="02:02:07.080" style="s2">the stroke and and she had a intense</p>
<p begin="02:02:04.800" end="02:02:09.540" style="s2">religious experience as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="02:02:07.080" end="02:02:12.210" style="s2">that and she experienced it as a</p>
<p begin="02:02:09.540" end="02:02:14.270" style="s2">dissolution of the ego into this state</p>
<p begin="02:02:12.210" end="02:02:17.250" style="s2">of union with everything and this</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.270" end="02:02:19.739" style="s2">transcendent experience of awe and and</p>
<p begin="02:02:17.250" end="02:02:21.480" style="s2">the open well I don&#39;t remember the rest</p>
<p begin="02:02:19.739" end="02:02:22.860" style="s2">of it I mean there are other elements of</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.480" end="02:02:24.480" style="s2">religious experience that are quite</p>
<p begin="02:02:22.860" end="02:02:26.969" style="s2">common the idea of the opening of the</p>
<p begin="02:02:24.480" end="02:02:29.310" style="s2">heavens that&#39;s one the communion with</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.969" end="02:02:31.260" style="s2">the ancestors that&#39;s another the</p>
<p begin="02:02:29.310" end="02:02:34.320" style="s2">reduction of the body to a skeleton</p>
<p begin="02:02:31.260" end="02:02:37.410" style="s2">that&#39;s another movement up into heaven</p>
<p begin="02:02:34.320" end="02:02:40.199" style="s2">like these are well documented phenomena</p>
<p begin="02:02:37.410" end="02:02:41.699" style="s2">and a lot of them are associated well of</p>
<p begin="02:02:40.199" end="02:02:43.380" style="s2">a fair number of them were associated</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.699" end="02:02:45.750" style="s2">with psychedelic use but that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="02:02:43.380" end="02:02:48.030" style="s2">only Avenue to experiences like that and</p>
<p begin="02:02:45.750" end="02:02:50.520" style="s2">epilepsy can produce experiences like</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.030" end="02:02:52.800" style="s2">that too and then people usually report</p>
<p begin="02:02:50.520" end="02:02:54.449" style="s2">a near-death experience as well you know</p>
<p begin="02:02:52.800" end="02:02:56.360" style="s2">people usually report that those</p>
<p begin="02:02:54.449" end="02:02:59.989" style="s2">experiences have life-altering</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.360" end="02:03:02.910" style="s2">significance now that in and of itself</p>
<p begin="02:02:59.989" end="02:03:04.949" style="s2">only proves that people are capable of</p>
<p begin="02:03:02.910" end="02:03:05.640" style="s2">having subjective religious experiences</p>
<p begin="02:03:04.949" end="02:03:08.490" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.640" end="02:03:10.830" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t definitively prove</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.490" end="02:03:13.050" style="s2">there&#39;s anything outside of that so</p>
<p begin="02:03:10.830" end="02:03:15.570" style="s2">young Carl young for example most of the</p>
<p begin="02:03:13.050" end="02:03:18.360" style="s2">time he didn&#39;t talk about God he talked</p>
<p begin="02:03:15.570" end="02:03:20.040" style="s2">about the God image which is not the</p>
<p begin="02:03:18.360" end="02:03:22.110" style="s2">same thing because you could have a god</p>
<p begin="02:03:20.040" end="02:03:24.600" style="s2">image that was even evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.110" end="02:03:29.010" style="s2">instantiated without that necessarily</p>
<p begin="02:03:24.600" end="02:03:33.570" style="s2">being rep to any transcendent being</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.010" end="02:03:38.070" style="s2">beyond the image right so who knows who</p>
<p begin="02:03:33.570" end="02:03:40.470" style="s2">knows again I think it depends on what</p>
<p begin="02:03:38.070" end="02:03:44.190" style="s2">you&#39;re willing to accept as proof now</p>
<p begin="02:03:40.470" end="02:03:45.770" style="s2">the proof the it&#39;s beyond question that</p>
<p begin="02:03:44.190" end="02:03:48.390" style="s2">can people can have life-changing</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.770" end="02:03:50.850" style="s2">religious experiences another example of</p>
<p begin="02:03:48.390" end="02:03:53.520" style="s2">that is that the best treatment for</p>
<p begin="02:03:50.850" end="02:03:55.170" style="s2">alcoholism is religious conversion it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:53.520" end="02:03:57.390" style="s2">well documented in the literature and I</p>
<p begin="02:03:55.170" end="02:04:00.540" style="s2">studied alcoholism for a long time so</p>
<p begin="02:03:57.390" end="02:04:02.580" style="s2">one of the cures that sticks is</p>
<p begin="02:04:00.540" end="02:04:04.140" style="s2">religious conversion and the 12-step</p>
<p begin="02:04:02.580" end="02:04:06.320" style="s2">programs essentially attempt to</p>
<p begin="02:04:04.140" end="02:04:08.910" style="s2">instantiate religious conversion and</p>
<p begin="02:04:06.320" end="02:04:11.370" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to document their success</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.910" end="02:04:13.310" style="s2">because they succeed for the people who</p>
<p begin="02:04:11.370" end="02:04:17.120" style="s2">stick with it but that&#39;s not a very good</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.310" end="02:04:18.930" style="s2">measure right it&#39;s sort of it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.120" end="02:04:21.000" style="s2">self-evident that they work for the</p>
<p begin="02:04:18.930" end="02:04:23.220" style="s2">people who stick with it I&#39;m not cynical</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.000" end="02:04:24.630" style="s2">about about Alcoholics Anonymous or</p>
<p begin="02:04:23.220" end="02:04:28.290" style="s2">anything but we don&#39;t have good data on</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.630" end="02:04:30.570" style="s2">on outcome but there is good data</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.290" end="02:04:33.810" style="s2">showing that religious transformation is</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.570" end="02:04:42.240" style="s2">a good cure for for alcoholism so and</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.810" end="02:04:47.310" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting phenomena too it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.240" end="02:04:49.080" style="s2">too complicated I probably can&#39;t okay</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.310" end="02:04:50.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll try I&#39;ll try this for a second so</p>
<p begin="02:04:49.080" end="02:04:52.830" style="s2">here&#39;s how I think a religious</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.310" end="02:04:54.750" style="s2">conversion might work so imagine you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:04:52.830" end="02:04:55.760" style="s2">got the left hemisphere and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:04:54.750" end="02:05:00.090" style="s2">place where your habitual</p>
<p begin="02:04:55.760" end="02:05:03.120" style="s2">interpretations reside so I can give you</p>
<p begin="02:05:00.090" end="02:05:05.240" style="s2">a quick example of this so this guy</p>
<p begin="02:05:03.120" end="02:05:08.190" style="s2">Ramachandran who&#39;s a neurophysiologist</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.240" end="02:05:11.430" style="s2">or I think that&#39;s his that&#39;s his field</p>
<p begin="02:05:08.190" end="02:05:13.560" style="s2">of study I think he&#39;s at UCLA he studied</p>
<p begin="02:05:11.430" end="02:05:16.590" style="s2">people who hadn&#39;t neglect and neglects</p>
<p begin="02:05:13.560" end="02:05:18.180" style="s2">is a very very bizarre phenomena so if</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.590" end="02:05:20.700" style="s2">you have a stroke that damages your</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.180" end="02:05:22.020" style="s2">right parietal lobe you&#39;ll lose the left</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.700" end="02:05:24.360" style="s2">part of your</p>
<p begin="02:05:22.020" end="02:05:26.310" style="s2">being not just your body it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:05:24.360" end="02:05:29.280" style="s2">weird it&#39;s like so for example if you</p>
<p begin="02:05:26.310" end="02:05:31.950" style="s2">have a right parietal stroke and you</p>
<p begin="02:05:29.280" end="02:05:34.560" style="s2">look at a clock you only see you only</p>
<p begin="02:05:31.950" end="02:05:36.450" style="s2">only half the clock exists for you it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:34.560" end="02:05:38.670" style="s2">not like you only see half the clock</p>
<p begin="02:05:36.450" end="02:05:40.950" style="s2">it&#39;s weirder than that it&#39;s that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:38.670" end="02:05:42.780" style="s2">only the right side of the clock there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.950" end="02:05:45.060" style="s2">only the right side of you there&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="02:05:42.780" end="02:05:47.880" style="s2">the right side of my body I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:05:45.060" end="02:05:50.070" style="s2">that this exists and so sometimes people</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.880" end="02:05:52.650" style="s2">with right parietal damage will wake up</p>
<p begin="02:05:50.070" end="02:05:54.810" style="s2">after the stroke and grab their left arm</p>
<p begin="02:05:52.650" end="02:05:56.490" style="s2">and throw it out of bed and or their leg</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.810" end="02:05:58.170" style="s2">and throw it out of bed because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.490" end="02:06:00.480" style="s2">theirs and then of course they fall out</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.170" end="02:06:03.570" style="s2">of bed which is quite a shock to them so</p>
<p begin="02:06:00.480" end="02:06:05.370" style="s2">and so now they&#39;ll only eat half the</p>
<p begin="02:06:03.570" end="02:06:07.110" style="s2">food on the plate nobody can really</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.370" end="02:06:09.300" style="s2">understand this phenomena logically</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.110" end="02:06:11.670" style="s2">right because we can&#39;t imagine what that</p>
<p begin="02:06:09.300" end="02:06:13.710" style="s2">must be like I think it must be like you</p>
<p begin="02:06:11.670" end="02:06:16.800" style="s2">know how you know there&#39;s things behind</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.710" end="02:06:18.480" style="s2">you but you don&#39;t not see them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.800" end="02:06:20.640" style="s2">just not there it&#39;s not like it&#39;s black</p>
<p begin="02:06:18.480" end="02:06:23.880" style="s2">or anything or there&#39;s a space it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.640" end="02:06:27.000" style="s2">not there and so I think what happens is</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.880" end="02:06:28.800" style="s2">the not there extends to three-quarters</p>
<p begin="02:06:27.000" end="02:06:33.090" style="s2">of the field instead of half the field</p>
<p begin="02:06:28.800" end="02:06:35.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a guess anyway so ramas now the</p>
<p begin="02:06:33.090" end="02:06:37.380" style="s2">funny thing about people with neglect is</p>
<p begin="02:06:35.190" end="02:06:39.060" style="s2">that if you tell them if you point it</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.380" end="02:06:41.700" style="s2">out you say well I noticed that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:06:39.060" end="02:06:44.820" style="s2">not moving your left foot today they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="02:06:41.700" end="02:06:46.710" style="s2">say well it&#39;s it&#39;s arthritic and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:06:44.820" end="02:06:48.090" style="s2">move it and say well why do you just try</p>
<p begin="02:06:46.710" end="02:06:49.620" style="s2">to move it so no look doctor I already</p>
<p begin="02:06:48.090" end="02:06:51.420" style="s2">told you it&#39;s in too much pain to move</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.620" end="02:06:54.120" style="s2">it was working fine this morning that</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.420" end="02:06:56.370" style="s2">can be months after the the accident so</p>
<p begin="02:06:54.120" end="02:06:58.170" style="s2">it&#39;s a denial and and people thought</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.370" end="02:07:00.030" style="s2">actually that that was trauma induced</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.170" end="02:07:00.960" style="s2">denial for a long time before they</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.030" end="02:07:02.280" style="s2">figured it out was actually a</p>
<p begin="02:07:00.960" end="02:07:05.100" style="s2">consequence of the neurophysiological</p>
<p begin="02:07:02.280" end="02:07:10.070" style="s2">damage you know Ramachandran found that</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.100" end="02:07:13.710" style="s2">if you irrigated the contralateral ear</p>
<p begin="02:07:10.070" end="02:07:16.260" style="s2">say now if you pour cold water in</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.710" end="02:07:17.760" style="s2">someone&#39;s ear it upsets their vestibular</p>
<p begin="02:07:16.260" end="02:07:19.950" style="s2">system and their eyes will move back and</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.760" end="02:07:23.580" style="s2">forth like this you can try that at a</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.950" end="02:07:25.680" style="s2">party if you want and anyways</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.580" end="02:07:27.060" style="s2">Ramachandran was testing vestibular</p>
<p begin="02:07:25.680" end="02:07:29.700" style="s2">function on these patients and he</p>
<p begin="02:07:27.060" end="02:07:32.580" style="s2">irrigated the right ear with cold water</p>
<p begin="02:07:29.700" end="02:07:35.789" style="s2">and they woke up and maybe what happened</p>
<p begin="02:07:32.580" end="02:07:37.440" style="s2">was that that was shocking enough</p>
<p begin="02:07:35.789" end="02:07:39.719" style="s2">so imagine the networks in the right</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.440" end="02:07:41.849" style="s2">hemisphere were degraded but not</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.719" end="02:07:43.920" style="s2">completely gone and they needed a really</p>
<p begin="02:07:41.849" end="02:07:46.289" style="s2">high threshold of activation to snap</p>
<p begin="02:07:43.920" end="02:07:47.969" style="s2">into function so here&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="02:07:46.289" end="02:07:50.699" style="s2">that if you have Parkinson&#39;s disease</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.969" end="02:07:52.260" style="s2">imagine you&#39;re frozen there okay and I</p>
<p begin="02:07:50.699" end="02:07:55.639" style="s2">throw a ball at you you&#39;ll go like this</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.260" end="02:07:59.579" style="s2">and catch it but you can&#39;t throw it back</p>
<p begin="02:07:55.639" end="02:08:01.590" style="s2">so you can the stimulus is enough that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:59.579" end="02:08:03.360" style="s2">enough to push you past threshold but</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.590" end="02:08:05.699" style="s2">you can&#39;t do it voluntarily now if you</p>
<p begin="02:08:03.360" end="02:08:07.260" style="s2">have Parkinson&#39;s like right to the tenth</p>
<p begin="02:08:05.699" end="02:08:09.030" style="s2">degree you won&#39;t even be able to couch</p>
<p begin="02:08:07.260" end="02:08:10.949" style="s2">it but there&#39;s a stage where you could</p>
<p begin="02:08:09.030" end="02:08:13.739" style="s2">still do that there&#39;s a great case study</p>
<p begin="02:08:10.949" end="02:08:15.360" style="s2">where this grandpa was in a wheelchair</p>
<p begin="02:08:13.739" end="02:08:17.730" style="s2">he had Parkinson&#39;s and his young</p>
<p begin="02:08:15.360" end="02:08:19.440" style="s2">grandson was playing out on the dock and</p>
<p begin="02:08:17.730" end="02:08:22.230" style="s2">fell in the water and started to drown</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.440" end="02:08:24.929" style="s2">and he got out of his wheelchair went</p>
<p begin="02:08:22.230" end="02:08:26.940" style="s2">into the ocean rescued him brought him</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.929" end="02:08:29.400" style="s2">onto the beach sat back down in his</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.940" end="02:08:30.989" style="s2">wheelchair and was paralyzed together so</p>
<p begin="02:08:29.400" end="02:08:32.880" style="s2">that was enough so you can imagine there</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.989" end="02:08:36.239" style="s2">was enough network left so if the</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.880" end="02:08:38.039" style="s2">emotional tension became high enough</p>
<p begin="02:08:36.239" end="02:08:41.340" style="s2">that the degraded circuits could still</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.039" end="02:08:43.380" style="s2">function so okay so back to Ramachandran</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.340" end="02:08:45.929" style="s2">so you irrigate the ear all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.380" end="02:08:48.510" style="s2">the right hemisphere connections flash</p>
<p begin="02:08:45.929" end="02:08:50.519" style="s2">the remainders managed to connect and</p>
<p begin="02:08:48.510" end="02:08:52.349" style="s2">the person goes oh my god I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.519" end="02:08:54.659" style="s2">terrible stroke I&#39;ve lost the left side</p>
<p begin="02:08:52.349" end="02:08:57.239" style="s2">of my body they&#39;re crying they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="02:08:54.659" end="02:09:00.179" style="s2">completely catastrophic aliy overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="02:08:57.239" end="02:09:02.190" style="s2">by it and then 20 minutes later the the</p>
<p begin="02:09:00.179" end="02:09:04.889" style="s2">effects wear off and they snap back in</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.190" end="02:09:06.780" style="s2">and now they they&#39;ve lost their left</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.889" end="02:09:09.780" style="s2">side again they don&#39;t remember it and so</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.780" end="02:09:13.559" style="s2">what seems to happen is that the right</p>
<p begin="02:09:09.780" end="02:09:15.900" style="s2">hemisphere is collecting anomalous</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.559" end="02:09:17.639" style="s2">information that&#39;s what it does that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:15.900" end="02:09:20.820" style="s2">what it does when you&#39;re dreaming it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:09:17.639" end="02:09:23.039" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s representing that</p>
<p begin="02:09:20.820" end="02:09:25.320" style="s2">anomalous information in image form and</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.039" end="02:09:27.360" style="s2">sort of slowly passing it to the left</p>
<p begin="02:09:25.320" end="02:09:29.369" style="s2">hemisphere so it doesn&#39;t overwhelm it</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.360" end="02:09:30.809" style="s2">and maybe if it gets overwhelming you</p>
<p begin="02:09:29.369" end="02:09:32.610" style="s2">wake up and you&#39;re afraid and you tell</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.809" end="02:09:34.730" style="s2">someone about the dream that helps you</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.610" end="02:09:36.840" style="s2">figure out what it was but anyways so</p>
<p begin="02:09:34.730" end="02:09:39.590" style="s2">that the right hemisphere is always</p>
<p begin="02:09:36.840" end="02:09:42.949" style="s2">trying to tap the left hemisphere into</p>
<p begin="02:09:39.590" end="02:09:47.369" style="s2">transformation right so now imagine that</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.949" end="02:09:49.050" style="s2">that can happen a little bit or a lot so</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.369" end="02:09:49.680" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re just ignoring a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.050" end="02:09:52.200" style="s2">of anomalous</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.680" end="02:09:54.210" style="s2">information you just have some mildly</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.200" end="02:09:56.220" style="s2">frightening dreams or maybe you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.210" end="02:09:57.270" style="s2">stacked up a whole bunch of things that</p>
<p begin="02:09:56.220" end="02:09:59.970" style="s2">you&#39;re ignoring and there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="02:09:57.270" end="02:10:02.010" style="s2">major-league monsters that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:09:59.970" end="02:10:05.160" style="s2">contended with maybe there&#39;s situations</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.010" end="02:10:09.000" style="s2">where the right hemisphere is stored up</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.160" end="02:10:11.430" style="s2">enough counter enough of a counter</p>
<p begin="02:10:09.000" end="02:10:12.030" style="s2">hypothesis let&#39;s say about how the world</p>
<p begin="02:10:11.430" end="02:10:14.040" style="s2">works</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.030" end="02:10:16.470" style="s2">out make making sense out of all those</p>
<p begin="02:10:14.040" end="02:10:19.740" style="s2">things that you&#39;ve ignored that one day</p>
<p begin="02:10:16.470" end="02:10:22.170" style="s2">it just goes snap and you&#39;re a new</p>
<p begin="02:10:19.740" end="02:10:25.470" style="s2">personality and maybe the new</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.170" end="02:10:27.090" style="s2">personality isn&#39;t addicted so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.470" end="02:10:33.080" style="s2">something like it&#39;s something like that</p>
<p begin="02:10:27.090" end="02:10:33.080" style="s2">I think so yeah okay</p>
<p begin="02:10:38.150" end="02:10:46.350" style="s2">joke good morning citizen Peterson oh</p>
<p begin="02:10:43.610" end="02:10:48.330" style="s2">you got I&#39;ve prepared a real doozy for</p>
<p begin="02:10:46.350" end="02:10:50.220" style="s2">you here oh good it&#39;s a good thing</p>
<p begin="02:10:48.330" end="02:10:52.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve got extra time to handle this one</p>
<p begin="02:10:50.220" end="02:10:55.080" style="s2">I&#39;d even say it&#39;s rehearsed a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:10:52.620" end="02:11:00.660" style="s2">so it&#39;s gonna be ultra ineffective yeah</p>
<p begin="02:10:55.080" end="02:11:03.210" style="s2">okay now I understand that a lecture on</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.660" end="02:11:03.989" style="s2">the psychological significance of</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.210" end="02:11:07.020" style="s2">anything really</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.989" end="02:11:11.540" style="s2">is going to indubitably wander off into</p>
<p begin="02:11:07.020" end="02:11:15.060" style="s2">an anthropocentric worldview but as a</p>
<p begin="02:11:11.540" end="02:11:17.700" style="s2">practitioner of the hard sciences I</p>
<p begin="02:11:15.060" end="02:11:20.910" style="s2">wanted to dig a little bit deeper you</p>
<p begin="02:11:17.700" end="02:11:23.250" style="s2">know so I sought out I guess a religious</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.910" end="02:11:30.750" style="s2">interpretation of both creative freedom</p>
<p begin="02:11:23.250" end="02:11:35.010" style="s2">and I guess the very nature of time</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.750" end="02:11:37.739" style="s2">itself and I found it obviously that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.010" end="02:11:40.170" style="s2">why I&#39;m here and if you think you have</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.739" end="02:11:42.390" style="s2">an anthropocentric worldview it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.170" end="02:11:47.040" style="s2">nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal</p>
<p begin="02:11:42.390" end="02:11:50.640" style="s2">Ratzinger you know now I like to think</p>
<p begin="02:11:47.040" end="02:11:52.440" style="s2">that you know this microphone here the</p>
<p begin="02:11:50.640" end="02:11:55.230" style="s2">one that you keep muting out on me</p>
<p begin="02:11:52.440" end="02:11:57.720" style="s2">you know this microphone is an object</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.230" end="02:11:59.910" style="s2">which exists outside of our individual</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.720" end="02:12:04.110" style="s2">perceptions that&#39;s just the way I like</p>
<p begin="02:11:59.910" end="02:12:06.480" style="s2">to look at it but then I think about the</p>
<p begin="02:12:04.110" end="02:12:09.630" style="s2">concept beauty is in the eye of the</p>
<p begin="02:12:06.480" end="02:12:12.120" style="s2">beholder and certainly I mean when</p>
<p begin="02:12:09.630" end="02:12:14.310" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about are the</p>
<p begin="02:12:12.120" end="02:12:16.290" style="s2">appreciation of art there has to be some</p>
<p begin="02:12:14.310" end="02:12:19.890" style="s2">sort of subjective element integrated</p>
<p begin="02:12:16.290" end="02:12:23.730" style="s2">into that but there also must be a limit</p>
<p begin="02:12:19.890" end="02:12:26.940" style="s2">as well I mean certain works of art do</p>
<p begin="02:12:23.730" end="02:12:30.060" style="s2">we appreciate as absolute masterpieces</p>
<p begin="02:12:26.940" end="02:12:32.340" style="s2">like Michelangelo&#39;s pietà for example</p>
<p begin="02:12:30.060" end="02:12:35.040" style="s2">which you bring up frequently because it</p>
<p begin="02:12:32.340" end="02:12:37.680" style="s2">really is that good but there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="02:12:35.040" end="02:12:42.120" style="s2">things which are just by comparison</p>
<p begin="02:12:37.680" end="02:12:44.790" style="s2">there like vandalism you know now</p>
<p begin="02:12:42.120" end="02:12:47.239" style="s2">there&#39;s always a temptation all right to</p>
<p begin="02:12:44.790" end="02:12:49.700" style="s2">invoke the principle of a</p>
<p begin="02:12:47.239" end="02:12:51.870" style="s2">non-overlapping magisteria</p>
<p begin="02:12:49.700" end="02:12:54.510" style="s2">but that seems like sort</p>
<p begin="02:12:51.870" end="02:12:57.000" style="s2">of a capo right so I formulated I guess</p>
<p begin="02:12:54.510" end="02:12:58.800" style="s2">for myself for standards of measure</p>
<p begin="02:12:57.000" end="02:13:02.130" style="s2">which help me separate what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:12:58.800" end="02:13:06.290" style="s2">difference between art and mediocrity</p>
<p begin="02:13:02.130" end="02:13:09.840" style="s2">and here&#39;s the four number one education</p>

<p begin="02:15:58.300" end="02:16:06.010" style="s2">sort of functional necessity for him to</p>

<p begin="02:16:06.010" end="02:16:09.850" style="s2">thing or another and and I think that</p>
<p begin="02:16:08.020" end="02:16:11.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a string that runs through the</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.850" end="02:16:14.680" style="s2">Bible and then through the New Testament</p>

<p begin="02:16:33.429" end="02:16:37.090" style="s2">that is before them which is to say they</p>

<p begin="02:16:54.160" end="02:16:59.860" style="s2">good um I don&#39;t I don&#39;t precisely know</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.969" end="02:17:02.139" style="s2">the answer that it&#39;s it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.860" end="02:17:03.910" style="s2">peculiar thing because we think many</p>
<p begin="02:17:02.139" end="02:17:07.210" style="s2">things or you could say many voices</p>
<p begin="02:17:03.910" end="02:17:09.160" style="s2">appear in our minds because when</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.210" end="02:17:10.990" style="s2">Nietzsche took des cartes I think</p>
<p begin="02:17:09.160" end="02:17:12.370" style="s2">therefore I am apart and he said well it</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.990" end="02:17:16.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t so obvious that there&#39;s an AI</p>
<p begin="02:17:12.370" end="02:17:18.880" style="s2">first of all that it&#39;s a unity like a no</p>
<p begin="02:17:16.240" end="02:17:20.650" style="s2">unity transparent unto itself which of</p>
<p begin="02:17:18.880" end="02:17:22.929" style="s2">course the psychoanalysts picked up in a</p>
<p begin="02:17:20.650" end="02:17:25.719" style="s2">big way and then he wasn&#39;t sure that it</p>
<p begin="02:17:22.929" end="02:17:27.189" style="s2">was the AI who thought in some causal</p>
<p begin="02:17:25.719" end="02:17:29.500" style="s2">manner he said well no it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="02:17:27.189" end="02:17:32.200" style="s2">thoughts it&#39;s something like thoughts</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.500" end="02:17:33.849" style="s2">appear in the phenomenal field and maybe</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.200" end="02:17:35.290" style="s2">you choose between them or maybe they</p>
<p begin="02:17:33.849" end="02:17:37.120" style="s2">possess you like there&#39;s lots of other</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.290" end="02:17:39.729" style="s2">ways of thinking about it it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.120" end="02:17:42.300" style="s2">exactly obvious to me why we choose to</p>
<p begin="02:17:39.729" end="02:17:47.019" style="s2">take one pathway rather than another</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.300" end="02:17:48.910" style="s2">when so many of them offer themselves to</p>
<p begin="02:17:47.019" end="02:17:52.179" style="s2">us you know people tend to talk about</p>
<p begin="02:17:48.910" end="02:18:01.570" style="s2">that as something like conscience right</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.179" end="02:18:03.960" style="s2">and now maybe it&#39;s that it&#39;s got to have</p>
<p begin="02:18:01.570" end="02:18:06.490" style="s2">something to do I think</p>
<p begin="02:18:03.960" end="02:18:09.370" style="s2">it&#39;s an endless regress because you can</p>
<p begin="02:18:06.490" end="02:18:11.860" style="s2">always ask why the why any assumption</p>
<p begin="02:18:09.370" end="02:18:13.960" style="s2">became primary but I&#39;ll put that aside</p>
<p begin="02:18:11.860" end="02:18:17.979" style="s2">for a moment it seems to me to have</p>
<p begin="02:18:13.960" end="02:18:21.490" style="s2">something to do with your aims you know</p>
<p begin="02:18:17.979" end="02:18:24.160" style="s2">that you&#39;re more likely to listen to a</p>
<p begin="02:18:21.490" end="02:18:27.040" style="s2">voice that is in keeping with your most</p>
<p begin="02:18:24.160" end="02:18:28.719" style="s2">fundamental aims and then the question</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.040" end="02:18:30.550" style="s2">is where do your most fundamental aims</p>
<p begin="02:18:28.719" end="02:18:32.050" style="s2">come from and from what I&#39;ve been able</p>
<p begin="02:18:30.550" end="02:18:34.990" style="s2">to determine and I&#39;ll speak</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.050" end="02:18:37.780" style="s2">psychologically again is that to begin</p>
<p begin="02:18:34.990" end="02:18:40.510" style="s2">with you&#39;re a concatenation of rather</p>
<p begin="02:18:37.780" end="02:18:43.420" style="s2">primitive sub personalities hungry ones</p>
<p begin="02:18:40.510" end="02:18:44.860" style="s2">tired one&#39;s upset ones laughing one so</p>
<p begin="02:18:43.420" end="02:18:46.630" style="s2">you can see that in babies you know they</p>
<p begin="02:18:44.860" end="02:18:51.160" style="s2">cycle through those states very rapidly</p>
<p begin="02:18:46.630" end="02:18:53.830" style="s2">there&#39;s a infantile unity above all that</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.160" end="02:18:56.679" style="s2">but it doesn&#39;t have control right and so</p>
<p begin="02:18:53.830" end="02:18:58.740" style="s2">then the developing individual has to</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.679" end="02:19:01.330" style="s2">figure out how to integrate those</p>
<p begin="02:18:58.740" end="02:19:03.780" style="s2">primitive sub personalities into a</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.330" end="02:19:05.730" style="s2">unified personality</p>
<p begin="02:19:03.780" end="02:19:09.260" style="s2">at the same time they integrate the</p>
<p begin="02:19:05.730" end="02:19:13.710" style="s2">unified personality into a social unity</p>
<p begin="02:19:09.260" end="02:19:16.440" style="s2">so it&#39;s partly individual integration</p>
<p begin="02:19:13.710" end="02:19:18.630" style="s2">but it&#39;s fed by social forces I mean</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.440" end="02:19:21.450" style="s2">even when you watch a an infant</p>
<p begin="02:19:18.630" end="02:19:23.160" style="s2">breastfeed its established a</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.450" end="02:19:25.260" style="s2">relationship with its mother and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:23.160" end="02:19:28.530" style="s2">a reciprocity that&#39;s already at play</p>
<p begin="02:19:25.260" end="02:19:30.900" style="s2">there so then that underlying</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.530" end="02:19:33.420" style="s2">multiplicity starts to form itself into</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.900" end="02:19:36.000" style="s2">a unity and then the question and I</p>
<p begin="02:19:33.420" end="02:19:38.340" style="s2">would say that&#39;s something like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.000" end="02:19:41.639" style="s2">something like the emergence of the the</p>
<p begin="02:19:38.340" end="02:19:43.530" style="s2">individual out of out of the the Titans</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.639" end="02:19:45.809" style="s2">that&#39;s a reasonable way of thinking</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.530" end="02:19:48.480" style="s2">about it like a sovereign out of the</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.809" end="02:19:50.700" style="s2">Titans it&#39;s something like that but then</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.480" end="02:19:53.820" style="s2">there&#39;s another division which seems to</p>
<p begin="02:19:50.700" end="02:19:56.160" style="s2">me to paralyse parallel the the Cain and</p>
<p begin="02:19:53.820" end="02:19:57.900" style="s2">Abel division it&#39;s that that integration</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.160" end="02:19:59.580" style="s2">can be oriented towards something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.900" end="02:20:01.790" style="s2">positive but it can also be oriented</p>
<p begin="02:19:59.580" end="02:20:04.620" style="s2">towards something that&#39;s negative and</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.790" end="02:20:07.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the split of the world into good</p>
<p begin="02:20:04.620" end="02:20:08.970" style="s2">and evil I think and then it looks like</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.050" end="02:20:10.800" style="s2">you&#39;re navigating between those and I</p>
<p begin="02:20:08.970" end="02:20:12.860" style="s2">can only account for that with something</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.800" end="02:20:16.440" style="s2">like choice like I think the free choice</p>
<p begin="02:20:12.860" end="02:20:19.050" style="s2">even though I don&#39;t understand it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:20:16.440" end="02:20:21.150" style="s2">unwilling to deny the existence of free</p>
<p begin="02:20:19.050" end="02:20:24.300" style="s2">choice merely because I don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.150" end="02:20:26.370" style="s2">it because it looks to me like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.300" end="02:20:29.190" style="s2">how people act that&#39;s how they expect to</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.370" end="02:20:31.200" style="s2">be treated and that societies who that</p>
<p begin="02:20:29.190" end="02:20:32.760" style="s2">that structure themselves in accordance</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.200" end="02:20:35.520" style="s2">with the idea that people have free</p>
<p begin="02:20:32.760" end="02:20:37.110" style="s2">choice actually work now that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.520" end="02:20:38.220" style="s2">prove that there&#39;s free choice but</p>
<p begin="02:20:37.110" end="02:20:41.280" style="s2">people have been arguing about that</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.220" end="02:20:43.500" style="s2">forever so but it looks to me so those</p>
<p begin="02:20:41.280" end="02:20:45.710" style="s2">are two possible means of integration</p>
<p begin="02:20:43.500" end="02:20:48.830" style="s2">and then I think what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.710" end="02:20:51.600" style="s2">feeding one or the other constantly and</p>
<p begin="02:20:48.830" end="02:20:54.300" style="s2">I think you probably choose which one to</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.600" end="02:20:56.670" style="s2">feed I think that&#39;s and I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.300" end="02:20:59.970" style="s2">how it feels that way to me as well like</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.670" end="02:21:02.250" style="s2">when I look at my own you know maybe</p>
<p begin="02:20:59.970" end="02:21:03.840" style="s2">you&#39;re really aggravated with something</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.250" end="02:21:07.020" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re aggravated with your wife</p>
<p begin="02:21:03.840" end="02:21:09.420" style="s2">you know or your child or something like</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.020" end="02:21:12.330" style="s2">that you know and you&#39;re feeling kind of</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.420" end="02:21:14.100" style="s2">nasty and maybe even know that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="02:21:12.330" end="02:21:17.250" style="s2">the wrong and an idea comes into your</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.100" end="02:21:18.990" style="s2">head you think I could say that and</p>
<p begin="02:21:17.250" end="02:21:21.060" style="s2">no you could say it and you know what it</p>
<p begin="02:21:18.990" end="02:21:24.420" style="s2">would do but then you pause and you</p>
<p begin="02:21:21.060" end="02:21:26.130" style="s2">think would that make it better or worse</p>
<p begin="02:21:24.420" end="02:21:28.410" style="s2">and then maybe you go to hell with it</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.130" end="02:21:30.150" style="s2">which is a quite the thing to say I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:21:28.410" end="02:21:30.600" style="s2">got a little story about that in a</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.150" end="02:21:34.650" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="02:21:30.600" end="02:21:36.930" style="s2">and then you say it but you knew you</p>
<p begin="02:21:34.650" end="02:21:39.330" style="s2">knew that you took the low road right</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.930" end="02:21:40.830" style="s2">and you know it and then you&#39;re guilty</p>
<p begin="02:21:39.330" end="02:21:42.600" style="s2">about that and defensive and that makes</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.830" end="02:21:44.190" style="s2">the fight way worse because then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:42.600" end="02:21:46.890" style="s2">no damn way you&#39;re gonna admit that you</p>
<p begin="02:21:44.190" end="02:21:49.800" style="s2">actually did that and so things do go to</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.890" end="02:21:53.250" style="s2">hell and so so here&#39;s here&#39;s an ugly</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.800" end="02:21:55.950" style="s2">little idea so that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:21:53.250" end="02:22:00.180" style="s2">relevant to the question so imagine</p>
<p begin="02:21:55.950" end="02:22:02.460" style="s2">you&#39;re playing around with cocaine now</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.180" end="02:22:04.020" style="s2">I&#39;m using cocaine because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.460" end="02:22:05.970" style="s2">addictive but it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="02:22:04.020" end="02:22:09.540" style="s2">chemical because it&#39;s a dopaminergic</p>
<p begin="02:22:05.970" end="02:22:11.400" style="s2">agonist and what what dopamine does is</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.540" end="02:22:13.850" style="s2">two things it makes you feel like what</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.400" end="02:22:15.930" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is worthwhile but it also</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.850" end="02:22:18.360" style="s2">imagined that there&#39;s a bunch of neural</p>
<p begin="02:22:15.930" end="02:22:20.730" style="s2">circuits that are active and then they</p>
<p begin="02:22:18.360" end="02:22:22.320" style="s2">get a hit of dopamine or you do then</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.730" end="02:22:25.170" style="s2">those neural circuits get a little bit</p>
<p begin="02:22:22.320" end="02:22:27.630" style="s2">more powerful okay so it it has a</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.170" end="02:22:29.250" style="s2">rewarding property which is that it</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.630" end="02:22:31.830" style="s2">makes you feel like what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="02:22:29.250" end="02:22:34.080" style="s2">important and it has a reinforcing</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.830" end="02:22:37.170" style="s2">property which is it makes neural</p>
<p begin="02:22:34.080" end="02:22:40.740" style="s2">circuits grow so now what that means is</p>
<p begin="02:22:37.170" end="02:22:44.640" style="s2">that whatever you were doing just before</p>
<p begin="02:22:40.740" end="02:22:46.380" style="s2">you took cocaine grows okay so now</p>
<p begin="02:22:44.640" end="02:22:48.000" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s a bunch of different</p>
<p begin="02:22:46.380" end="02:22:50.310" style="s2">things that you do just before you take</p>
<p begin="02:22:48.000" end="02:22:53.370" style="s2">cocaine but there&#39;s a string of</p>
<p begin="02:22:50.310" end="02:22:55.110" style="s2">decisions and at one decision point is</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.370" end="02:22:57.060" style="s2">the same for all of those difference</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.110" end="02:22:58.830" style="s2">occurrences and that decision point is</p>
<p begin="02:22:57.060" end="02:23:01.020" style="s2">because you know you&#39;re in trouble and</p>
<p begin="02:22:58.830" end="02:23:02.270" style="s2">that decision point is well to hell with</p>
<p begin="02:23:01.020" end="02:23:05.970" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="02:23:02.270" end="02:23:08.220" style="s2">okay so then you think that each of the</p>
<p begin="02:23:05.970" end="02:23:09.630" style="s2">200 times that you take cocaine even</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.220" end="02:23:12.060" style="s2">though you do it in different places but</p>
<p begin="02:23:09.630" end="02:23:14.310" style="s2">that one thought is there all the time</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.060" end="02:23:16.530" style="s2">and that thing grows because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:23:14.310" end="02:23:18.870" style="s2">reinforcing it and it grows and it grows</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.530" end="02:23:21.060" style="s2">and it grows and so now that&#39;s in you</p>
<p begin="02:23:18.870" end="02:23:23.910" style="s2">let&#39;s that&#39;s part of you and it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.060" end="02:23:26.760" style="s2">thing that says to hell with it okay so</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.910" end="02:23:29.280" style="s2">now and maybe that&#39;s not such a good</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.760" end="02:23:30.931" style="s2">thing to grow inside your brain so then</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.280" end="02:23:32.730" style="s2">you your idea</p>
<p begin="02:23:30.931" end="02:23:34.891" style="s2">and they take you to a cocaine treatment</p>
<p begin="02:23:32.730" end="02:23:37.080" style="s2">center and after a week you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="02:23:34.891" end="02:23:39.091" style="s2">physically physiologically addicted</p>
<p begin="02:23:37.080" end="02:23:42.091" style="s2">you&#39;re not craving you don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="02:23:39.091" end="02:23:43.170" style="s2">problem as long as you&#39;re there but then</p>
<p begin="02:23:42.091" end="02:23:46.170" style="s2">they take you back to your normal</p>
<p begin="02:23:43.170" end="02:23:49.410" style="s2">environment and you see like cocaine Joe</p>
<p begin="02:23:46.170" end="02:23:51.631" style="s2">your friend and as soon as you see him</p>
<p begin="02:23:49.410" end="02:23:55.110" style="s2">up that thing comes and bang you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="02:23:51.631" end="02:23:57.210" style="s2">on the you&#39;re back on the to hell with</p>
<p begin="02:23:55.110" end="02:24:00.080" style="s2">the track and that&#39;s well you&#39;re in well</p>
<p begin="02:23:57.210" end="02:24:02.370" style="s2">you&#39;re where you will end up - if you</p>
<p begin="02:24:00.080" end="02:24:06.210" style="s2">reinforce that particular perspective</p>
<p begin="02:24:02.370" end="02:24:07.980" style="s2">long enough so that&#39;s akin in a sense to</p>
<p begin="02:24:06.210" end="02:24:10.341" style="s2">the this decision-making process you</p>
<p begin="02:24:07.980" end="02:24:12.721" style="s2">know if you if you take the low road</p>
<p begin="02:24:10.341" end="02:24:17.030" style="s2">then that wins and it gets a little</p>
<p begin="02:24:12.721" end="02:24:18.900" style="s2">stronger because everything that wins</p>
<p begin="02:24:17.030" end="02:24:22.200" style="s2">neurologically gets a little stronger</p>
<p begin="02:24:18.900" end="02:24:24.091" style="s2">it&#39;s like a Darwinian competition so one</p>
<p begin="02:24:22.200" end="02:24:26.040" style="s2">rule is don&#39;t practice what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:24:24.091" end="02:24:28.530" style="s2">want to become because you really do</p>
<p begin="02:24:26.040" end="02:24:30.631" style="s2">become that it builds it builds itself</p>
<p begin="02:24:28.530" end="02:24:32.311" style="s2">right into your neural architecture and</p>
<p begin="02:24:30.631" end="02:24:33.480" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the terrifying things</p>
<p begin="02:24:32.311" end="02:24:35.160" style="s2">about addiction you know because you</p>
<p begin="02:24:33.480" end="02:24:37.891" style="s2">think well it&#39;s kind of psychological</p>
<p begin="02:24:35.160" end="02:24:39.570" style="s2">it&#39;s like yeah kind of it&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="02:24:37.891" end="02:24:42.570" style="s2">neuro physiological and you build a</p>
<p begin="02:24:39.570" end="02:24:44.580" style="s2">one-eyed cocaine monster in your head if</p>
<p begin="02:24:42.570" end="02:24:51.320" style="s2">you hit yourself enough with something</p>
<p begin="02:24:44.580" end="02:24:51.320" style="s2">that reinforcing so yeah</p>
<p begin="02:24:55.120" end="02:25:04.780" style="s2">last question I guess it&#39;s just a really</p>
<p begin="02:25:00.221" end="02:25:08.381" style="s2">simple question then about long</p>
<p begin="02:25:04.780" end="02:25:10.120" style="s2">suffering so when it one of the things</p>
<p begin="02:25:08.381" end="02:25:11.351" style="s2">that was noticing from the stories of</p>
<p begin="02:25:10.120" end="02:25:13.990" style="s2">Jacob and a lot of these biblical</p>
<p begin="02:25:11.351" end="02:25:16.650" style="s2">narratives is you do have this</p>
<p begin="02:25:13.990" end="02:25:19.061" style="s2">all-powerful God who is able to kind of</p>
<p begin="02:25:16.650" end="02:25:21.070" style="s2">essentially be the hidden protagonist in</p>
<p begin="02:25:19.061" end="02:25:23.921" style="s2">the narrative but then the funny thing</p>
<p begin="02:25:21.070" end="02:25:25.181" style="s2">is that he&#39;s kind of revealing some of</p>
<p begin="02:25:23.921" end="02:25:28.811" style="s2">his qualities throughout the course of</p>
<p begin="02:25:25.181" end="02:25:31.240" style="s2">the story so you were talking about the</p>
<p begin="02:25:28.811" end="02:25:34.631" style="s2">weird paradox of the fact that God</p>
<p begin="02:25:31.240" end="02:25:37.511" style="s2">somehow allows Jacob Israel to win the</p>
<p begin="02:25:34.631" end="02:25:40.001" style="s2">fight yeah</p>
<p begin="02:25:37.511" end="02:25:42.370" style="s2">so my question is relating to pants EPs</p>
<p begin="02:25:40.001" end="02:25:43.931" style="s2">thing about the rats that you told like</p>
<p begin="02:25:42.370" end="02:25:45.311" style="s2">three or four times and the number of</p>
<p begin="02:25:43.931" end="02:25:46.841" style="s2">occasions I saw one even more recent</p>
<p begin="02:25:45.311" end="02:25:48.580" style="s2">videos you talked about it where the</p>
<p begin="02:25:46.841" end="02:25:50.410" style="s2">bigger rat lets the smaller rat win</p>
<p begin="02:25:48.580" end="02:25:52.480" style="s2">because then the other the smaller rat</p>
<p begin="02:25:50.410" end="02:25:55.990" style="s2">won&#39;t engage in the game so the question</p>
<p begin="02:25:52.480" end="02:25:58.751" style="s2">is is twofold for me one is God allowing</p>
<p begin="02:25:55.990" end="02:26:01.211" style="s2">humanity to win periodically so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:25:58.751" end="02:26:03.881" style="s2">to allow us to actually engage in the</p>
<p begin="02:26:01.211" end="02:26:06.431" style="s2">dialogue through these stories and to is</p>
<p begin="02:26:03.881" end="02:26:08.351" style="s2">it a much more primitive version of the</p>
<p begin="02:26:06.431" end="02:26:10.751" style="s2">virtue of humility which you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:26:08.351" end="02:26:15.431" style="s2">normally characterize of an Amana path</p>
<p begin="02:26:10.751" end="02:26:17.830" style="s2">of anonymity omnipotent deity well those</p>
<p begin="02:26:15.431" end="02:26:19.541" style="s2">are excellent questions that&#39;s I really</p>
<p begin="02:26:17.830" end="02:26:23.771" style="s2">like the second one in particular that</p>
<p begin="02:26:19.541" end="02:26:25.601" style="s2">that that God&#39;s decision to allow human</p>
<p begin="02:26:23.771" end="02:26:27.730" style="s2">victory from time to time is actually a</p>
<p begin="02:26:25.601" end="02:26:30.610" style="s2">manifestation of something approximating</p>
<p begin="02:26:27.730" end="02:26:32.771" style="s2">humility or at least mercy but humility</p>
<p begin="02:26:30.610" end="02:26:36.041" style="s2">is an interesting take on it well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:32.771" end="02:26:38.681" style="s2">also connected to Paul&#39;s image of how</p>
<p begin="02:26:36.041" end="02:26:41.591" style="s2">Christ handed him hands himself over and</p>
<p begin="02:26:38.681" end="02:26:43.841" style="s2">allows himself to be defeated by men and</p>
<p begin="02:26:41.591" end="02:26:46.931" style="s2">therefore conquers sin which is man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:26:43.841" end="02:26:49.211" style="s2">enemy it&#39;s a weird it&#39;s the same paradox</p>
<p begin="02:26:46.931" end="02:26:52.771" style="s2">where God enters into that dynamic with</p>
<p begin="02:26:49.211" end="02:26:56.681" style="s2">people and loses and willingly loses</p>
<p begin="02:26:52.771" end="02:26:58.091" style="s2">yeah well that&#39;s a okay so the first</p>
<p begin="02:26:56.681" end="02:27:01.440" style="s2">thing I would say is that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:26:58.091" end="02:27:05.381" style="s2">really interesting analogy I I</p>
<p begin="02:27:01.440" end="02:27:08.320" style="s2">I can&#39;t it&#39;s complicated enough question</p>
<p begin="02:27:05.381" end="02:27:08.949" style="s2">so that I can&#39;t go be I don&#39;t think I</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.320" end="02:27:10.779" style="s2">can go be</p>
<p begin="02:27:08.949" end="02:27:12.189" style="s2">the question actually because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="02:27:10.779" end="02:27:13.959" style="s2">complicated that I don&#39;t think I can</p>
<p begin="02:27:12.189" end="02:27:16.329" style="s2">formulate it any better than you already</p>
<p begin="02:27:13.959" end="02:27:18.069" style="s2">did like it&#39;s an interesting string of</p>
<p begin="02:27:16.329" end="02:27:21.579" style="s2">ideas I&#39;d have to play with it a while</p>
<p begin="02:27:18.069" end="02:27:25.419" style="s2">to see it does shed an interesting light</p>
<p begin="02:27:21.579" end="02:27:27.430" style="s2">on why God is amenable to negotiation in</p>
<p begin="02:27:25.419" end="02:27:29.169" style="s2">the Old Testament which is really a</p>
<p begin="02:27:27.430" end="02:27:31.060" style="s2">strange as you pointed out it&#39;s really a</p>
<p begin="02:27:29.169" end="02:27:33.009" style="s2">strange thing it&#39;s like this is</p>
<p begin="02:27:31.060" end="02:27:35.499" style="s2">omnipotent God who obviously can do</p>
<p begin="02:27:33.009" end="02:27:37.869" style="s2">whatever he wants and yet he allow he</p>
<p begin="02:27:35.499" end="02:27:40.270" style="s2">can be bargained with and that also</p>
<p begin="02:27:37.869" end="02:27:42.279" style="s2">opens up the question of why like your</p>
<p begin="02:27:40.270" end="02:27:44.199" style="s2">hypothesis is well if you don&#39;t let the</p>
<p begin="02:27:42.279" end="02:27:46.749" style="s2">little rat win now and then then they</p>
<p begin="02:27:44.199" end="02:27:48.279" style="s2">get dejected and quit playing and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:46.749" end="02:27:50.140" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:27:48.279" end="02:27:52.600" style="s2">observation if people don&#39;t get to win</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.140" end="02:27:55.119" style="s2">now and then you know they that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="02:27:52.600" end="02:27:56.709" style="s2">of what happens to Cain God says well</p>
<p begin="02:27:55.119" end="02:28:03.989" style="s2">you not playing a straight game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.709" end="02:28:03.989" style="s2">why you&#39;re not winning but I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.369" end="02:28:09.009" style="s2">there&#39;s an intimation in the Old</p>
<p begin="02:28:07.719" end="02:28:10.899" style="s2">Testament and I think it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.009" end="02:28:13.209" style="s2">developed in the New Testament maybe not</p>
<p begin="02:28:10.899" end="02:28:17.879" style="s2">that the straighter the game you play</p>
<p begin="02:28:13.209" end="02:28:20.469" style="s2">the more likely you are to win and so</p>
<p begin="02:28:17.879" end="02:28:22.959" style="s2">maybe part of the reason that God lets</p>
<p begin="02:28:20.469" end="02:28:24.999" style="s2">Abraham bargain and and even Jacob is</p>
<p begin="02:28:22.959" end="02:28:27.789" style="s2">because they&#39;ve started to play very</p>
<p begin="02:28:24.999" end="02:28:29.409" style="s2">straight games and so maybe you do win</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.789" end="02:28:32.199" style="s2">in your wrestling with God if you play a</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.409" end="02:28:34.029" style="s2">straight game I mean I think that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="02:28:32.199" end="02:28:35.399" style="s2">actually think that&#39;s I think the reason</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.029" end="02:28:38.199" style="s2">that&#39;s true is because that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:28:35.399" end="02:28:40.029" style="s2">why we would define it as a straight</p>
<p begin="02:28:38.199" end="02:28:42.549" style="s2">game now then we could speak</p>
<p begin="02:28:40.029" end="02:28:45.249" style="s2">psychologically again I think that what</p>
<p begin="02:28:42.549" end="02:28:47.979" style="s2">we&#39;ve come to recognize as a straight</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.249" end="02:28:51.039" style="s2">game is the game that in the broadest</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.979" end="02:28:53.799" style="s2">number of situations across the widest</p>
<p begin="02:28:51.039" end="02:28:55.749" style="s2">range of time spans is most likely to</p>
<p begin="02:28:53.799" end="02:28:57.640" style="s2">produce a positive outcome and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:28:55.749" end="02:28:59.259" style="s2">that&#39;s actually the grounds for our</p>
<p begin="02:28:57.640" end="02:29:01.839" style="s2">sense of ethics that it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="02:28:59.259" end="02:29:03.159" style="s2">practical not to belabor it too much</p>
<p begin="02:29:01.839" end="02:29:04.629" style="s2">because there was there was an</p>
<p begin="02:29:03.159" end="02:29:07.119" style="s2">interesting insight from Chesterton&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:29:04.629" end="02:29:10.289" style="s2">the man who was Thursday where God sets</p>
<p begin="02:29:07.119" end="02:29:15.039" style="s2">himself up as the benevolent antagonist</p>
<p begin="02:29:10.289" end="02:29:17.199" style="s2">so as to accelerate the game yeah well I</p>
<p begin="02:29:15.039" end="02:29:20.499" style="s2">think that&#39;s a really interesting idea I</p>
<p begin="02:29:17.199" end="02:29:22.630" style="s2">mean there is there is hints I would say</p>
<p begin="02:29:20.499" end="02:29:26.380" style="s2">throughout the biblical story</p>
<p begin="02:29:22.630" end="02:29:28.840" style="s2">that the reason that God tolerates Satan</p>
<p begin="02:29:26.380" end="02:29:32.710" style="s2">let&#39;s say is because without an</p>
<p begin="02:29:28.840" end="02:29:34.510" style="s2">adversary you&#39;re soft and that&#39;s I mean</p>
<p begin="02:29:32.710" end="02:29:37.180" style="s2">that&#39;s tied in with the notion that life</p>
<p begin="02:29:34.510" end="02:29:38.800" style="s2">is something like a moral struggle you</p>
<p begin="02:29:37.180" end="02:29:42.100" style="s2">know that that&#39;s the fundamental essence</p>
<p begin="02:29:38.800" end="02:29:44.220" style="s2">of being a moral struggle now it I think</p>
<p begin="02:29:42.100" end="02:29:47.020" style="s2">that that&#39;s phenomenologically a</p>
<p begin="02:29:44.220" end="02:29:48.520" style="s2">reasonable observation maybe it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="02:29:47.020" end="02:29:51.280" style="s2">other people don&#39;t experience it that</p>
<p begin="02:29:48.520" end="02:29:53.710" style="s2">way but it seems to me like within my</p>
<p begin="02:29:51.280" end="02:29:55.000" style="s2">own experience that that&#39;s accurate now</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.710" end="02:29:56.620" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what again I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="02:29:55.000" end="02:29:59.439" style="s2">what that says about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="02:29:56.620" end="02:30:02.200" style="s2">nature of reality but I had a vision at</p>
<p begin="02:29:59.439" end="02:30:07.570" style="s2">one point that I was in a ring with</p>
<p begin="02:30:02.200" end="02:30:11.800" style="s2">Satan actually believe it or not and it</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.570" end="02:30:15.010" style="s2">was like a Roman Colosseum and you know</p>
<p begin="02:30:11.800" end="02:30:19.479" style="s2">I was rather upset to find myself there</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.010" end="02:30:22.120" style="s2">but I won and I asked God afterwards why</p>
<p begin="02:30:19.479" end="02:30:25.750" style="s2">he would do such a thing and his answer</p>
<p begin="02:30:22.120" end="02:30:27.729" style="s2">was he knew I could win and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:30:25.750" end="02:30:29.050" style="s2">interesting you know because like I</p>
<p begin="02:30:27.729" end="02:30:30.610" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to make of that believe</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.050" end="02:30:34.660" style="s2">me I have no idea what to make of that</p>
<p begin="02:30:30.610" end="02:30:38.140" style="s2">but the idea was that if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="02:30:34.660" end="02:30:39.340" style="s2">to encourage someone rather than protect</p>
<p begin="02:30:38.140" end="02:30:41.350" style="s2">them because those are really different</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.340" end="02:30:43.149" style="s2">things right to protect someone isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="02:30:41.350" end="02:30:45.460" style="s2">make them strong to encourage them is to</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.149" end="02:30:51.250" style="s2">make them strong then you set them a</p>
<p begin="02:30:45.460" end="02:30:54.700" style="s2">series of challenges right right at the</p>
<p begin="02:30:51.250" end="02:30:56.020" style="s2">point where they may win and maybe you</p>
<p begin="02:30:54.700" end="02:30:58.540" style="s2">could make a case that that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.020" end="02:31:00.700" style="s2">do if you really care for someone now I</p>
<p begin="02:30:58.540" end="02:31:03.580" style="s2">know that that&#39;s it I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="02:31:00.700" end="02:31:06.729" style="s2">that interpretation is correct I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.580" end="02:31:08.620" style="s2">but but there&#39;s something mean you</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.729" end="02:31:10.450" style="s2">definitely with your children you know</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.620" end="02:31:14.740" style="s2">when you&#39;re wrestling with them say when</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.450" end="02:31:17.189" style="s2">you&#39;re playing with them you use you</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.740" end="02:31:19.720" style="s2">push them to the limit of their ability</p>
<p begin="02:31:17.189" end="02:31:27.899" style="s2">because otherwise they don&#39;t transcend</p>
<p begin="02:31:19.720" end="02:31:27.899" style="s2">their current abilities so yep</p>

<p begin="02:31:38.560" end="02:31:45.560" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see some of you perhaps most of</p>
<p begin="02:31:42.560" end="02:31:48.410" style="s2">you in December and I think we&#39;ll finish</p>
<p begin="02:31:45.560" end="02:31:50.270" style="s2">off Genesis at that point and then in</p>
<p begin="02:31:48.410" end="02:31:53.720" style="s2">the new year probably not till the</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.270" end="02:31:55.069" style="s2">spring I&#39;ll start with exodus which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.720" end="02:31:57.050" style="s2">really looking forward to because I</p>
<p begin="02:31:55.069" end="02:32:00.080" style="s2">really like the Exodus story it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.050" end="02:32:01.880" style="s2">amazing story and unbelievably deep note</p>
<p begin="02:32:00.080" end="02:32:04.489" style="s2">well the ones we&#39;ve covered so far being</p>
<p begin="02:32:01.880" end="02:32:05.989" style="s2">you know pretty good as well but so</p>
<p begin="02:32:04.489" end="02:32:09.399" style="s2">thank you all for coming and we&#39;ll</p>
