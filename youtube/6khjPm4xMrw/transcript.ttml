<p begin="00:00:32.969" end="00:00:37.410" style="s2">the bakery from scratch and having to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:40.710" style="s2">in competition with everybody else is</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.410" end="00:00:42.329" style="s2">what currently exists so you don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.710" end="00:00:43.710" style="s2">make pumpernickel for yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.329" end="00:00:45.750" style="s2">figure out how to make it for the five</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.710" end="00:00:47.399" style="s2">of you and enough people to make that</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.750" end="00:00:48.660" style="s2">efficient but you&#39;re in competition with</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.399" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">everyone else which makes it not</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:54.390" style="s2">efficient getting ten thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:57.090" style="s2">together to say how do we make our get</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.390" end="00:01:01.170" style="s2">our 10,000 families breads needs made</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.090" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">that&#39;s doable and how do we bring that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.170" end="00:01:04.470" style="s2">cost down how do we share in that labor</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">how do we both buy ingredients to make</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.470" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">it cheaper at a local level we do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">we figure out how many of us need a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.979" end="00:01:17.310" style="s2">bakery then we create the bakery we bake</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:19.560" style="s2">the bread locally because breads better</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:22.020" style="s2">locally we make the decisions on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.560" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">the packaging is it is efficient how we</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.020" end="00:01:26.880" style="s2">get it to us the user is it delivered</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:28.290" style="s2">this woman leave him with all the trucks</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.880" end="00:01:30.090" style="s2">and going delivering each individual</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.290" end="00:01:32.400" style="s2">bread that sounds like not a great</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.090" end="00:01:33.990" style="s2">option but when we also solve it for</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.400" end="00:01:36.659" style="s2">vegetables and eggs and milk and</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.990" end="00:01:37.680" style="s2">together we get it delivered that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.659" end="00:01:41.430" style="s2">like a great option</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.680" end="00:01:42.420" style="s2">so there&#39;s then regionally regionally we</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.430" end="00:01:44.070" style="s2">want to be able to bulk buy ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.420" end="00:01:47.310" style="s2">with not just our bakery but other</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.070" end="00:01:49.680" style="s2">bakeries we want to be able to start a</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.310" end="00:01:51.780" style="s2">niche bakery well turns out not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.680" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">wants pumpernickel rye or sourdough some</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.780" end="00:01:54.509" style="s2">people are gluten-free</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:56.130" style="s2">are there enough gluten-free people to</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.509" end="00:01:59.250" style="s2">have a local bakery that&#39;s gluten free</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.130" end="00:02:00.960" style="s2">and have it be cheap maybe not what</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.250" end="00:02:02.280" style="s2">about a larger region how many how big</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.960" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">of a region do we need to have that</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.280" end="00:02:07.079" style="s2">10,000 people so there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.849" style="s2">make sense to do regionally probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.079" end="00:02:10.800" style="s2">milling it until we get to the point</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.849" end="00:02:14.310" style="s2">where we have a local</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.800" end="00:02:15.930" style="s2">Mills in our bakeries they grind it</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.310" end="00:02:19.110" style="s2">fresh so that it maintains its its</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.930" end="00:02:20.700" style="s2">nutritional value but we can decide on</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.110" end="00:02:24.330" style="s2">that right does it make sense to mill</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.700" end="00:02:27.960" style="s2">ourselves we can decide globally what</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.330" end="00:02:30.060" style="s2">makes sense well the machines in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.960" end="00:02:32.880" style="s2">bakeries don&#39;t make sense for us to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.060" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">locally or regionally we don&#39;t all need</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.880" end="00:02:38.250" style="s2">a we all need bread we need it to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:41.400" style="s2">baked in ovens we don&#39;t need an oven</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.250" end="00:02:43.710" style="s2">making factory in every town the parts</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.400" end="00:02:45.570" style="s2">that go into those machines as well as</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.710" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">the other thing that&#39;s done on a global</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.570" end="00:02:50.040" style="s2">scale is the technology that goes into</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:52.950" style="s2">running the bakery to managing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.040" end="00:02:55.260" style="s2">inventory to managing the labor to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.950" end="00:02:57.630" style="s2">the feedback system to know how much</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.260" end="00:02:59.340" style="s2">bread should we be baking feeds back</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.630" end="00:03:01.020" style="s2">from the customer themselves saying</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.340" end="00:03:02.550" style="s2">here&#39;s what the bread I want they</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.020" end="00:03:05.100" style="s2">themselves don&#39;t want to have an app</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.550" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">just to order bread they want an app to</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.100" end="00:03:09.240" style="s2">order all of their groceries which goes</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:12.930" style="s2">to the individual makers and gets</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.240" end="00:03:14.400" style="s2">compiled into one one delivery and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.930" end="00:03:16.620" style="s2">given to you I don&#39;t want to have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.400" end="00:03:18.630" style="s2">wait by the door for every every loaf of</p>

<p begin="00:03:21.270" end="00:03:24.840" style="s2">want it to feed back into the system my</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.950" end="00:03:26.490" style="s2">individual needs so that it knows guess</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.840" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">what you get a thing of milk every week</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.490" end="00:03:31.020" style="s2">here you go</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.430" style="s2">you get bread every so in this often it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.020" end="00:03:34.020" style="s2">goes mouldy maybe you need half a loaf</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.430" end="00:03:36.180" style="s2">of bread your neighbor also likes bread</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.020" end="00:03:37.830" style="s2">and also the same thing happens we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:19.109" style="s2">feasible thing to do together we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.680" end="00:04:19.930" style="s2">share an innovation and recipes on our</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.109" end="00:04:22.150" style="s2">technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.930" end="00:04:23.830" style="s2">nothing is mandatory you don&#39;t have to</p>

<p begin="00:04:23.830" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">don&#39;t have to share your grandmother&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:29.830" style="s2">recipe with everyone but if everybody</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:31.810" style="s2">else is innovating and you have a new</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.830" end="00:04:33.940" style="s2">way to innovate to shave off two seconds</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.810" end="00:04:35.500" style="s2">the next person&#39;s innovation is going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.940" end="00:04:37.419" style="s2">shave off another two seconds in another</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.500" end="00:04:40.449" style="s2">second and so we&#39;re all going to be able</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.419" end="00:04:43.509" style="s2">to benefit off of sharing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.449" end="00:04:46.270" style="s2">innovation if we all have the recipes</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.509" end="00:04:49.539" style="s2">available then we can say which one we</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.270" end="00:04:51.009" style="s2">want locally and and make those ones</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.539" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">make the ones that work for the most</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.009" end="00:04:56.949" style="s2">people but then the nice bread can get</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:58.900" style="s2">made more regionally and create the</p>

<p begin="00:05:07.120" end="00:05:11.080" style="s2">feasible that has the feedback systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.370" end="00:05:13.720" style="s2">that less stuff is going to waste</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.080" end="00:05:17.139" style="s2">we&#39;re getting more bread out of less</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.720" end="00:05:18.789" style="s2">labor we&#39;re getting a delivery system</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.139" end="00:05:20.979" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t just work for bread it</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.789" end="00:05:22.690" style="s2">works for everything we&#39;re getting when</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.979" end="00:05:24.039" style="s2">there&#39;s an innovation on we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.690" end="00:05:25.479" style="s2">it in paper because it doesn&#39;t keep it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.039" end="00:05:26.500" style="s2">fresh and we don&#39;t want it in plastic</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.479" end="00:05:28.720" style="s2">because plastic is bad for the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.500" end="00:05:31.000" style="s2">environment oh you have a solution you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.720" end="00:05:32.800" style="s2">came up with a hemp bag that we can just</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.000" end="00:05:35.550" style="s2">put it in there how fast can you make</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.800" end="00:05:37.990" style="s2">those have bags we as a region we as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.550" end="00:05:40.150" style="s2">bakery can say yes we want to use yours</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.990" end="00:05:41.650" style="s2">and we want other people to use yours</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.150" end="00:05:43.720" style="s2">too because its solution that helps the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.650" end="00:05:46.199" style="s2">planet when innovation happens you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.720" end="00:05:49.030" style="s2">already have your customers ready to go</p>
