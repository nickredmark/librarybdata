<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:22.859" style="s2">the middle I put a couple things on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.460" end="00:00:24.830" style="s2">agenda just cuz I needed some things</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">okay for the YouTube channel or</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.830" end="00:00:28.439" style="s2">brainstorm better than that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:29.880" style="s2">really know what we&#39;re doing today but</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.439" end="00:00:31.920" style="s2">I&#39;m sure we always manage to fill the</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.880" end="00:00:36.320" style="s2">hour move it forward so well figure it</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.920" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">out so um the two things I just was um</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:39.750" style="s2">when we post something on YouTube I</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:40.739" style="s2">don&#39;t know if we can do it through</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.750" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">stream you&#39;re it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.739" end="00:00:44.370" style="s2">the stream art always seems to post as</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:46.530" style="s2">entertainment on my channel but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.370" end="00:00:48.539" style="s2">like you can pick a category that it</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.530" end="00:00:49.920" style="s2">normally posts as and I think both are</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.539" end="00:00:51.510" style="s2">set to entertainment my channel and</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.920" end="00:00:53.600" style="s2">together at Eckerd set to entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.510" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">I don&#39;t think entertainment covers it oh</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.600" end="00:00:59.340" style="s2">so there&#39;s no profit and activism and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">there&#39;s technology and then there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.340" end="00:01:02.730" style="s2">people and blogs which mine might fit</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:04.290" style="s2">under but we&#39;re not working together</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.730" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">tech what do we want together and you</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.290" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">have to pick one just to be the main one</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:13.920" style="s2">that the the UM that it automatically is</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:16.320" style="s2">unless you write okay I mean nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.920" end="00:01:20.790" style="s2">and activism it&#39;s probably the closest</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.320" end="00:01:22.830" style="s2">thing I think battery technology I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.790" end="00:01:25.590" style="s2">like where&#39;s nonprofit technology</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.830" end="00:01:27.240" style="s2">where&#39;s but yeah like who are our people</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.590" end="00:01:29.310" style="s2">that we want to find it people who are</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.240" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">looking for nonprofit activism or people</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.310" end="00:01:34.340" style="s2">who are looking for technology my guess</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:36.570" style="s2">is nonprofit activism is more I think so</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.340" end="00:01:39.420" style="s2">well I mean yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.570" end="00:01:44.430" style="s2">not totally cut and dry like it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.420" end="00:01:47.640" style="s2">completely valid question yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.430" end="00:01:49.409" style="s2">in the short term it&#39;ll be nonprofit</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.640" end="00:01:51.450" style="s2">activism and then when we get enough</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.409" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">momentum and we go more mainstream than</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.450" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">I&#39;m late tech hmm alright sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">and then the other thing I just had on</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">the agenda was every other week at this</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">time or Duty Nydia cafes right for our</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">projects I have no idea what questions</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:07.020" style="s2">for those look like so brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">some questions and then you can just</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.020" end="00:02:11.310" style="s2">make a schedule and then pick one but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:11.670" style="s2">that&#39;s half of why this is dead all</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.310" end="00:02:13.370" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.670" end="00:02:15.319" style="s2">videos aren&#39;t posted before</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.370" end="00:02:17.300" style="s2">and is like I think of them and I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.319" end="00:02:19.459" style="s2">procrastinate on that into laters we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.300" end="00:02:21.830" style="s2">generate three or four questions that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.459" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">then you know we don&#39;t need to visit it</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.830" end="00:02:25.370" style="s2">again for another couple weeks and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:26.690" style="s2">we can write and we can rotate them it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.370" end="00:02:30.620" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be new ones every time</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.690" end="00:02:32.090" style="s2">but and on the idea cafes that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.620" end="00:02:35.750" style="s2">completely open or is that meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.090" end="00:02:38.209" style="s2">idea cafes sort of adjacent to together</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.750" end="00:02:39.799" style="s2">tactic idea Cafe is its own YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.209" end="00:02:41.930" style="s2">channel right that I do every Tuesday</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.799" end="00:02:42.980" style="s2">and it was going to be a platform in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.930" end="00:02:46.160" style="s2">day cafe is just an hour-long</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.980" end="00:02:48.019" style="s2">conversation where everyone takes a turn</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.160" end="00:02:49.430" style="s2">answering the question throughout two</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.019" end="00:02:52.310" style="s2">five minutes without instruction and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.430" end="00:02:53.930" style="s2">then you have an open discussion so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.310" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">got a bit of format to it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.930" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">mainly so people know what that question</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.299" style="s2">is they&#39;re not feeling like it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:00.860" style="s2">roundtable but it&#39;s got to be like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.299" end="00:03:03.170" style="s2">question that people want to answer</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.860" end="00:03:07.700" style="s2">about their project but you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.170" end="00:03:09.349" style="s2">mean like it&#39;s right right cafe cafe</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.700" end="00:03:11.480" style="s2">channel and you&#39;ve got other spots</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.349" end="00:03:14.450" style="s2">throughout the week that you do whatever</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.480" end="00:03:17.269" style="s2">topics right right yeah okay yeah so it</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.450" end="00:03:20.060" style="s2">sort of meant to be like a crossroads of</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.269" end="00:03:21.980" style="s2">the idea cafe format on a topic that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.060" end="00:03:24.019" style="s2">somewhat related to together tech is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.980" end="00:03:24.950" style="s2">that what we&#39;re saying are these by the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.019" end="00:03:26.989" style="s2">idea cafes</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.950" end="00:03:29.660" style="s2">I believe the every yeah the every other</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.989" end="00:03:30.739" style="s2">Friday idea cafe was to have an IT cafe</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.660" end="00:03:32.359" style="s2">just cuz it&#39;s a way to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.739" end="00:03:33.739" style="s2">conversation that isn&#39;t the round table</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.359" end="00:03:36.859" style="s2">we&#39;re all answered like one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.739" end="00:03:38.090" style="s2">like how does your how could your your</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.859" end="00:03:40.370" style="s2">project be used during the grand in it</p>

<p begin="00:03:43.579" end="00:03:48.109" style="s2">allowing any of those things but those</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.160" end="00:03:50.599" style="s2">questions I&#39;m generating three or four</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.109" end="00:03:52.250" style="s2">of them that are project specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.599" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">without the mean to project specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.250" end="00:03:55.700" style="s2">right not how is wiki lecture I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:04:00.260" style="s2">say who pandemic it&#39;s like how is your</p>

<p begin="00:04:00.260" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">start out listening being I think we</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.480" end="00:04:15.400" style="s2">start out initiate with just kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:19.690" style="s2">basics like funding attracting users</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.400" end="00:04:23.120" style="s2">which I guess might fall under marketing</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.690" end="00:04:29.389" style="s2">building a landing page could even be</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.120" end="00:04:32.780" style="s2">you know stuff like that so we talked in</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.389" end="00:04:34.400" style="s2">like kind of a something like some</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.780" end="00:04:37.070" style="s2">question around like how does the</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.400" end="00:04:39.500" style="s2">marketing work for your profile it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.070" end="00:04:41.630" style="s2">it&#39;s every its I guess it&#39;s answering</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.500" end="00:04:44.419" style="s2">the question I kind of see it as it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.630" end="00:04:48.590" style="s2">working session for all for us to work</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.419" end="00:04:52.070" style="s2">on things that help all the projects</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.590" end="00:04:54.889" style="s2">either in the moment or building</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.070" end="00:04:56.330" style="s2">something central for the project so so</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.889" end="00:04:57.950" style="s2">yeah I think the topic could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.330" end="00:04:59.570" style="s2">marketing and then the answer could be</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.950" end="00:05:02.090" style="s2">Oh what am i doing on my project so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.570" end="00:05:03.710" style="s2">can learn from that but what are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.090" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">problems on having that we can work shop</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.710" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">together although that may be that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:12.710" style="s2">maybe that&#39;s closer to the to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:15.020" style="s2">Saturday meeting so I&#39;m gonna be getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.710" end="00:05:17.750" style="s2">a mixed up but but I kind of think of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.020" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">be like I really think of it like okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.750" end="00:05:23.060" style="s2">so let&#39;s tackle funding how do we fund</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:25.100" style="s2">all the projects right how do we do a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.060" end="00:05:27.770" style="s2">group funding for together taxes the way</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.100" end="00:05:31.820" style="s2">I see abut tell me that&#39;s wrong so yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.770" end="00:05:34.039" style="s2">so that&#39;s part of the like Fridays is</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.820" end="00:05:38.450" style="s2">more better project right Saturdays is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.039" end="00:05:39.860" style="s2">your project and the meta so yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.450" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">one&#39;s the port this is the board</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.860" end="00:05:43.640" style="s2">meetings this is like how do we move the</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:45.800" style="s2">meta project actually forward right the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.640" end="00:05:47.260" style="s2">other one is the idea cafe which it</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.800" end="00:05:50.210" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need to be right it could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.260" end="00:05:53.300" style="s2">that it&#39;s just a topic right it&#39;s its</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.210" end="00:05:54.500" style="s2">marketing and then people can share</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.300" end="00:05:56.930" style="s2">whatever they want to it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.500" end="00:05:59.150" style="s2">question necessarily um and then we may</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.930" end="00:06:00.770" style="s2">be able to even get experts on that to</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.150" end="00:06:03.410" style="s2">come and talk about it and and help</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.770" end="00:06:04.520" style="s2">brainstorm and we could change it I just</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.410" end="00:06:05.990" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it&#39;s within my capacity</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.520" end="00:06:08.539" style="s2">because then I can&#39;t be like finding</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.990" end="00:06:10.330" style="s2">experts and I&#39;m kind of all about her</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.539" end="00:06:12.440" style="s2">shows up shows up and we&#39;re all experts</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.330" end="00:06:15.889" style="s2">let&#39;s not worry about that and tell us</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.440" end="00:06:17.990" style="s2">someone has a specific need so if we can</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.889" end="00:06:19.880" style="s2">do it in the idea cafe format just so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.990" end="00:06:21.020" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have to format something</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.880" end="00:06:23.840" style="s2">new and then we can kind of make it</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.020" end="00:06:25.400" style="s2">wiggle around and run it like what are</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.840" end="00:06:27.260" style="s2">you currently doing for marketing and</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.400" end="00:06:28.940" style="s2">your project right and then you but</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.260" end="00:06:30.770" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing your project to it even</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.940" end="00:06:32.750" style="s2">though it is the meta project right like</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.770" end="00:06:34.729" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re representing your</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.750" end="00:06:36.710" style="s2">project but in the meta project of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.729" end="00:06:40.070" style="s2">what could we do together</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.710" end="00:06:41.330" style="s2">I find people don&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.070" end="00:06:42.650" style="s2">they&#39;re part of the meta even when they</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.330" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">are so they&#39;re like oh that&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.650" end="00:06:47.510" style="s2">piece and they it&#39;s it&#39;s so creating it</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:49.040" style="s2">the question arounds your project so</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.510" end="00:06:50.180" style="s2">people come and bring their project and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.040" end="00:06:53.360" style="s2">then they&#39;re already part of the minute</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.180" end="00:06:54.740" style="s2">I met a project right it&#39;s just like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.360" end="00:06:58.430" style="s2">slightly different focus on Friday</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.740" end="00:07:01.130" style="s2">versus our Saturday but very similar so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.430" end="00:07:04.970" style="s2">Saturday is really specifically it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.130" end="00:07:06.350" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s your it&#39;s your project but</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.970" end="00:07:08.990" style="s2">it&#39;s more like what have I done and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.350" end="00:07:12.530" style="s2">I need help with over any topic and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.990" end="00:07:15.610" style="s2">that&#39;s fits the mastermind format and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.530" end="00:07:19.550" style="s2">Friday is just an open idea Cafe about</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.610" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">projects with under a specific topic for</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.550" end="00:07:23.090" style="s2">each week yeah because the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:25.970" style="s2">around a question right you each take</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.090" end="00:07:28.010" style="s2">turns answering the question so yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.970" end="00:07:30.050" style="s2">a question might be how yeah how do you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.010" end="00:07:33.730" style="s2">mark it I think how do you market your</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.050" end="00:07:33.730" style="s2">project how do you fund your projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.380" end="00:07:38.870" style="s2">stuff like that what are something and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.550" end="00:07:40.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know marketing may be too big</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.870" end="00:07:42.530" style="s2">maybe it should be how do I find users</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.430" end="00:07:45.320" style="s2">or how do you find users for your</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.530" end="00:07:48.260" style="s2">project how do you find you get the word</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.320" end="00:07:50.200" style="s2">out for your volunteers yeah or just how</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.260" end="00:07:53.180" style="s2">do you build an audience oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.200" end="00:07:55.700" style="s2">and that&#39;s where like honestly marketing</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.180" end="00:07:57.290" style="s2">is the word like even if it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.700" end="00:07:59.720" style="s2">connotation it&#39;s like no matter because</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.290" end="00:08:01.130" style="s2">whatever your project is is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.720" end="00:08:02.630" style="s2">that&#39;s marketing I&#39;m just thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.130" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">though there&#39;s there&#39;s two focuses one</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.630" end="00:08:07.490" style="s2">is to like just get users of the parts</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:09.440" style="s2">and one is to get volunteers for the</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:11.720" style="s2">project and I think those are those</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.440" end="00:08:13.730" style="s2">might be two different conversations but</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.720" end="00:08:16.460" style="s2">they both I mean marketing is really the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.730" end="00:08:18.320" style="s2">user side but it could mean both you do</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.460" end="00:08:20.390" style="s2">marketing yeah it&#39;s yours and to be fair</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.320" end="00:08:21.800" style="s2">I think the term marketing can be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.390" end="00:08:23.090" style="s2">loose I think a lot of people when they</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.800" end="00:08:25.190" style="s2">hear marketing just think advertising</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.090" end="00:08:27.770" style="s2">and I think that might get some wires</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.190" end="00:08:30.110" style="s2">crossed so I agree with taking it a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.770" end="00:08:31.760" style="s2">layer two down and doing stuff like how</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.110" end="00:08:35.240" style="s2">would you build your audience how would</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.760" end="00:08:37.190" style="s2">you like that sort of a more and cluster</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.240" end="00:08:38.360" style="s2">we&#39;re hitting a tree hitting the topics</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.190" end="00:08:39.740" style="s2">which we think will do it having a</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.360" end="00:08:43.000" style="s2">slightly nuanced a little different</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.740" end="00:08:45.050" style="s2">might generate different conversations a</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.000" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">members name I&#39;ll have pretty watch it -</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.050" end="00:08:48.230" style="s2">we&#39;ll look at the name but he had</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:49.840" style="s2">mentioned that there&#39;s the cat that do</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.230" end="00:08:51.790" style="s2">coffee meeting right now</p>

<p begin="00:09:04.150" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">mapping I&#39;ll figure it out or they won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.770" end="00:09:10.210" style="s2">I was hoping to be part of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.880" end="00:09:12.250" style="s2">conversation but it&#39;ll it&#39;ll be figured</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.210" end="00:09:15.340" style="s2">out one way or the other or not and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.250" end="00:09:16.780" style="s2">won&#39;t move forward with it yeah if it</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.340" end="00:09:18.340" style="s2">wasn&#39;t during this time I would be on it</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.780" end="00:09:21.970" style="s2">or if I was able to go to the one</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.340" end="00:09:24.400" style="s2">yesterday and mapping really is a is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.970" end="00:09:28.960" style="s2">kind of I guess it could have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.400" end="00:09:30.640" style="s2">projects underneath it but yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.960" end="00:09:32.950" style="s2">guess I still don&#39;t quite know what the</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.640" end="00:09:35.080" style="s2">scope of what they mean by mapping for</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.950" end="00:09:36.460" style="s2">me it I think of it like education but</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.090" end="00:14:08.060" style="s2">a roundtable and we&#39;re not going back</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.530" end="00:14:10.490" style="s2">and forth</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.060" end="00:14:12.680" style="s2">but then if somebody want really wanted</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.490" end="00:14:15.860" style="s2">a project raising I&#39;m also I did want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.680" end="00:14:17.720" style="s2">kind of figure out so I&#39;d kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:20.030" style="s2">brought up the idea hey do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.720" end="00:14:22.340" style="s2">have a discussion about replying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.030" end="00:14:25.010" style="s2">people or phrasing the people things</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.340" end="00:14:29.840" style="s2">because I&#39;ve had a need for that I got a</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.010" end="00:14:31.990" style="s2">couple topics so I guess I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.840" end="00:14:36.710" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s the easiest way to</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.990" end="00:14:38.540" style="s2">make that happen so I didn&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.710" end="00:14:41.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really fit in an idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.540" end="00:14:43.850" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of more specific but</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.450" end="00:14:45.860" style="s2">I&#39;d be happy to do it on the cafe time</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.850" end="00:14:48.890" style="s2">if you&#39;re if you&#39;re low on topics which</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.860" end="00:14:50.630" style="s2">are probably not and then if not then</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.890" end="00:14:52.640" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.630" end="00:14:54.620" style="s2">logistics of scheduling and what do we</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.640" end="00:14:56.210" style="s2">suggest people just throw up a doodle</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.620" end="00:14:58.550" style="s2">and see when people available we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.210" end="00:15:01.730" style="s2">post with a time and see if anyone shows</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.550" end="00:15:04.460" style="s2">up like you mean you want to do your own</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.730" end="00:15:06.920" style="s2">project raising and you want it well I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.460" end="00:15:09.140" style="s2">mean I wanted to have that conversation</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.920" end="00:15:11.720" style="s2">with this group and I guess I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.140" end="00:15:13.880" style="s2">really care win or how yeah so I guess</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.720" end="00:15:15.950" style="s2">I&#39;m just seeing what if everyone says</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.880" end="00:15:18.080" style="s2">that there&#39;s a regular meeting time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.950" end="00:15:19.430" style="s2">I guess actually we could do that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.080" end="00:15:22.550" style="s2">I don&#39;t know it doesn&#39;t really fit even</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.430" end="00:15:24.860" style="s2">in the idea cafe Friday things I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.550" end="00:15:26.870" style="s2">the best thing to do is to put pick a</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.860" end="00:15:28.790" style="s2">time that you want to do it and put it</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.870" end="00:15:30.170" style="s2">up there because that&#39;s what we want</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.790" end="00:15:31.790" style="s2">them to do right</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.170" end="00:15:33.290" style="s2">is like pick a time you&#39;re available if</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.790" end="00:15:34.700" style="s2">you have three or four times available</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.290" end="00:15:35.810" style="s2">then by all means do a doodle poll and</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.700" end="00:15:38.750" style="s2">then pick the one that most people will</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.810" end="00:15:40.459" style="s2">say yes to but otherwise pick a time and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.750" end="00:15:43.790" style="s2">then let&#39;s see if people show up right</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.459" end="00:15:46.339" style="s2">yeah and of which if I can I will be one</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.790" end="00:15:48.019" style="s2">of those people like who else shows up</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.339" end="00:15:49.070" style="s2">right to invite people to say this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.019" end="00:15:51.910" style="s2">what it looks like to do your own</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.070" end="00:15:53.269" style="s2">solution raising our generator right</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.910" end="00:15:55.250" style="s2">okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.269" end="00:15:57.860" style="s2">yeah I was just trying to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.250" end="00:15:59.630" style="s2">best way or if we had another meeting</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.860" end="00:16:01.070" style="s2">time that we wanted to use for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.630" end="00:16:02.690" style="s2">because I don&#39;t want to create a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.070" end="00:16:06.050" style="s2">separate meeting if we have it but it</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.690" end="00:16:08.290" style="s2">sounds like we don&#39;t so yeah so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.050" end="00:16:10.579" style="s2">just throw out a time for next week</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.290" end="00:16:11.990" style="s2">Sandia is I don&#39;t want other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.579" end="00:16:13.160" style="s2">using our time right like I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.990" end="00:16:15.470" style="s2">other people being like I&#39;m gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.160" end="00:16:17.570" style="s2">because Friday is a bit but like</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.470" end="00:16:20.660" style="s2">Saturday is our roundtables if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.570" end="00:16:22.399" style="s2">doing Project Racing&#39;s also then it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.660" end="00:16:24.440" style="s2">kind of hard that 9 a.m. 2 a.m. thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.399" end="00:16:26.570" style="s2">that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s not we want people</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.440" end="00:16:28.160" style="s2">to do but like if they knew they could</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.570" end="00:16:29.899" style="s2">schedule in at any point sign everyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.160" end="00:16:32.329" style="s2">home right now anyway people will</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.899" end="00:16:34.040" style="s2">hopefully show up then they can schedule</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.329" end="00:16:36.050" style="s2">it at their convenience to see who shows</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.040" end="00:16:37.820" style="s2">up and that&#39;s what I want to give them</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.050" end="00:16:39.800" style="s2">permission to do I&#39;ve literally given</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.820" end="00:16:41.690" style="s2">them permission on Facebook like typed</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.800" end="00:16:44.089" style="s2">it up you said that but no one&#39;s done it</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.690" end="00:16:46.940" style="s2">so it&#39;s like doing that so that we see</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.089" end="00:16:49.370" style="s2">right with that yeah I guess my thought</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.940" end="00:16:50.930" style="s2">is I don&#39;t know that anyone&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.370" end="00:16:52.459" style="s2">show up I mean you all said you would</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.930" end="00:16:55.130" style="s2">participate but I&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.459" end="00:16:59.390" style="s2">whether if I just throw a random date</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.130" end="00:17:01.880" style="s2">time what&#39;s the chance that anyone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.390" end="00:17:04.069" style="s2">gonna be able to make it and I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.880" end="00:17:06.140" style="s2">pretty open the schedule but yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.069" end="00:17:08.329" style="s2">worth a try I just say that&#39;s why is</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.140" end="00:17:11.240" style="s2">kind of thinking about is there a better</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.329" end="00:17:13.699" style="s2">way to do it yeah and that is part of it</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.240" end="00:17:15.829" style="s2">too because other people don&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.699" end="00:17:17.540" style="s2">conversation first right so that is like</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.829" end="00:17:18.860" style="s2">a vulnerable thing to put yourself out</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.540" end="00:17:20.540" style="s2">there and say hey I want to approach you</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.860" end="00:17:22.309" style="s2">crazy and at noon on Wednesday and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.540" end="00:17:25.069" style="s2">no one shows up it&#39;s gross think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.309" end="00:17:27.140" style="s2">like oh no no one likes me you know what</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.069" end="00:17:28.730" style="s2">you know like it&#39;s a different whereas</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.140" end="00:17:31.190" style="s2">well that&#39;s why I&#39;m wondering whether if</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.730" end="00:17:32.929" style="s2">we could somehow facilitate to make it</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.190" end="00:17:35.929" style="s2">more likely that it would work but I</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.929" end="00:17:37.669" style="s2">don&#39;t have any solutions you my only</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.929" end="00:17:39.830" style="s2">suggestion would be like you said to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.669" end="00:17:41.510" style="s2">pick a time and then say hey if there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.800" end="00:23:36.670" style="s2">whatnot but for the most part I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.530" end="00:23:39.160" style="s2">it&#39;s important for us to actually get</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.670" end="00:23:41.020" style="s2">like at least a couple projects and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.160" end="00:23:42.220" style="s2">their active hosting stuff so that when</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.020" end="00:23:45.010" style="s2">you go look at like the event list</p>

<p begin="00:23:49.630" end="00:23:54.190" style="s2">think that&#39;d make sense to post it in</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.430" end="00:23:56.020" style="s2">the game deep space so that because I</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.190" end="00:23:58.420" style="s2">mean when I put up the list of all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.020" end="00:24:00.340" style="s2">videos for the week on Sunday part of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.420" end="00:24:02.680" style="s2">is also probably adding it to that so</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.340" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">but no I think I am one of the project</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.680" end="00:24:05.470" style="s2">list for together tech if not be</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.510" style="s2">practical therefore together tech on</p>

<p begin="00:24:11.950" end="00:24:15.790" style="s2">because they&#39;re not under an umbrella of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.450" end="00:24:18.400" style="s2">a project this specifically just that</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.790" end="00:24:21.440" style="s2">like the idea Cafe is just game be then</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.970" end="00:24:32.300" style="s2">there probably makes sense to wait until</p>

<p begin="00:25:09.800" end="00:25:13.040" style="s2">subjects that we might be able to cover</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.180" end="00:25:15.230" style="s2">for the idea cafes for the amount of</p>

<p begin="00:25:25.520" end="00:25:31.460" style="s2">so we can hear any of those unanswered</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.530" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">questions cuz right now it&#39;s not all</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.460" end="00:25:34.790" style="s2">that well set up for that regards but</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.770" end="00:25:43.730" style="s2">because it&#39;s meta right it&#39;s like how we</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.450" end="00:25:46.820" style="s2">create solutions together how we govern</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.730" end="00:25:49.610" style="s2">together how governments what there</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.820" end="00:25:51.800" style="s2">might end up being like a category for</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.610" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">meta projects or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.800" end="00:25:55.360" style="s2">because yeah it is weird to explain</p>

<p begin="00:26:42.019" end="00:26:48.019" style="s2">now if you want to know if the four of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.450" end="00:26:49.669" style="s2">us are good yeah if we&#39;re out of other</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.019" end="00:26:54.500" style="s2">topics although I guess as far as the</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.669" end="00:26:58.730" style="s2">product matter project I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.500" end="00:27:00.559" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a couple things that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.730" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">still kind of want to work on or or do</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.559" end="00:27:05.240" style="s2">you think that we&#39;re just gonna kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:07.309" style="s2">build up the community first like do we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.240" end="00:27:10.610" style="s2">want to figure out how we&#39;re gonna start</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.309" end="00:27:13.550" style="s2">how we&#39;re gonna eventually collect some</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.610" end="00:27:15.789" style="s2">funds and pay for some development or</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.550" end="00:27:19.309" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.789" end="00:27:22.070" style="s2">what&#39;s the other thing or just determine</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.309" end="00:27:24.259" style="s2">you know what software do we what you</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.070" end="00:27:29.090" style="s2">know or is the matter project really</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.259" end="00:27:31.220" style="s2">just a community which is fine yeah so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.090" end="00:27:32.840" style="s2">think we do that way the time comes like</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.220" end="00:27:35.000" style="s2">when we&#39;re because right now</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:36.529" style="s2">theoretically one of us could like if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.000" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">wanted to put ten dollars in a month we</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.529" end="00:27:40.789" style="s2">could just pick one of us that&#39;s not me</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:42.440" style="s2">and you don&#39;t even give them the ten</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.789" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">bucks then they pay for the things cuz</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.440" end="00:27:45.559" style="s2">we&#39;re not even incorporated nothing&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:47.360" style="s2">there but as soon as like someone else</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.559" end="00:27:48.649" style="s2">comes on board that doesn&#39;t know us and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.360" end="00:27:50.269" style="s2">doesn&#39;t that&#39;s when it&#39;s like like when</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.649" end="00:27:52.070" style="s2">someone else is dying to give us their</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.269" end="00:27:53.419" style="s2">money that&#39;s the point we&#39;re like right</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.070" end="00:27:55.940" style="s2">there&#39;s enough of us who want to be able</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.419" end="00:27:59.809" style="s2">to generate or when we have something we</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.940" end="00:28:01.970" style="s2">have to pay for right um yeah I guess</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.809" end="00:28:05.509" style="s2">the Troy something we have to pay for</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.970" end="00:28:11.019" style="s2">enough of a need because we decided that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.509" end="00:28:14.000" style="s2">the scheduling program really wasn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.019" end="00:28:14.300" style="s2">mean if we start using the one that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.000" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.300" end="00:28:19.220" style="s2">made it it&#39;d probably be good to just</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:22.670" style="s2">compensate him a little bit just to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.220" end="00:28:24.410" style="s2">start the process flow yeah especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.670" end="00:28:26.060" style="s2">if it costs him any if it costs him</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.410" end="00:28:29.360" style="s2">anything to run it but if he just coded</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.060" end="00:28:30.980" style="s2">it now don&#39;t this is I&#39;m not discounting</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.360" end="00:28:32.780" style="s2">Otis&#39;s work or anyone&#39;s work in any way</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.980" end="00:28:34.340" style="s2">but like I&#39;ve been doing this full-time</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.780" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">for four years where&#39;s my compensation</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.340" end="00:28:37.220" style="s2">you know what I mean like it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:38.630" style="s2">we&#39;re putting in what we want to put in</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.220" end="00:28:40.730" style="s2">and then we are gonna figure out at some</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.630" end="00:28:42.860" style="s2">point how to compensate fairly but like</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.730" end="00:28:45.170" style="s2">why that one and not a drill snack right</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.860" end="00:28:46.670" style="s2">why that one and not that like what why</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.170" end="00:28:50.120" style="s2">are we compensating this and not that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.670" end="00:28:51.920" style="s2">yeah it is what it was like I need money</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.120" end="00:28:53.870" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a different it&#39;s never</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.920" end="00:28:57.980" style="s2">gonna be it&#39;s never gonna be fair but</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.870" end="00:29:02.660" style="s2">yeah but I think to get the ball rolling</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.980" end="00:29:03.260" style="s2">you need to have you need to start</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.660" end="00:29:05.750" style="s2">somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.260" end="00:29:07.310" style="s2">so I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll like get a big</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.750" end="00:29:09.380" style="s2">enough project and we gonna say oh this</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.310" end="00:29:12.700" style="s2">is worth paying for let&#39;s do it</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.380" end="00:29:16.940" style="s2">I think that you know if if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.700" end="00:29:20.330" style="s2">spending time doing this then you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.940" end="00:29:22.430" style="s2">maybe we should all donate to a thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.330" end="00:29:24.800" style="s2">and disburse but just to get the ball</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.430" end="00:29:25.790" style="s2">kind of rolling cuz I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.800" end="00:29:27.680" style="s2">there&#39;s ever gonna be something big</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.790" end="00:29:30.350" style="s2">enough that if we don&#39;t start small that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.680" end="00:29:31.490" style="s2">early work yeah so there&#39;s also just</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.350" end="00:29:32.840" style="s2">start with building the community</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.490" end="00:29:35.090" style="s2">because I think that was sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.840" end="00:29:37.040" style="s2">started this part of it was what do we</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.090" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">start with and I think if you just start</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.040" end="00:29:41.450" style="s2">building your community or your audience</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:43.070" style="s2">a they&#39;ll tell you and B you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.450" end="00:29:46.250" style="s2">them so you can say like hey there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.070" end="00:29:48.440" style="s2">hundred of us now what&#39;s next and in my</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.250" end="00:29:50.660" style="s2">mind we keep money out of it I think the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.440" end="00:29:52.340" style="s2">first step for money is we&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.660" end="00:29:55.580" style="s2">paying for things that just the project</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.340" end="00:29:57.020" style="s2">means right thing like if Jonas is to</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.580" end="00:29:59.630" style="s2">like if there&#39;s actually hosting costs</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.020" end="00:30:01.850" style="s2">involved then yeah that&#39;s maybe we paid</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.630" end="00:30:03.920" style="s2">for that because we&#39;re fine with you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.850" end="00:30:05.300" style="s2">know we&#39;ve all put in time but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.920" end="00:30:08.950" style="s2">certain times are like okay if you put</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.300" end="00:30:11.480" style="s2">an actual money we&#39;ll try to you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.950" end="00:30:14.450" style="s2">buffer that a little bit yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.480" end="00:30:21.620" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of free hosting but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.450" end="00:30:23.050" style="s2">such low volume I mean you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.620" end="00:30:25.850" style="s2">paying</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.050" end="00:30:28.110" style="s2">it&#39;s nothing for this project but even</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.850" end="00:30:31.410" style="s2">my small sites actually most of</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.110" end="00:30:35.010" style="s2">free but yeah I mean I guess we should</p>

<p begin="00:31:28.679" end="00:31:32.280" style="s2">it&#39;s from what I understand it&#39;s not my</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.210" end="00:31:33.929" style="s2">project but it&#39;s more hey let&#39;s figure</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.280" end="00:31:35.940" style="s2">out politics we want to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.929" end="00:31:39.419" style="s2">politics and people put money towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.940" end="00:31:40.860" style="s2">that common goal and then together we do</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.419" end="00:31:42.090" style="s2">a bit of governance on like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.860" end="00:31:43.590" style="s2">there&#39;s a board of directors we decide</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.090" end="00:31:45.419" style="s2">on this but anyone has put money in</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.590" end="00:31:46.320" style="s2">could theoretically take over right</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.419" end="00:31:48.270" style="s2">because they could say hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.320" end="00:31:49.500" style="s2">you&#39;re doing it wrong we&#39;re so you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.270" end="00:31:50.640" style="s2">conserve the campaign and then the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.500" end="00:31:52.980" style="s2">people who are putting the money in and</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.640" end="00:31:54.600" style="s2">get involved can actually chipped it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.980" end="00:31:56.429" style="s2">change it and so that&#39;s very exciting to</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.600" end="00:31:59.640" style="s2">me because that&#39;s like yes it exists</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.429" end="00:32:01.260" style="s2">that sounds really cool so it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.640" end="00:32:02.970" style="s2">like there&#39;s a way to also get money</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.260" end="00:32:04.230" style="s2">from that but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.970" end="00:32:05.520" style="s2">within our alignment because then we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.230" end="00:32:07.169" style="s2">have to like pass it we&#39;d have to pass</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.520" end="00:32:11.160" style="s2">off control of the people oh wait that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.169" end="00:32:12.720" style="s2">what we want so oh wait right we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.160" end="00:32:14.220" style="s2">people right now and then for something</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.720" end="00:32:16.200" style="s2">like that though then it could be hey no</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.220" end="00:32:17.850" style="s2">we&#39;re putting ten dollars a month in so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.200" end="00:32:19.260" style="s2">we&#39;re the ones and then as people come</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.850" end="00:32:21.450" style="s2">on board and they&#39;re willing to put in</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.260" end="00:32:23.100" style="s2">the money then they get a say right they</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.450" end="00:32:25.470" style="s2">get a say in what does this matter</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.100" end="00:32:26.520" style="s2">project was like what does this and so I</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.470" end="00:32:27.419" style="s2">don&#39;t know he&#39;s gonna put me in touch</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.520" end="00:32:31.530" style="s2">with the person I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.419" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">solution raising works with that and or</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.530" end="00:32:35.100" style="s2">together tech but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:37.710" style="s2">something we could put on common when it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.100" end="00:32:39.660" style="s2">first comes out that is so is that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.710" end="00:32:41.280" style="s2">is that the mystery project that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.660" end="00:32:41.940" style="s2">someone&#39;s building in game B or is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.280" end="00:32:46.260" style="s2">outside of</p>

<p begin="00:33:06.960" end="00:33:09.870" style="s2">think was the one it was and we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.340" end="00:33:11.400" style="s2">oh we&#39;re doing this one and then someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.870" end="00:33:13.980" style="s2">goes oh well there&#39;s someone building</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.400" end="00:33:20.040" style="s2">this that&#39;s in game B and I&#39;m like are</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.980" end="00:33:22.110" style="s2">they gonna tell anyone yes I just worry</p>

<p begin="00:33:22.110" end="00:33:28.040" style="s2">else yeah no no it&#39;s it&#39;s not in game B</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.720" end="00:33:30.570" style="s2">it&#39;s specifically it&#39;s someone with it</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.040" end="00:33:34.140" style="s2">well that&#39;s interesting yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.570" end="00:33:38.100" style="s2">yeah that Dow stuff is all that flavors</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.140" end="00:33:38.940" style="s2">is kind of what other techniques so</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.100" end="00:33:41.400" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.940" end="00:33:42.990" style="s2">but time gets into the difference</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.400" end="00:33:44.130" style="s2">between hollow chain and Dow stock at</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.990" end="00:33:45.360" style="s2">the beginning when I asked him and he</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.130" end="00:33:48.360" style="s2">seemed to seem think it was very</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.360" end="00:33:50.970" style="s2">concrete I have no way understand it did</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.360" end="00:33:52.290" style="s2">you watch it Shiloh did you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.970" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">understand it either the difference in</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.290" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">Apollo chickens out stock after watching</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:34:00.870" style="s2">it I feel like I do and I don&#39;t think he</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.590" style="s2">described it very well oh okay fair</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.870" end="00:34:03.090" style="s2">enough fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.590" end="00:34:04.800" style="s2">I was like it was describing it over my</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.090" end="00:34:05.970" style="s2">head anyway I was like well they&#39;re I</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.800" end="00:34:07.050" style="s2">don&#39;t even know how it like it was like</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.970" end="00:34:08.100" style="s2">he would couldn&#39;t even explain the</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.050" end="00:34:09.900" style="s2">difference because they were so</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.100" end="00:34:11.520" style="s2">different it&#39;s how I was getting what he</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.900" end="00:34:13.440" style="s2">was saying it was like in my head down</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:17.130" style="s2">the same there like an umbrella project</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.440" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">of projects once blockchain and once not</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.130" end="00:34:21.000" style="s2">and it&#39;s like and they&#39;re both very</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:22.560" style="s2">techy and I don&#39;t care whatever so but</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.000" end="00:34:26.390" style="s2">I&#39;m excited by the comment that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.560" end="00:34:26.390" style="s2">going to exist and that we can use head</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:30.270" style="s2">anything that&#39;s decentralized and helps</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.770" end="00:34:32.190" style="s2">us work together more effectively which</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.270" end="00:34:33.450" style="s2">is what the data stack is concentrating</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.190" end="00:34:34.950" style="s2">on is more of kind of what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.450" end="00:34:39.780" style="s2">but behind the scenes not live on</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.950" end="00:34:40.950" style="s2">YouTube and actually doing it like</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.780" end="00:34:45.690" style="s2">actually making the things which you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.950" end="00:34:48.450" style="s2">both are how many conversations which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.690" end="00:34:50.130" style="s2">a thing you know it sounds interesting</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.450" end="00:34:52.020" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t use like it for any of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.130" end="00:34:53.520" style="s2">main projects now because I&#39;d want to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.020" end="00:34:54.960" style="s2">see you know what it does and how it</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.520" end="00:34:55.500" style="s2">works and how it actually behaves but</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.960" end="00:34:58.890" style="s2">super cool</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.500" end="00:35:01.050" style="s2">idea I would absolutely use it for a</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.890" end="00:35:03.150" style="s2">solution raising like what&#39;s the worst</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.050" end="00:35:05.610" style="s2">they take over the education project and</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.150" end="00:35:06.870" style="s2">make it and it&#39;s exactly yeah I guess my</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.610" end="00:35:10.050" style="s2">point is I would use it for any like</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.870" end="00:35:11.540" style="s2">projects that are established and taking</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.050" end="00:35:13.740" style="s2">over wiki election but I&#39;m like no I</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.540" end="00:35:16.230" style="s2">probably wouldn&#39;t for solution reason</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.740" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">itself but for a solution Rosie</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.230" end="00:35:19.980" style="s2">yes well yeah if it starts there and</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.860" style="s2">evolves there then do whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.980" end="00:35:25.650" style="s2">with it yeah I need to dig a little</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.860" end="00:35:29.160" style="s2">deeper because reason score would be a</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.650" end="00:35:31.290" style="s2">potential tool within you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.160" end="00:35:34.230" style="s2">governance tool it&#39;s one of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.290" end="00:35:40.530" style="s2">it&#39;s not a solve all solution but</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.230" end="00:35:41.730" style="s2">there&#39;s one small piece excited that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.530" end="00:35:43.050" style="s2">get to come in contact with these</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.730" end="00:35:44.820" style="s2">projects even if I can&#39;t keep them</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.050" end="00:35:47.490" style="s2">straight in my head these amazing things</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.820" end="00:35:49.010" style="s2">they could in what exists put so much</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.490" end="00:35:51.960" style="s2">easier could be your guys&#39;s projects</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.010" end="00:35:54.060" style="s2">somewhat separated cuz I had I know you</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.960" end="00:35:55.950" style="s2">guys that I know yeah yeah you get to</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.060" end="00:35:59.700" style="s2">hear about them in bits over time so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.950" end="00:36:01.230" style="s2">just keeps reinforcing it yes even then</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.700" end="00:36:03.810" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t want to like explain it like</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.230" end="00:36:05.580" style="s2">I was trying to get Chantal our cousin</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.810" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">in touch with with Susan and it was like</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.580" end="00:36:09.480" style="s2">what do I tell her about your project</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:12.600" style="s2">though like I need I need the words like</p>

<p begin="00:37:45.590" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like considering we only have like</p>

<p begin="00:39:02.609" end="00:39:08.130" style="s2">need to kind of fill out to support yeah</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.849" end="00:39:09.270" style="s2">and by all me if there&#39;s any fields that</p>

<p begin="00:39:40.589" end="00:39:44.010" style="s2">helps show like okay here&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.150" end="00:39:48.990" style="s2">looks like with multiple projects not</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.010" end="00:39:50.970" style="s2">everyone has to do everything cool so</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.990" end="00:39:53.099" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s still good and that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.970" end="00:39:55.319" style="s2">both sides that&#39;s the like roles that</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.099" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">you already have and then roles that you</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.319" end="00:39:59.880" style="s2">need you need help with both cons are</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:01.560" style="s2">probably good that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.880" end="00:40:04.770" style="s2">questions I just added the idea cafe as</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.560" end="00:40:06.119" style="s2">well like what outside role would have</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.770" end="00:40:08.700" style="s2">the most impact if they really come on</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.119" end="00:40:10.200" style="s2">right like I need a longer advertise or</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.700" end="00:40:14.910" style="s2">whatever that I can&#39;t even articulate</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.200" end="00:40:16.650" style="s2">that particular diverge another question</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.910" end="00:40:19.319" style="s2">I have but it&#39;s something like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.650" end="00:40:20.819" style="s2">what are the categories of help that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.319" end="00:40:22.470" style="s2">think both that we need and that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.819" end="00:40:24.240" style="s2">think other projects might need right</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.470" end="00:40:26.069" style="s2">because it&#39;s like I just got a really</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.240" end="00:40:27.030" style="s2">vague thing for like marketing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.069" end="00:40:30.030" style="s2">like yeah but that could be a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.030" end="00:40:32.130" style="s2">two different roles how how do we want</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.030" end="00:40:33.960" style="s2">to categorize it which is true for like</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.130" end="00:40:35.940" style="s2">how do we want to categorize people that</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.960" end="00:40:38.339" style="s2">have projects that we need that we need</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.940" end="00:40:40.200" style="s2">help with but kind of more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.339" end="00:40:42.119" style="s2">how do we think volunteers are gonna be</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.200" end="00:40:44.400" style="s2">looking at the lists and wanting it</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.119" end="00:40:46.200" style="s2">categorized for sort of what they can do</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.400" end="00:40:48.390" style="s2">and how they can help so they can just</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.200" end="00:40:52.050" style="s2">zero down and that I can do these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.390" end="00:40:54.859" style="s2">show me what what I can help with so the</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.050" end="00:40:58.950" style="s2">way I&#39;ve been thinking about doing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.859" end="00:41:00.540" style="s2">is is not as opposed to having roles and</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.950" end="00:41:03.580" style="s2">stuff like that it&#39;s really well I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.540" end="00:41:06.890" style="s2">or a role would be</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.580" end="00:41:12.190" style="s2">in my mind either a skill set that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.890" end="00:41:15.260" style="s2">needed for a thing or a or an actual</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.190" end="00:41:17.750" style="s2">task that you do so you&#39;re responsible</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.260" end="00:41:20.450" style="s2">for doing X so I would almost want it to</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.750" end="00:41:22.610" style="s2">be a just a group of tags that I put on</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.450" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">so I might label it like community</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.610" end="00:41:26.030" style="s2">manager but that doesn&#39;t mean anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:27.920" style="s2">like even software device it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.030" end="00:41:29.960" style="s2">mean anything so it really needs to be a</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.920" end="00:41:31.850" style="s2">lot more specific like for software</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.960" end="00:41:33.320" style="s2">developer you&#39;d list the actual tech you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.850" end="00:41:34.370" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say software developer you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.320" end="00:41:36.470" style="s2">what I mean right</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.370" end="00:41:38.690" style="s2">okay because are you talking about kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.470" end="00:41:40.280" style="s2">of like a long text area look like just</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.690" end="00:41:41.540" style="s2">where where you could almost like at</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.280" end="00:41:43.400" style="s2">least to start with have like a bulleted</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.540" end="00:41:45.650" style="s2">list appears the five to ten things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.400" end="00:41:49.130" style="s2">this role would need to do actual you</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.650" end="00:41:50.750" style="s2">know for a marketing person you know put</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.130" end="00:41:52.970" style="s2">like post on social media once a week</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.750" end="00:41:54.860" style="s2">and you know find out articles and try</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.970" end="00:41:56.900" style="s2">to establish a relationship like those</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.860" end="00:41:59.630" style="s2">sort of actual things they go under the</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.900" end="00:42:01.700" style="s2">umbrella of the bigger like how you find</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.630" end="00:42:03.590" style="s2">it group yeah it would be nice though if</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.700" end="00:42:05.000" style="s2">they were actual tags and then you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.590" end="00:42:07.580" style="s2">search by tags I don&#39;t know if neck</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.000" end="00:42:09.380" style="s2">openness and tagging I think I think she</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.580" end="00:42:11.210" style="s2">means so like if somebody thought that</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.380" end="00:42:13.460" style="s2">for example they can code in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.210" end="00:42:14.570" style="s2">teams you know in a certain language you</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.460" end="00:42:16.760" style="s2">might have a tag that says not just</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.570" end="00:42:19.460" style="s2">coder but a coder like in c-sharp or in</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.760" end="00:42:20.240" style="s2">whatever and then I can look for coding</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.460" end="00:42:21.470" style="s2">in C sharp</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.240" end="00:42:24.020" style="s2">oh there&#39;s two projects that help with</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.470" end="00:42:26.900" style="s2">that cool I can do that yeah like if</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.020" end="00:42:31.940" style="s2">you&#39;re a you know if if I&#39;m running a</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.900" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">team of people there might be there</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.940" end="00:42:36.110" style="s2">might be some tasks that we trade back</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:39.680" style="s2">and forth and it&#39;s nicer if if you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.110" end="00:42:41.750" style="s2">that your job role is is these 50 roles</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.680" end="00:42:43.610" style="s2">which are kind of tasks and skill set</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.750" end="00:42:44.990" style="s2">right and responsibility it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.610" end="00:42:46.580" style="s2">like responsibilities what are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.990" end="00:42:48.590" style="s2">individual responsibilities that make</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.580" end="00:42:50.510" style="s2">right that that person takes on but</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.590" end="00:42:52.750" style="s2">really I don&#39;t think of it as a role</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.510" end="00:42:55.610" style="s2">like like would traditionally say</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.750" end="00:42:57.470" style="s2">software developer manager it&#39;s like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.610" end="00:42:59.480" style="s2">the manager that does these 50 things</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.470" end="00:43:00.770" style="s2">right and then you can move the role</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.480" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">from person to person</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.770" end="00:43:05.000" style="s2">you know as I got it from so it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:07.400" style="s2">about the individual things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.000" end="00:43:09.470" style="s2">doing to try and get as possible which I</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.400" end="00:43:11.720" style="s2">totally agree with you not sure how we</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.470" end="00:43:13.820" style="s2">do that in act just yet so that might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.720" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">a future thing but I totally agree that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.820" end="00:43:16.940" style="s2">that would be awesome to get sort of as</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.700" style="s2">detailed as possible</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.940" end="00:43:20.900" style="s2">and I think you probably still need some</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.700" end="00:43:22.520" style="s2">kind of a higher level categorization</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.900" end="00:43:24.440" style="s2">just to be able to help people drill</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.520" end="00:43:26.810" style="s2">down yeah like to maybe start with</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.440" end="00:43:28.670" style="s2">developer and then it further breaks</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.810" end="00:43:29.900" style="s2">down and a further you know gets even</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.670" end="00:43:32.270" style="s2">more specialized into like what</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.900" end="00:43:36.680" style="s2">languages and environments and yeah it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.270" end="00:43:40.040" style="s2">be nice if it had a yeah hierarchy what</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.680" end="00:43:41.960" style="s2">do they call that nomenclature our mom</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.040" end="00:43:44.840" style="s2">would like I mean terms would TP</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.960" end="00:43:46.160" style="s2">but yeah so yeah that would be that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.840" end="00:43:48.140" style="s2">would be helpful but I don&#39;t know if doc</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.160" end="00:43:52.850" style="s2">has that feature it&#39;s very few systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.140" end="00:43:55.910" style="s2">that do I mean yeah well this is the</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.850" end="00:43:57.170" style="s2">meta project group so this is I guess</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.910" end="00:43:58.970" style="s2">the board meeting for what we&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.170" end="00:44:03.530" style="s2">together text which is the meta object</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.970" end="00:44:05.150" style="s2">ribbon and then we access the two things</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.530" end="00:44:06.680" style="s2">I just added to the agenda or what do we</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.150" end="00:44:07.970" style="s2">want the question to be next week we</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.680" end="00:44:09.440" style="s2">brainstorm some what do we want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.970" end="00:44:11.540" style="s2">actually talk about next week and I can</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.440" end="00:44:15.530" style="s2">post it and then the other question I</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.540" end="00:44:17.770" style="s2">had was um oh I&#39;m like I&#39;m a kid no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.530" end="00:44:17.770" style="s2">happy</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.360" end="00:44:23.840" style="s2">let me just go back to the agenda</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.350" end="00:44:25.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t jog my memory or means oh yes</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.840" end="00:44:27.530" style="s2">for these board meetings</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.220" end="00:44:29.090" style="s2">oh please Mahlon for these board</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.530" end="00:44:30.500" style="s2">meetings do we want to post the link for</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.090" end="00:44:33.950" style="s2">outside people to come and participate</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.500" end="00:44:36.260" style="s2">or just like idea cafes clearly but the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.950" end="00:44:38.030" style="s2">board meeting itself I am just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.260" end="00:44:41.600" style="s2">post it in the game be space right</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.030" end="00:44:42.860" style="s2">project indie projects I say yes cuz the</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.600" end="00:44:43.820" style="s2">worst happens someone shows up and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.860" end="00:44:46.360" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.820" end="00:44:48.650" style="s2">cool we let them know what&#39;s going on um</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.360" end="00:44:51.590" style="s2">but how does everyone else feel about</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.650" end="00:44:55.880" style="s2">hosting I say yes until it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.590" end="00:44:57.020" style="s2">problem is also just how stream guard</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.880" end="00:44:58.520" style="s2">works if we have to add them to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.020" end="00:44:59.900" style="s2">stream so if someone shows up and we add</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.520" end="00:45:01.070" style="s2">them in they&#39;re a jerk we can kick them</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.900" end="00:45:03.680" style="s2">in even if they keep showing up we just</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.070" end="00:45:08.590" style="s2">don&#39;t have them to the string for</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.680" end="00:45:11.870" style="s2">example so yeah on the on the next site</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.590" end="00:45:13.610" style="s2">the project rolls yeah it&#39;s just uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.870" end="00:45:15.500" style="s2">just a text box right so even just</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.610" end="00:45:18.500" style="s2">adding a text area description would</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.500" end="00:45:23.060" style="s2">probably be sufficient oh okay yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.500" end="00:45:24.620" style="s2">can do that I think there is uh I forget</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.060" end="00:45:27.950" style="s2">what I call that I call this something</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.620" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">bigger it was like I think expected full</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.950" end="00:45:31.000" style="s2">or expected</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.490" style="s2">responsibilities order something like</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.000" end="00:45:35.380" style="s2">that which i think is on the way up but</p>

<p begin="00:50:53.900" end="00:51:03.220" style="s2">everything we do is relevant like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.060" end="00:51:03.220" style="s2">it&#39;s the issue is you have fighting yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.650" end="00:51:11.270" style="s2">and then of course everyone&#39;s able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.230" end="00:51:12.859" style="s2">give feedback on how together we can</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.270" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">move forward with together tech and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.859" end="00:51:15.500" style="s2">better project like if someone else has</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:16.670" style="s2">an amazing idea on how to come together</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.500" end="00:51:18.890" style="s2">with our projects</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.670" end="00:51:21.740" style="s2">everyone&#39;s welcome to share we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.890" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">doing that at the moment because other</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.740" end="00:51:26.079" style="s2">people weren&#39;t we took on projects yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.770" end="00:51:31.880" style="s2">okay well I think we&#39;re getting close to</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.910" end="00:51:32.960" style="s2">the end of the hour unless any other one</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.880" end="00:51:35.270" style="s2">of the other things it was just when we</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.960" end="00:51:36.560" style="s2">were talking about paying yonas maybe</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.270" end="00:51:38.150" style="s2">this isn&#39;t the same for everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.560" end="00:51:41.359" style="s2">but there&#39;s a difference to me between</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.150" end="00:51:43.910" style="s2">us deciding what to make and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.359" end="00:51:47.270" style="s2">someone going out and making it versus</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.910" end="00:51:48.680" style="s2">somebody just making it because they</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.270" end="00:51:50.089" style="s2">could write like someone made the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.680" end="00:51:51.800" style="s2">schedule or he made that and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.089" end="00:51:53.180" style="s2">awesome I like donuts this thing or the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.800" end="00:51:54.290" style="s2">other one and then you don&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.180" end="00:51:56.420" style="s2">knack thing right like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.290" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">difference between we need it to be X</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.420" end="00:52:01.490" style="s2">and then paying someone to make X versus</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.640" end="00:52:04.190" style="s2">oh I could do Y so I&#39;m just gonna do why</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.490" end="00:52:06.200" style="s2">there&#39;s like it happens in the community</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.190" end="00:52:07.759" style="s2">that I&#39;m part of quite frequently we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.200" end="00:52:10.069" style="s2">like so be like</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.759" end="00:52:11.719" style="s2">all these garden boxes they took me ten</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.069" end="00:52:13.069" style="s2">hours yes but nobody wanted you I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:52:13.069" end="00:52:15.949" style="s2">you to make that right so no that</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.479" end="00:52:17.779" style="s2">doesn&#39;t count that&#39;s not your evening</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.949" end="00:52:18.229" style="s2">meal right that&#39;s not the same as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.779" end="00:52:20.089" style="s2">saint</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.229" end="00:52:23.599" style="s2">the playroom needs to be clean and</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.089" end="00:52:25.519" style="s2">someone organizing it even though under</p>

<p begin="00:52:27.799" end="00:52:33.649" style="s2">don&#39;t really get credit my boy dork has</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.519" end="00:52:35.659" style="s2">to read commissioned and agreed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.649" end="00:52:37.429" style="s2">gonna be paid ahead of time to like hey</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.659" end="00:52:39.499" style="s2">this is a clean posting we&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.429" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">pay for this thing you could do anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.499" end="00:52:43.849" style="s2">you want only this thing pays like you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:45.499" style="s2">know so I built Mac no one asked me to I</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.849" end="00:52:47.869" style="s2">just went and did it that shouldn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.499" end="00:52:48.859" style="s2">paid if suddenly there&#39;s a huge push and</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.869" end="00:52:50.539" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of work and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.859" end="00:52:52.759" style="s2">that then it might become okay to make</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.539" end="00:52:55.279" style="s2">these changes that&#39;s paid then go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.759" end="00:52:58.279" style="s2">but until the other side yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.279" end="00:52:59.959" style="s2">and if we end up using it then a lot</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.279" end="00:53:02.059" style="s2">then we could choose to pay server costs</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.959" end="00:53:03.559" style="s2">and stuff like that and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.059" end="00:53:05.269" style="s2">you know if we do need more features</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.559" end="00:53:07.519" style="s2">than it could be like well I could</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.269" end="00:53:10.009" style="s2">volunteer that or I can pay or other</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.519" end="00:53:12.589" style="s2">ones and it should all be open source so</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.009" end="00:53:15.139" style="s2">if something happens to you we can all</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.589" end="00:53:16.729" style="s2">jump in and someone else can add</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.139" end="00:53:20.599" style="s2">features right I guess yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.729" end="00:53:22.249" style="s2">theoretically we can also if we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.599" end="00:53:25.849" style="s2">like just features done like that but we</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.249" end="00:53:27.829" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to have a central thing we</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.849" end="00:53:29.719" style="s2">could still just put it up on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.829" end="00:53:32.329" style="s2">called bounty source for our feature and</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.719" end="00:53:34.009" style="s2">that you know whoever wants to do it can</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.329" end="00:53:37.279" style="s2">do it and then everyone can go and</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.009" end="00:53:44.359" style="s2">contribute to bounty source for it so we</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.279" end="00:53:47.089" style="s2">do have options and I think somebody</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.359" end="00:53:48.829" style="s2">said in previous meetings like I would</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.089" end="00:53:50.689" style="s2">imagine especially for for more things</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.829" end="00:53:54.079" style="s2">right now we would start off sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.689" end="00:53:55.579" style="s2">long thing slash expecting a volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.079" end="00:53:58.339" style="s2">because we don&#39;t have any money right</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.579" end="00:54:00.289" style="s2">now and then that&#39;s sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.339" end="00:54:02.299" style="s2">until we say otherwise all the work is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.289" end="00:54:03.949" style="s2">just assuming to be volunteer once we</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.299" end="00:54:06.109" style="s2">can actually start offering bounties or</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.949" end="00:54:08.389" style="s2">commissions or whatever then we&#39;ll wall</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.109" end="00:54:09.919" style="s2">me that clear hey this one area is where</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.389" end="00:54:11.359" style="s2">you go to see that only the things that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.919" end="00:54:16.279" style="s2">are listed only how they&#39;re listed</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.359" end="00:54:18.079" style="s2">that&#39;s how you get paid like I said this</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.279" end="00:54:19.489" style="s2">difference in commissioning it there is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.079" end="00:54:20.910" style="s2">I think a certain amount like there</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.489" end="00:54:22.589" style="s2">might be something that someone</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.910" end="00:54:24.450" style="s2">able to do right we have time right now</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.589" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">they have the skill they can make it and</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.450" end="00:54:29.339" style="s2">we could even commission I didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:31.769" style="s2">stayed in the future right like hey this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.339" end="00:54:34.829" style="s2">is valuable if we had $10,000 would love</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.769" end="00:54:37.500" style="s2">to pay you $10,000 but we don&#39;t so how</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.829" end="00:54:39.269" style="s2">about 20,000 in the future right which</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.500" end="00:54:40.980" style="s2">is what is the future mean well when we</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.269" end="00:54:42.930" style="s2">not our first 20,000 right when we get</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.980" end="00:54:45.480" style="s2">200,000 you get to your 20,000 or</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.930" end="00:54:47.880" style="s2">whatever that looks like that it can be</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.480" end="00:54:49.970" style="s2">an actual commission but also because I</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.880" end="00:54:51.990" style="s2">don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s gonna volunteer to</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.970" end="00:54:54.210" style="s2">volunteer its gonna volunteer to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.990" end="00:54:55.890" style="s2">paid in the future when they don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.210" end="00:54:57.720" style="s2">the project right when they don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.890" end="00:54:59.279" style="s2">that that&#39;s gonna happen so it&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.720" end="00:55:01.289" style="s2">your volunteer you because you might</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.279" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">never see this but also we&#39;re paying you</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.289" end="00:55:04.079" style="s2">double we&#39;re paying you like what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:05.640" style="s2">worth because we understand there&#39;s risk</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.079" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">involved and not getting mattered you</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.640" end="00:55:08.910" style="s2">know those those kind of things that</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:10.109" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s only because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.910" end="00:55:12.900" style="s2">have money so we&#39;re not gonna pay you</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.109" end="00:55:14.369" style="s2">but future lis we will probably have</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.900" end="00:55:18.059" style="s2">money and what you&#39;re doing is worth is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.369" end="00:55:19.710" style="s2">worth it but I would love to first look</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.059" end="00:55:21.569" style="s2">for volunteers right together Tech&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.710" end="00:55:23.819" style="s2">bottom line how we help compete the</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.569" end="00:55:26.009" style="s2">current tech is that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.819" end="00:55:30.900" style="s2">have ingenuity in the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.009" end="00:55:32.220" style="s2">volunteer and do that and the skill and</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.900" end="00:55:32.789" style="s2">then when we don&#39;t have that we pay oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.220" end="00:55:35.519" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.789" end="00:55:37.140" style="s2">all right I don&#39;t have any closing</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.519" end="00:55:38.910" style="s2">comments before we say goodbye till</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.140" end="00:55:43.230" style="s2">tomorrow Fridays is always weird can see</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.910" end="00:55:47.039" style="s2">each other the next day but maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.230" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">not a good time no five minutes that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.039" end="00:55:54.630" style="s2">question I&#39;ve been trying to just absorb</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:56.670" style="s2">whatever I can and I guess I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.630" end="00:56:00.390" style="s2">little bit confused together Tech and</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.670" end="00:56:03.660" style="s2">the med project what is the meta project</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.390" end="00:56:05.609" style="s2">for together tech is there that still</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.660" end="00:56:07.410" style="s2">just open-ended right now is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.609" end="00:56:15.539" style="s2">something that we all could collaborate</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.410" end="00:56:18.930" style="s2">on one meta project or is that not so</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.539" end="00:56:22.200" style="s2">together tech theoretically is the meta</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.930" end="00:56:23.849" style="s2">project the idea being that the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.200" end="00:56:25.650" style="s2">tech is the tech cooperative that we all</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.849" end="00:56:27.539" style="s2">we all own together and operate together</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.650" end="00:56:29.640" style="s2">what does that look like well in my</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.539" end="00:56:30.990" style="s2">vision a year ago it looks like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.640" end="00:56:32.069" style="s2">users owning it and that&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.990" end="00:56:33.660" style="s2">together and figuring out what most</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.069" end="00:56:34.590" style="s2">empowers our lives we got involved in</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.660" end="00:56:36.330" style="s2">game B</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.590" end="00:56:38.280" style="s2">then ever people actually got involved</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.330" end="00:56:40.560" style="s2">it turns out everyone has a project</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.280" end="00:56:42.960" style="s2">everyone has their baby and so it made</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.560" end="00:56:45.060" style="s2">more sense to find out how can we create</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.960" end="00:56:46.890" style="s2">omnimon solutions for our projects</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.060" end="00:56:48.840" style="s2">instead of just for the people and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.890" end="00:56:52.110" style="s2">now we&#39;re focusing on what does it look</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.840" end="00:56:53.640" style="s2">like to be part of solution raising part</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.110" end="00:56:56.610" style="s2">of we collection part of reason score</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.640" end="00:56:58.740" style="s2">and how can we facilitate our common</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.610" end="00:56:59.790" style="s2">problems together right everyone gotta</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.740" end="00:57:01.650" style="s2">figure out marketing and everyone has to</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.790" end="00:57:05.150" style="s2">figure out funding and trust how do we</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.650" end="00:57:09.440" style="s2">do that well we&#39;re my kids calling me</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.150" end="00:57:11.790" style="s2">from the other room well I&#39;m - camera Oh</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.440" end="00:57:13.080" style="s2">how do we facilitate the undoing</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.790" end="00:57:15.180" style="s2">solutions and so that&#39;s the matter</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.080" end="00:57:16.770" style="s2">project it&#39;s name together tech it might</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.180" end="00:57:18.750" style="s2">you know the end of game B takes it over</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.770" end="00:57:21.000" style="s2">I change the name but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.750" end="00:57:22.860" style="s2">does that make more more sense we</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.000" end="00:57:27.450" style="s2">interchange that a project and together</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.860" end="00:57:29.700" style="s2">tag it yeah it isn&#39;t a specific thing it</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.450" end="00:57:30.990" style="s2">is the umbrella of how do we create Omni</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.700" end="00:57:33.030" style="s2">win solutions together within our</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.990" end="00:57:35.310" style="s2">current capacity financially skill wise</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.030" end="00:57:38.490" style="s2">all of that that&#39;s currently like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.310" end="00:57:40.320" style="s2">nack project list and the scheduling and</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.490" end="00:57:41.760" style="s2">all of these things that were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.320" end="00:57:43.410" style="s2">done under the ability to gather tech of</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.760" end="00:57:44.490" style="s2">hey yes there&#39;s a need for that and</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.410" end="00:57:47.550" style="s2">someone went out and made it</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.490" end="00:57:51.330" style="s2">they just weren&#39;t Commission like that</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.550" end="00:57:55.200" style="s2">does that make sense I love it yeah kind</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.330" end="00:57:57.120" style="s2">of like it started out we just called it</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.200" end="00:58:00.090" style="s2">the meta project but before it really</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.120" end="00:58:01.290" style="s2">was anything and then then jublee</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.090" end="00:58:02.430" style="s2">already had a project called together</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.290" end="00:58:05.490" style="s2">tech that we&#39;re like you know I should</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.430" end="00:58:07.260" style="s2">steal that name and then it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.490" end="00:58:08.750" style="s2">game B projects and Facebook because</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.260" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of a part of the game B</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.750" end="00:58:13.380" style="s2">community like even if you look in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:15.630" style="s2">URL it&#39;s actually got together techie in</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.380" end="00:58:17.160" style="s2">the URL so like all three of them are</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.630" end="00:58:21.000" style="s2">kind of the same thing that I&#39;ve evolved</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.160" end="00:58:23.640" style="s2">to be that I was trying to like just for</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.000" end="00:58:25.890" style="s2">myself figure out like what is together</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.640" end="00:58:29.130" style="s2">tech like how would I describe it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.890" end="00:58:31.760" style="s2">someone and the list that I had was like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.130" end="00:58:34.560" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of one of its main purposes is</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.760" end="00:58:36.600" style="s2">to come up with those best practices for</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.560" end="00:58:37.890" style="s2">Omni one projects and it might you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.600" end="00:58:39.240" style="s2">it might not be suitable for all of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.890" end="00:58:40.830" style="s2">it might be like here&#39;s what tech looks</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.240" end="00:58:42.150" style="s2">like here&#39;s what like if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.830" end="00:58:44.850" style="s2">farming as a part of an omni moon</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.150" end="00:58:46.620" style="s2">project here&#39;s what we&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.850" end="00:58:48.360" style="s2">I think it&#39;ll end up being like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.620" end="00:58:50.100" style="s2">network of Omni wind projects</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.360" end="00:58:52.560" style="s2">and then it&#39;s meant to itself act like</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.100" end="00:58:54.180" style="s2">an omni wind project so we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.560" end="00:58:57.210" style="s2">test out some of the tools and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.180" end="00:59:01.020" style="s2">strategies that were we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.210" end="00:59:04.740" style="s2">that that&#39;s what it is to me I know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.020" end="00:59:06.270" style="s2">helps so Steve had a good question what</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.740" end="00:59:10.980" style="s2">does it look like to be part of KB</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.270" end="00:59:12.390" style="s2">together the tech meditech so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.980" end="00:59:15.630" style="s2">together the tech medtech are pretty</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.390" end="00:59:16.950" style="s2">much the same bet meta meta project and</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.630" end="00:59:26.100" style="s2">together the tech are pretty much the</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.950" end="00:59:28.320" style="s2">same thing I mean yeah so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.100" end="00:59:28.740" style="s2">practicing game B by building technology</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.320" end="00:59:30.540" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.740" end="00:59:32.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a meta project because the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.540" end="00:59:35.220" style="s2">project is to help other projects do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.400" end="00:59:38.850" style="s2">so better project is what it is the name</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.220" end="00:59:41.360" style="s2">is together TAC and all this fluctuates</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.850" end="00:59:44.550" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.360" end="00:59:47.040" style="s2">but yeah participation in in together</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.550" end="00:59:50.700" style="s2">tech and and the meta project is just</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.040" end="00:59:52.710" style="s2">coming to this meeting saying what we</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.700" end="00:59:53.220" style="s2">want to do together and figuring out how</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.710" end="01:00:00.270" style="s2">to do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.220" end="01:00:02.150" style="s2">so you are all here by participants like</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.270" end="01:00:05.430" style="s2">do you want to be in it you&#39;re in it</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.150" end="01:00:06.870" style="s2">attendee I don&#39;t want to be in it</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.430" end="01:00:09.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s it and then we build it</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.870" end="01:00:10.620" style="s2">together I mean so you know we were</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.330" end="01:00:12.060" style="s2">starting to do some stuff but then we</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.620" end="01:00:13.350" style="s2">kind of thought well we need more people</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.060" end="01:00:16.050" style="s2">because we&#39;re just kind of like building</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.350" end="01:00:20.010" style="s2">castles in the sky so whatever y&#39;all</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.050" end="01:00:21.960" style="s2">wants to do together to make the world a</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.010" end="01:00:25.230" style="s2">better place a little bit through</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.960" end="01:00:27.480" style="s2">technology just show up and tell us what</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.230" end="01:00:29.730" style="s2">you want figure it out together is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.480" end="01:00:32.460" style="s2">right yeah I think between the three of</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.730" end="01:00:35.940" style="s2">us that&#39;s a pretty rural there&#39;s a yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.460" end="01:00:38.850" style="s2">that those three enemies all right is</p>
