<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">bigger picture</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.280" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">and hope it&#39;ll lead to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:26.320" style="s2">solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:28.240" style="s2">and a lot of helping each other out and</p>

<p begin="00:05:32.639" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">even sure that people would be at</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.919" end="00:05:37.280" style="s2">most people would be adding in data just</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:40.080" style="s2">because it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.280" end="00:05:41.680" style="s2">it&#39;s more i think people want it to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.080" end="00:05:43.600" style="s2">mostly be</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.680" end="00:05:45.759" style="s2">done by experts and then they would come</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.600" end="00:05:48.000" style="s2">in and add their two cents</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.759" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">so i&#39;m think considering hiring someone</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.000" end="00:05:51.520" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">some kind of internet research and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.520" end="00:05:56.160" style="s2">hold my hand while we</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:57.199" style="s2">enter some data into the system and see</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.160" end="00:06:00.800" style="s2">how it works</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.199" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">i still think the process is good but</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.800" end="00:06:06.240" style="s2">it just made it&#39;s so thought intensive</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:07.759" style="s2">uh once you i think reading it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.240" end="00:06:09.680" style="s2">but writing is hard</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.759" end="00:06:10.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of like writing a a book</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.680" end="00:06:12.479" style="s2">you know it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.880" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">it can take some people up to a year to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.479" end="00:06:19.120" style="s2">write a book but it only takes you</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:21.280" style="s2">10 hours to read or whatever um</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.120" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">and then i was also kind of inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.280" end="00:06:26.479" style="s2">our talks about</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:29.440" style="s2">um uh systems where people can</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.479" end="00:06:31.120" style="s2">rate and review and kind of choose</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.440" end="00:06:34.000" style="s2">things based on that so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.120" end="00:06:35.280" style="s2">encompasses food and politics and</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.000" end="00:06:37.600" style="s2">software</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.280" end="00:06:39.360" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been thinking about a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.600" end="00:06:41.759" style="s2">core open source software that would</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.360" end="00:06:44.560" style="s2">facilitate all those use cases</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.759" end="00:06:46.080" style="s2">that would be kind of a no code easy</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.560" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">startup</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.080" end="00:06:52.880" style="s2">easy thing to start maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">also building tools that are</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.880" end="00:06:56.960" style="s2">kind of like no code but jubilee has</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:57.919" style="s2">kind of talked to the past on how</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.960" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">you know it&#39;s great that there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.919" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">this open source software but unless you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:04.000" style="s2">have a programmer you obviously</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:05.759" style="s2">often can&#39;t start it and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.000" end="00:07:07.759" style="s2">couple tools nowadays where you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.759" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">actually click a button it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.759" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">load it up to a host of your choice</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:15.039" style="s2">and then you just have to pay that host</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">for hosting costs and then you can adapt</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.039" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">but a lot of those are very house</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:22.639" style="s2">specific so i&#39;m trying to make a generic</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">one that&#39;ll work in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.639" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">you know where you can do it with a</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">small hosting company or</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">with amazon or microsoft or whoever you</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">want</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.639" end="00:07:35.840" style="s2">so i&#39;ve been writing up documentation on</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.639" end="00:07:37.680" style="s2">what i think to do that</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.840" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">and then maybe we&#39;ll have meeting next</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.680" end="00:07:40.880" style="s2">friday to go through the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.319" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">with voting with your wallet sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.960" end="00:07:48.240" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:50.080" style="s2">which is just one aspect i need to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.240" end="00:07:53.440" style="s2">careful i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.080" end="00:07:57.039" style="s2">try and change what anyone&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.440" end="00:07:58.319" style="s2">do by trying to generalize it too much</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.039" end="00:08:00.319" style="s2">uh yeah so i&#39;ve been kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.319" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">through that process and i&#39;ve been kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.319" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to think i might want to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:08.160" style="s2">a part-time job because</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">um i&#39;m kind of losing steam on all my</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.160" end="00:08:12.720" style="s2">projects and i think it&#39;d be nice to</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">have someone hand me some work i could</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.720" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">do for a little while rather than</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:19.520" style="s2">having to every day figure out what i</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">need to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.520" end="00:08:24.720" style="s2">and make a little cash and extend this</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:26.479" style="s2">experiment but i don&#39;t know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.720" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">i&#39;ve been thinking</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:29.440" style="s2">so i guess it didn&#39;t really say what</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:30.479" style="s2">reason score does and i don&#39;t know if we</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.440" end="00:08:32.880" style="s2">all kind of did that</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.479" end="00:08:34.000" style="s2">but um that&#39;s a it&#39;s a mass agreement</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.880" end="00:08:36.159" style="s2">tool so it helps</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.000" end="00:08:37.120" style="s2">people find agreement on contentious</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.159" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">issues through</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.120" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">evidence and reason</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">um so yeah that&#39;s it for me i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:47.360" style="s2">thinking maybe when we do this in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:50.640" style="s2">future maybe we could just</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:52.000" style="s2">decide to go clockwise from the top um</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.640" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">because i think we&#39;re all in the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.000" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">position we have jubilee at the top</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">adriel and then kerry and then me does</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.000" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:00.959" style="s2">see that same clockwise from the top</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.000" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.959" end="00:09:04.959" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re under me right bentley yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">yeah the other problem is i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.959" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">if i if i point this way i&#39;m pointing at</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">carrie aren&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.160" end="00:09:13.760" style="s2">no you&#39;ve got a point this way oh okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.200" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.760" end="00:09:17.360" style="s2">right because of the because of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">camera i tried to mirror it but i forgot</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.360" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">oh yeah you&#39;re right okay so she&#39;s over</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:23.839" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.720" end="00:09:30.080" style="s2">it&#39;s always fun to play with the mirrors</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:31.360" style="s2">on this one that was one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.080" end="00:09:35.120" style="s2">that ended up with that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.360" end="00:09:36.000" style="s2">point adrian but not for anyone else but</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.120" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">this one it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.000" end="00:09:40.720" style="s2">yeah okay it is it is um not mirrored</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">for me and some of the tools</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.720" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">the mirror yours so it looks less weird</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">but then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">angles get off um</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:53.680" style="s2">yeah yeah so um i don&#39;t know if i</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:09:55.519" style="s2">have anything for the hot seat i mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.680" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">i&#39;d like to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.519" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">that that uh surveying tool the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:04.800" style="s2">but i don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">design it too much without the other</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.800" end="00:10:09.519" style="s2">participants</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">but yeah and when you say surveying</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.519" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">tools that the vote was your wallet</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.120" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.680" end="00:10:18.240" style="s2">oh it just muted you yeah community</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.880" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">review okay</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.240" end="00:10:22.560" style="s2">community rating ratings probably a</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:26.079" style="s2">better word</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.560" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">okay yeah i&#39;m okay with uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.079" end="00:10:29.680" style="s2">and i think we can sort of talk about</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:31.279" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.680" end="00:10:32.959" style="s2">we have a level of talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.279" end="00:10:35.680" style="s2">that affects all of our projects</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.959" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">and then there will be a level on on</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.680" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">friday</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">where it&#39;s about a specific project and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">we can sort of talk about what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.079" style="s2">yeah but i mean i think yeah there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:47.200" style="s2">many projects about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.079" end="00:10:49.040" style="s2">sort of community review and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.200" end="00:10:50.880" style="s2">definitely core part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.040" end="00:10:53.760" style="s2">wikilection and so it might be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.880" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">like if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.760" end="00:10:57.360" style="s2">building sort of like a tool that could</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:10:58.720" style="s2">work for multiple things</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.360" end="00:11:00.720" style="s2">in theory we could just say hey what</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.720" end="00:11:02.399" style="s2">would you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.720" end="00:11:04.480" style="s2">reason score and wikilection need to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.399" end="00:11:04.959" style="s2">able to use this so we have a starting</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.480" end="00:11:07.360" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.959" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">and when we talk about this other</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.360" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">project how does that fit into</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:14.880" style="s2">so carrie did did you have anything that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">you especially want to be on the hot</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.880" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">seat about i know jubilee said she</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">um i&#39;m kind of specific it&#39;s more about</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:26.480" style="s2">asking yourselves</p>

<p begin="00:12:10.800" end="00:12:14.560" style="s2">gets um</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:16.000" style="s2">they gravitate around that and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.560" end="00:12:17.040" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the big wide world which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.000" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">full of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.040" end="00:12:20.800" style="s2">but there&#39;ll be a maybe a community that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.040" end="00:12:22.800" style="s2">could have gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.800" end="00:12:25.200" style="s2">around your project right during</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.800" end="00:12:26.720" style="s2">worcester as i said i&#39;m just looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.200" end="00:12:28.800" style="s2">because i know jubilee&#39;s after ten</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.720" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">thousands right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.800" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">that&#39;s that bit um but you too i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:36.480" style="s2">too sure how many people</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:37.120" style="s2">um you&#39;d want to so like gravitate</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.480" end="00:12:39.360" style="s2">toward</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.120" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">what would be an ideal community size in</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.360" end="00:12:42.560" style="s2">terms of people</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:44.320" style="s2">would you would you have around your</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.560" end="00:12:47.440" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.320" end="00:12:48.399" style="s2">yeah i think for mine it would end up</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:50.720" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.399" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">different levels of involvement kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.720" end="00:12:54.240" style="s2">like probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">wikipedia where you know there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.240" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">some people that actually like go you</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:12:59.040" style="s2">know and spend a lot of time on it and</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">geek out i may occasionally change a few</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.040" end="00:13:02.480" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s the people who like</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.480" end="00:13:05.839" style="s2">you know there&#39;s that guy who&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">published like 10 thousand or a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.839" end="00:13:10.800" style="s2">thousand</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:12.240" style="s2">articles or some insane number like that</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.800" end="00:13:13.760" style="s2">and then there&#39;s you know just the the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.240" end="00:13:15.040" style="s2">regular user that might just find a</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.760" end="00:13:15.760" style="s2">wikipedia page when they google</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.040" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.760" end="00:13:18.880" style="s2">and they go there and look at it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:22.079" style="s2">then they did</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.880" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">they they move on so i think um</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.079" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">oh hey matu is here even though it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.560" style="s2">quite late for him um</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">so i think on the community side the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.560" end="00:13:33.839" style="s2">like end users</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:35.200" style="s2">you know the end goal is for that to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.839" end="00:13:35.760" style="s2">like in the billions because it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.200" end="00:13:38.720" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.760" end="00:13:39.040" style="s2">right it&#39;s like a a global political</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.720" end="00:13:41.279" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.040" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s you know way down the road i</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.279" end="00:13:44.560" style="s2">think real</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">realistically if it were to get let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.560" end="00:13:48.639" style="s2">say 10 000 like</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">core users that would be awesome that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.639" end="00:13:51.839" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:52.880" style="s2">you know probably actually be close to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.839" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">the numbers that</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.880" end="00:13:57.360" style="s2">if it were really successful that would</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">probably be around the core number of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.360" end="00:14:01.760" style="s2">users like somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.600" style="s2">between 5 000 and 50 000 and then you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.760" end="00:14:05.760" style="s2">might get into like the tens and huh</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.600" end="00:14:07.680" style="s2">hundreds of thousands for like the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.760" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">dabblers people you know who would</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.680" end="00:14:10.399" style="s2">go in there and check things out i may</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:12.399" style="s2">occasionally like throw a rock at</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.399" end="00:14:15.040" style="s2">something and be like hey is that right</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.399" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">or you know some form of a comment but</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.040" end="00:14:18.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.920" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">so in terms of contributors right how</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.560" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">many people how many people would you</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">like in terms of contribute</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:24.560" style="s2">contributors</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.120" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">i mean that&#39;s where it gets weird</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.480" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">because just on the political side</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:33.920" style="s2">you know probably in the thousands where</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:35.279" style="s2">it would probably end up being like</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.920" end="00:14:36.560" style="s2">you know maybe a hundred or a couple</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.279" end="00:14:38.240" style="s2">hundred in canada and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.560" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">easily into the thousands in the us and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.240" end="00:14:42.800" style="s2">it would probably be split to different</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.120" style="s2">countries right when it comes to like</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.800" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.120" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">discussing evidence side definitely in</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:49.199" style="s2">the thousands</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">right okay nice or you know or to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.199" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">many many thousands because if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:53.920" style="s2">talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:56.240" style="s2">people just discussing science and</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.920" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">people discussing you know the various</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.240" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">economics um the goal is for it to be a</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:02.240" style="s2">fairly large number of people who are</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:04.399" style="s2">qualified</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.240" end="00:15:05.279" style="s2">in that area and then you know if each</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.399" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.279" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">reviews anywhere from 10 to 100</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:13.839" style="s2">studies you could end up getting a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:16.880" style="s2">pretty good breath of knowledge being</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.839" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">reviewed okay right okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.880" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">how about you bentley</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.480" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">so um reason score is kind of a generic</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.480" end="00:15:27.519" style="s2">tool so there might be several</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">communities using it for different</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.519" end="00:15:32.240" style="s2">purposes but if we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">kind of narrow it down to maybe like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.240" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">goalie bot use of it</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">gilibot being a public character</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:45.279" style="s2">that helps people make decisions on a</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:48.480" style="s2">on a society-wide basis um</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.279" end="00:15:50.399" style="s2">like you know is global warming</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.480" end="00:15:52.720" style="s2">something we need to work on or should</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.399" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">we send our kids back to school</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.720" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">this season while we&#39;re in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:58.399" style="s2">a pandemic or at the end of a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.639" end="00:16:02.720" style="s2">so for that i mean i would imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.040" end="00:16:06.839" style="s2">would be fairly successful</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.720" end="00:16:09.199" style="s2">if we had a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.839" end="00:16:10.639" style="s2">contributors right and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.199" end="00:16:13.680" style="s2">tens of thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.639" end="00:16:15.199" style="s2">readers okay um</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.680" end="00:16:17.360" style="s2">so yeah that would be that would be a</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:19.759" style="s2">fairly good start</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.360" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">okay specific piece yeah right it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.759" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">because i was just</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:28.399" style="s2">trying to get a feel for kind of numbers</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:32.399" style="s2">you know what i mean um see how you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.399" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">you would need to collect for you</p>

<p begin="00:18:44.799" end="00:18:51.760" style="s2">or to the well just to to the project um</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.400" end="00:18:54.160" style="s2">maybe i don&#39;t know using it or</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.760" end="00:18:55.039" style="s2">helping other people using it or if you</p>

<p begin="00:18:58.799" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">the hyperlogos because that&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">of thing i&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.200" end="00:19:12.640" style="s2">i would expect the hyperlogos itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">as a generic software to have just a few</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.640" end="00:19:16.960" style="s2">because that&#39;s the way with</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.919" end="00:19:18.559" style="s2">open source projects so i definitely do</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">not expect much</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.559" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">money on the other hand</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:29.440" style="s2">on specific instances of it um</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:32.480" style="s2">when there is um a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.440" end="00:19:34.080" style="s2">subject or a purpose to this to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.480" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">given instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.080" end="00:19:40.799" style="s2">uh i would expect a tens</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:42.160" style="s2">to hundreds right okay but if i if i</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.799" end="00:19:44.640" style="s2">have even a ten</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.160" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">uh that would be uh i consider it a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.640" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">success</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.280" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">marches do you see there being kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:52.960" style="s2">public</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:54.320" style="s2">group one that&#39;s kind of open or do you</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.960" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">think it&#39;ll always be a specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.320" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:01.120" style="s2">uh i have an idea uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:05.760" style="s2">idea on this that kerry would would</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:06.159" style="s2">that&#39;s the community i think kerry would</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.760" end="00:20:10.240" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.159" end="00:20:10.799" style="s2">focusing on yes there will be something</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.240" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.799" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">uh like this uh ideally because</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">uh for</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:21.520" style="s2">in the initial stage there would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:24.080" style="s2">instances</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.520" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">only uh each instance with specific</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.080" end="00:20:29.120" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">and um theme and so on</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.120" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">but a public instance to you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:37.360" style="s2">gather them all in one big tree of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:39.280" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.360" end="00:20:41.600" style="s2">uh that&#39;s something i would like to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.280" end="00:20:45.200" style="s2">in uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.600" end="00:20:47.840" style="s2">unspecified future so yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.200" end="00:20:49.400" style="s2">it would be like a tree of trees and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.840" end="00:20:53.120" style="s2">something containing</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.400" end="00:20:57.600" style="s2">descriptions and links to all instances</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.120" end="00:21:00.400" style="s2">that are public and within the same</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.600" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">scope like if the scope is improving the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.400" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:07.919" style="s2">and there are 10 or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">however many specific instances for uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.919" end="00:21:12.480" style="s2">specific purposes</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:16.640" style="s2">um this one public instance would be the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.480" end="00:21:21.200" style="s2">like main landing page</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.640" end="00:21:24.400" style="s2">and um source of initial information</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.200" end="00:21:26.799" style="s2">uh sending users to specific um</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.400" end="00:21:28.159" style="s2">branches so to speak do you also make</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.799" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">sure what you&#39;d what would either</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.159" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">forest get in a forest</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.400" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">first round forest</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.000" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">yeah do do you envision one of these for</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">like the game b</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">community or is it more specific than</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:44.799" style="s2">that okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.159" style="s2">so if we had the game b community that</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.799" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.159" end="00:21:50.480" style="s2">a couple hundred people by maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:53.679" style="s2">participating</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.480" end="00:21:54.880" style="s2">uh looking at it uh actively adding</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.679" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">information to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.880" end="00:22:00.159" style="s2">um if i have 10 people actively adding</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.159" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">given how uh in our environment</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:10.400" style="s2">in the context of everything being</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2">voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.400" end="00:22:16.880" style="s2">then it&#39;s um not as easy</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">yeah unless uh there is some incentive</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.880" end="00:22:21.200" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">um not in for form of money but</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.200" end="00:22:26.400" style="s2">uh like rewards points</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:27.679" style="s2">like you know in warcraft you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.400" end="00:22:30.000" style="s2">pieces of gold</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.679" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">so it could be something like this</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.000" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">slight gamification of those</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:36.880" style="s2">of this project who knows i don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">the word and i don&#39;t like the idea too</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.880" end="00:22:39.919" style="s2">much but</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.480" style="s2">then again uh this is how human minds</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.919" end="00:22:43.679" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.480" end="00:22:47.120" style="s2">so um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.679" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">yeah but we see we are</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.120" end="00:22:53.039" style="s2">far away from the stage from that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:54.480" style="s2">is there a way to easily start must be</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.039" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">more than carries</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.480" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">wheelhouse but start collecting people</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">who want</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">to volunteer they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">write like everyone who joins projects</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">either has a project or wants to be part</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">of a project everyone joins game b</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">is basically has a project or is looking</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:10.720" style="s2">for a project none of our projects are</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:12.400" style="s2">at the space where someone can just come</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.720" end="00:23:13.360" style="s2">in and be part of it at the same level</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.400" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.360" end="00:23:18.000" style="s2">um all of them could use labor right all</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">of them could use especially with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.000" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">data entry</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">and i feel like data entry is something</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:25.120" style="s2">that&#39;s fairly accessible to most people</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:26.880" style="s2">if you depending on what it is and how</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.120" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">complex it is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.880" end="00:23:30.880" style="s2">most people if they knew about it would</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.559" style="s2">want to give some time and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.880" end="00:23:34.320" style="s2">there&#39;s what bentley had said where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">going to pay people to do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.320" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">and both there&#39;s people who are like oh</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.000" end="00:23:40.559" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s pay people</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:43.039" style="s2">in venezuela to to do data entry</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.559" end="00:23:44.159" style="s2">i&#39;m willing to put 50 bucks towards that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.039" end="00:23:46.080" style="s2">knowing it&#39;s going to be maybe</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.159" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">you know like 10 hours worth of work or</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.080" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">whatever that there&#39;s funders</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:52.080" style="s2">to pay for outsourcing especially if</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:52.880" style="s2">it&#39;s for a bigger mission and then also</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.080" end="00:23:55.520" style="s2">people who</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.880" end="00:23:56.640" style="s2">um volunteer anyway just the volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.520" end="00:23:58.320" style="s2">part like if people</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.640" end="00:24:00.080" style="s2">when they come in or like it&#39;s like yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.320" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">here&#39;s an email list</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.080" end="00:24:03.360" style="s2">if they&#39;re part of that email list they</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">know they&#39;re gonna get spam</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.360" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">from people who are like hey we need</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">volunteers for x right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">and once technology reaches the point</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">then of course it&#39;s not an email list</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:15.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:16.080" style="s2">more fluid way to get those volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.200" end="00:24:17.840" style="s2">and to find out</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.080" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">is it an in-person volunteer as a data</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.840" end="00:24:21.120" style="s2">entry can i do it what five-minute</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">opportunities are there right now that i</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.120" end="00:24:24.159" style="s2">could just do something right now</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">but like there&#39;s enough people</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.159" end="00:24:29.600" style="s2">interested that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">future it is kind of now like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.600" end="00:24:32.799" style="s2">but i don&#39;t know whether doing any of</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:34.000" style="s2">that work would get up to qrikets anyway</p>

<p begin="00:25:54.400" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">how much work goes into any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:26:00.640" style="s2">output</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">right it definitely sounds like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.640" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">would end up being something that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:06.720" style="s2">like that you know if the knack tool</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:07.840" style="s2">were good it could have ended up doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.720" end="00:26:09.919" style="s2">and the tool that</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.840" end="00:26:12.960" style="s2">the the drupal site that carries working</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.919" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">on it sounds like it could pretty</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.960" end="00:26:16.159" style="s2">easily turn into that i&#39;m wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.159" end="00:26:22.960" style="s2">value in doing it off of software first</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">like we&#39;ve sort of tried maybe different</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.960" end="00:26:26.240" style="s2">versions of this in the game be projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:28.640" style="s2">group but even saying like</p>

<p begin="00:26:30.000" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">that need work to decide on exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.400" end="00:26:35.520" style="s2">work is needed</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:36.880" style="s2">start to put that out like a weekly call</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.520" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">out to the group saying you know hey if</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.880" end="00:26:39.120" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:39.120" end="00:26:43.039" style="s2">five things that we need help with</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.320" style="s2">yes if your project needs help feel free</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.039" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">to add a comment here and you know we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.320" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">try to like</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">figure out how to keep that one updated</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">where it&#39;s i guess similar to like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">weekly status update but instead of</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:55.679" style="s2">being a status update</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.559" style="s2">it&#39;s uh who needs help and who&#39;s willing</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.679" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">to help</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.559" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">and you know knowing that the first like</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">using a comment thread in facebook</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.840" end="00:27:02.000" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be super messy if it</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:03.760" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.000" end="00:27:05.440" style="s2">takes off but at that point that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.760" end="00:27:07.919" style="s2">good problem to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.440" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">so some other options would be email</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.919" end="00:27:10.480" style="s2">lists</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:11.840" style="s2">so pretty easy to set up as a google</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.480" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">group</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.840" end="00:27:16.720" style="s2">and then we could post the link to sign</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:18.080" style="s2">up for that anyone who wanted to could</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.720" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">sign up and then anyone</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.080" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">in that group could send an email to the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:25.919" style="s2">whole group so until it gets spammed</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">it would be good then there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.919" end="00:27:28.880" style="s2">things like sub stack</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:30.880" style="s2">and i can&#39;t remember the name of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.880" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">other one where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.880" end="00:27:37.279" style="s2">it&#39;s free as long as you&#39;re not charging</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">for the email list and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.279" end="00:27:40.720" style="s2">that&#39;d be more like they could sign up</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:43.520" style="s2">and then we could um</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.720" end="00:27:46.159" style="s2">a specific person or group of dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.520" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">people could then send out emails to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.159" end="00:27:49.760" style="s2">and maybe be worth setting up a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:52.480" style="s2">one-pager somewhere for game b</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.760" end="00:27:54.240" style="s2">or on carrie&#39;s site or on the wiki that</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.480" end="00:27:56.320" style="s2">says here are the email lists to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.240" end="00:27:58.480" style="s2">notifications about</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.320" end="00:27:59.600" style="s2">volunteering or new projects or</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.480" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.600" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">rather than having to to</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:06.080" style="s2">hope that you see it in your facebook</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">feed or remember to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.080" end="00:28:10.480" style="s2">look um so those are some options i</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:11.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know what people think of that</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.480" end="00:28:13.520" style="s2">it seems like there&#39;s two types of</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.840" end="00:28:15.120" style="s2">volunteers one of which is like very</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.520" end="00:28:16.000" style="s2">particular right i need someone who</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">knows codeine which</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.000" end="00:28:19.120" style="s2">luckily we have a lot but like still</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a very particular right i know to</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.120" end="00:28:23.360" style="s2">go to mature bentley but like no</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.200" end="00:28:25.520" style="s2">rest don&#39;t know but also the callouts</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.360" end="00:28:26.799" style="s2">for like literally anyone can do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.520" end="00:28:28.080" style="s2">right like that&#39;s a little bit me and my</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.799" end="00:28:28.960" style="s2">solution is they like just come i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.080" end="00:28:30.720" style="s2">feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.960" end="00:28:32.000" style="s2">you&#39;re an expert just come you have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.720" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">life that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.000" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">there&#39;s no requirement and therefore um</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:38.080" style="s2">like if you can read and write numbers</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.880" end="00:28:39.360" style="s2">you can probably do data entry</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.080" end="00:28:40.799" style="s2">especially if it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.360" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">repetitive and you&#39;re having multiple</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.799" end="00:28:45.120" style="s2">people enter the same thing so it can</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:46.320" style="s2">check off each other but um yeah an</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.120" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">email list for just</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.320" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">the the very low barrier volunteering</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.760" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">of like yes we want dozens of people</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">doing that entry</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:58.000" style="s2">and growing that also becomes a source</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:00.640" style="s2">of like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.000" end="00:29:01.120" style="s2">emailing you unless it&#39;s good project</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.640" end="00:29:03.760" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">anyone gets the email for for volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.760" end="00:29:06.240" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:07.919" style="s2">and then that becomes a reason people</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.240" end="00:29:09.520" style="s2">come and join anyway and</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.919" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">to be part of that if there&#39;s people on</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.520" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">that list that want to volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.080" end="00:29:15.200" style="s2">yeah if we really want to curate it i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:18.559" style="s2">probably say</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.200" end="00:29:19.760" style="s2">using sub stack or that other email one</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.559" end="00:29:21.679" style="s2">although i don&#39;t know actually it may</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.760" end="00:29:25.120" style="s2">only be one person can send them out so</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.679" end="00:29:27.360" style="s2">that may be too much of a barrier</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.120" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if google group supports</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.360" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.240" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">to where only certain people can send</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:41.840" style="s2">the emails or not</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:45.919" style="s2">but yeah that would be something to look</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.880" end="00:29:48.399" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.919" end="00:29:49.760" style="s2">do we do you really think that if we had</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.399" end="00:29:51.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.760" end="00:29:54.799" style="s2">that we do have people that are willing</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.200" end="00:29:57.039" style="s2">to no i mean i&#39;ve seen a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.799" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">i think there&#39;s like there&#39;s nobody to</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.039" end="00:29:59.840" style="s2">put them</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">right like it&#39;s like people have asked</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.840" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">me like what can i do for your project</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.520" style="s2">like i don&#39;t even know but if i had</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">a way to be like listen sign ups i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.520" end="00:30:08.320" style="s2">never doing a newsletter</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:10.159" style="s2">and i&#39;ll give you the newsletter like</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.320" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">sign up and when there&#39;s a volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.159" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:15.600" style="s2">you will find out about it i might i</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.000" end="00:30:16.960" style="s2">can&#39;t even do it that level but it feels</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.600" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">like together tech can do it at that</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.960" end="00:30:19.919" style="s2">level where it&#39;s like hey even if there</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:22.240" style="s2">isn&#39;t anything quite yet</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.919" end="00:30:23.840" style="s2">we&#39;re i think we do have a mailchimp</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.960" style="s2">account don&#39;t we from like months ago</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.840" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">and uh something but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.960" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">something along those lines well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:31.840" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.080" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">i could i could set one up with what</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.120" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just it just sounded dead so</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">so basically</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:54.559" style="s2">i could probably build something in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">you know would have somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.559" end="00:30:58.080" style="s2">for people to go and say right okay we</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">need this this week</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.080" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">and just have it kind of like a notice</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:02.480" style="s2">board and then we can post a link from</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:03.760" style="s2">the notice boards</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.480" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">and then you know people with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.760" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">projects and and stuff like that can</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">you know um we can put it like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">towards the project and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">who&#39;s offering what and then that would</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:14.080" style="s2">be an easy way and then just post it</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:15.679" style="s2">every week</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.080" end="00:31:18.399" style="s2">and say right this week and sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.679" end="00:31:18.720" style="s2">do a digest of like so i was looking for</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.399" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.720" end="00:31:22.720" style="s2">i&#39;m looking for that yeah can you i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">give this and with that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.720" end="00:31:25.279" style="s2">because there&#39;s a lot of people who say</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:26.240" style="s2">they&#39;re looking for the project to get</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.279" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">involved with</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.240" end="00:31:31.440" style="s2">but they have um i don&#39;t know what what</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:32.799" style="s2">they&#39;d want to do because obviously you</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.440" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be saying right</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.799" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">all these projects are needed help but</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:39.600" style="s2">like because some people might think of</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:40.720" style="s2">the help that&#39;s needed is a bit beneath</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.600" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">them you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.720" end="00:31:44.799" style="s2">so um i think i&#39;d have to find out more</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.799" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">sort of like what people are needing and</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">that&#39;s why the the chat&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:53.120" style="s2">um and i&#39;ve chats with people with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:55.039" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.120" end="00:31:56.960" style="s2">and finding out properly and what</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:31:58.880" style="s2">information they want out there</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.960" end="00:32:00.640" style="s2">and whether they&#39;re wanting to have some</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.880" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">space where they can so they</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.640" end="00:32:04.080" style="s2">just have other things in together as</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:05.760" style="s2">well you know i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.080" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">as i said because we can start with with</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.760" end="00:32:09.519" style="s2">us because we&#39;ve got enough projects</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:11.679" style="s2">to go with without that with now and</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.519" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">then so like build it out</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.679" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">so everybody you know and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:16.880" style="s2">because people can start seeing once</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">tasks are done and once things are</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.880" end="00:32:19.279" style="s2">starting to move</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:21.279" style="s2">and i think that would be good for</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.279" end="00:32:21.679" style="s2">people to see as well you know i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.279" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.679" end="00:32:26.320" style="s2">i think that&#39;s all possible</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.399" style="s2">well i i just don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.320" end="00:32:31.840" style="s2">effective unless they get</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.399" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">a direct notification somehow so a text</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.840" end="00:32:34.960" style="s2">an email</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:37.279" style="s2">what are some other a message through</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.960" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">facebook but that&#39;s kind of hard to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.279" end="00:32:41.679" style="s2">yeah okay well as i said we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:43.919" style="s2">look at that and build build</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.679" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">um i think with the crm module you can</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.919" end="00:32:48.480" style="s2">do kind of like a campaign or do a</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:50.880" style="s2">newsletter or we can do a newsletter</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.480" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">and for them to sign up with you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.880" end="00:32:52.880" style="s2">what i mean and then that can take them</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:54.320" style="s2">to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.880" end="00:32:56.320" style="s2">straight to the page and that and</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.320" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">obviously we can sign them send links</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.320" end="00:32:58.640" style="s2">for people to actually sign up if they</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.840" end="00:33:02.159" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.640" end="00:33:03.760" style="s2">and we&#39;ll just take it from there really</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.159" end="00:33:05.840" style="s2">well i mean sending out emails and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.760" end="00:33:07.919" style="s2">getting them delivered consistently</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.840" end="00:33:10.399" style="s2">will will be difficult without either</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.919" end="00:33:13.600" style="s2">using sendgrid or</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.399" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">or mailchimp or substack</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.600" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">so you you can send it out from a base</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:19.039" style="s2">server but until it&#39;s trusted it&#39;ll show</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:21.039" style="s2">up in everyone&#39;s spams folder for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.039" end="00:33:23.840" style="s2">most part</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.039" end="00:33:25.600" style="s2">yeah in general i&#39;m not a big fan of</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.840" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">email just because the deliverability</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.600" end="00:33:29.120" style="s2">rates for email</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:29.519" style="s2">have been going steadily downhill for</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.120" end="00:33:31.519" style="s2">the last</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.519" end="00:33:32.600" style="s2">okay well we can develop a social media</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.519" end="00:33:34.880" style="s2">strategy then</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.600" end="00:33:36.240" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.880" end="00:33:37.919" style="s2">i still think email&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.240" end="00:33:39.760" style="s2">deliverability is fine as long as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.919" end="00:33:42.159" style="s2">using a known provider</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.760" end="00:33:43.919" style="s2">right yeah if you use send grid so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.159" end="00:33:45.519" style="s2">i don&#39;t just mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.919" end="00:33:47.519" style="s2">like technical deliverability i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.519" end="00:33:49.840" style="s2">also like open rates well</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.519" end="00:33:51.279" style="s2">open rates are untrackable because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.840" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">of the website</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.279" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">the google blocks</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:57.679" style="s2">notifications so the open rates are not</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">accurate</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.679" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">um and you know that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">based on the quality that people are</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:05.360" style="s2">sending in and whether people open the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:06.799" style="s2">email</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.360" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">but i mean that i don&#39;t think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.799" end="00:34:11.839" style="s2">better option it&#39;s bad</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:13.599" style="s2">but i mean what else i mean if if</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.839" end="00:34:15.040" style="s2">anything else it&#39;s like well let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.599" end="00:34:15.919" style="s2">post in the facebook group that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.040" end="00:34:17.440" style="s2">everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.919" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">the same as the facebook group and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.440" end="00:34:20.960" style="s2">already doing that so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:22.480" style="s2">let&#39;s just be more intentional about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.960" end="00:34:25.520" style="s2">but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.480" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">like i would like because we&#39;re close to</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.520" end="00:34:31.119" style="s2">asking people to go off-site</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:32.320" style="s2">for the the drupal tool personally i i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.119" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.320" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">wait to use that request for the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:36.800" style="s2">drupal site because if we&#39;re like hey go</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:37.919" style="s2">check out mac</p>

<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:44.800" style="s2">that i think ended up creating a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">fatigue and it&#39;s not to say that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.800" end="00:34:47.919" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:48.960" style="s2">that still won&#39;t happen with things like</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.919" end="00:34:51.520" style="s2">the drupal site but</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.960" end="00:34:53.359" style="s2">just to try to keep that to a minimum</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.520" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">and yeah knowing that the the facebook</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.359" end="00:34:56.000" style="s2">option</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:57.359" style="s2">isn&#39;t great either but it&#39;s just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.000" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">like we&#39;ve already got them there</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.359" end="00:35:01.040" style="s2">and it&#39;s no extra step to action it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">just do do they see it or not</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.040" end="00:35:05.599" style="s2">and then the next time that we ask them</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:08.960" style="s2">it&#39;s to sign up for this drupal tool</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.599" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">well yeah i just but are we asking them</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.960" end="00:35:12.560" style="s2">i don&#39;t think kerry&#39;s suggestion was to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:13.520" style="s2">have them sign up for the drupal tool</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.560" end="00:35:16.480" style="s2">what&#39;s the drupal goal</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.520" end="00:35:17.839" style="s2">going to do with that sign up well as it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.480" end="00:35:19.599" style="s2">says it&#39;s just a case right</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.839" end="00:35:21.200" style="s2">it&#39;s just to basically as i said once we</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.599" end="00:35:23.440" style="s2">get the the project lists</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.200" end="00:35:26.240" style="s2">and the ones some help that&#39;s needed and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.440" end="00:35:28.400" style="s2">we you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve got that sorted</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.240" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">so everybody knows what&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.400" end="00:35:31.040" style="s2">they want and what you need and what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:34.400" style="s2">sort of help</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.040" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">and what you know um what&#39;s as i said if</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.400" end="00:35:38.079" style="s2">we get that with the project</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:40.079" style="s2">then people can actually we can post the</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.079" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">link to the project page</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.079" end="00:35:44.320" style="s2">and then because all the contacts will</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:46.880" style="s2">be there for that specific project</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.320" end="00:35:48.240" style="s2">they can sign up to the to the person</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.880" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">directly rather than</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.240" end="00:35:51.839" style="s2">having to sign up to the site because he</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">might not want to get involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.839" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">back end of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:57.520" style="s2">um but as i said i just see the the back</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">end of the drupal</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.520" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">as a site to where we can actually put</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.280" style="s2">all our stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">and if there&#39;s plans and things you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.280" end="00:36:06.960" style="s2">and you can have your own content and</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.560" style="s2">you can see what&#39;s going on and other</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.960" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">people can see what&#39;s going on as well</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.560" end="00:36:13.280" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a kind of sort of like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.240" style="s2">as i said like a clubhouse you know so</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.280" end="00:36:16.240" style="s2">you can right so</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.240" end="00:36:17.599" style="s2">you know and see what&#39;s what and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.240" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">develop outwards and</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.599" end="00:36:21.200" style="s2">as i said there&#39;ll be some people who</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:24.560" style="s2">have a project you might want to come in</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.200" end="00:36:26.560" style="s2">and play out with us and and that um</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.560" end="00:36:28.560" style="s2">but not everybody&#39;s gonna want that so</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.560" end="00:36:31.359" style="s2">as i said if i can get the project</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.560" end="00:36:32.320" style="s2">page uh where they go to to find all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.359" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">projects we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.320" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">set up fields about help and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:39.520" style="s2">wanted and what&#39;s needed</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.720" end="00:36:41.520" style="s2">so we and you can display the fields so</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.520" end="00:36:43.839" style="s2">they can just see that and where to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.520" end="00:36:45.440" style="s2">contact the person directly if they they</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.839" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">want that you know what i mean and</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.440" end="00:36:48.800" style="s2">which groups and give them more</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">information um</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.800" end="00:36:52.160" style="s2">if they need it so basically we just put</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.280" style="s2">a link to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.160" end="00:36:56.960" style="s2">the project page um</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.280" end="00:36:58.320" style="s2">of all the projects so they can go and</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.960" end="00:37:01.200" style="s2">have a mooch through</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.320" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">and as i said you can display it whether</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.200" end="00:37:04.160" style="s2">helps want it</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:06.000" style="s2">helps need it you know what i mean and</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.160" end="00:37:07.680" style="s2">what status the projects are</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.000" end="00:37:09.359" style="s2">and if you know and if somebody&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.680" end="00:37:10.800" style="s2">got ideas</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.359" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">that they want to come along and talk to</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.800" end="00:37:14.079" style="s2">somebody about they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">you know as i said it&#39;s just a seat of</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.079" end="00:37:16.640" style="s2">an idea but they want to help grow it</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.640" end="00:37:19.760" style="s2">if they want they can come and join the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:21.359" style="s2">back end of it because i think</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.760" end="00:37:23.680" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of nowhere because it&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.359" end="00:37:25.680" style="s2">in the public you don&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.680" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">um people if you&#39;ve just got a seed of</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.680" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">an idea you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:29.920" style="s2">going with it</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:31.760" style="s2">you don&#39;t really want everybody looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.920" end="00:37:33.520" style="s2">at it and going oh you&#39;re an idiot</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.760" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">you know that&#39;ll never take off but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.520" end="00:37:37.599" style="s2">want to be able to talk to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:38.640" style="s2">and talk some talk talk through it with</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.599" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">somebody</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.640" end="00:37:41.760" style="s2">and then maybe we can do that in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:44.000" style="s2">back end of it and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.760" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">either because as i said we you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.000" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">you&#39;ll have to join to see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:51.680" style="s2">but it&#39;ll be you know be a a safer place</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:53.119" style="s2">to kind of like an idea factory</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.680" end="00:37:55.760" style="s2">something like that where you can just</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.119" end="00:37:57.920" style="s2">bounce about and don&#39;t no matter how</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.760" end="00:37:59.599" style="s2">out there it is you know i mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.920" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">not gonna get laughed out of town</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.599" end="00:38:02.960" style="s2">or run out of town for having an idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:06.079" style="s2">that looks a bit mad</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.960" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">you know what i mean right i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.079" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">like what the the question that i sort</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:11.359" style="s2">of heard</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:13.119" style="s2">brantley ask and what led to this</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.359" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">conversation from my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.119" end="00:38:16.800" style="s2">is you know how do we get our facebook</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:18.640" style="s2">audience to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.800" end="00:38:20.320" style="s2">what&#39;s the step to start to drive this</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.640" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">sort of action and i</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.320" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">think if we&#39;re saying that the next step</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:25.920" style="s2">is the drupal tool</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t think the first version will</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.920" end="00:38:32.000" style="s2">have everybody signing up for a member</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">i&#39;m not expecting this question i think</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.000" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">it probably starts out being just carrie</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:37.680" style="s2">and then the the the next step are the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:38.880" style="s2">project owners</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.680" end="00:38:41.040" style="s2">and then it just becomes sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.880" end="00:38:42.720" style="s2">portal where i for four week election</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.040" end="00:38:43.839" style="s2">can go say here what&#39;s going on with</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.720" end="00:38:45.280" style="s2">wikilection</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.839" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">oh and by the way here&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.280" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">help with and then there&#39;s some page on</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">the site that just you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:52.560" style="s2">if bentley lists something in isla</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:53.200" style="s2">something emma touch and jubilee and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.560" end="00:38:54.880" style="s2">carrie and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.200" end="00:38:56.240" style="s2">everybody who has a project each list</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.880" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">two or three things that we need help</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.240" end="00:38:58.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">there&#39;s just a page showing here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.000" end="00:39:01.520" style="s2">everything and</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">in the first version they&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.520" end="00:39:04.880" style="s2">like it just says if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">participate go reach out to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.880" end="00:39:08.960" style="s2">project then yeah and then eventually we</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:10.160" style="s2">might get to the point where those</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.960" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">people actually sign up for a member</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.160" end="00:39:16.640" style="s2">account and there&#39;s the whole like idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:18.640" style="s2">ecosystem but i think to answer b b</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.640" end="00:39:20.079" style="s2">question in the start they wouldn&#39;t sign</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.640" end="00:39:21.920" style="s2">up it would just be like</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.079" end="00:39:23.760" style="s2">go there and read it and then we still</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.920" end="00:39:25.760" style="s2">have the the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.760" end="00:39:27.520" style="s2">will they go read it or do we also then</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.760" end="00:39:28.320" style="s2">you know put in an email and also post</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.520" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">it on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.320" end="00:39:31.359" style="s2">like how do we start uh i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:34.400" style="s2">like you know like</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.359" end="00:39:36.800" style="s2">it&#39;s um content media</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.400" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">planning strategies which involve social</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.800" end="00:39:40.720" style="s2">media strategies as well so</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:42.400" style="s2">once once you&#39;ve got it up and running</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.720" end="00:39:43.680" style="s2">as i said at the back end of it we can</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.400" end="00:39:46.160" style="s2">actually develop</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">some content and and some social media</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.160" end="00:39:49.119" style="s2">strategies</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:50.720" style="s2">in order to do that so so that would</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.119" end="00:39:52.880" style="s2">take care of that bit</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.720" end="00:39:54.720" style="s2">you know so and then so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.880" end="00:39:56.400" style="s2">fine but as i said i&#39;m not expecting</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.720" end="00:39:59.440" style="s2">anyone to sign up</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.400" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">um and you know as i said if people who</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.440" end="00:40:02.800" style="s2">want to they can</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:04.400" style="s2">to be more than welcome but as i said</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.800" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not going to be everybody&#39;s cup of</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.400" end="00:40:07.440" style="s2">tea which</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:09.359" style="s2">i&#39;m fine with but there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.440" end="00:40:10.400" style="s2">the projects in the open so they can</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.359" end="00:40:12.640" style="s2">actually see</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.400" end="00:40:14.079" style="s2">and other stuff will be in the open what</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.640" end="00:40:16.400" style="s2">you know what we want them to see</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.079" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">well everyone to see will be in the open</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.400" end="00:40:20.880" style="s2">so they can read it without</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:21.839" style="s2">you know having to join or anything as i</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.880" end="00:40:23.760" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.839" end="00:40:24.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t you know as you know and then if</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.760" end="00:40:26.720" style="s2">they get inspired and if</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.960" end="00:40:28.079" style="s2">they&#39;re interested there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.720" end="00:40:30.480" style="s2">plenty of space for them</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.079" end="00:40:31.760" style="s2">if they want to you know what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.480" end="00:40:33.440" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.760" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s the advantage over</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.440" end="00:40:36.720" style="s2">the neck tool was when i built the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:38.480" style="s2">actual it was built around</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.720" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">project owners signing up and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.480" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">managing their pages and people were</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:44.319" style="s2">doing that so there&#39;s no information</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.240" end="00:40:46.640" style="s2">and i think the drupal tool that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.319" end="00:40:48.800" style="s2">creating the advantage is that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.640" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">willing to do the work to sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.800" end="00:40:52.560" style="s2">manage the projects and get it you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.720" style="s2">get and keep enough content in there to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.560" end="00:40:55.839" style="s2">to keep it interesting</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.720" end="00:40:57.760" style="s2">to the point where some people are</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.839" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">starting to use it as you know project</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.760" end="00:41:01.040" style="s2">participants and other people are trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:03.280" style="s2">to use it as project owners</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.040" end="00:41:05.200" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really where the inactual</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.280" end="00:41:06.400" style="s2">flat was it just didn&#39;t get actual users</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.200" end="00:41:07.280" style="s2">which is a pretty important part of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.400" end="00:41:09.119" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.280" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">well i said guess what i see myself as a</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.119" end="00:41:13.200" style="s2">little like a community student right</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not not in charge</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.200" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not just all about me and basically</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:19.839" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">so say like for the project listing</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.839" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">being the public right the</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:27.040" style="s2">research into collaboration tools put</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">that out there findings and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.040" end="00:41:30.000" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:32.560" style="s2">and things that people will find useful</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.000" end="00:41:34.560" style="s2">like as i said make that all in the open</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.560" end="00:41:35.760" style="s2">and i may have a thing like buy us a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.560" end="00:41:37.839" style="s2">coffee or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.760" end="00:41:40.800" style="s2">um on the list whatever but if they find</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.839" end="00:41:43.920" style="s2">it useful but as i said but having</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.800" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">information like the the collaboration</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.920" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">tools and maybe if we go in depth and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">as i said content and media and social</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.079" style="s2">strategies and</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.480" style="s2">community building strategies we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.079" end="00:41:56.480" style="s2">make all that information open</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.480" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">so anyone with the project is maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.480" end="00:41:59.440" style="s2">thinking about it and as i said if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:01.920" style="s2">want to come and join it</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.440" end="00:42:03.599" style="s2">join us for some solidarity and some you</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.920" end="00:42:06.880" style="s2">know i mean as i said</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.599" end="00:42:08.560" style="s2">the more the more we are together as</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.880" end="00:42:11.040" style="s2">and as long as we see it that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.560" end="00:42:12.079" style="s2">trying to take their project off them</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.040" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.079" end="00:42:15.440" style="s2">free to you know have you know projects</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:16.960" style="s2">but also if you can</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.440" end="00:42:18.800" style="s2">think of something that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.960" end="00:42:20.480" style="s2">thought of you know what i mean so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.800" end="00:42:24.210" style="s2">just kind of help each other out</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.480" end="00:42:27.930" style="s2">kind of big tent like a circus tent</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.210" end="00:42:27.930" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.839" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">yeah i i would i didn&#39;t have any problem</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:36.240" style="s2">with that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:37.839" style="s2">i guess just the thing was that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.240" end="00:42:41.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to like</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.839" end="00:42:44.240" style="s2">answer what jubilee asked so</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.040" end="00:42:46.079" style="s2">i was just wanting to make sure we</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.240" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">and i&#39;m also much more okay waiting for</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.079" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">the drupal tool than whatever we were</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:51.280" style="s2">doing that it was like</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:52.240" style="s2">years ago like eventually we&#39;ll get to</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.280" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">create this</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.240" end="00:42:55.440" style="s2">i don&#39;t have the need for volunteers at</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:42:57.520" style="s2">the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.440" end="00:42:59.760" style="s2">it&#39;s more for the sense making projects</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.520" end="00:43:01.520" style="s2">like when you guys do need your army of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.760" end="00:43:03.680" style="s2">of data entry and it might be ready by</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.520" end="00:43:05.200" style="s2">then and then we can together figure out</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.680" end="00:43:08.240" style="s2">a social media strategy</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.200" end="00:43:08.960" style="s2">to um like once we have some people can</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.240" end="00:43:11.119" style="s2">sign up</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.960" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">we can all tweet and facebook like hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.119" end="00:43:15.680" style="s2">want to come save the world like</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:18.079" style="s2">actually put hours to your</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.680" end="00:43:19.359" style="s2">vision come be part of this if you care</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.079" end="00:43:20.560" style="s2">about politics i&#39;ll be part of this if</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.359" end="00:43:22.400" style="s2">you care about science you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.560" end="00:43:24.000" style="s2">i think in the short term anytime we</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.400" end="00:43:27.119" style="s2">want to do a volunteers needed</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.000" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">i just i wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.119" end="00:43:30.400" style="s2">there&#39;s been some people that like post</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:32.240" style="s2">their weekly meetings i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.400" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">want that to be like a weekly post from</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.240" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">everybody where they all ask hey</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">come join my meeting um</p>

<p begin="00:44:02.319" end="00:44:04.800" style="s2">it&#39;s like it feels frustrating because</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.599" end="00:44:06.240" style="s2">we&#39;ve been doing it like week after week</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.800" end="00:44:06.800" style="s2">that&#39;s just the five of us but i&#39;m also</p>

<p begin="00:44:20.960" end="00:44:25.280" style="s2">but like there&#39;s something very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.520" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">happening that i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.280" end="00:44:29.359" style="s2">i&#39;m i have less stress about all of</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">these tools not being in existence</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.359" end="00:44:32.480" style="s2">because the people are coming together</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:34.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.480" end="00:44:36.480" style="s2">although we need both the people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.400" end="00:44:38.800" style="s2">more important tools without people or</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.480" end="00:44:40.400" style="s2">fucking shit workers people without</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.800" end="00:44:40.880" style="s2">tools we can still do it we can figure</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.400" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">it out</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.880" end="00:44:45.040" style="s2">yep yeah i think so</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.599" end="00:44:50.240" style="s2">so we have what 12 minutes left 13</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.240" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">is that enough time to get into your</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:53.839" style="s2">thing bentley</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t know we could start see how it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:00.640" style="s2">goes uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:02.839" style="s2">of course i don&#39;t know where to start</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.640" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.839" end="00:45:05.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.200" end="00:45:11.760" style="s2">so one of my main questions when i was</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.520" end="00:45:15.040" style="s2">trying to figure out sort of how or if</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.760" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">wiki election can tie in is</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.040" end="00:45:18.480" style="s2">what sort of evidence are we considering</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:20.720" style="s2">and what does that look like</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.480" end="00:45:22.319" style="s2">well from the system standpoint it</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.720" end="00:45:26.480" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.319" end="00:45:28.079" style="s2">matter so anything anyone considers</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.480" end="00:45:30.560" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.079" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">so right so i guess like what are some</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.560" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">lists that we can use to populate that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.520" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:36.800" style="s2">i like for example i had the idea for</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.520" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">wikilection for a long time like oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.800" end="00:45:39.200" style="s2">going to be evidence-based and then i</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:40.480" style="s2">actually went to go look for evidence</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.200" end="00:45:41.920" style="s2">and i&#39;m like oh it&#39;s not all that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.480" end="00:45:43.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s available but it&#39;s weird and</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.920" end="00:45:44.560" style="s2">piecemeal and then there&#39;s the other</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.760" end="00:45:47.920" style="s2">side of</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.560" end="00:45:51.119" style="s2">what do people actually trust</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.920" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">well no but but see you&#39;re not i so i</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.119" end="00:45:54.240" style="s2">would flip it</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:56.319" style="s2">around and say that you&#39;re not looking</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.240" end="00:45:59.119" style="s2">for evidence of people trust</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.319" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">you&#39;re allowing people to say this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.119" end="00:46:03.440" style="s2">why i believe</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:05.040" style="s2">this and then they put in their evidence</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.440" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">and then other people can come in and</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.040" end="00:46:09.280" style="s2">put in their evidence</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:10.960" style="s2">so there&#39;s not a category for evidence</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.280" end="00:46:13.359" style="s2">evidence is anything anyone thinks is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.960" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">evidence and you just link out to it</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.359" end="00:46:17.839" style="s2">um and then people can then discuss and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:20.000" style="s2">debate that evidence</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.839" end="00:46:22.319" style="s2">so there&#39;s there&#39;s no pre-population</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.000" end="00:46:23.119" style="s2">needed or categorization in my mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.319" end="00:46:24.880" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.119" end="00:46:27.359" style="s2">i don&#39;t care whether it&#39;s a video or a</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.880" end="00:46:29.440" style="s2">text it&#39;s just a it&#39;s just a hyperlink</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.359" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">right so if we&#39;re talking specifically</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.440" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:34.000" style="s2">voting with your wallet right so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:37.760" style="s2">say like</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.000" end="00:46:39.760" style="s2">what&#39;s an example of so like</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.760" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">it and this question is i guess for</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.760" end="00:46:43.040" style="s2">anyone more like as a consumer for</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:45.440" style="s2">somebody that wants to use the site</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.040" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">if you were trying to shop for i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:48.000" style="s2">know bread</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:49.599" style="s2">and it was saying like hey here&#39;s three</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.000" end="00:46:52.319" style="s2">companies and saying this company is</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.599" end="00:46:54.480" style="s2">great and that company sucks</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.319" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">if you were like brand new to the site</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.480" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">and you wanted to dig a bit deeper</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">what would the evidence look like or</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.160" style="s2">what sort of evidence would you either</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">be like oh i don&#39;t trust it or like oh</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.160" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">that&#39;s perfect</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:07.200" style="s2">um for something like you know that</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">company is great for</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.200" end="00:47:12.000" style="s2">paying their staff for example like</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:13.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what the evidence would</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.000" end="00:47:14.160" style="s2">look like would that just be a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.280" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">staff</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.160" end="00:47:17.839" style="s2">that are willing to go on record saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:21.119" style="s2">that they paid me 10</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">an hour or would it actually be like</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.119" end="00:47:24.480" style="s2">something available in that country</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:27.599" style="s2">let&#39;s kind of step through the</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.480" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">the user uh journey</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.599" end="00:47:30.960" style="s2">so you come to the site let&#39;s say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:32.960" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to figure out where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.960" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">gonna buy your daily coffee right so</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.960" end="00:47:35.599" style="s2">that&#39;s something you buy consistently</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:37.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.599" end="00:47:40.960" style="s2">so you might just go to the site type in</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.920" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">coffee and then you would say well</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.960" end="00:47:45.839" style="s2">here&#39;s our top several now of course</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.160" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">the coffee may not be in your area so</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.839" end="00:47:50.000" style="s2">then you may want to narrow it down to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:52.000" style="s2">say where you live</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.000" end="00:47:53.520" style="s2">and then it would filter down to that</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.000" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">and then it would say well</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.520" end="00:47:57.040" style="s2">here&#39;s our general ratings of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.000" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">companies like</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.040" end="00:48:01.119" style="s2">you know just talk five four three two</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">one and then here&#39;s kind of why</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.119" end="00:48:04.400" style="s2">and it would say well this one uh there</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:06.480" style="s2">was a news</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.400" end="00:48:08.240" style="s2">this one this lower one&#39;s lower because</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.480" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">there was a news article</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.240" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">saying that their employees weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">there or we could even take the um</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">the starbucks issue so like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">are they uh sensitive to the racial</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">issues in the united states</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">and there was that news article where a</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:24.240" style="s2">guy was the police were called on him</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:26.960" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.240" end="00:48:29.119" style="s2">and he was um i can&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.960" end="00:48:30.960" style="s2">specifically what went on</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.119" end="00:48:32.240" style="s2">so someone might say oh you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.960" end="00:48:35.920" style="s2">not good with</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.240" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">um social activism</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">because of that and then someone might</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.040" style="s2">come back and say oh well they shut down</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:43.280" style="s2">for two days</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.040" end="00:48:45.359" style="s2">a week later and retrained all their</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.280" end="00:48:46.640" style="s2">staff on cultural sensitivity and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.359" end="00:48:48.720" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.640" end="00:48:49.839" style="s2">so those two pieces of evidence would be</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.720" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">put in</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.839" end="00:48:53.920" style="s2">um so you know if there is no evidence</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:55.599" style="s2">whether they&#39;re good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.920" end="00:48:58.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything we can do</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.599" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">about that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.079" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">but where there is evidence now if if</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re going and you look at</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">those coffee things and you can see some</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">of the categories are like we rate</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:10.079" style="s2">this company high on on social but but</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">low</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.079" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">on um on environmentalism</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:18.800" style="s2">right then you can then say oh well i</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:20.960" style="s2">social is more important to me than</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.800" end="00:49:22.640" style="s2">environmentalism so i can like hit a</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.960" end="00:49:23.440" style="s2">button that says this is more important</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.640" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.440" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">and then the the list would then resort</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.480" style="s2">to show who&#39;s on top</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:31.599" style="s2">so that&#39;s the way i kind of envision</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.480" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">okay so it</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.599" end="00:49:35.680" style="s2">sounds like for the end user one of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.040" end="00:49:37.359" style="s2">lower</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.680" end="00:49:38.960" style="s2">or one of the lowest levels of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.359" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">like pieces of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.960" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">are the various news articles talking</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">about something right so yeah like for</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:44.559" style="s2">starbucks there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:46.400" style="s2">here&#39;s 10 news articles talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.559" end="00:49:48.000" style="s2">that situation where like i got i</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.400" end="00:49:49.920" style="s2">was like a barista called the cops on a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.000" end="00:49:50.800" style="s2">black guy who was just waiting in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.920" end="00:49:52.480" style="s2">starbucks</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.800" end="00:49:54.319" style="s2">for just for just being black and</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.480" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">waiting i guess right um</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.319" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">and then yes starbucks had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:49:58.960" style="s2">stories written about that that there</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:00.720" style="s2">was the blowback and then there was a</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.960" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">bunch of stories written about how</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.720" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">hey starbucks shut down for a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.599" style="s2">days and the various kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">sensitivity training</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.599" end="00:50:10.319" style="s2">um and so that and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:11.920" style="s2">i actually think that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.319" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">better sources that we have right now</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.920" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">are those kind of news articles and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:16.160" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:17.280" style="s2">grouping them together to say hey here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.160" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">something that a hundred different</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.280" end="00:50:20.000" style="s2">outlets</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.079" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">wrote about here&#39;s the 100 you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.000" end="00:50:23.119" style="s2">here&#39;s 100 articles that were written</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:25.040" style="s2">and here&#39;s that one thing that they</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.119" end="00:50:26.000" style="s2">wrote about and there&#39;s the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.040" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">whereas okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.000" end="00:50:29.680" style="s2">the incident and then there&#39;s the you</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">know what they did about it</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.680" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">and so there&#39;s these two separate things</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">backed up by a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">news articles right right but also</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:39.680" style="s2">someone could go in and look at their</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:40.720" style="s2">um quarterly earnings statements and say</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.680" end="00:50:41.760" style="s2">you know with the amount of money</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.720" end="00:50:43.119" style="s2">they&#39;re earning</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.760" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">and maybe somewhere in the statements</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.119" end="00:50:45.839" style="s2">they say what their average pay is for a</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:48.559" style="s2">barista</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.839" end="00:50:50.079" style="s2">they might say that&#39;s inappropriate and</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.559" end="00:50:51.680" style="s2">so that could be evidence right so</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.079" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s not a news article but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.680" end="00:50:55.440" style="s2">link it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">it&#39;s an internet link um you know and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.440" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:02.079" style="s2">maybe you post some videos of</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:03.760" style="s2">the um of the ceo on cnn</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.079" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">saying something about you know lying</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.760" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">about their company and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.280" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.000" end="00:51:09.839" style="s2">you know the the you know what snippets</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.280" end="00:51:12.480" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.839" end="00:51:13.359" style="s2">the you know mark zuckerberg in front of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.480" end="00:51:16.720" style="s2">congress</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.359" end="00:51:18.400" style="s2">right right um so all those things would</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.720" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">be kind of like evidence and you could</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.400" end="00:51:22.319" style="s2">say what</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:23.680" style="s2">feature that&#39;s affecting and and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.319" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">people can kind of debate</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.680" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">whether it should or should not affect</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:29.839" style="s2">it and how much it should affect it</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.119" end="00:51:31.359" style="s2">right that&#39;s my thought now i i think a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.839" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">lot of people may not be willing to put</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.359" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.920" end="00:51:35.520" style="s2">that level of information so there will</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.319" end="00:51:36.880" style="s2">be i imagine</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.520" end="00:51:38.559" style="s2">there would need to be i would rather</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.880" end="00:51:40.640" style="s2">not have it but i think we&#39;ll need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.559" end="00:51:41.839" style="s2">have just a popularity option so you can</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.640" end="00:51:43.200" style="s2">go and say oh i don&#39;t really like</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.839" end="00:51:45.200" style="s2">starbucks and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.200" end="00:51:46.319" style="s2">they say oh well tell us why you like it</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.200" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">is it because they&#39;re socially</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.319" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">responsible is it because they</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">you know so then you could rate each</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:52.640" style="s2">individual thing and then when you rate</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:54.400" style="s2">them maybe say oh do you have any</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.640" end="00:51:55.920" style="s2">evidence other than what we already have</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.400" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">and you could show if someone&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.920" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">posted news articles here what they have</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:01.520" style="s2">are we missing anything especially if</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:03.280" style="s2">their ratings differ from a majority of</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.520" end="00:52:05.119" style="s2">other people then you can say</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.280" end="00:52:06.880" style="s2">why what&#39;s the reason why you have that</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.119" end="00:52:08.720" style="s2">so you just kind of slowly</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.880" end="00:52:10.720" style="s2">uh bring them deeper into it if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.720" end="00:52:12.400" style="s2">willing to and then we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.720" end="00:52:13.839" style="s2">how the system could be abused and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.400" end="00:52:16.240" style="s2">figure that out but</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.839" end="00:52:18.160" style="s2">right that&#39;s the general idea yeah and i</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.240" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">i think that last part it like</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:21.839" style="s2">no matter what it has to go through a</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:24.480" style="s2">phase where it gets abused and we just</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.839" end="00:52:25.760" style="s2">you know kind of try to keep it mostly</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.480" end="00:52:26.720" style="s2">silent while we&#39;re trying to figure that</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.760" end="00:52:28.319" style="s2">part out and like</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.720" end="00:52:30.079" style="s2">don&#39;t publicize the outcome too much but</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.319" end="00:52:31.200" style="s2">we&#39;re like hey we started to collect</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.079" end="00:52:33.040" style="s2">this here&#39;s the prototype</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.200" end="00:52:34.240" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s fully able to be gamed</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.040" end="00:52:36.240" style="s2">right now and we&#39;re aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.240" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">like so do you see that flow also</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.240" end="00:52:40.160" style="s2">working for wiki election like</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:41.680" style="s2">and even whether you have your</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.160" end="00:52:42.960" style="s2">professionals but a public thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.680" end="00:52:44.839" style="s2">comes in let them</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.960" end="00:52:46.160" style="s2">just say what they like about their</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.839" end="00:52:48.240" style="s2">candidates</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.160" end="00:52:49.680" style="s2">and then another evidence on why they</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.240" end="00:52:51.839" style="s2">think the candidates are that way or</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.680" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">does that not work</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.839" end="00:52:55.680" style="s2">to an extent that&#39;s how it works my goal</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">is to sort of take</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.680" end="00:53:00.160" style="s2">the end of like the individual opinion i</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:01.839" style="s2">really only want</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.160" end="00:53:03.520" style="s2">at the level of like i have an opinion</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.839" end="00:53:04.480" style="s2">on what this piece of evidence means and</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.520" end="00:53:06.160" style="s2">sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.480" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">the outcome that people are saying that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.160" end="00:53:09.040" style="s2">this evidence means x is that true or</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.760" end="00:53:12.480" style="s2">not and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.040" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">what&#39;s your your uh either like your</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.480" end="00:53:15.040" style="s2">track record</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:17.040" style="s2">if you&#39;ve said you know that these 20</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.040" end="00:53:18.800" style="s2">past instances i like that and didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.040" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">like that do you 10 agree with the</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.800" end="00:53:24.240" style="s2">experts or not i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:28.319" style="s2">are you qualified in other ways um</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.240" end="00:53:29.760" style="s2">but very little about like trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.319" end="00:53:32.640" style="s2">an aggregate of like</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.760" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">somebody posting a comment and like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.640" end="00:53:35.920" style="s2">i guess starting from the evidence then</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">trying to figure out how to uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.920" end="00:53:39.839" style="s2">how to review it and then how to group</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:42.319" style="s2">it into various things</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.839" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">and for that i use the events like i</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.319" end="00:53:45.040" style="s2">talked about where for starbucks you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:46.640" style="s2">got okay here&#39;s the event</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.040" end="00:53:48.319" style="s2">of the cops being called here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.640" end="00:53:51.200" style="s2">event of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.319" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">you know the the training afterwards and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.200" end="00:53:53.280" style="s2">then the community would then sort of</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:55.119" style="s2">score</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.280" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">those events and then you can also do</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.119" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">scoring on the events for</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:00.400" style="s2">people said that this wasn&#39;t good but it</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:02.079" style="s2">also only had one news article written</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.400" end="00:54:04.559" style="s2">about it so we&#39;re not 100 sure</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.079" end="00:54:06.640" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening um and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.559" end="00:54:08.640" style="s2">you get deep into that okay well what</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.640" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">news outlets published that if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.640" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">five articles but they&#39;re all written</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:16.640" style="s2">by maybe less than reputable outlets</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:18.319" style="s2">how do you judge that but it in</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.640" end="00:54:18.960" style="s2">wikileaks it really all starts from the</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.319" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">evidence</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.960" end="00:54:22.480" style="s2">and then you start to group it and score</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:23.520" style="s2">it and review it and so on and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.480" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.520" end="00:54:26.640" style="s2">so yeah so the feature i didn&#39;t have in</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:30.400" style="s2">my list yet that you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.640" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">was or the big one was um experts</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.400" end="00:54:35.520" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.760" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">and then there were some other nuances</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.520" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">in there so we&#39;d have to see whether</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:39.520" style="s2">those nuances like i think the experts</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.520" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">would happen in all these things because</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">if you have someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">knows nutritional science then if</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">they&#39;re including that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.040" end="00:54:52.799" style="s2">that chemical in their food in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.960" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">ingredients list then that could be</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.799" end="00:54:55.760" style="s2">something that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.240" end="00:54:57.920" style="s2">and of course for the food piece the</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.760" end="00:54:59.760" style="s2">ingredients list is something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.920" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite fit with everything else i</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.760" end="00:55:05.200" style="s2">mean maybe that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">called an evidence and maybe that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.200" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">we can just shoehorn that into the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:09.200" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:11.040" style="s2">and then give it a different name on</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.200" end="00:55:12.720" style="s2">that site yeah i mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.040" end="00:55:15.920" style="s2">quite thought through all those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.720" end="00:55:17.359" style="s2">where hyperlogos would be useful</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.920" end="00:55:19.200" style="s2">where it&#39;s like you might have a section</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.359" end="00:55:21.599" style="s2">that has the evidence about</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.200" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">the um the individual ingredients is</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.599" end="00:55:24.319" style="s2">sort of like okay so</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re saying that aspartame is</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.319" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">healthy or not great then what are all</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:28.960" style="s2">the studies underlying that so anytime</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:30.559" style="s2">aspartame comes up</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.960" end="00:55:32.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this underlying bed of</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.559" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">information about that one ingredient</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.720" end="00:55:36.720" style="s2">that if you&#39;re referencing it in like</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:37.920" style="s2">okay i&#39;m not as concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.720" end="00:55:39.520" style="s2">company i just want to make sure i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.920" end="00:55:41.040" style="s2">eating something that&#39;s healthy</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.520" end="00:55:42.559" style="s2">okay great here&#39;s you know from what</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.040" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">you&#39;ve said and the kinds of sources</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.559" end="00:55:46.319" style="s2">that you trust and don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.760" style="s2">here&#39;s how the evidence currently boils</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.319" end="00:55:49.359" style="s2">down and based on the evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.760" end="00:55:50.960" style="s2">aspartame you know the community has</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.359" end="00:55:52.640" style="s2">shown that it&#39;s either safe or not safe</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.960" end="00:55:54.720" style="s2">or you know it&#39;s safe to eat but don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.640" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">inject it or however that information is</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.720" end="00:55:58.480" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">split out so the question comes down to</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.480" end="00:56:03.839" style="s2">is all these little nuances</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">for each community in each project</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.839" end="00:56:07.440" style="s2">going to be so different from the other</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.960" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.440" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">that how much code is actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.960" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">be able to be shared right</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">right so that would be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:16.640" style="s2">architecture and maybe in the first</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:19.040" style="s2">couple of things maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.640" end="00:56:20.000" style="s2">experts won&#39;t be in it or maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.040" end="00:56:22.880" style="s2">ingredients</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.000" end="00:56:24.880" style="s2">won&#39;t be in it on the food one although</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.880" end="00:56:28.000" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty core to it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.880" end="00:56:28.480" style="s2">but so i think we kind of have to map</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.000" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">out the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.480" end="00:56:33.040" style="s2">feature requirements and then seeing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">even though the names will differ</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.040" end="00:56:37.200" style="s2">the the core data structures if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:39.200" style="s2">similar enough it may not right</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.200" end="00:56:41.920" style="s2">matter whether it&#39;s an ingredient or or</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.200" end="00:56:45.200" style="s2">a feature for a website</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.920" end="00:56:47.680" style="s2">but but maybe it does so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.200" end="00:56:49.119" style="s2">i&#39;m wondering what uh i guess this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.680" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">mostly a question for</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.119" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">for bentley amatouche but like take</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:53.839" style="s2">something like the vote with your wallet</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.839" end="00:56:58.400" style="s2">build sort of like the really you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:57:00.240" style="s2">popsicle sticks and glue</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.400" end="00:57:02.240" style="s2">prototype that like were you know that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.240" end="00:57:03.920" style="s2">i&#39;m e effectively</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.240" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">working with matush to build full wiki</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.920" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">election knowing that that&#39;s not going</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.040" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">to be long term</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">i&#39;m making a bunch of design choices</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:11.119" style="s2">that aren&#39;t great for the long term and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:12.880" style="s2">that won&#39;t handle certain situations</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.119" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">but just to get a vibe for it and see</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.880" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">like what works any</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:18.000" style="s2">glaring issues and in the case of wiki</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:20.319" style="s2">election it&#39;s focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.000" end="00:57:22.000" style="s2">uh on politics and that in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.319" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">confronting it&#39;s focusing on sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.000" end="00:57:26.559" style="s2">organizations and the same type of</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">history that what will be available</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.559" end="00:57:30.480" style="s2">i wonder if the end goal is to start</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:32.240" style="s2">with that level of prototype for</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.480" end="00:57:33.440" style="s2">something like vote with your wallet</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.240" end="00:57:35.440" style="s2">don&#39;t worry about trying to tie them</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.440" end="00:57:36.880" style="s2">together at all and then meet up you</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.440" end="00:57:38.000" style="s2">know in three months and see what we</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.880" end="00:57:39.920" style="s2">have in common</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.000" end="00:57:41.520" style="s2">i start to like after once they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.920" end="00:57:42.480" style="s2">starting to to do stuff and then we say</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.520" end="00:57:44.400" style="s2">oh they overlapped</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.480" end="00:57:45.760" style="s2">great here not so great there and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.400" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">we can talk about the pros and cons of</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.760" end="00:57:48.559" style="s2">each</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">and could we overlap or should they keep</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.559" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">on their you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:54.240" style="s2">pads we&#39;re running out of time but my</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">almost</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.240" end="00:57:58.319" style="s2">feeling is because when things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.000" style="s2">when they&#39;re designed</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.319" end="00:58:01.760" style="s2">kind of separately like that you tend to</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.000" end="00:58:05.040" style="s2">make naming conventions</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.760" end="00:58:06.799" style="s2">and concepts that are different enough</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.040" end="00:58:07.760" style="s2">that&#39;d be really hard to recombine them</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.799" end="00:58:09.440" style="s2">in the end</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.760" end="00:58:11.119" style="s2">but if you say everyone&#39;s going to want</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.440" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">to have an entity that they vote on</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.119" end="00:58:15.040" style="s2">and attributes of those entities that</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">they vote on all of them do have that</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.040" end="00:58:18.960" style="s2">piece</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.319" style="s2">the evidence and the and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.960" end="00:58:21.680" style="s2">thing i don&#39;t know we got to look at</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.319" end="00:58:23.599" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.680" end="00:58:25.760" style="s2">that maybe just building up that piece</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.599" end="00:58:28.400" style="s2">and using it in all three</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.760" end="00:58:28.799" style="s2">um i that that would be my preferred</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.400" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">path</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.799" end="00:58:33.839" style="s2">right i i see so like</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.920" end="00:58:35.359" style="s2">have sort of a pre-planning prior to the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.839" end="00:58:37.359" style="s2">prototype so that we&#39;re at least</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.359" end="00:58:38.880" style="s2">more set up to follow the same general</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.359" end="00:58:40.079" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.880" end="00:58:41.760" style="s2">and then knowing that we&#39;ll still add</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.079" end="00:58:42.240" style="s2">things onto our prototypes that might be</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.760" end="00:58:43.440" style="s2">unique</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.240" end="00:58:45.040" style="s2">but at least you know like you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.440" end="00:58:46.319" style="s2">starting from people and organizations</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.040" end="00:58:48.720" style="s2">and positions and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.319" end="00:58:50.160" style="s2">the general structure of like so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.720" end="00:58:51.119" style="s2">talking the same language for if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.160" end="00:58:53.119" style="s2">trying to look at what</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.119" end="00:58:55.520" style="s2">person worked where and who donated what</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.119" end="00:58:58.559" style="s2">that there&#39;s hopefully some</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.520" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">yeah i think there&#39;s i think there is a</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.559" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:03.040" style="s2">of shared functionality that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">shared and then there&#39;s the more stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:06.079" style="s2">that we might want to figure</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:07.680" style="s2">out how to work together um so i&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.079" end="00:59:08.079" style="s2">to work on that core a little bit right</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.680" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">first</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.079" end="00:59:12.240" style="s2">okay hopefully i wonder and i know you</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.520" end="00:59:15.040" style="s2">guys were</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.240" end="00:59:16.640" style="s2">at the end but like the if an event</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.040" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">happens and it&#39;s newsworthy</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.640" end="00:59:20.400" style="s2">and then everyone covers it that gets a</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:22.319" style="s2">high score but if something&#39;s newsworthy</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.400" end="00:59:23.680" style="s2">and no one covers it because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.319" end="00:59:25.520" style="s2">happens in the media right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.680" end="00:59:26.559" style="s2">protest that like crickets nobody looked</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.520" end="00:59:29.280" style="s2">at it</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.559" end="00:59:30.480" style="s2">what no news source picked it up but</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.280" end="00:59:33.359" style="s2">there&#39;s hundreds of people with cell</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.480" end="00:59:36.880" style="s2">phones right it&#39;s it&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.359" end="00:59:37.839" style="s2">um and that is partly like my my focus</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.880" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">of starting with</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.839" end="00:59:41.680" style="s2">the ground base of the people but we</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:43.040" style="s2">don&#39;t have 10 000 people so that would</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.680" end="00:59:43.599" style="s2">be ridiculous for you guys to stop your</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.040" end="00:59:48.079" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.599" end="00:59:50.000" style="s2">for thousands of people that like how</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.079" end="00:59:51.440" style="s2">how the average person gets their</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.000" end="00:59:52.880" style="s2">information on food and how you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.440" end="00:59:54.480" style="s2">to trust it and how you get your</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.880" end="00:59:55.040" style="s2">information on politicians because</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.480" end="00:59:57.280" style="s2">politic</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.040" end="00:59:58.880" style="s2">they&#39;re very different like like science</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.280" end="01:00:00.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t want news articles i want it</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.880" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">back to the scientific article</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.880" end="01:00:04.160" style="s2">politicians there&#39;s no scientific</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:05.119" style="s2">article it is was it covered in the news</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.160" end="01:00:07.119" style="s2">and was it spoken</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.119" end="01:00:08.640" style="s2">at you know like actually recorded and</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.119" end="01:00:11.599" style="s2">spoken in the votes and stuff</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.640" end="01:00:13.040" style="s2">so it&#39;s like back to the evidence like</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.599" end="01:00:14.720" style="s2">none of the evidence would i trust would</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.040" end="01:00:16.160" style="s2">be like well this was covered 500 times</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.720" end="01:00:17.680" style="s2">in the news because i</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.160" end="01:00:20.240" style="s2">already the news that&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.680" end="01:00:22.079" style="s2">fixing like it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.240" end="01:00:23.599" style="s2">that like the amount of times it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.079" end="01:00:25.280" style="s2">covered in the news is not the same as</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.599" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">the amount of times that a</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.280" end="01:00:28.400" style="s2">peer-reviewed article has sourced</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:29.119" style="s2">another one revised and even that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.400" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">broken</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.119" end="01:00:32.160" style="s2">but like the bigger picture of that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">like well</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.160" end="01:00:35.920" style="s2">yeah i can link to that story first of</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:38.160" style="s2">all that starbucks guy</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.920" end="01:00:40.079" style="s2">starbucks didn&#39;t say go kick him out an</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.160" end="01:00:41.760" style="s2">employee said i&#39;m going to pick him up</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.079" end="01:00:42.960" style="s2">starbucks response didn&#39;t fire that</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.760" end="01:00:45.760" style="s2">employee they&#39;re like we&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.960" end="01:00:47.920" style="s2">training for everyone</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.760" end="01:00:49.680" style="s2">like it&#39;s like well did they do did</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.920" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">starbucks do wrong</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.680" end="01:00:53.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t know starbucks do right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">yeah like it&#39;s like you know like</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.920" end="01:00:57.440" style="s2">but as a society we focus on no</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.000" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">starbucks kicked the guy out in</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.440" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">starbucks</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:03.359" style="s2">right but the in the system is the</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:06.799" style="s2">ability to rate</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.359" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">the evidence and debate it so nowhere</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.799" end="01:01:10.480" style="s2">would we say oh the frequency of newer</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:13.599" style="s2">articles have any</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.480" end="01:01:15.760" style="s2">bearing on it or we would say oh we</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.599" end="01:01:17.599" style="s2">trust studies more than others that will</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.760" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">come out of the wash because the system</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.599" end="01:01:21.599" style="s2">says you could link anything</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:23.200" style="s2">so like you said no news coverage well</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.599" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">there&#39;s youtube videos so you link a</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.200" end="01:01:28.960" style="s2">youtube video</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">yeah um so yeah so it&#39;s unrelated to</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.960" end="01:01:33.920" style="s2">the media the media just happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">one of the sources</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.920" end="01:01:37.520" style="s2">and i think for something like the</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:38.799" style="s2">protests you&#39;re going to end up with a</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.520" end="01:01:40.319" style="s2">huge amount of both</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.799" end="01:01:41.920" style="s2">and a lot of them won&#39;t agree with each</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.319" end="01:01:42.559" style="s2">other and then that&#39;s where the review</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.920" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.559" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">on you know if you had an article about</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:48.000" style="s2">the black lives matter protest in the us</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.559" style="s2">you would end up with a thousand news</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.000" end="01:01:52.799" style="s2">articles and 500 000 youtube videos</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.559" end="01:01:54.319" style="s2">yeah and then it&#39;s like okay so now you</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.799" end="01:01:55.760" style="s2">kind of go through and find</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.319" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">the common findings and you have some</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.760" end="01:01:58.720" style="s2">people go through and start to flag out</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:00.640" style="s2">to like</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.720" end="01:02:02.559" style="s2">okay i&#39;m just going to pull up with no</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.640" end="01:02:03.440" style="s2">context just the instances of police</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.559" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">brutality</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.440" end="01:02:06.880" style="s2">then you&#39;re gonna have somebody else</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:08.079" style="s2">going and pull up just the the writers</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.880" end="01:02:09.359" style="s2">doing bad things</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.079" end="01:02:10.799" style="s2">and then if everyone&#39;s doing it with the</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.359" end="01:02:11.599" style="s2">same source you can start to be like</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.799" end="01:02:13.039" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.599" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">here&#39;s what the different sides are</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.039" end="01:02:15.520" style="s2">doing and then you can pull it back and</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:17.520" style="s2">say like okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.520" end="01:02:18.960" style="s2">now let&#39;s add some context to those</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.520" end="01:02:20.559" style="s2">videos and let&#39;s start to see</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.960" end="01:02:22.079" style="s2">what numbers are we talking about</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.559" end="01:02:22.400" style="s2">because if there&#39;s you know 10 of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.079" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.400" end="01:02:25.760" style="s2">you know 10 instances of police</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:28.319" style="s2">brutality and 10 rioters</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.760" end="01:02:29.440" style="s2">and a million protesters like oh maybe</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.319" end="01:02:30.799" style="s2">the extremes aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.440" end="01:02:32.960" style="s2">actually driving this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.799" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">despite what people are saying</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.960" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">or if one you know is ten percent one is</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:38.559" style="s2">one percent you&#39;re like oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:40.559" style="s2">one side is obviously clear you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.559" end="01:02:42.319" style="s2">clearly worse here</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.559" end="01:02:43.520" style="s2">but if like even in the riots and i</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.319" end="01:02:44.559" style="s2">agree that those numbers probably</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.520" end="01:02:47.839" style="s2">showcase very</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.559" end="01:02:49.039" style="s2">heavily one way that actually no it</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.839" end="01:02:51.359" style="s2">helps both sides</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.039" end="01:02:52.400" style="s2">that like you don&#39;t know the cops or the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.359" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">cops when they&#39;re quitting police</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.400" end="01:02:55.119" style="s2">brutality you don&#39;t know protesters or</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.920" end="01:02:56.400" style="s2">protesters when they&#39;re committing the</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.119" end="01:02:58.000" style="s2">violence right so</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.400" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">how do i know that was a cop and not</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.000" end="01:02:59.680" style="s2">just somebody who wanted you to think</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:00.960" style="s2">cops are</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.680" end="01:03:02.240" style="s2">having police brutality that&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.960" end="01:03:03.680" style="s2">likely to happen because there&#39;s a much</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.240" end="01:03:06.319" style="s2">higher legal precedent</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.680" end="01:03:07.760" style="s2">than the cops getting in black all black</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.319" end="01:03:09.440" style="s2">right and being like we&#39;ll just smash</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.760" end="01:03:10.640" style="s2">the windows and start some fires that</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.440" end="01:03:12.079" style="s2">everyone else does</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.640" end="01:03:13.839" style="s2">that it one it happened and there was</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.079" end="01:03:16.400" style="s2">one incident and a human being</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.839" end="01:03:17.839" style="s2">started this fire now how do we know</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.400" end="01:03:19.039" style="s2">whether they&#39;re you know this or that</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.839" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.039" end="01:03:23.520" style="s2">for me any sense making tool is owning</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:25.280" style="s2">that well we don&#39;t know how to own that</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.520" end="01:03:26.960" style="s2">right like we know what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.280" end="01:03:29.119" style="s2">the protest we know they&#39;re happening</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.960" end="01:03:30.319" style="s2">maybe maybe because the media&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.119" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">covering them as much as they could</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.319" end="01:03:32.559" style="s2">if there&#39;s something there but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:34.559" style="s2">like three minutes pass should we end</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.559" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">this or should we continue</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.559" end="01:03:40.960" style="s2">recording i think yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:42.640" style="s2">all right thanks misery thanks people</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.960" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">for showing up for the two</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.640" end="01:03:45.839" style="s2">2 p.m one the same</p>
