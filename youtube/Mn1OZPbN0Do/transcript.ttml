<p begin="00:01:02.850" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">cracks in the ivory tower the moral mess</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.550" end="00:01:09.899" style="s2">of higher education and I must say one</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:11.210" style="s2">of the reasons I would reach out to</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.899" end="00:01:13.890" style="s2">Jason&#39;s not only were the books</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.210" end="00:01:16.740" style="s2">inherently interesting but also his</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.890" end="00:01:18.750" style="s2">style is definitely a bit of a bomb</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.740" end="00:01:20.910" style="s2">thrower he says it&#39;s like he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.750" end="00:01:22.709" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold back and that&#39;s as our</p>

<p begin="00:01:22.709" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">on the gym rut show before we get</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.990" end="00:01:29.369" style="s2">started though on those two topics I</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:32.069" style="s2">would like you to talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.369" end="00:01:34.020" style="s2">about how you ended up at a business</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.069" end="00:01:36.030" style="s2">school looking at your educational</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.020" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">background your publishing background</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.030" end="00:01:41.190" style="s2">clearly a philosopher by training with</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:42.239" style="s2">some work in political science what</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.190" end="00:01:44.160" style="s2">brought you to the business school</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.239" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">certainly that was not the case in my</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.160" end="00:01:47.009" style="s2">day when I went attended the Sloan</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:49.319" style="s2">Business School we didn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.009" end="00:01:49.979" style="s2">philosophers running around loose yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.319" end="00:01:51.840" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.979" end="00:01:53.340" style="s2">well my entire department here at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.840" end="00:01:55.979" style="s2">McDonough School of Business is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.340" end="00:01:57.660" style="s2">like the island of misfit toys and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.979" end="00:01:59.640" style="s2">wish I had like a really nice story to</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.660" end="00:02:01.349" style="s2">the effect of I realize that business</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.640" end="00:02:03.000" style="s2">education is the way to go and I just</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.349" end="00:02:05.610" style="s2">love business education but in reality</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.000" end="00:02:07.319" style="s2">it&#39;s just pure greed business schools</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:09.750" style="s2">pay a higher salary than liberal arts</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.319" end="00:02:11.400" style="s2">colleges so at a certain point my my</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.750" end="00:02:14.250" style="s2">wife was pregnant with our second kid we</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.400" end="00:02:16.590" style="s2">wanted her to be able to basically quit</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.250" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">working and be a full-time mom and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.590" end="00:02:19.230" style="s2">realized if I worked in a business</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">school we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.230" end="00:02:23.790" style="s2">money anymore so I turned down other</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:26.069" style="s2">offers left my former University and</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.790" end="00:02:27.719" style="s2">came here so yeah that&#39;s it I&#39;m in a</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.069" end="00:02:29.430" style="s2">political economy Department and a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.719" end="00:02:31.260" style="s2">of the people here are transplants from</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.430" end="00:02:33.329" style="s2">the Social Sciences or from philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.260" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">and law and things like that find it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.329" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">good place to be but ultimately it was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:40.140" style="s2">desire to chase the money rather than</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:43.680" style="s2">something more noble I like it a good</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.140" end="00:02:45.959" style="s2">honest answer on why not what a concept</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.680" end="00:02:47.939" style="s2">what a final thing before we hop into</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.959" end="00:02:49.829" style="s2">the books is you&#39;ve posted quite a</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.939" end="00:02:52.530" style="s2">little bit on the bleeding heart</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.829" end="00:02:54.810" style="s2">libertarian blog I thought it might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.530" end="00:02:56.760" style="s2">useful provided just a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.810" end="00:02:58.920" style="s2">positioning kind of on your macro</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.760" end="00:03:01.049" style="s2">perspective is that still something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.920" end="00:03:02.900" style="s2">you more or less adhere to and how would</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.049" end="00:03:05.849" style="s2">you describe what a bleeding-heart</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.900" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">libertarian is yeah good question</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.849" end="00:03:10.470" style="s2">so I think in the middle of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:11.939" style="s2">century you had a lot of left-wing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.470" end="00:03:13.620" style="s2">kind of socialist thinkers saying</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.939" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">something to the effect of well the</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.620" end="00:03:16.919" style="s2">reason you should advocate socialism or</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:18.840" style="s2">the reason you should advocate massive</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.919" end="00:03:21.180" style="s2">redistribution is because it&#39;s really to</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.840" end="00:03:22.500" style="s2">everybody&#39;s benefit and it imbues people</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.180" end="00:03:24.540" style="s2">with the power to lead the lot their</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.500" end="00:03:27.419" style="s2">lives they see fit and then you saw</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.540" end="00:03:29.489" style="s2">certain libertarians pretty much taking</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.419" end="00:03:31.229" style="s2">the bait and saying well it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.489" end="00:03:33.690" style="s2">socialism does that or at least it aims</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.229" end="00:03:35.340" style="s2">to but in reality we just we have these</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.690" end="00:03:36.870" style="s2">rights against each other and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.340" end="00:03:39.239" style="s2">respect those rights come what may</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.870" end="00:03:41.190" style="s2">regardless of the consequences which</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.239" end="00:03:43.979" style="s2">pretty much concedes the moral high</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.190" end="00:03:45.120" style="s2">ground to people on the other side but I</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.979" end="00:03:47.159" style="s2">thought it was really perplexing</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.120" end="00:03:49.500" style="s2">response because there isn&#39;t evidence</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.159" end="00:03:51.780" style="s2">that socialism works as intended and in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.500" end="00:03:54.269" style="s2">fact market oriented societies do a much</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.780" end="00:03:56.340" style="s2">better job of delivering the goods to</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.269" end="00:03:58.079" style="s2">the poor than the alternatives so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.340" end="00:04:00.540" style="s2">think what bleeding-heart libertarianism</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.079" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">is is actually the mainline of classical</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.540" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">liberal thinking over the past few</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:06.359" style="s2">hundred years if you start with John</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:08.040" style="s2">Locke and Adam Smith and so on and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.359" end="00:04:09.599" style="s2">look at what they were saying you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.040" end="00:04:11.939" style="s2">and Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.599" end="00:04:14.489" style="s2">Nations he was revolutionising the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.939" end="00:04:16.859" style="s2">that we think about prosperity by saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.489" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">that the measurement of prosperity is</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.859" end="00:04:20.849" style="s2">not how big the king&#39;s army is or how</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:22.889" style="s2">much money is in his Treasury but the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.849" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">opportunity and welfare available to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.889" end="00:04:26.159" style="s2">average person so I think what</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:28.919" style="s2">bleeding-heart libertarians are saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.159" end="00:04:31.050" style="s2">is freedom economic freedom civil</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.919" end="00:04:32.909" style="s2">liberty and so on are important like as</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.050" end="00:04:35.760" style="s2">a way of respecting people yes but also</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.909" end="00:04:37.590" style="s2">they work they deliver the goods and it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.760" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">matters that they deliver the goods</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.590" end="00:04:41.340" style="s2">all right that sounds good I would like</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">to point out that not only did Adam</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.340" end="00:04:45.270" style="s2">Smith write The Wealth of Nations but</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:46.940" style="s2">about the same time soon thereafter he</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.270" end="00:04:49.500" style="s2">publishes Theory of Moral Sentiments</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.940" end="00:04:51.510" style="s2">which he backed away a little bit from</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.500" end="00:04:53.580" style="s2">some of his arguments in The Wealth of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.510" end="00:04:55.980" style="s2">Nations and it&#39;s good to consider that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.580" end="00:04:58.920" style="s2">Adam Smith had other aspects other than</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.980" end="00:05:01.380" style="s2">the way he&#39;s often portrayed by you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.920" end="00:05:03.240" style="s2">sort of classic neoliberals mm-hmm I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.380" end="00:05:05.220" style="s2">also point out for our listeners and</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.240" end="00:05:08.460" style="s2">we&#39;ll have a link up on our website on</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.220" end="00:05:10.890" style="s2">this that I recently engaged in a letter</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.460" end="00:05:13.560" style="s2">wiki exchange was a really cool new</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.890" end="00:05:15.420" style="s2">website where thinkers on opposite sides</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.560" end="00:05:18.170" style="s2">of issues can exchange some one-on-one</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.420" end="00:05:20.370" style="s2">letters in public view and my</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.370" end="00:05:26.580" style="s2">written on libertarianism and what he</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.640" end="00:05:28.260" style="s2">calls liberal anarchy and I took the</p>

<p begin="00:07:50.880" end="00:07:55.950" style="s2">was in Sao Paulo Brazil watching two</p>

<p begin="00:07:55.950" end="00:08:00.000" style="s2">other and they had to separate the fans</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.080" end="00:08:01.740" style="s2">into opposite sides of the stadium put</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.000" end="00:08:03.900" style="s2">up large metal barricades that had</p>

<p begin="00:08:03.900" end="00:08:07.350" style="s2">metal barricades around the stadium and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.700" end="00:08:09.480" style="s2">they separated fans so that you had to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.350" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">basically walk about two kilometers to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.480" end="00:08:12.660" style="s2">get from one side of the stadium to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:14.670" style="s2">other and that&#39;s because the fans would</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.660" end="00:08:17.070" style="s2">fight each other they they rapidly hate</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.670" end="00:08:19.230" style="s2">one another nothing about sports fans is</p>

<p begin="00:08:19.230" end="00:08:23.340" style="s2">but they&#39;re also extremely biased so if</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.630" end="00:08:25.290" style="s2">you think about say Tom Brady being</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.340" end="00:08:27.180" style="s2">accused of deflating footballs back a</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.290" end="00:08:29.010" style="s2">few years ago people from the New</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.760" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">the same amount of information but we</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.440" end="00:08:38.880" style="s2">interpret that information in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:40.380" style="s2">flatters what we&#39;d like to believe and</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:42.510" style="s2">they&#39;re also sports fans often can</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.380" end="00:08:43.740" style="s2">recount lots and lots of facts about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.510" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">games they can tell you what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.740" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">the World Series a couple years ago or</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:48.600" style="s2">they can tell you what would happen in</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:50.820" style="s2">the World Cup from 40 years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.600" end="00:08:53.070" style="s2">again they&#39;re biased so the political</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.820" end="00:08:55.050" style="s2">analog of that would be the typical</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.070" end="00:08:56.730" style="s2">citizen who chooses to vote when we</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.050" end="00:08:59.280" style="s2">study those people especially people who</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.730" end="00:09:01.440" style="s2">vote persistently we find that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.280" end="00:09:03.390" style="s2">often significantly better informed they</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.440" end="00:09:05.130" style="s2">do know at least some of the basic facts</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.390" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">but there</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.130" end="00:09:09.240" style="s2">extremely biased they only look for new</p>

<p begin="00:12:14.670" end="00:12:19.030" style="s2">irrational could you share a few of</p>

<p begin="00:12:19.030" end="00:12:23.380" style="s2">basically since 1958 there been these</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.730" end="00:12:24.670" style="s2">studies have been conducted by large</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.380" end="00:12:26.920" style="s2">numbers of different peoples including</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.930" end="00:12:32.290" style="s2">called the American national election</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.310" end="00:12:33.580" style="s2">studies and what it tests it&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.290" end="00:12:35.560" style="s2">every other year and what it tests</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.580" end="00:12:38.410" style="s2">varies from year to year but in most</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.560" end="00:12:40.960" style="s2">versions of this they give voters a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.410" end="00:12:43.150" style="s2">battery of questions like just basic</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.960" end="00:12:44.860" style="s2">things like who&#39;s the president who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.150" end="00:12:47.200" style="s2">the vice president who controls Congress</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.860" end="00:12:49.180" style="s2">can you identify the unemployment rate</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.200" end="00:12:51.760" style="s2">and so on the funny thing about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.180" end="00:12:53.710" style="s2">test isn&#39;t in a very zr2 year but on</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.760" end="00:12:55.150" style="s2">average what you find is it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.710" end="00:12:57.130" style="s2">multiple-choice test and when people</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.150" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">don&#39;t know the answer they guess and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.130" end="00:13:01.540" style="s2">typically find that roughly the top 25</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:03.850" style="s2">percent of voters get kind of like an</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.540" end="00:13:06.370" style="s2">a-minus on the test the next sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.850" end="00:13:09.070" style="s2">middle 50% do sort of equivalent to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.370" end="00:13:11.470" style="s2">chance and the bottom 25% do worse than</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.070" end="00:13:12.760" style="s2">chance so that means we they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.470" end="00:13:14.620" style="s2">actually doing worse than just random</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.760" end="00:13:17.710" style="s2">guessing they&#39;re systematically mistaken</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.620" end="00:13:20.260" style="s2">you know so like 1996 the bottom 25% of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.710" end="00:13:22.420" style="s2">voters were pretty convinced that Bob</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.260" end="00:13:24.400" style="s2">Dole was more liberal than Bill Clinton</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.420" end="00:13:25.450" style="s2">they didn&#39;t know which party was they</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.400" end="00:13:27.520" style="s2">thought the Democrats were more</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.450" end="00:13:29.440" style="s2">conservative than the Republicans people</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.520" end="00:13:31.630" style="s2">overestimate things like the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.440" end="00:13:32.110" style="s2">money that&#39;s spent on foreign aid in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.630" end="00:13:34.269" style="s2">break</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.110" end="00:13:36.850" style="s2">vote they overestimate the number of</p>

<p begin="00:13:36.850" end="00:13:40.630" style="s2">it&#39;s only about 5% of the population but</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.890" end="00:13:42.730" style="s2">the lis voters thought of something like</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.630" end="00:13:45.850" style="s2">30% and the remain motors thought it was</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.730" end="00:13:48.519" style="s2">about 20% if I remember correctly in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.850" end="00:13:50.709" style="s2">1964 during that version of that test</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.519" end="00:13:53.050" style="s2">they asked people they knew whether the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.709" end="00:13:54.910" style="s2">USSR was part of NATO and a large</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.050" end="00:13:57.190" style="s2">percentage people don&#39;t in a given year</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.910" end="00:13:59.050" style="s2">most voters these are voters not just</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.190" end="00:14:00.820" style="s2">non motors most voters don&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.050" end="00:14:02.079" style="s2">the representative is to Congress and</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.820" end="00:14:04.990" style="s2">they don&#39;t know which party controls</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.079" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">Congress it&#39;s pretty much for almost any</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.990" end="00:14:08.920" style="s2">fact you can think of the voters don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:10.269" style="s2">know it other than who the president is</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.920" end="00:14:12.970" style="s2">they usually get that and they usually</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.269" end="00:14:15.160" style="s2">have about six months worth of memory in</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.970" end="00:14:16.209" style="s2">terms of economic performance they know</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.160" end="00:14:17.890" style="s2">whether the economy has been getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.209" end="00:14:19.329" style="s2">better or worse over the last six months</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.890" end="00:14:21.850" style="s2">but don&#39;t remember anything beyond that</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.329" end="00:14:23.170" style="s2">and that&#39;s just on basic information the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.850" end="00:14:25.300" style="s2">kind of stuff that you could google</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.170" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">easily but sometimes knowing even the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.300" end="00:14:28.570" style="s2">basic facts isn&#39;t that helpful because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:30.700" style="s2">mean imagine I have two political</p>

<p begin="00:14:39.550" end="00:14:42.130" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t tell you how to vote</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.630" end="00:14:43.750" style="s2">because you need to know something about</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.130" end="00:14:45.850" style="s2">economics in order to understand which</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.940" end="00:14:57.480" style="s2">worse because we&#39;re also extremely</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.370" end="00:14:59.350" style="s2">biased in how we process information so</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.480" end="00:15:01.209" style="s2">we have something called dis</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.350" end="00:15:03.310" style="s2">confirmation bias which means that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.209" end="00:15:05.140" style="s2">ignore evidence that goes against what</p>

<p begin="00:15:09.370" end="00:15:14.019" style="s2">we have a kind of intergroup bias where</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.829" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">we see ourselves as members of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.019" end="00:15:18.610" style="s2">political tribe and we tend to just go</p>

<p begin="00:15:18.610" end="00:15:21.910" style="s2">really nice book called democracy for</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.320" end="00:15:24.250" style="s2">realist provides a lot of evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.910" end="00:15:25.899" style="s2">this kind of behavior but the the story</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.250" end="00:15:28.000" style="s2">that your sixth grade civics teacher</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.899" end="00:15:30.670" style="s2">told you about democracy goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.000" end="00:15:33.250" style="s2">people have a set of opinions and a set</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.670" end="00:15:35.199" style="s2">of values they then learn how the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.250" end="00:15:36.850" style="s2">works and they form a political ideology</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.199" end="00:15:39.070" style="s2">that&#39;s supposed to express how you</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.850" end="00:15:40.120" style="s2">realize those values in the world then</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.070" end="00:15:42.069" style="s2">they look at the various political</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.120" end="00:15:43.750" style="s2">parties and candidates on offer and they</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.069" end="00:15:45.970" style="s2">pick the one that best corresponds to</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.750" end="00:15:47.410" style="s2">their ideology they vote every</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.970" end="00:15:49.899" style="s2">votes this way we get a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.410" end="00:15:52.000" style="s2">compromise position and then our will is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.899" end="00:15:54.370" style="s2">expressed through democracy that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.000" end="00:15:54.879" style="s2">almost certainly false like all of it is</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.370" end="00:15:57.310" style="s2">false</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.879" end="00:15:59.230" style="s2">rather for the typical voter it&#39;s more</p>

<p begin="00:16:43.629" end="00:16:46.720" style="s2">what you end up doing is you find out</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.610" end="00:16:48.339" style="s2">what your party believes and you</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.720" end="00:16:50.079" style="s2">convince yourself that you agree with it</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.339" end="00:16:51.610" style="s2">and we know that they&#39;re convincing</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.079" end="00:16:53.740" style="s2">themselves they&#39;re really rationalizing</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.610" end="00:16:55.420" style="s2">it because when the party changes they</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.740" end="00:16:57.339" style="s2">will change their mind but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:16:58.389" style="s2">know that they have so I&#39;m not here to</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.339" end="00:17:00.309" style="s2">pick on the Republicans the Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.389" end="00:17:02.620" style="s2">are just as bad when it comes to this</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.309" end="00:17:04.329" style="s2">but a nice example is what happened with</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.620" end="00:17:07.089" style="s2">free trade and Republicans in the last</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.329" end="00:17:09.039" style="s2">set of elections before the primaries</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.089" end="00:17:10.630" style="s2">most Republicans who had an opinion</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.039" end="00:17:12.520" style="s2">about trade said they were Pro free</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.630" end="00:17:14.890" style="s2">trade Trump becomes the presumptive</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.520" end="00:17:17.650" style="s2">nominee and then suddenly in about a one</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.890" end="00:17:19.240" style="s2">month period polls show that Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.650" end="00:17:21.280" style="s2">switch from being Pro free-trade to Pro</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.240" end="00:17:22.839" style="s2">protectionism okay well maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.280" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">change their minds maybe Trump made a</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.839" end="00:17:26.890" style="s2">good argument but you even asked them in</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:28.809" style="s2">polls why did you change your mind why</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.890" end="00:17:30.580" style="s2">did you switch and their answer was no</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.809" end="00:17:32.080" style="s2">no I didn&#39;t switch I&#39;ve always thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.580" end="00:17:34.450" style="s2">that if you don&#39;t mind other good</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.080" end="00:17:37.360" style="s2">example that one from history was the</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.450" end="00:17:40.150" style="s2">Communist Party USA they famously hated</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.360" end="00:17:42.520" style="s2">the Germans and then the Nazis right up</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.150" end="00:17:43.929" style="s2">until the non-aggression pact between</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.520" end="00:17:45.309" style="s2">the Russians and the Germans and</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.929" end="00:17:47.140" style="s2">suddenly the Germans became their</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.309" end="00:17:50.679" style="s2">buddies absolutely happens all the time</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.140" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">anyway continue yeah so to go along with</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.679" end="00:17:54.820" style="s2">the sports analogy because I think the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:56.260" style="s2">psychology of political behavior is very</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.820" end="00:17:57.760" style="s2">similar to the psychology of sports</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.260" end="00:17:59.300" style="s2">fandom they&#39;re they&#39;re almost identical</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.760" end="00:18:01.790" style="s2">really</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.300" end="00:18:03.950" style="s2">think about Tom Brady again I&#39;m from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.790" end="00:18:05.630" style="s2">New England area and people from my area</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.950" end="00:18:06.740" style="s2">they worship Tom Brady and they think</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.630" end="00:18:08.990" style="s2">he&#39;s the greatest ball player of all</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.740" end="00:18:10.280" style="s2">time I agree I think they&#39;re right I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.990" end="00:18:13.010" style="s2">think there&#39;s objective evidence of that</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.280" end="00:18:15.080" style="s2">but imagine that Tom Brady gets on the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.010" end="00:18:16.430" style="s2">TV today and says you know what I&#39;m sick</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.080" end="00:18:18.020" style="s2">of playing for the Patriots I&#39;m sick of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.430" end="00:18:19.880" style="s2">Belichick and I hate New England your</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.020" end="00:18:22.520" style="s2">ball bunch of jerks I&#39;m gonna move too</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.880" end="00:18:25.010" style="s2">and work for the Jets instead well Tommy</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.520" end="00:18:27.140" style="s2">down at the local pub who yesterday said</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.010" end="00:18:29.660" style="s2">that tom was to go like he&#39;s gonna now</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.140" end="00:18:31.580" style="s2">say that tom has always been overrated</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.660" end="00:18:33.440" style="s2">that he was never that good he&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.580" end="00:18:35.000" style="s2">being carried by the team and when you</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.440" end="00:18:36.320" style="s2">ask him it like well didn&#39;t you disagree</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.000" end="00:18:38.300" style="s2">with that last week he&#39;s gonna go none</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.320" end="00:18:39.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve always thought that and he&#39;ll he&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.300" end="00:18:41.240" style="s2">be sincere he&#39;ll genuinely think that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.800" end="00:18:42.590" style="s2">he&#39;s always said that even though in</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.240" end="00:18:45.710" style="s2">fact he&#39;s changed his mind</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.590" end="00:18:47.240" style="s2">so the typical voter for the Democrats</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.710" end="00:18:48.440" style="s2">Republicans who even knows what those</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.240" end="00:18:51.110" style="s2">people are teased stand for they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.440" end="00:18:53.060" style="s2">behaving that way it&#39;s not that you vote</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.110" end="00:18:54.470" style="s2">Democrat because you&#39;re pro-choice it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.060" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">more like you&#39;re pro-choice because</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.470" end="00:18:58.550" style="s2">you&#39;re a Democrat it&#39;s not that you are</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:19:00.200" style="s2">against immigration because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.550" end="00:19:01.640" style="s2">you&#39;re Republican because you&#39;re against</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.200" end="00:19:03.290" style="s2">immigration but rather you&#39;re against</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.640" end="00:19:05.930" style="s2">immigration because you&#39;re a Republican</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.290" end="00:19:07.820" style="s2">I think that&#39;s probably true for a whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.930" end="00:19:09.410" style="s2">lot of particularly the more inside</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:10.940" style="s2">baseball issues like for instance</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.410" end="00:19:12.800" style="s2">protectionism and trade but there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.940" end="00:19:15.170" style="s2">some certainly some hot-button issues</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.800" end="00:19:17.210" style="s2">people seem to have strong and abiding</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.170" end="00:19:18.950" style="s2">opinions about and I&#39;ve actually caused</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.210" end="00:19:20.660" style="s2">them to move parties rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.950" end="00:19:22.760" style="s2">other way around think I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.660" end="00:19:25.460" style="s2">about things like abortion and gun</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.760" end="00:19:26.870" style="s2">control or two that hop out yeah even</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.460" end="00:19:28.400" style="s2">then they&#39;re if you read that akin in</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:30.260" style="s2">Bartels book they&#39;ll talk about those</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.400" end="00:19:32.540" style="s2">issues and the idea of the single issue</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.260" end="00:19:35.480" style="s2">voter and they provide a lot of evidence</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.540" end="00:19:37.520" style="s2">that people like all the sudden groups</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.480" end="00:19:39.410" style="s2">will just switch almost overnight they</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.520" end="00:19:40.910" style="s2">go from being like they&#39;re evangelicals</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.410" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">and in a certain year they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.910" end="00:19:44.180" style="s2">any concern for abortion at all it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:47.750" style="s2">an issue and then all of a sudden it</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.180" end="00:19:50.030" style="s2">becomes a leading issue for them so one</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.750" end="00:19:52.520" style="s2">way to think about how what political</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.030" end="00:19:55.490" style="s2">beliefs do for us is think about</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.520" end="00:19:56.690" style="s2">circumcision with Jews and there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.490" end="00:19:59.030" style="s2">of other examples but that&#39;s just a case</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.690" end="00:20:01.520" style="s2">of everyone knows why do you have this</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.030" end="00:20:03.650" style="s2">ritual that you slice off a part of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.520" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">boy&#39;s penis at a certain age well what</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.650" end="00:20:06.530" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re proving that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:08.630" style="s2">are a member of the group it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.530" end="00:20:11.000" style="s2">expensive signal that proves sincerity</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.630" end="00:20:12.830" style="s2">and it turns out that using these</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.000" end="00:20:14.630" style="s2">expensive signals is a very good</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.830" end="00:20:16.429" style="s2">way of like making groups cohere with</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.630" end="00:20:17.720" style="s2">one another because it weeds out people</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.429" end="00:20:19.340" style="s2">that aren&#39;t properly committed to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.720" end="00:20:21.289" style="s2">group it shows that you can trust them</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.340" end="00:20:23.120" style="s2">another example is why do we give</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.289" end="00:20:25.730" style="s2">engagement rings when we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.120" end="00:20:27.230" style="s2">married well if you go up if I say to my</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.730" end="00:20:29.179" style="s2">wife you know hey we&#39;re driving in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.230" end="00:20:31.010" style="s2">car and I&#39;m like as we&#39;re dating I say</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.179" end="00:20:32.149" style="s2">what you know should we get married she</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.010" end="00:20:33.950" style="s2">doesn&#39;t know if I&#39;m very sincere about</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.149" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">that but if I then come to her and I say</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.950" end="00:20:39.409" style="s2">look I&#39;ve wasted many thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:41.510" style="s2">dollars on a useless trinket and I want</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.409" end="00:20:43.279" style="s2">you to marry me she&#39;s like wow he wasted</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.510" end="00:20:45.289" style="s2">all that money on nothing he must be</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.279" end="00:20:48.470" style="s2">sincere it&#39;s a proof of my sincerity</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.289" end="00:20:50.029" style="s2">so these signaling mechanisms they</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.470" end="00:20:51.590" style="s2">abound all over the world and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.029" end="00:20:53.720" style="s2">very effective in getting groups to work</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.590" end="00:20:55.610" style="s2">together there&#39;s good evidence that a</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.720" end="00:20:57.559" style="s2">lot of our political beliefs serve the</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.610" end="00:20:59.929" style="s2">function of being an expensive signal</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.559" end="00:21:01.429" style="s2">you believe stuff and you try to show</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.929" end="00:21:03.110" style="s2">that you believe it very strongly and</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.429" end="00:21:05.120" style="s2">you mouth the words over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.110" end="00:21:07.130" style="s2">in order to prove to other people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.120" end="00:21:08.029" style="s2">your in your demographic group that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.130" end="00:21:10.130" style="s2">you&#39;re one of them and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.029" end="00:21:11.570" style="s2">trustworthy and therefore you can be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.130" end="00:21:13.159" style="s2">good business partner you&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.570" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">person to date you&#39;re a good person to</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.159" end="00:21:16.970" style="s2">be friends with and so unfortunately</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:19.429" style="s2">political views and religious views</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.970" end="00:21:22.100" style="s2">often serve this kind of function of</p>

<p begin="00:22:08.179" end="00:22:11.630" style="s2">think there&#39;s a lot to that or my friend</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.070" end="00:22:13.549" style="s2">Robin Hansen was on the show and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.630" end="00:22:15.139" style="s2">talked a lot about those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.549" end="00:22:17.299" style="s2">expensive signals and how they do</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.139" end="00:22:18.980" style="s2">produce cohesion so clearly that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.299" end="00:22:21.789" style="s2">of it but what about the argument that</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.980" end="00:22:24.669" style="s2">yeah true dad ignorance teamplay</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.789" end="00:22:26.980" style="s2">irrationality but maybe they&#39;re random</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.669" end="00:22:29.230" style="s2">distributed must cancel themselves out</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.980" end="00:22:30.609" style="s2">leaving the Vulcans in control yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.230" end="00:22:32.769" style="s2">that&#39;s right so there&#39;s this idea called</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.609" end="00:22:35.739" style="s2">the miracle of aggregation in the hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.769" end="00:22:38.169" style="s2">is if people were just genuinely and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.739" end="00:22:40.239" style="s2">perfectly ignorant then you ask them to</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.169" end="00:22:43.570" style="s2">pick between two things they would vote</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.239" end="00:22:46.299" style="s2">randomly so imagine imagine like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.570" end="00:22:47.649" style="s2">doing a poll and you have a disease we</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.299" end="00:22:49.869" style="s2">have to give you some sort of medicine</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.649" end="00:22:52.239" style="s2">and for whatever reason we let this be</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.869" end="00:22:54.519" style="s2">decided by the American populace</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.239" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">well we&#39;re offering you two drugs let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.519" end="00:22:58.210" style="s2">just say a and B and then we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.070" style="s2">everybody vote well the thought is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.210" end="00:23:02.169" style="s2">typical citizen has no knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.070" end="00:23:03.759" style="s2">these drugs whatsoever so they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.169" end="00:23:05.590" style="s2">to guess at random and the more and more</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.759" end="00:23:07.570" style="s2">people we throw on the more likely it is</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.590" end="00:23:09.789" style="s2">that we get literally 50% going one way</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.570" end="00:23:11.169" style="s2">and 50% the other because you know if</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.789" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">you&#39;re flipping a coin over and over</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.169" end="00:23:15.369" style="s2">again you&#39;re gonna get 50/50 but then</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:16.899" style="s2">the medical doctors who actually know</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.369" end="00:23:19.989" style="s2">something will all pick the right</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.899" end="00:23:21.460" style="s2">medicine and thus the group will behave</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.989" end="00:23:23.619" style="s2">as if it&#39;s fully informed even though</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.460" end="00:23:26.679" style="s2">only a small minority is fully informed</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.619" end="00:23:28.989" style="s2">in theory as a mathematical theorem</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.679" end="00:23:30.940" style="s2">that&#39;s perfectly good the problem is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.989" end="00:23:33.429" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t apply to the real world for</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.940" end="00:23:35.169" style="s2">a number of reasons one is people</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.429" end="00:23:36.609" style="s2">actually don&#39;t pick randomly when</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.169" end="00:23:38.950" style="s2">they&#39;re ignorant we have it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.609" end="00:23:40.539" style="s2">position bias so when you give people a</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.950" end="00:23:42.039" style="s2">list of things they tend to pick the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.539" end="00:23:44.049" style="s2">thing on the front and the thing on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.039" end="00:23:45.100" style="s2">back and they don&#39;t pick the middle so</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.049" end="00:23:46.299" style="s2">you give them if you give them a</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.100" end="00:23:47.919" style="s2">multiple choice test and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.299" end="00:23:50.590" style="s2">perfectly ignorant they pick a and D</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.919" end="00:23:52.359" style="s2">over B and C but you could fix that by</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.590" end="00:23:53.440" style="s2">just randomizing the answers and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.359" end="00:23:55.269" style="s2">could some weight to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.440" end="00:23:56.950" style="s2">overcome it but it turns out there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.269" end="00:23:58.389" style="s2">other things when people pick things</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.950" end="00:23:59.799" style="s2">even if they don&#39;t know something they</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.389" end="00:24:01.299" style="s2">pick something that sounds better</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.799" end="00:24:05.230" style="s2">so you think about political candidates</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.299" end="00:24:06.669" style="s2">if you had a Kennedy versus someone with</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.230" end="00:24:07.989" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know an Arabic last name</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.669" end="00:24:10.179" style="s2">they&#39;re more likely to pick the Kennedy</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.989" end="00:24:12.129" style="s2">so there&#39;s that problem but it gets</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.179" end="00:24:14.470" style="s2">worse because it turns out people are</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.129" end="00:24:16.600" style="s2">not ignorant enough for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.470" end="00:24:19.239" style="s2">thing to work they have some knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.600" end="00:24:20.889" style="s2">and so they have a tendency to pick that</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.239" end="00:24:23.080" style="s2">go for like a certain political view</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.889" end="00:24:25.119" style="s2">over and over again so if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.080" end="00:24:26.590" style="s2">systematic error and you can measure</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.119" end="00:24:28.600" style="s2">that people make these systematic</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.590" end="00:24:29.859" style="s2">mistakes they also follow one another</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.600" end="00:24:31.960" style="s2">they&#39;re not independent</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.859" end="00:24:33.580" style="s2">if you flip a coin and it comes up ten</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.960" end="00:24:35.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a fair coin it comes up</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.580" end="00:24:38.290" style="s2">heads ten times in a row the next time</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.830" end="00:24:40.090" style="s2">you flip it it&#39;s still 50/50</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.290" end="00:24:43.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not dependent upon your previous</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.090" end="00:24:45.670" style="s2">flips but voters copy one another and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.600" end="00:24:47.740" style="s2">if voters are making mistakes they tend</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.670" end="00:24:49.480" style="s2">to make systematic mistakes so</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.740" end="00:24:51.610" style="s2">unfortunately it&#39;s a good mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.480" end="00:24:53.620" style="s2">theorem but in the real world when we go</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.610" end="00:24:55.240" style="s2">to test that we find that people deviate</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.620" end="00:24:57.100" style="s2">this from this so much that in fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.240" end="00:24:58.750" style="s2">voters are followers and they make</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.100" end="00:25:00.310" style="s2">systematic mistakes and error does not</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.750" end="00:25:03.340" style="s2">get canceled out but rather it gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.310" end="00:25:06.040" style="s2">compounded how pleasant yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.340" end="00:25:09.310" style="s2">certainly obviously a oversimplification</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.040" end="00:25:12.250" style="s2">to assume that voters are our iid random</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.310" end="00:25:14.590" style="s2">variables who who actually are like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.250" end="00:25:17.680" style="s2">coin flip yeah there are all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.590" end="00:25:19.540" style="s2">network effect aggregation effects etc</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.680" end="00:25:21.940" style="s2">that make that theory that the vole can</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.540" end="00:25:24.130" style="s2">somehow control unlikely and now it gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.940" end="00:25:27.040" style="s2">even worse you make the case that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.130" end="00:25:28.930" style="s2">rational to be irrational if you take us</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.040" end="00:25:30.220" style="s2">through that argument a little bit fact</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.930" end="00:25:32.380" style="s2">I think here&#39;s the quote from the book a</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.220" end="00:25:34.930" style="s2">person is rationally irrational when is</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.380" end="00:25:37.570" style="s2">instrumentally rational for that person</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.930" end="00:25:40.030" style="s2">to be epistemic alee irrational yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.570" end="00:25:41.950" style="s2">good so it sounds like a paradox to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.030" end="00:25:44.290" style="s2">rationally irrational but it&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.950" end="00:25:47.050" style="s2">different kinds of rationality what we</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.290" end="00:25:48.940" style="s2">mean by instrumental rationality is are</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.050" end="00:25:51.160" style="s2">you taking means or performing actions</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.940" end="00:25:52.900" style="s2">which promote your ends what we mean by</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.160" end="00:25:54.850" style="s2">epistemic rationality is are you</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.900" end="00:25:57.580" style="s2">thinking in a scientific way in pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.850" end="00:25:59.800" style="s2">the truth and the idea here is that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.580" end="00:26:01.990" style="s2">degree to which people are epistemic lis</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.800" end="00:26:03.700" style="s2">rational is dominated and determined by</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.990" end="00:26:05.620" style="s2">whether it actually serves their ends</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.700" end="00:26:07.030" style="s2">and that sounds weird in the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.620" end="00:26:10.270" style="s2">but I can give a simple example that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.030" end="00:26:13.540" style="s2">think makes it clear imagine that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.270" end="00:26:15.340" style="s2">taking biology 101 at Berkeley and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.540" end="00:26:16.810" style="s2">your professor there&#39;s 1,200 other</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.340" end="00:26:18.130" style="s2">students in the class I think the class</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.810" end="00:26:20.470" style="s2">they&#39;re supposed to be really big cuz</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.130" end="00:26:21.880" style="s2">like everyone&#39;s pre-med and I say at the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.470" end="00:26:23.410" style="s2">beginning of the semester hey everybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.880" end="00:26:25.000" style="s2">I want you to know that I&#39;m at a gala</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.410" end="00:26:26.920" style="s2">Terry and professor I think everyone</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.000" end="00:26:28.570" style="s2">should be treated equally and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.920" end="00:26:30.640" style="s2">think that you deserve your own scores</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.570" end="00:26:32.790" style="s2">because of I insert some like leftist</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.640" end="00:26:35.050" style="s2">argument so here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.790" end="00:26:37.240" style="s2">15 weeks from now you&#39;re going to take a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.050" end="00:26:39.130" style="s2">final exam and that&#39;ll be worth a</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.240" end="00:26:41.530" style="s2">hundred percent of your grade but rather</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.130" end="00:26:43.420" style="s2">than each student getting whatever score</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.530" end="00:26:45.640" style="s2">they got on the exam I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.420" end="00:26:47.320" style="s2">average everybody scores together and</p>

<p begin="00:26:59.889" end="00:27:03.399" style="s2">biology you probably wouldn&#39;t and for</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.019" end="00:27:05.109" style="s2">what it&#39;s worth there been attempts to</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.909" end="00:27:17.529" style="s2">stupid ideas about biology it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.519" end="00:27:21.099" style="s2">because they&#39;re stupid as people it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.529" end="00:27:23.979" style="s2">not because they&#39;re onions are all wrong</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.299" end="00:27:50.529" style="s2">to about 210 million people so if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.909" end="00:27:51.999" style="s2">have no reason to study hard when it</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.529" end="00:27:53.710" style="s2">comes to that biology exam give you a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.999" end="00:27:55.599" style="s2">less reason to study when it comes to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.710" end="00:27:56.889" style="s2">major election and that&#39;s what we find</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.599" end="00:27:58.330" style="s2">most people don&#39;t study at all they</p>

<p begin="00:27:58.330" end="00:28:02.469" style="s2">feel free to indulge their worst biases</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.580" end="00:28:05.469" style="s2">they feel free to believe things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.469" end="00:28:07.179" style="s2">are obviously false and very few people</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.469" end="00:28:08.919" style="s2">actually put real effort and care into</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.179" end="00:28:10.299" style="s2">it it&#39;s not because they&#39;re stupid it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.919" end="00:28:13.239" style="s2">not because they&#39;re incapable of self</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.299" end="00:28:15.669" style="s2">rule is because a built-in defect in</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.239" end="00:28:17.769" style="s2">democratic voting is it incentivizes you</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.669" end="00:28:21.729" style="s2">to the ignorant and incentivizes you to</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.769" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">be irrational that&#39;s not so good what</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.729" end="00:28:25.629" style="s2">about some of the other arguments in</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:28.210" style="s2">favor of democracy like John Stuart</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.629" end="00:28:31.359" style="s2">Mill&#39;s education argument that political</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.210" end="00:28:33.309" style="s2">participation makes us smarter yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.359" end="00:28:35.649" style="s2">you know Mills writing that in like 1850</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.309" end="00:28:38.169" style="s2">he has his hypothesis that he basically</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.649" end="00:28:39.879" style="s2">says well in order to do politics well</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.169" end="00:28:41.200" style="s2">you would need to know all of these</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.879" end="00:28:43.509" style="s2">things so if we get you to participate</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.200" end="00:28:44.710" style="s2">in politics you&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.509" end="00:28:46.149" style="s2">understand what other people believe</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.710" end="00:28:48.099" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna have to understand their</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.149" end="00:28:49.960" style="s2">point of view and and be concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.099" end="00:28:51.729" style="s2">their welfare you&#39;ll have to deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.960" end="00:28:53.950" style="s2">with others and then when you deliberate</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.729" end="00:28:56.619" style="s2">you&#39;ll learn from them but what mill is</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.950" end="00:28:57.999" style="s2">basically saying was people are hobbits</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.619" end="00:28:59.289" style="s2">and if we get them to interact with one</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.999" end="00:29:02.409" style="s2">another and do politics they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.289" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">turned into Vulcans yeah good hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.409" end="00:29:05.770" style="s2">but it&#39;s wrong and the way we know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:07.870" style="s2">wrong is by testing</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.770" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">we we run experiments where we put</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.870" end="00:29:11.650" style="s2">people in forums and allow them to</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:13.630" style="s2">deliberate with one another and then see</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.650" end="00:29:15.190" style="s2">what happens and overwhelmingly you get</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.630" end="00:29:17.860" style="s2">negative results with these things where</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.190" end="00:29:19.060" style="s2">people they don&#39;t learn that much what</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.860" end="00:29:21.370" style="s2">they do learn they could have learned by</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.060" end="00:29:23.920" style="s2">just reading a pamphlet they become ever</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.370" end="00:29:25.390" style="s2">more polarized and so on and the funny</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.920" end="00:29:26.980" style="s2">thing is you know there are these</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.390" end="00:29:28.540" style="s2">deliberative Democrats that cite these</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.980" end="00:29:30.460" style="s2">studies and it&#39;ll be like one out of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.540" end="00:29:31.960" style="s2">ninety-seven will have a positive result</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.460" end="00:29:33.460" style="s2">and then they&#39;ll say ah that see</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.960" end="00:29:35.050" style="s2">therefore it works and then will accuse</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.460" end="00:29:37.240" style="s2">me of cherry-picking because I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.050" end="00:29:39.070" style="s2">the other 96 on a 97 that had a bad</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.240" end="00:29:41.590" style="s2">result so that&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.070" end="00:29:43.720" style="s2">hooligan behavior on their heart too so</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.590" end="00:29:45.130" style="s2">the evidence is just it doesn&#39;t work we</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.720" end="00:29:46.870" style="s2">don&#39;t learn much and the reason we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.130" end="00:29:49.060" style="s2">learn much is because our votes just</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.870" end="00:29:51.160" style="s2">don&#39;t matter very much if your vote</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.060" end="00:29:53.140" style="s2">mattered if if you were personally going</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.160" end="00:29:54.520" style="s2">to decide the outcome of the next</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.140" end="00:29:56.800" style="s2">election or the outcome of the next</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.520" end="00:29:58.930" style="s2">policy or whatever then you&#39;d have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.800" end="00:30:00.610" style="s2">stake in really being careful and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.930" end="00:30:01.540" style="s2">learning what you&#39;re doing unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.610" end="00:30:03.100" style="s2">you also have a stake in being very</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.540" end="00:30:04.660" style="s2">selfish about it rather than voting for</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.100" end="00:30:06.880" style="s2">the common good you probably promote</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.660" end="00:30:08.620" style="s2">your own ends but if your vote mattered</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.880" end="00:30:10.330" style="s2">you would treat it like it mattered but</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.620" end="00:30:11.740" style="s2">your vote doesn&#39;t matter and so you</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.330" end="00:30:14.080" style="s2">treat it like it doesn&#39;t and that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.740" end="00:30:16.870" style="s2">of almost everybody you try to provide</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.080" end="00:30:18.730" style="s2">people education by say teaching them</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.870" end="00:30:19.870" style="s2">civics in school or teaching them the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.730" end="00:30:22.270" style="s2">things that they need to learn to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.870" end="00:30:23.860" style="s2">good voter it it just generally doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.270" end="00:30:25.870" style="s2">work and it doesn&#39;t work for the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.860" end="00:30:28.060" style="s2">reason that school in general has a sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.870" end="00:30:29.350" style="s2">of problem right you learn all these</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.060" end="00:30:30.880" style="s2">things in school like maybe you learn a</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.350" end="00:30:32.590" style="s2">foreign language you learn advanced</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.880" end="00:30:34.140" style="s2">mathematics you cover some things about</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.590" end="00:30:36.610" style="s2">Shakespeare and you read a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.140" end="00:30:38.230" style="s2">interesting essays and so on and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.610" end="00:30:39.790" style="s2">you test people a year after they</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.230" end="00:30:41.590" style="s2">graduate and you find that they</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.790" end="00:30:43.240" style="s2">forgotten more than half of it you test</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.590" end="00:30:45.610" style="s2">them five years after they graduate and</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.240" end="00:30:47.940" style="s2">they forgotten something like 80% well</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.610" end="00:30:50.470" style="s2">why is that it&#39;s rational ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.940" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">reborn like I used to be fluent in</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.470" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">Spanish but after I left college I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:55.810" style="s2">basically stopped using and I&#39;ve used it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:30:57.370" style="s2">maybe like four times in my life since</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.810" end="00:30:59.440" style="s2">then so I don&#39;t speak it very well</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.370" end="00:31:01.540" style="s2">anymore I used to be really good at</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.440" end="00:31:02.890" style="s2">Latin not anymore I did all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.540" end="00:31:04.840" style="s2">advanced mathematics and I still</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.890" end="00:31:06.340" style="s2">sometimes do but the only advanced</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.840" end="00:31:08.710" style="s2">mathematics I really remember is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.340" end="00:31:10.750" style="s2">stuff that I use in my job I took many</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.710" end="00:31:12.820" style="s2">many chemistry classes and if you&#39;d met</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.750" end="00:31:15.070" style="s2">me it&#39;d say age 20 I could have</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.820" end="00:31:16.930" style="s2">synthesized various kinds of drugs in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.070" end="00:31:18.850" style="s2">laboratory really easily and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.930" end="00:31:20.410" style="s2">remember how to do that anymore why I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.850" end="00:31:22.450" style="s2">don&#39;t use it so the stuff has been</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.410" end="00:31:23.890" style="s2">jettisoned from my brain same thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.450" end="00:31:25.810" style="s2">happens with political information we</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.890" end="00:31:28.420" style="s2">teach people through K through 12</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.810" end="00:31:29.980" style="s2">education the basics of what they need</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.420" end="00:31:32.430" style="s2">to know to be a good voter but they</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.980" end="00:31:34.360" style="s2">forget all of it by the time they&#39;re 24</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.430" end="00:31:37.090" style="s2">interesting when you and then you go a</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.360" end="00:31:39.730" style="s2">step further and you say not only are we</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.090" end="00:31:41.920" style="s2">not being smarter by the process but</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.730" end="00:31:44.710" style="s2">maybe we&#39;re actually made worse more</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.920" end="00:31:46.840" style="s2">hooligan ish it makes us enemies of each</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.710" end="00:31:48.640" style="s2">other could you say more about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.840" end="00:31:50.350" style="s2">so think about the sports fan analogy</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.640" end="00:31:52.750" style="s2">again when I met my mother-in-law she</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.350" end="00:31:54.580" style="s2">said something which is absurd she said</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.750" end="00:31:58.510" style="s2">I&#39;m a fan of both the Yankees and the</p>

<p begin="00:31:58.510" end="00:32:03.070" style="s2">because you part of being a fan of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.390" end="00:32:05.620" style="s2">Red Sox is hating the Yankees and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.070" end="00:32:07.300" style="s2">vice-versa it&#39;s built into it so when</p>

<p begin="00:32:13.990" end="00:32:17.140" style="s2">maybe they&#39;d be more likely to be my</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.540" end="00:32:29.770" style="s2">more the more intolerant I am of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.700" end="00:32:31.660" style="s2">Yankees the sort of better I am as Red</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.770" end="00:32:33.730" style="s2">Sox fan and the more other Red Sox fans</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.660" end="00:32:34.720" style="s2">will reward me now that&#39;s true about</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:39.130" style="s2">though I hate to say it because I am a</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.730" end="00:32:40.570" style="s2">Red Sox fan and I am a Pats fan I do</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.130" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">think Tom Brady is the greatest of all</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.570" end="00:32:45.130" style="s2">time despite his lackluster performance</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.640" end="00:32:47.650" style="s2">this this year I hate to say it but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.130" end="00:32:49.540" style="s2">really doesn&#39;t matter and I really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.650" end="00:32:51.310" style="s2">have reason to hate Colts fans I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.540" end="00:32:53.860" style="s2">really have reason to hate Yankees fans</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.310" end="00:32:55.570" style="s2">it&#39;s just kind of a thing we do as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.860" end="00:32:57.130" style="s2">sort of play time thing but when it</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.570" end="00:32:58.930" style="s2">comes to politics even though people</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.130" end="00:33:00.490" style="s2">don&#39;t spend much time thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.930" end="00:33:01.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t put in the effort to treat it</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.490" end="00:33:03.670" style="s2">as if it&#39;s something serious</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.320" end="00:33:06.130" style="s2">nevertheless it&#39;s about morality and</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.670" end="00:33:08.530" style="s2">justice in the common good so then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.130" end="00:33:10.210" style="s2">feel like well I&#39;m justified and if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.530" end="00:33:11.710" style="s2">a Democrat I&#39;m justified in hitting the</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.210" end="00:33:13.270" style="s2">Republicans they&#39;re trying to hurt</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.710" end="00:33:15.640" style="s2">people they&#39;re trying to cost our ORS</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.270" end="00:33:16.990" style="s2">and hurt the poor and they hate they</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.640" end="00:33:18.700" style="s2">hate everyone else other than themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.990" end="00:33:20.110" style="s2">and they&#39;re purely selfish and then you</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.700" end="00:33:23.020" style="s2">ask Republicans and they say the same</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.110" end="00:33:24.460" style="s2">thing about the Democrats so yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.020" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">order to show you&#39;re a good member of</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.460" end="00:33:27.640" style="s2">your group you hate the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:27.970" style="s2">the more you hate them the better you</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.640" end="00:33:30.040" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.970" end="00:33:34.150" style="s2">a member of your group and that&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.040" end="00:33:35.470" style="s2">stronger in politics than it is with say</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.150" end="00:33:37.950" style="s2">like sports</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.470" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">in fact the effect is so strong that</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.950" end="00:33:41.680" style="s2">current studies show that people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:44.560" style="s2">more biased about political behavior</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.680" end="00:33:45.640" style="s2">than they are about race or sex or these</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.560" end="00:33:47.170" style="s2">other things if you think that people</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.640" end="00:33:48.880" style="s2">are racist you might be right but</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.170" end="00:33:50.620" style="s2">they&#39;re more partyís than they are</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.880" end="00:33:52.690" style="s2">racist so one study that was done on</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.620" end="00:33:54.640" style="s2">this you give people resumes and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.690" end="00:33:57.040" style="s2">independently have a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.640" end="00:33:58.060" style="s2">code them which resume is better so now</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.040" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">you know when there&#39;s no political</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.060" end="00:34:03.160" style="s2">affiliation attached to it that you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:05.470" style="s2">99.9% of people say resume is better</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.160" end="00:34:06.970" style="s2">than resume B now you do is you take the</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.470" end="00:34:08.980" style="s2">same resumes and you attach a political</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.970" end="00:34:11.470" style="s2">affiliation you say have the person say</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.980" end="00:34:13.270" style="s2">that in high school they were on the</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.470" end="00:34:15.490" style="s2">Republican Club or the young Democrat</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.270" end="00:34:17.260" style="s2">Club and then you give it to vote people</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.490" end="00:34:19.780" style="s2">and see how they rate it what you find</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.260" end="00:34:22.450" style="s2">is that Democrats will overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.780" end="00:34:24.430" style="s2">say that a resume from somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.450" end="00:34:25.960" style="s2">like who says they&#39;re a Democrat is</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.430" end="00:34:27.670" style="s2">better than the resume of a person who</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.960" end="00:34:29.200" style="s2">says the Republican even though you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.670" end="00:34:31.000" style="s2">carefully made sure the Republican one</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.200" end="00:34:32.290" style="s2">is actually better like this person was</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.000" end="00:34:34.060" style="s2">captain in the football team and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.290" end="00:34:36.280" style="s2">Democrat was a benchwarmer this person</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.060" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">had a 400 GPA and the Democrat had a 300</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.280" end="00:34:40.090" style="s2">GPA that he went to a better school or</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:41.710" style="s2">whatever he has more work experience and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.090" end="00:34:44.440" style="s2">vice versa the Republicans will</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.710" end="00:34:47.140" style="s2">discriminate in favor of the Democrat</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.440" end="00:34:49.150" style="s2">the Democratic candidate when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.140" end="00:34:51.250" style="s2">to job opportunities and these are for</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.150" end="00:34:52.060" style="s2">things like cashier like we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.250" end="00:34:53.590" style="s2">talking about a thing where like</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.060" end="00:34:55.510" style="s2">political affiliation matters we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.590" end="00:34:56.890" style="s2">talking about separates irrelevant they</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.510" end="00:34:58.630" style="s2">discriminate and they do this more than</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.890" end="00:35:01.360" style="s2">they do with party other than we do with</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.630" end="00:35:03.550" style="s2">race or sex or anything else the other</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.360" end="00:35:05.650" style="s2">one I saw recently that was fairly</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.550" end="00:35:07.090" style="s2">shocking but I suppose not surprising</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.650" end="00:35:09.690" style="s2">for those of us who hang around on</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.090" end="00:35:13.150" style="s2">Twitter and what-have-you is that today</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.690" end="00:35:14.980" style="s2">parents will rank a difference in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.150" end="00:35:16.770" style="s2">marriage prospect for one of their</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.980" end="00:35:19.750" style="s2">children of a different political</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.770" end="00:35:22.780" style="s2">persuasion as much more salient than</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.750" end="00:35:24.550" style="s2">religion or race yeah I&#39;m so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.780" end="00:35:25.750" style="s2">quite a change in say the nineteen fifty</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.550" end="00:35:27.970" style="s2">so there&#39;s been something going on</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.750" end="00:35:30.220" style="s2">that&#39;s made these hooligan --is--</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.970" end="00:35:31.660" style="s2">tendencies in our politics stronger</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.220" end="00:35:34.360" style="s2">though it&#39;s probably have been floated</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.660" end="00:35:36.520" style="s2">probably the same thing was true in 1860</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.360" end="00:35:38.710" style="s2">as it is today but that&#39;s certainly a</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.520" end="00:35:40.390" style="s2">fairly striking statistic yeah</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.710" end="00:35:41.800" style="s2">absolutely and the difference too is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.390" end="00:35:43.240" style="s2">people think it&#39;s justified</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.800" end="00:35:45.130" style="s2">when you point this out to them they say</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.240" end="00:35:46.990" style="s2">if when you&#39;ve to have them read these</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.130" end="00:35:48.400" style="s2">studies that shows that say a Democrat</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.990" end="00:35:50.290" style="s2">will discriminate against Republican</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.400" end="00:35:52.510" style="s2">when it comes to hiring a cashier for a</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.290" end="00:35:54.430" style="s2">supermarket people&#39;s reaction is usually</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.510" end="00:35:55.780" style="s2">yeah but that&#39;s different because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.430" end="00:35:58.420" style="s2">should discriminate against Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.780" end="00:35:59.590" style="s2">they&#39;re evil and bad people whereas if</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.420" end="00:36:00.970" style="s2">I&#39;m just kidding it&#39;s a person for being</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.590" end="00:36:02.230" style="s2">black that&#39;s not appropriate because</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.970" end="00:36:05.020" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with being black</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.230" end="00:36:06.790" style="s2">so like that&#39;s their attitude that they</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.020" end="00:36:09.100" style="s2">will just affirm it it&#39;s okay to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.790" end="00:36:10.900" style="s2">partyi stin fact if you say things like</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.100" end="00:36:12.730" style="s2">I think we should be accepting of all</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.900" end="00:36:14.050" style="s2">points of view and I don&#39;t think I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.730" end="00:36:15.610" style="s2">I should be friends with people even</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.050" end="00:36:17.560" style="s2">though they disagree about politics</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.610" end="00:36:18.820" style="s2">you&#39;ll get a lot of pushback I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.560" end="00:36:21.190" style="s2">see this on college campuses especially</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.820" end="00:36:22.390" style="s2">where people say you can&#39;t be friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.190" end="00:36:25.000" style="s2">with someone who thinks that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.390" end="00:36:26.830" style="s2">they&#39;re evil they have evil ideas they</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.000" end="00:36:28.270" style="s2">want to silence and hurt people like me</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.830" end="00:36:29.740" style="s2">so if you&#39;re just like oh let&#39;s let</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.270" end="00:36:33.880" style="s2">bygones be bygones and still be friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.740" end="00:36:36.340" style="s2">that means that you&#39;re endorsing evil so</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.880" end="00:36:38.640" style="s2">there&#39;s actually like strong pressure to</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.340" end="00:36:40.540" style="s2">engage in this kind of partyís behavior</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.640" end="00:36:41.770" style="s2">yeah it seems like it&#39;s getting worse</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.540" end="00:36:44.020" style="s2">all the time</p>

<p begin="00:37:12.580" end="00:37:16.270" style="s2">more about that yeah well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.860" end="00:37:19.000" style="s2">summary of a couple chapters worth of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.270" end="00:37:21.250" style="s2">work but basically one thing I do the</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.000" end="00:37:23.080" style="s2">first maybe third of the book is just</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.250" end="00:37:25.390" style="s2">going over the facts and the empirical</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.080" end="00:37:27.430" style="s2">research about how what participation</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.390" end="00:37:28.960" style="s2">does to us and what we know and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.430" end="00:37:30.850" style="s2">maybe the next third is looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.960" end="00:37:32.860" style="s2">various other kinds of arguments people</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.850" end="00:37:34.300" style="s2">give in favor of democracy some of these</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.860" end="00:37:36.550" style="s2">things say things like well democracy is</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.300" end="00:37:38.050" style="s2">good because it&#39;s fair but if you really</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.550" end="00:37:39.580" style="s2">care about fairness you wouldn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.050" end="00:37:40.840" style="s2">want democracy want something else</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.580" end="00:37:42.610" style="s2">because it turns out democracy is not</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.840" end="00:37:44.410" style="s2">very fair and I moved Ian&#39;s reasons why</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.610" end="00:37:46.570" style="s2">at some point there are these arguments</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.410" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">to try to say that democracy in some way</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.570" end="00:37:50.770" style="s2">empowers you but the problem with all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.780" style="s2">those is that your vote just doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.770" end="00:37:55.490" style="s2">matter so a good way to illustrate that</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.780" end="00:37:56.840" style="s2">is if you&#39;re a Jewish person in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.490" end="00:37:59.000" style="s2">were fifth in the federal election in</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.840" end="00:38:01.130" style="s2">Germany in 1932 it&#39;s an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.000" end="00:38:02.750" style="s2">disaster for you if the Nazis and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.130" end="00:38:06.380" style="s2">nationalists win a coalition government</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.750" end="00:38:08.450" style="s2">but you voting for against the Nazis you</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.380" end="00:38:10.310" style="s2">voting for the Nazis and you staying</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.450" end="00:38:13.580" style="s2">home have basically the same effect on</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.310" end="00:38:15.170" style="s2">politics so your vote does not do much</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.580" end="00:38:16.490" style="s2">for you just doesn&#39;t matter has a very</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.170" end="00:38:19.160" style="s2">low chance of making any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.490" end="00:38:21.110" style="s2">difference so all these arguments to try</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.160" end="00:38:22.700" style="s2">to say well you know it&#39;s your vote</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.110" end="00:38:24.290" style="s2">protects you from being dominated it</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.700" end="00:38:25.550" style="s2">gives you autonomy and so it allows you</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.290" end="00:38:27.020" style="s2">to consent to government they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.550" end="00:38:28.970" style="s2">they&#39;re wrong because your vote is so</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.020" end="00:38:30.830" style="s2">ineffectual it doesn&#39;t look like any of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.970" end="00:38:33.710" style="s2">that stuff is true so at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.830" end="00:38:35.450" style="s2">day the argument for democracy has to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.710" end="00:38:37.100" style="s2">something about the results that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.450" end="00:38:38.440" style="s2">produces it can&#39;t be that it&#39;s just good</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.100" end="00:38:42.470" style="s2">as an end in itself</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.440" end="00:38:43.340" style="s2">okay now let&#39;s turn to your alternative</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.470" end="00:38:46.520" style="s2">which you called</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.340" end="00:38:49.369" style="s2">Epis toc recei tell us about that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.520" end="00:38:52.100" style="s2">so Epis toc recei is a pretty old idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.369" end="00:38:53.840" style="s2">you can see elements of an in Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.100" end="00:38:56.510" style="s2">the idea is that in one way or another</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.840" end="00:39:00.200" style="s2">you apportion political power according</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.510" end="00:39:01.700" style="s2">to knowledge and competence and so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.200" end="00:39:03.380" style="s2">term at pisaq recei was coined by the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.700" end="00:39:05.300" style="s2">philosopher david s Lind at Brown</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.380" end="00:39:07.490" style="s2">University&#39;s a former colleague of mine</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.300" end="00:39:09.260" style="s2">I used to work there with him and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.490" end="00:39:11.270" style="s2">it&#39;s contrasted to democracy just the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.260" end="00:39:12.859" style="s2">rule of everybody though no democracies</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.270" end="00:39:14.810" style="s2">actually extend everybody the right to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.859" end="00:39:16.369" style="s2">vote whereas Epis talker sees are going</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.810" end="00:39:18.650" style="s2">in some way way political power</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.369" end="00:39:20.510" style="s2">according to knowledge so the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.650" end="00:39:23.570" style="s2">the version that Plato recommended was</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.510" end="00:39:25.790" style="s2">we basically breed a political class and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.570" end="00:39:28.190" style="s2">trained them from youth to become good</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.790" end="00:39:29.810" style="s2">guardians of the public good that&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.190" end="00:39:32.359" style="s2">idea that kind of philosopher Kings</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.810" end="00:39:33.710" style="s2">model and when people want to be liked</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.359" end="00:39:35.090" style="s2">because they&#39;re hooligans if they read</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.710" end="00:39:36.230" style="s2">my book or like glanced at the back</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.090" end="00:39:38.000" style="s2">cover and they want to dismiss me</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.230" end="00:39:40.700" style="s2">quickly they go uh-oh Plato said that uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.000" end="00:39:42.080" style="s2">and there then they&#39;re done but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.700" end="00:39:44.540" style="s2">lots of other versions of that the stock</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.080" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">recei that are worth considering so the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.540" end="00:39:50.600" style="s2">Mexican philosopher Claudia Lopez Guerra</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.720" end="00:39:52.550" style="s2">recommends we have a lottery and 20,000</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.600" end="00:39:54.200" style="s2">people or so are selected at random and</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.550" end="00:39:56.600" style="s2">they and only they are allowed to vote</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.200" end="00:39:59.690" style="s2">and so that eliminates any kind of bias</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.600" end="00:40:01.550" style="s2">in say sex or gender or race or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.690" end="00:40:02.990" style="s2">or income but before they&#39;re allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.550" end="00:40:04.670" style="s2">vote they have to undergo some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.990" end="00:40:06.530" style="s2">confidence-building exercise and if they</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.670" end="00:40:08.700" style="s2">can&#39;t pass an exercise they don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.530" end="00:40:11.700" style="s2">vote and that&#39;s the system that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.700" end="00:40:14.220" style="s2">that&#39;s a kind of a pistachio check on</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.700" end="00:40:16.260" style="s2">who gets to vote based upon that another</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.220" end="00:40:17.520" style="s2">idea might be which is not what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.260" end="00:40:18.990" style="s2">advocate do I did I wrote a paper</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.520" end="00:40:21.570" style="s2">advocating this early on but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.990" end="00:40:23.130" style="s2">advocate this anymore you should have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.570" end="00:40:25.710" style="s2">get a license to vote in the same way</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.130" end="00:40:27.060" style="s2">that you get a license to be a driver so</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.710" end="00:40:28.640" style="s2">you have to pass a test to basic</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.060" end="00:40:30.810" style="s2">competence it could be as simple as like</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.640" end="00:40:32.670" style="s2">identify your congressperson and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.810" end="00:40:34.290" style="s2">identify the vice-president from a list</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.670" end="00:40:36.630" style="s2">of candidates and then you get to vote</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.290" end="00:40:38.250" style="s2">otherwise you don&#39;t some people like</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.630" end="00:40:40.470" style="s2">John Stuart Mill and even the left</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.250" end="00:40:42.540" style="s2">liberal philosopher John Rawls advocated</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.470" end="00:40:44.280" style="s2">plural voting where everyone gets at</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.540" end="00:40:46.740" style="s2">least one vote but some people get more</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.280" end="00:40:48.270" style="s2">than one vote there&#39;s a few other ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.740" end="00:40:50.700" style="s2">as well though the one that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.270" end="00:40:52.830" style="s2">the best and it&#39;s not clear if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.700" end="00:40:55.770" style="s2">gonna be really fine about our</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.830" end="00:40:57.270" style="s2">definitions of terms whether this counts</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.770" end="00:40:58.830" style="s2">as democracy or at the stock or sea it</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.270" end="00:41:00.810" style="s2">could be debated either way but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.830" end="00:41:02.850" style="s2">what I call in the book government by</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.810" end="00:41:04.680" style="s2">simulated Oracle I think I like now to</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.850" end="00:41:06.030" style="s2">refer to it as enlightened preference</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.680" end="00:41:08.310" style="s2">voting so here&#39;s how enlightened</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.030" end="00:41:10.680" style="s2">preference voting works everybody gets</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.310" end="00:41:11.940" style="s2">to vote including your toddler doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.680" end="00:41:14.310" style="s2">matter let them show up it won&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.940" end="00:41:16.680" style="s2">difference so everyone gets to vote but</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.310" end="00:41:19.500" style="s2">when you vote you do three things one is</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.680" end="00:41:21.240" style="s2">you tell us what you want so whatever is</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.500" end="00:41:23.040" style="s2">being subject to an election or being</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.240" end="00:41:24.030" style="s2">subject to a vote I&#39;m agnostic about</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.040" end="00:41:25.710" style="s2">what should be but whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.030" end="00:41:28.500" style="s2">putting there they get to tell us their</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.710" end="00:41:30.390" style="s2">view on that second you have to put down</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.500" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">your demographic information because</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.390" end="00:41:35.130" style="s2">this stuff affects how people vote and</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:37.350" style="s2">third you take a test or a quiz of basic</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.130" end="00:41:39.030" style="s2">clinical knowledge this quiz does not</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.350" end="00:41:40.350" style="s2">determine whether you get to vote or not</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.030" end="00:41:43.260" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t determine whether your vote</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.350" end="00:41:45.750" style="s2">gets put in or not but rather when we</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.260" end="00:41:49.110" style="s2">have three sets of data what people want</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.750" end="00:41:51.270" style="s2">who they are and what they know you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.110" end="00:41:53.220" style="s2">then statistically estimate what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.270" end="00:41:55.500" style="s2">public would have wanted a</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.220" end="00:41:57.510" style="s2">demographically identical public would</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.500" end="00:42:00.750" style="s2">have wanted if it had gotten a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.510" end="00:42:02.040" style="s2">score on that test so in fact when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.750" end="00:42:03.480" style="s2">take to give these tests to people you</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.040" end="00:42:05.130" style="s2">know your average grade is an F but you</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.480" end="00:42:07.170" style="s2">can simulate well what would the public</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.130" end="00:42:09.900" style="s2">have voted for if it had gotten an A and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.170" end="00:42:11.460" style="s2">a priori like just sitting your armchair</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.900" end="00:42:14.220" style="s2">there&#39;s no guarantee that there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.460" end="00:42:16.200" style="s2">to be convergence but it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.220" end="00:42:18.270" style="s2">when you run these sorts of tests on</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.200" end="00:42:20.190" style="s2">people you tend to find that voters vote</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.270" end="00:42:22.460" style="s2">as if they were informed about economics</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.190" end="00:42:24.650" style="s2">they vote for certain policies and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.460" end="00:42:26.150" style="s2">and interestingly a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.650" end="00:42:28.940" style="s2">political scientists and economists have</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.150" end="00:42:30.260" style="s2">used this kind of method before to sort</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.940" end="00:42:31.910" style="s2">of test the effect of knowledge on</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.260" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">people&#39;s voting preferences and they use</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.910" end="00:42:34.910" style="s2">different datasets but they tend to get</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.910" end="00:42:38.599" style="s2">that the public would say be more in</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.890" end="00:42:40.099" style="s2">favor of free trade rather than against</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.599" end="00:42:42.710" style="s2">it they&#39;d be more in favor of emigration</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.099" end="00:42:44.210" style="s2">rather than against it they&#39;d be less</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.710" end="00:42:47.210" style="s2">belligerent when it comes to foreign</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.210" end="00:42:49.849" style="s2">policy and so on so in this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.210" end="00:42:52.880" style="s2">system it&#39;s not literally the case that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.849" end="00:42:55.430" style="s2">say you get 7.4 votes and I get 6.8 and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.880" end="00:42:57.290" style="s2">that person gets 2.9 in a way we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.430" end="00:42:58.730" style="s2">basically equal but you&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.290" end="00:43:00.619" style="s2">simulate what the public would have</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.730" end="00:43:02.900" style="s2">wanted if it had gotten a perfect score</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.619" end="00:43:04.579" style="s2">on this test so it might arguably be a</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.900" end="00:43:07.250" style="s2">form of democracy but I think of it as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.579" end="00:43:09.079" style="s2">system of extracting the knowledge from</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.250" end="00:43:10.790" style="s2">the people and the reason you get there</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.079" end="00:43:12.740" style="s2">demographic information is that way</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.790" end="00:43:15.260" style="s2">you&#39;re able to make sure that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.740" end="00:43:17.750" style="s2">results are not because say of income or</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.260" end="00:43:19.069" style="s2">race or gender is because of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.750" end="00:43:21.260" style="s2">you can sing it you can just test the</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.069" end="00:43:23.059" style="s2">effective knowledge and one reason to</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.260" end="00:43:24.950" style="s2">use this kind of system too is for the</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.059" end="00:43:26.660" style="s2">past like say 30 or 40 years when</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.950" end="00:43:28.309" style="s2">economists and political scientists have</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.660" end="00:43:29.599" style="s2">wanted to ask the question how does</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.309" end="00:43:32.510" style="s2">knowledge affect people&#39;s political</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.599" end="00:43:34.280" style="s2">preferences or how does gender affect</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.510" end="00:43:35.990" style="s2">people&#39;s political preferences this is</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.280" end="00:43:37.910" style="s2">the way you do it you use this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.990" end="00:43:39.079" style="s2">statistical method in fact if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.910" end="00:43:41.089" style="s2">do this if you don&#39;t do this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.079" end="00:43:44.270" style="s2">stuff your your results are basically</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.089" end="00:43:45.530" style="s2">invalid now the big question that</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.270" end="00:43:47.690" style="s2">everyone should ask it&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.530" end="00:43:50.420" style="s2">question to ask is yeah but who gets to</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.690" end="00:43:53.150" style="s2">decide what goes on the test and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.420" end="00:43:55.130" style="s2">answer is me I&#39;m just I was gonna ask</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.150" end="00:43:56.450" style="s2">you to steal man the argument against</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.130" end="00:43:58.369" style="s2">but something you&#39;re getting ready to do</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.450" end="00:44:00.829" style="s2">that yeah I mean it really should be me</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.369" end="00:44:02.210" style="s2">but since I won&#39;t be here forever we</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.829" end="00:44:04.130" style="s2">have to pick something a second best</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.210" end="00:44:06.160" style="s2">sort of system and the worry that people</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.130" end="00:44:08.630" style="s2">have which is a very reasonable worry is</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.160" end="00:44:11.450" style="s2">if party the political parties in power</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.630" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">were forced to do this system they would</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.450" end="00:44:16.309" style="s2">try to modify the demographic categories</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:17.720" style="s2">and the test in a way that benefits them</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.309" end="00:44:19.309" style="s2">at the expense of the other party of</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.720" end="00:44:20.750" style="s2">course they would do that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.309" end="00:44:22.730" style="s2">every party does in every democracy</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.750" end="00:44:25.010" style="s2">already even we&#39;re not doing these kinds</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.730" end="00:44:26.809" style="s2">of things a gerrymandered districts they</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.010" end="00:44:28.130" style="s2">try to control the voting system and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.809" end="00:44:30.230" style="s2">on to benefit themselves at the expense</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.130" end="00:44:31.400" style="s2">of alternative points of view I mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.230" end="00:44:33.200" style="s2">that&#39;s why I like first-past-the-post</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.400" end="00:44:34.490" style="s2">voting will never go away in the US</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.200" end="00:44:35.650" style="s2">because the Democrats and Republicans</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.490" end="00:44:38.830" style="s2">know they benefit from it</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.650" end="00:44:40.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s true that it will be abused and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.830" end="00:44:42.790" style="s2">we have to ask like what of all the</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.600" end="00:44:44.740" style="s2">defective imperfect systems which one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.790" end="00:44:47.050" style="s2">the best but an idea that I have which</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.740" end="00:44:49.660" style="s2">might sound paradoxical is you let the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.050" end="00:44:52.330" style="s2">people decide what goes on the test so</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.660" end="00:44:53.710" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have a test of political</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.330" end="00:44:55.690" style="s2">knowledge that&#39;s going to be used to</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.710" end="00:44:57.280" style="s2">weigh or to calculate what an</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.690" end="00:44:59.470" style="s2">enlightened public would prefer what a</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.280" end="00:45:02.080" style="s2">fully informed public would prefer but</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.470" end="00:45:03.160" style="s2">you randomly select say 500 citizens in</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.080" end="00:45:04.960" style="s2">the way that you select people through</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.160" end="00:45:07.090" style="s2">jury duty you have them come together</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.960" end="00:45:08.230" style="s2">for a weekend you pay them to do this so</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.090" end="00:45:09.490" style="s2">maybe have a law that even says that</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.230" end="00:45:11.170" style="s2">they can&#39;t be penalized by their</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.490" end="00:45:14.200" style="s2">employers for taking time off and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.170" end="00:45:16.120" style="s2">tell them you 500 citizens randomly</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.200" end="00:45:18.580" style="s2">selected your job is to decide what</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.120" end="00:45:20.920" style="s2">counts as an informed voter what do you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.580" end="00:45:22.210" style="s2">think voters ought to know and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.920" end="00:45:24.460" style="s2">gonna sit here for a weekend and come up</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.210" end="00:45:25.840" style="s2">with a list of things and give us the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.460" end="00:45:27.910" style="s2">questions and then we&#39;ll use that to</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.840" end="00:45:28.960" style="s2">weigh votes what&#39;s odd about that</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.910" end="00:45:30.820" style="s2">because I&#39;ve just spent all this time</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.960" end="00:45:31.630" style="s2">arguing that voters are ignorant you</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.820" end="00:45:34.300" style="s2">might think well how would they know</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.630" end="00:45:37.330" style="s2">that stuff but the funny thing is when</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.300" end="00:45:38.890" style="s2">you go and pull typical citizens what</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.330" end="00:45:41.020" style="s2">sorts of things do you think you need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.890" end="00:45:42.970" style="s2">know to be a good voter they give very</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.020" end="00:45:44.500" style="s2">reasonable answers they say things like</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.970" end="00:45:45.340" style="s2">you should know the president is you</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.500" end="00:45:46.720" style="s2">should know which party controls</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.340" end="00:45:47.950" style="s2">Congress you should know who your</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.720" end="00:45:50.230" style="s2">representative is you should know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.950" end="00:45:51.850" style="s2">certain statistics about how the country</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.230" end="00:45:54.250" style="s2">is doing and what money is being spent</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.850" end="00:45:55.810" style="s2">on and historical facts if I even say</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.250" end="00:45:58.540" style="s2">you should know the bus fare to get</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.810" end="00:46:01.600" style="s2">across town they say reasonable things</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.540" end="00:46:03.400" style="s2">so in a sense they know what should be</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.600" end="00:46:05.770" style="s2">on the test even though they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.400" end="00:46:07.420" style="s2">the answers to the test if that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.770" end="00:46:09.310" style="s2">paradoxical I mean I&#39;ll use another</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.420" end="00:46:10.770" style="s2">college example think about when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.310" end="00:46:14.380" style="s2">in you know you&#39;re getting a bad grade</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.770" end="00:46:15.400" style="s2">like in a chemistry 101 you know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.380" end="00:46:16.480" style="s2">the questions are going to be on the</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.400" end="00:46:18.490" style="s2">test you just don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.480" end="00:46:19.810" style="s2">answers are right you&#39;re like I know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.490" end="00:46:21.280" style="s2">supposed to know about like what happens</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.810" end="00:46:22.600" style="s2">when these two things bond together I</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.280" end="00:46:24.820" style="s2">know I&#39;m supposed to understand what a</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.600" end="00:46:26.110" style="s2">mole is I know so people that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.820" end="00:46:27.730" style="s2">what&#39;s happening with the average</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.110" end="00:46:28.990" style="s2">citizen they know what the right</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.730" end="00:46:30.490" style="s2">questions are but they don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.990" end="00:46:32.830" style="s2">the answers are so I think we can let</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.490" end="00:46:35.710" style="s2">them decide the questions that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.830" end="00:46:37.120" style="s2">bad solution as I was reading your you</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.710" end="00:46:38.620" style="s2">know your critique one of the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.120" end="00:46:41.200" style="s2">came to my mind something I&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.620" end="00:46:43.210" style="s2">about a little bit is maybe liquid</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.200" end="00:46:44.980" style="s2">democracy also called recursive</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.210" end="00:46:47.140" style="s2">delegative democracy what answer are</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.980" end="00:46:49.420" style="s2">many of your objections I&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.140" end="00:46:52.119" style="s2">with delegative democracy I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.420" end="00:46:53.319" style="s2">that phrase before and I think maybe</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.119" end="00:46:56.079" style="s2">rather than commenting on that I should</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.319" end="00:46:57.970" style="s2">say there&#39;s other there&#39;s lots lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.079" end="00:46:59.799" style="s2">other ideas out there about how to sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.970" end="00:47:01.030" style="s2">of fix democracy by changing the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.799" end="00:47:03.339" style="s2">that people vote or how they allocate</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.030" end="00:47:05.410" style="s2">power so you know in a liquid democracy</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.339" end="00:47:07.930" style="s2">or basically you&#39;re able to allocate</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.410" end="00:47:09.700" style="s2">your voting power to another person and</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.930" end="00:47:11.170" style="s2">maybe if we did that we&#39;d allocate in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.700" end="00:47:12.910" style="s2">more rational way or maybe you would end</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.170" end="00:47:14.619" style="s2">up being being biased I&#39;m not really</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.910" end="00:47:16.150" style="s2">sure but I mean there&#39;s other things</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.619" end="00:47:18.549" style="s2">that people have in mind and well what</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.150" end="00:47:20.470" style="s2">is to just use lotteries instead of</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.549" end="00:47:21.940" style="s2">having elections you know randomly</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.470" end="00:47:24.069" style="s2">select people the way the Athenians did</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.940" end="00:47:25.510" style="s2">and have them make decisions and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.069" end="00:47:26.799" style="s2">if you randomly select people and kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.510" end="00:47:28.270" style="s2">of have them serve and these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.799" end="00:47:29.950" style="s2">citizen councils where they have to pass</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.270" end="00:47:31.480" style="s2">certain laws they&#39;ll have an incentive</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.950" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">to inform themselves because they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.480" end="00:47:35.079" style="s2">been appointed to an office</p>

<p begin="00:51:01.859" end="00:51:05.970" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with academia and they say</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.600" end="00:51:07.560" style="s2">oh it&#39;s the spirit of neoliberalism or</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.970" end="00:51:09.900" style="s2">it&#39;s the corporate business mentality</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.560" end="00:51:11.160" style="s2">that&#39;s destroying a higher end and if</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.900" end="00:51:12.869" style="s2">you leave the college campus and you ask</p>

<p begin="00:51:12.869" end="00:51:15.140" style="s2">the problem is like social justice</p>

<p begin="00:51:22.400" end="00:51:26.120" style="s2">challenge a lot of that we say the</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.810" end="00:51:28.280" style="s2">problem is most of what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.120" end="00:51:31.010" style="s2">higher ed can be explained instead by</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.280" end="00:51:33.500" style="s2">bad incentives the rules of the game are</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.010" end="00:51:35.300" style="s2">set up in such a way where all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.500" end="00:51:39.530" style="s2">players involved from administrators to</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.300" end="00:51:42.080" style="s2">professors to students can benefit</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.530" end="00:51:44.270" style="s2">themselves and pass the costs on to</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.080" end="00:51:46.190" style="s2">others or they can do certain things</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.270" end="00:51:48.500" style="s2">which are collectively harmful but</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.190" end="00:51:50.870" style="s2">individually beneficial and it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.500" end="00:51:52.520" style="s2">suboptimal behavior so we say is why</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.870" end="00:51:53.930" style="s2">don&#39;t we go through case-by-case and</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.520" end="00:51:56.570" style="s2">look at the incentive structure that</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.930" end="00:51:59.090" style="s2">everybody is under and then see how much</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.570" end="00:52:00.500" style="s2">of dysfunction we can explain and also</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.090" end="00:52:01.820" style="s2">reveal because a lot of the stuff we go</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.500" end="00:52:04.280" style="s2">after is not the stuff that people have</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.820" end="00:52:06.350" style="s2">been talking about and explained through</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.280" end="00:52:09.890" style="s2">bad incentives just ordinary people</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.350" end="00:52:12.410" style="s2">taking the bait and then if only after</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.890" end="00:52:13.610" style="s2">that kind of basic explanation fails do</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.410" end="00:52:15.680" style="s2">you start looking at things like gods</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.610" end="00:52:18.410" style="s2">social justice warriors or ruining</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.680" end="00:52:19.670" style="s2">campus or owes neoliberalism so at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.410" end="00:52:21.470" style="s2">end we go after those things and say</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.670" end="00:52:23.690" style="s2">they&#39;re not very much explanatory for us</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.470" end="00:52:25.550" style="s2">but really it&#39;s just the people who work</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.690" end="00:52:27.440" style="s2">in higher ed or ordinary selfish people</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.550" end="00:52:29.810" style="s2">not completely selfish but predominantly</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.440" end="00:52:32.000" style="s2">selfish and they face bad and sentence</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.810" end="00:52:34.730" style="s2">and that&#39;s why they act badly yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.000" end="00:52:37.310" style="s2">gave a nice example right up front about</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.730" end="00:52:39.470" style="s2">a administrator who kept trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.310" end="00:52:41.270" style="s2">overrule the department on what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.470" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">might call an affirmative action hire</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.270" end="00:52:46.670" style="s2">where clearly one candidate was better</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:48.620" style="s2">than the other but didn&#39;t check off the</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.670" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">affirmative action box could you take us</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.620" end="00:52:53.210" style="s2">through that example yeah so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:55.610" style="s2">administrator in question it wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.210" end="00:52:58.280" style="s2">this person had a very strong view about</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.610" end="00:53:01.130" style="s2">affirmative action but rather they face</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.280" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">a sort of issue where given the laws</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.130" end="00:53:05.120" style="s2">that are in place the department in</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:07.580" style="s2">question did not have the right number</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.120" end="00:53:08.900" style="s2">of people who meet certain criteria so</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.580" end="00:53:10.610" style="s2">if you don&#39;t have that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.900" end="00:53:12.950" style="s2">presumptively guilty of something called</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.610" end="00:53:14.690" style="s2">disparate impact and if your suit you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.950" end="00:53:17.870" style="s2">you have to prove your innocence and you</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.690" end="00:53:19.190" style="s2">can be fined very easily so that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.870" end="00:53:20.660" style="s2">they weren&#39;t guilty that they had in a</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.190" end="00:53:22.370" style="s2">sense broken the law that way</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.660" end="00:53:25.580" style="s2">unfortunately the way that the law is</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.370" end="00:53:27.080" style="s2">written I&#39;m thinking about shoot I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.580" end="00:53:28.829" style="s2">I&#39;m not a lawyer so I camera my head at</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.080" end="00:53:31.049" style="s2">that&#39;s title for title nine</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.829" end="00:53:33.180" style="s2">rules the way that the law is written I</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.049" end="00:53:35.069" style="s2">should say this is the 1964 Civil Rights</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.180" end="00:53:36.719" style="s2">Act I think it must be title 7 well</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.069" end="00:53:39.329" style="s2">whatever the number is love so no lawyer</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.719" end="00:53:40.979" style="s2">can correct me so the way that the law</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.329" end="00:53:43.229" style="s2">is written though you&#39;re you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.979" end="00:53:45.150" style="s2">allowed to affirmatively discriminate in</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.229" end="00:53:46.529" style="s2">favor of the other groups in order to</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.150" end="00:53:48.299" style="s2">make up for the impact for your</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.529" end="00:53:51.359" style="s2">disparity impact so it&#39;s this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.299" end="00:53:53.940" style="s2">paradoxical thing where in order to in</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.359" end="00:53:56.339" style="s2">order you can comply with that law but</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.940" end="00:53:58.109" style="s2">only unintentionally so he had a case</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.339" end="00:53:59.819" style="s2">where the university did not have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.109" end="00:54:01.200" style="s2">valid affirmative action plan that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.819" end="00:54:03.029" style="s2">allow him to discriminate in favor of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.200" end="00:54:05.190" style="s2">female candidate over the male candidate</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.029" end="00:54:07.109" style="s2">but he also knew that the university had</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.190" end="00:54:09.420" style="s2">too many men to women in terms of like</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.109" end="00:54:12.029" style="s2">the right percentages so he was strongly</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.420" end="00:54:13.619" style="s2">encouraging the without without flat-out</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.029" end="00:54:16.349" style="s2">saying you need to discriminate in favor</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.619" end="00:54:17.880" style="s2">of the woman he was strongly encouraging</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.349" end="00:54:19.589" style="s2">people to think that way he would write</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.880" end="00:54:21.599" style="s2">memos and memorandums that said things</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.589" end="00:54:23.819" style="s2">like I want to remind you that every</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.599" end="00:54:25.259" style="s2">hire is a diversity hire and people</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.819" end="00:54:26.910" style="s2">would interpret that is sort of telling</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.259" end="00:54:28.469" style="s2">them to discriminate even though he</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.910" end="00:54:30.450" style="s2">wasn&#39;t actually saying that and legally</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.469" end="00:54:32.190" style="s2">speaking he&#39;s not allowed to and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.450" end="00:54:33.569" style="s2">when a male candidate came up who is on</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.190" end="00:54:36.269" style="s2">paper much better than the female</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.569" end="00:54:37.680" style="s2">candidate he said well you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.269" end="00:54:39.209" style="s2">understand why you want to hire milk in</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.680" end="00:54:41.549" style="s2">it you have all these female candidates</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.209" end="00:54:43.769" style="s2">who seem high quality so I think you</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.549" end="00:54:46.049" style="s2">should they should rethink your decision</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.769" end="00:54:47.609" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to authorize this but</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.049" end="00:54:49.739" style="s2">again it wasn&#39;t like this person&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.609" end="00:54:51.509" style="s2">strongly committed to that it&#39;s just it</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.739" end="00:54:53.309" style="s2">was his job to try to make sure the</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.509" end="00:54:55.440" style="s2">university complied with these rules and</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.309" end="00:54:56.789" style="s2">he was sort of stuck between a so-called</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.440" end="00:54:59.699" style="s2">rock and a hard place where no matter</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.789" end="00:55:02.219" style="s2">what he did he&#39;d be breaking a rule yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.699" end="00:55:04.799" style="s2">very true another example I loved</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.219" end="00:55:06.930" style="s2">actually because it was so to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.799" end="00:55:10.199" style="s2">line you talked about a case where the</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.930" end="00:55:12.299" style="s2">Dean named Nancy and your experiment</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.199" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">letting kids do little mini businesses</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.299" end="00:55:17.369" style="s2">and they decided to sell beer pong</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:19.079" style="s2">t-shirts and the Dean didn&#39;t like it I</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.369" end="00:55:20.640" style="s2">wasn&#39;t totally clear to me that was</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.079" end="00:55:22.859" style="s2">actually your Dean or some other Dean</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.640" end="00:55:24.809" style="s2">but anyway I thought the bottom line was</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.859" end="00:55:26.930" style="s2">actually totally major case that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.809" end="00:55:29.699" style="s2">mostly people dealing with obvious human</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.930" end="00:55:31.619" style="s2">incentives the Dean said if students do</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.699" end="00:55:33.839" style="s2">something that bothers parents such as</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.619" end="00:55:34.949" style="s2">selling beer pong shirts the parents</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.839" end="00:55:37.019" style="s2">won&#39;t call you</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.949" end="00:55:39.239" style="s2">meaning you Jason they&#39;ll call me</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.019" end="00:55:42.210" style="s2">meaning the Dean that I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.239" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">perfect example of these kind of micro</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.210" end="00:55:47.280" style="s2">personal incentives that drive behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:48.839" style="s2">in academia absolutely and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.280" end="00:55:50.970" style="s2">make it clear we we do this in the book</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.839" end="00:55:52.800" style="s2">we are not saying like we&#39;re above this</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.970" end="00:55:54.960" style="s2">and we&#39;re better than other people so in</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.800" end="00:55:56.339" style="s2">the opening chapters we give examples of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:55:59.130" style="s2">things that we do that are like this</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.339" end="00:56:00.930" style="s2">like I go to hotel and I have an expense</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.130" end="00:56:02.190" style="s2">account and I could walk across the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.930" end="00:56:05.730" style="s2">street and get a burrito from Chipotle</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.190" end="00:56:07.650" style="s2">or it could be lazy and pay $100 for</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.730" end="00:56:09.510" style="s2">room service and I&#39;m just like I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.650" end="00:56:10.740" style="s2">7500 dollars left in my account I&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.510" end="00:56:12.630" style="s2">ahead and get the room service who cares</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.740" end="00:56:14.250" style="s2">or I&#39;ll stay in a nicer room that I</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.630" end="00:56:16.470" style="s2">really need when I&#39;m in a conference or</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.250" end="00:56:18.660" style="s2">as I&#39;m sitting here talking to you my</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.470" end="00:56:20.220" style="s2">feet are on top of my $2,000 standing</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.660" end="00:56:21.480" style="s2">desk and it turns out I don&#39;t really use</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.220" end="00:56:24.390" style="s2">the standing desk that often I forget</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.480" end="00:56:26.339" style="s2">that it works money spent a bunch of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.390" end="00:56:28.369" style="s2">university&#39;s money on this or even</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.339" end="00:56:30.599" style="s2">thinking about where I invest my time</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.369" end="00:56:32.339" style="s2">though it&#39;s not clear this is a bad</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.599" end="00:56:35.160" style="s2">thing it might be what the university</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.339" end="00:56:36.450" style="s2">wants me to do but I as a professor in</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.160" end="00:56:38.310" style="s2">the mcdonoughs School of Business at</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.450" end="00:56:40.950" style="s2">Georgetown have a very strong incentive</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.310" end="00:56:42.060" style="s2">to prioritize research over teaching and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.950" end="00:56:44.250" style="s2">I can tell you exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.060" end="00:56:48.089" style="s2">incentive is because it&#39;s money and</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.250" end="00:56:49.109" style="s2">other things if I publish one book or</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.089" end="00:56:51.470" style="s2">article and what the university</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.109" end="00:56:53.490" style="s2">considers an a-level publication so</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.470" end="00:56:55.109" style="s2">cracks a ivory tower is an a-level</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.490" end="00:56:56.940" style="s2">publications published with Oxford</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.109" end="00:56:59.250" style="s2">University Press that is the number one</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.940" end="00:57:01.470" style="s2">peer-reviewed press for almost every</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.250" end="00:57:04.230" style="s2">field the university will reward me by</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.470" end="00:57:06.390" style="s2">giving me a summer bonus or 2/9 of my</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.230" end="00:57:08.070" style="s2">base salary it will increase my research</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.390" end="00:57:10.290" style="s2">budget and it will release me from a</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.070" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">course I don&#39;t have to teach as much on</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.290" end="00:57:13.800" style="s2">the other hand if I win the University</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:17.280" style="s2">Teaching Award I think I get like 10</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.800" end="00:57:20.099" style="s2">grand so I have a very strong incentive</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.280" end="00:57:21.690" style="s2">to put my time and effort into research</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.099" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">and very weak incentives to put it into</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.690" end="00:57:24.990" style="s2">teaching I should try to minimize the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:26.369" style="s2">amount of time I spend teaching them on</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.990" end="00:57:28.380" style="s2">time I think about it and just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.369" end="00:57:31.320" style="s2">like mail it in and instead pump up as</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.380" end="00:57:33.030" style="s2">much research as possible then you go on</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.320" end="00:57:35.609" style="s2">to and I thought was the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.030" end="00:57:37.470" style="s2">analysis and the whole book was you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.609" end="00:57:39.330" style="s2">perhaps a an attempt to reverse those</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.470" end="00:57:40.950" style="s2">incentives that most universities now</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.330" end="00:57:43.230" style="s2">require students to do course</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.950" end="00:57:45.390" style="s2">evaluations you know we didn&#39;t have such</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.230" end="00:57:47.010" style="s2">things in my day which was in the 70s or</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.390" end="00:57:49.050" style="s2">if they did nobody looked at me nobody</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.010" end="00:57:50.310" style="s2">gave a but so I understand now from</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.050" end="00:57:52.380" style="s2">talking to professor&#39;s they&#39;re a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.310" end="00:57:54.450" style="s2">damn big deal they count to some</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.380" end="00:57:55.690" style="s2">significant degree in tenure at least it</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.450" end="00:57:58.900" style="s2">not top research</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:58:00.190" style="s2">tract universities and in promotion but</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.900" end="00:58:02.230" style="s2">I think the word you said is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.190" end="00:58:05.230" style="s2">research overwhelming shows that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.230" end="00:58:07.450" style="s2">course evaluations are well garbage I</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.230" end="00:58:08.859" style="s2">think you also said actually reading tea</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.450" end="00:58:11.740" style="s2">leaves would be better it&#39;s equally</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.859" end="00:58:13.630" style="s2"> but it&#39;s faster and cheaper and</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.740" end="00:58:15.760" style="s2">you went into all kinds of really</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.630" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">interesting analysis about course</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.760" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">evaluations take us through some of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:23.440" style="s2">yeah so most universities I mean I say</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:25.150" style="s2">bonus I&#39;ve literally almost all of them</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.440" end="00:58:27.339" style="s2">there might be like three examples of</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.150" end="00:58:28.690" style="s2">places that don&#39;t use these a student</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.339" end="00:58:31.540" style="s2">course evaluations at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.690" end="00:58:33.430" style="s2">semester and they just ask the students</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.540" end="00:58:36.010" style="s2">how much did you learn was a instructor</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.430" end="00:58:38.530" style="s2">effective okay fair enough I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.010" end="00:58:41.140" style="s2">don&#39;t mind the idea of having some sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.530" end="00:58:42.730" style="s2">of check on professors I think it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.140" end="00:58:44.650" style="s2">to evaluate them and we should care</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.730" end="00:58:46.270" style="s2">about this stuff I I want to measure</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.650" end="00:58:48.250" style="s2">learning and hold her professors</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.270" end="00:58:49.780" style="s2">accountable to this I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.250" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">really want my university to do that but</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.780" end="00:58:55.510" style="s2">I want I think it should be done however</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:57.339" style="s2">the question is are these s CTS the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.510" end="00:59:00.010" style="s2">student evaluations of teaching are they</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.339" end="00:59:02.020" style="s2">actually measuring teaching how would we</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.010" end="00:59:04.750" style="s2">know well the best way to do that is to</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.020" end="00:59:06.819" style="s2">run various kinds of experiments there</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.750" end="00:59:09.670" style="s2">are all these problems with if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.819" end="00:59:11.560" style="s2">crappy professor at MIT your students</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.670" end="00:59:13.839" style="s2">will probably still learn more than if</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.560" end="00:59:16.690" style="s2">you are a really good professor at say</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.839" end="00:59:18.010" style="s2">UMass Boston because the MIT students</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.690" end="00:59:19.569" style="s2">are just smarter on average they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.010" end="00:59:20.500" style="s2">going to learn more there&#39;s all these</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.569" end="00:59:22.329" style="s2">other problems like all these</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.500" end="00:59:24.579" style="s2">confounding variables but there are ways</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.329" end="00:59:26.740" style="s2">of running experiments where you control</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.579" end="00:59:28.540" style="s2">over all possible confounding variables</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.740" end="00:59:30.220" style="s2">and you actually measure how much do</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.540" end="00:59:33.550" style="s2">students learn from this professor and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.220" end="00:59:35.109" style="s2">it turns out that every time it someone</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.550" end="00:59:37.990" style="s2">does any kind of analysis like this</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.109" end="00:59:39.819" style="s2">there&#39;s not only not a positive</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.990" end="00:59:41.619" style="s2">correlation between what students learn</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.819" end="00:59:43.410" style="s2">and what their evaluation score is</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.619" end="00:59:46.440" style="s2">there&#39;s actually a negative correlation</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.410" end="00:59:49.569" style="s2">another recent example of this was</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.440" end="00:59:50.619" style="s2">experiment was done where they put</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.569" end="00:59:52.599" style="s2">students and two different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.619" end="00:59:54.220" style="s2">teaching and they measured what they</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.599" end="00:59:57.040" style="s2">knew before the tech before the class</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.220" end="00:59:58.540" style="s2">and after and then when one kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.040" end="01:00:00.490" style="s2">teaching method you have students</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.540" end="01:00:01.990" style="s2">actively think through things but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.490" end="01:00:04.510" style="s2">problem with the active learning is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.990" end="01:00:06.310" style="s2">it shows you what you don&#39;t know so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.510" end="01:00:08.109" style="s2">feel kind of dumb and then they ask</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.310" end="01:00:09.640" style="s2">students to evaluate the teaching and it</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.109" end="01:00:11.739" style="s2">turned out they measure they</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.640" end="01:00:13.630" style="s2">lock through this method of teaching but</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.739" end="01:00:14.920" style="s2">students said it was not effective then</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.630" end="01:00:17.349" style="s2">there&#39;s another kind just passive</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.920" end="01:00:18.819" style="s2">learning just lecture the students they</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.349" end="01:00:20.319" style="s2">because they don&#39;t feel dumb because</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.819" end="01:00:21.579" style="s2">they&#39;re not struggling they felt like</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.319" end="01:00:23.410" style="s2">they learned a lot but in fact the</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.579" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">measurements show that they didn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.410" end="01:00:27.369" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:30.789" style="s2">research I mean it&#39;s amazing how much</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.369" end="01:00:32.470" style="s2">there is trying to test what our student</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.789" end="01:00:33.999" style="s2">evaluations of teaching measuring</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.470" end="01:00:36.279" style="s2">teaching ability at all are they</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.999" end="01:00:37.989" style="s2">measuring effectiveness and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.279" end="01:00:41.259" style="s2">what they seem to be interested is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.989" end="01:00:44.200" style="s2">reward for being a lacks grader and also</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.259" end="01:00:46.029" style="s2">largely a personality test do you are</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.200" end="01:00:47.499" style="s2">you fun and engaging into students like</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.029" end="01:00:49.059" style="s2">you by the way you might think well</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.499" end="01:00:51.190" style="s2">being funny engaging matters maybe makes</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.059" end="01:00:53.739" style="s2">them learn more but it doesn&#39;t so the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.190" end="01:00:55.180" style="s2">reason that universities use them even</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.739" end="01:00:58.420" style="s2">though they&#39;re overwhelmingly</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.180" end="01:01:00.009" style="s2">is one Dean&#39;s don&#39;t seem to know that</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.420" end="01:01:01.809" style="s2">they&#39;re so they&#39;re been all</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.009" end="01:01:03.099" style="s2">these studies where they they ask</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.809" end="01:01:04.869" style="s2">students do you think student</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.099" end="01:01:06.279" style="s2">evaluations of teaching are actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.869" end="01:01:07.599" style="s2">measuring teaching effectiveness and the</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.279" end="01:01:09.299" style="s2">students are kind of ambiguous the</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.599" end="01:01:11.319" style="s2">faculty think they aren&#39;t and</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.299" end="01:01:13.269" style="s2">administrators and Dean&#39;s think they are</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.319" end="01:01:14.799" style="s2">even though the research says that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.269" end="01:01:16.989" style="s2">not they just don&#39;t they&#39;re not aware of</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.799" end="01:01:18.190" style="s2">that another thing is if you think about</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.989" end="01:01:19.869" style="s2">the there&#39;s a conflict between</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.190" end="01:01:21.670" style="s2">administrators and faculty we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.869" end="01:01:24.130" style="s2">fighting over resources we&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.670" end="01:01:26.319" style="s2">over power administrators would love it</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.130" end="01:01:28.089" style="s2">if faculty are interchangeable and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.319" end="01:01:29.319" style="s2">could just replace them at will and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.089" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to sort of invest in them</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.319" end="01:01:32.950" style="s2">long term because that means more power</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.359" end="01:01:34.599" style="s2">and money and resources for them and</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.950" end="01:01:37.119" style="s2">faculty would like it if it goes the</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.599" end="01:01:38.890" style="s2">other way so insofar as we use student</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.119" end="01:01:40.809" style="s2">evaluations of teaching it&#39;s one way for</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.890" end="01:01:44.019" style="s2">administrators to sort of win the class</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.809" end="01:01:45.099" style="s2">conflict between admins and faculty and</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.019" end="01:01:47.369" style="s2">I think you can cash that out in</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.099" end="01:01:49.989" style="s2">individualistic terms too and finally</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.369" end="01:01:52.089" style="s2">it&#39;s also a good way of bamboozling with</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.989" end="01:01:53.470" style="s2">students because in the chapter on this</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.089" end="01:01:55.180" style="s2">I go through carefully what would it</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.470" end="01:01:57.249" style="s2">actually take to show that this method</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.180" end="01:01:58.839" style="s2">of teaching is effective what would it</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.249" end="01:02:00.999" style="s2">actually take to show that this person</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.839" end="01:02:03.039" style="s2">is a good teacher it&#39;s really expensive</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.999" end="01:02:05.680" style="s2">and really difficult and it interferes</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.039" end="01:02:08.019" style="s2">with student choice so no one wants to</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.680" end="01:02:09.910" style="s2">do that but you can give these</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.019" end="01:02:11.739" style="s2">tests of teaching effectiveness and</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.910" end="01:02:13.839" style="s2">trick students into thinking you care</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.739" end="01:02:15.369" style="s2">about teaching and voila and then of</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.839" end="01:02:17.680" style="s2">course once you get departments in place</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.369" end="01:02:19.239" style="s2">that run this as their job they have a</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.680" end="01:02:21.039" style="s2">very strong professional incentive to</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.239" end="01:02:22.869" style="s2">continue to lobby for the use of it and</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.039" end="01:02:23.420" style="s2">you have all these birds out there that</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.869" end="01:02:25.280" style="s2">like run</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.420" end="01:02:28.010" style="s2">has to provide soccer for and they Lobby</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.280" end="01:02:30.410" style="s2">extensively for it so again I like I</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.010" end="01:02:31.609" style="s2">love the idea of professors being</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.410" end="01:02:33.049" style="s2">measured and how good they are as</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.609" end="01:02:34.579" style="s2">teaching and being punished for being</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.049" end="01:02:36.079" style="s2">bad teachers and rewarded for being good</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.579" end="01:02:38.299" style="s2">teachers I totally think we should do</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.079" end="01:02:40.099" style="s2">that but student evaluations of teaching</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.299" end="01:02:42.020" style="s2">are not valid measurements of that</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.099" end="01:02:43.339" style="s2">they&#39;re measuring something else and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.020" end="01:02:45.079" style="s2">that&#39;s despite the fact that you score</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.339" end="01:02:47.809" style="s2">pretty high on these things I understand</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.079" end="01:02:49.339" style="s2">yeah I selfishly benefit from them the</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.809" end="01:02:52.250" style="s2">way that evaluations are done here in</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.339" end="01:02:53.869" style="s2">campus your raises determined oh by</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.250" end="01:02:56.150" style="s2">being better than the average in your</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.869" end="01:02:57.589" style="s2">group I get better than average student</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.150" end="01:02:59.150" style="s2">evaluation of teaching scores as a</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.589" end="01:03:02.000" style="s2">result my raise is higher than it would</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.150" end="01:03:03.200" style="s2">be if I got lower scores however again</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.000" end="01:03:05.750" style="s2">these scores are actually negatively</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.200" end="01:03:06.950" style="s2">correlated with learning so I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.750" end="01:03:08.150" style="s2">you in my own particular case whether</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.950" end="01:03:09.319" style="s2">they&#39;re learning more or less but an</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.150" end="01:03:10.790" style="s2">average the fact that I&#39;m getting higher</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.319" end="01:03:12.829" style="s2">scores than some of the other people in</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.790" end="01:03:14.240" style="s2">my department means probably my students</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.829" end="01:03:16.880" style="s2">are learning less for me so I&#39;m probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.240" end="01:03:19.040" style="s2">getting rewarded for being bad I love it</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.880" end="01:03:20.930" style="s2">in fact I actually liked your a fairly</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.040" end="01:03:23.119" style="s2">careful analysis of where the negative</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.930" end="01:03:24.440" style="s2">correlation came from it&#39;s one of those</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.119" end="01:03:26.329" style="s2">things when you think about it goes oh</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.440" end="01:03:27.829" style="s2">yeah of course but I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.329" end="01:03:29.150" style="s2">actually seen it laid out like that</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.829" end="01:03:31.069" style="s2">could you take us through the negative</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.150" end="01:03:33.589" style="s2">correlation phenomenon and what you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.069" end="01:03:35.420" style="s2">think is going on there yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.589" end="01:03:37.730" style="s2">puzzling why the negative correlation is</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.420" end="01:03:39.319" style="s2">there but it might be things like so</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.730" end="01:03:40.339" style="s2">this is a lot largely speculative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.319" end="01:03:42.200" style="s2">clear that there is a slight negative</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.339" end="01:03:46.220" style="s2">correlation but why is there as not as</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.200" end="01:03:48.470" style="s2">clear it could be that one thing is that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.220" end="01:03:50.329" style="s2">certain learning methods feel good even</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.470" end="01:03:52.280" style="s2">though they don&#39;t actually work certain</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.329" end="01:03:53.569" style="s2">methods require a lot from students and</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.280" end="01:03:55.760" style="s2">they feel like they&#39;re not working even</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.569" end="01:03:57.380" style="s2">though they do so again like lecturing</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.760" end="01:03:59.270" style="s2">feels like it works even though people</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.380" end="01:04:00.950" style="s2">learn less from it active learning feels</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.270" end="01:04:02.210" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t work because when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.950" end="01:04:03.290" style="s2">engaged in active learning you feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.210" end="01:04:05.510" style="s2">stupid at the time</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.290" end="01:04:08.510" style="s2">you sure struggling but in fact you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.510" end="01:04:10.309" style="s2">learning more also grading people the</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.510" end="01:04:12.710" style="s2">easier you are is a greater the higher</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.309" end="01:04:14.780" style="s2">scores you get that seems an obvious one</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.710" end="01:04:16.790" style="s2">to me yeah you know if you&#39;re a weak</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.780" end="01:04:18.619" style="s2">grader if you haven&#39;t you know any kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.790" end="01:04:20.420" style="s2">of reasonable theory about personal</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.619" end="01:04:22.640" style="s2">autonomy how hell yes you&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.420" end="01:04:24.589" style="s2">voted up and people are gonna learn less</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.640" end="01:04:26.930" style="s2">yeah people who are suffice to fising on</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.589" end="01:04:29.089" style="s2">their GPAs right yeah I had this</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.930" end="01:04:31.490" style="s2">professor in college who was a really</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.089" end="01:04:32.809" style="s2">hard grader and she just didn&#39;t accept</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.490" end="01:04:34.160" style="s2">anything less it was good and she would</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.809" end="01:04:36.079" style="s2">just make you rewrite things over and</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.160" end="01:04:37.150" style="s2">over and over again and a her case she</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.079" end="01:04:38.380" style="s2">got good teaching</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.150" end="01:04:40.299" style="s2">valuations only because none of her</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.380" end="01:04:42.339" style="s2">classes were like required classes and</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.299" end="01:04:43.569" style="s2">people knew she was a hard-ass so they</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.339" end="01:04:45.460" style="s2">would only take her class if they were</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.569" end="01:04:47.260" style="s2">willing to put up with that but if she</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.460" end="01:04:48.309" style="s2">been paid to teach and they never had</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.260" end="01:04:49.690" style="s2">her do this because of this if she&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.309" end="01:04:51.819" style="s2">been made to teach like the introductory</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.690" end="01:04:53.170" style="s2">political science course and she had</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.819" end="01:04:54.520" style="s2">that same kind of method what would have</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.170" end="01:04:56.109" style="s2">happened is most students would punish</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.520" end="01:04:57.549" style="s2">her they&#39;re like she&#39;s really mean and</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.109" end="01:04:58.869" style="s2">hard on me and she keeps making me do</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.549" end="01:05:02.020" style="s2">more work and they would have given her</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.869" end="01:05:03.760" style="s2">very low scores so as a professor you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.020" end="01:05:05.079" style="s2">incentive is to sort of take it easy on</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.760" end="01:05:07.150" style="s2">students and there&#39;s actually almost a</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.079" end="01:05:09.279" style="s2">kind of implicit bargaining that goes on</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.150" end="01:05:11.950" style="s2">with students it&#39;s like I won&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.279" end="01:05:12.490" style="s2">much from you and you don&#39;t require much</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.950" end="01:05:14.200" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.490" end="01:05:16.900" style="s2">you get benefited because you have more</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.200" end="01:05:18.700" style="s2">free time to to do the summer camp stuff</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.900" end="01:05:20.410" style="s2">that happens in college and have fun and</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.700" end="01:05:22.180" style="s2">I benefit because I have more time to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.410" end="01:05:23.740" style="s2">research and all the fame and money and</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.180" end="01:05:25.809" style="s2">statuses and research rather than</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.740" end="01:05:28.779" style="s2">teaching yeah reminds me of the old</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.809" end="01:05:30.849" style="s2">Soviet Union joke you know they pretend</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.779" end="01:05:33.789" style="s2">to pay us and we pretend to work right</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.849" end="01:05:36.250" style="s2">absolutely and fro it&#39;s worth there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.789" end="01:05:38.230" style="s2">really good evidence that students are</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.250" end="01:05:41.079" style="s2">studying much less now than they used to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.230" end="01:05:44.319" style="s2">in the past in the Year 1960 the average</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.079" end="01:05:46.779" style="s2">student in college was spending um about</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.319" end="01:05:48.640" style="s2">40 hours a week engaged in academic</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.779" end="01:05:51.640" style="s2">activities and now it&#39;s somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.640" end="01:05:53.500" style="s2">between like 23 and 27 hours some of</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.640" end="01:05:54.789" style="s2">that might be because students are more</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.500" end="01:05:56.410" style="s2">efficient they&#39;re better able to</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.789" end="01:05:58.329" style="s2">self-select into the right program so</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.410" end="01:05:59.980" style="s2">they&#39;re good at maybe maybe teaching</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.329" end="01:06:01.630" style="s2">methods have actually improved and that</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.980" end="01:06:03.849" style="s2">might be it but I think a lot of it just</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.630" end="01:06:06.579" style="s2">comes down to we expect less from</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.849" end="01:06:07.569" style="s2">students and get less okay how much</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.579" end="01:06:09.430" style="s2">don&#39;t be head a little bit here on my</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.569" end="01:06:11.200" style="s2">list because it Kies into the ongoing</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.430" end="01:06:14.109" style="s2">conversation you had some interesting</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.200" end="01:06:16.660" style="s2">things to say about the fallacy of GPAs</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.109" end="01:06:18.640" style="s2">and grading in general could you take us</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.660" end="01:06:20.980" style="s2">through that argument a little bit yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.640" end="01:06:23.319" style="s2">this is a because I that book we want to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.980" end="01:06:25.869" style="s2">fight throw fire and everybody so we had</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.319" end="01:06:27.880" style="s2">that chapter on student evaluations and</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.869" end="01:06:29.710" style="s2">faculty are going to read then go yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.880" end="01:06:31.900" style="s2">knew it and you went carefully through I</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.710" end="01:06:33.730" style="s2">knew it was ha ha and then the</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.900" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">next chapters don&#39;t go so easy on</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.730" end="01:06:37.809" style="s2">yourselves because you&#39;re doing the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:39.670" style="s2">thing okay yeah so then the empirical</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.809" end="01:06:41.589" style="s2">research shows that assigning great like</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.670" end="01:06:43.480" style="s2">again I I love the idea of measuring</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.589" end="01:06:45.160" style="s2">things I am NOT a Hampshire College</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.480" end="01:06:47.380" style="s2">hippie I have another book where I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.160" end="01:06:49.900" style="s2">I argue that you can assign a dollar</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.380" end="01:06:50.560" style="s2">value to every human life like I believe</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.900" end="01:06:52.840" style="s2">in number</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.560" end="01:06:54.880" style="s2">but because I believe in numbers I want</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.840" end="01:06:56.800" style="s2">to be scientific I don&#39;t like GPA it</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.880" end="01:06:58.480" style="s2">turns out that the process of assigning</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.800" end="01:07:00.790" style="s2">grace to people like giving them a</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.480" end="01:07:02.650" style="s2">letter grade actually demotivates them</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.790" end="01:07:04.390" style="s2">it makes them learn less so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.650" end="01:07:05.830" style="s2">problem so that we suggest that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.390" end="01:07:07.120" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t we should maybe just tell</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.830" end="01:07:09.580" style="s2">people how they&#39;re doing but not give</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.120" end="01:07:12.340" style="s2">them a grade but it gets worse one</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.580" end="01:07:14.350" style="s2">problem is that we say you know we all</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.340" end="01:07:15.610" style="s2">use the same letters but we don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.350" end="01:07:18.340" style="s2">the same things by it</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.610" end="01:07:21.220" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just Bob over here and Tommy</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.340" end="01:07:23.170" style="s2">over here they both you know was an easy</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.220" end="01:07:24.640" style="s2">grader one&#39;s a hard grader so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.170" end="01:07:27.340" style="s2">easier to get an A here than their</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.640" end="01:07:29.100" style="s2">that&#39;s it&#39;s not even that that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.340" end="01:07:32.260" style="s2">not even half of it the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.100" end="01:07:33.700" style="s2">grades mean different things so for some</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.260" end="01:07:35.140" style="s2">classes like if you take a class at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.700" end="01:07:37.000" style="s2">mcdonoughs School of Business or if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.140" end="01:07:39.460" style="s2">take a class in the law school at any in</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.000" end="01:07:41.500" style="s2">any law school grades are standing for</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.460" end="01:07:43.480" style="s2">class ranking that&#39;s why you should pose</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.500" end="01:07:45.700" style="s2">to rank people from first to worst in</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.480" end="01:07:47.410" style="s2">the class and then you assign them a</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.700" end="01:07:49.600" style="s2">grade that shows a rough reflection like</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.410" end="01:07:51.910" style="s2">so maybe the people at like the 50th</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.600" end="01:07:53.830" style="s2">percentile get like a b-plus or whatever</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.910" end="01:07:54.970" style="s2">it depends on what the curve is and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.830" end="01:07:56.800" style="s2">that&#39;s how it is in some classes in</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.970" end="01:07:59.410" style="s2">other classes a grade is supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.800" end="01:08:01.870" style="s2">a shorthand for a qualitative</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.410" end="01:08:05.350" style="s2">description like excellent good average</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.870" end="01:08:07.450" style="s2">or bad in other classes a grade is a</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.350" end="01:08:09.160" style="s2">shorthand for a percentage of questions</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.450" end="01:08:11.470" style="s2">you got right on some sort of test the</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.160" end="01:08:14.260" style="s2">problem is you can&#39;t average these</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.470" end="01:08:15.640" style="s2">things together so imagine you&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.260" end="01:08:17.620" style="s2">a class at the mcdonoughs School of</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.640" end="01:08:19.330" style="s2">Business you get an A in one group class</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.620" end="01:08:22.030" style="s2">that means you&#39;re ranked 1 out of 45</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.330" end="01:08:24.280" style="s2">students you get a B and the other that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.030" end="01:08:26.200" style="s2">means you&#39;re ranked 22 out of 45</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.280" end="01:08:27.819" style="s2">you cannot average it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.200" end="01:08:29.080" style="s2">mathematically incoherent to average</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.819" end="01:08:31.330" style="s2">those together because they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.080" end="01:08:32.710" style="s2">identical scales so say well what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.330" end="01:08:35.470" style="s2">average ranking the answer is there</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.710" end="01:08:37.420" style="s2">isn&#39;t one because the gap between</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.470" end="01:08:38.799" style="s2">students and one in these classes might</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.420" end="01:08:40.330" style="s2">be very different it might be very</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.799" end="01:08:41.920" style="s2">clustered together in one class and very</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.330" end="01:08:44.080" style="s2">spread out another they&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.920" end="01:08:45.609" style="s2">coherent thing when you have like a</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.080" end="01:08:48.609" style="s2">class in English in a class in like</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.609" end="01:08:49.660" style="s2">finance in a class in chemistry what you</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.609" end="01:08:52.270" style="s2">might be doing is saying something like</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.660" end="01:08:57.040" style="s2">here here&#39;s your grades mean excellent</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.270" end="01:09:00.400" style="s2">plus ranked seven on a 45 plus 85%</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.040" end="01:09:02.200" style="s2">divided by three equals what nothing it</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.400" end="01:09:04.540" style="s2">means nothing it&#39;s mathematically</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.200" end="01:09:06.490" style="s2">incoherent like so</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.540" end="01:09:08.230" style="s2">we nevertheless do this and this could</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.490" end="01:09:10.060" style="s2">be rescued by if it turned out that</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.230" end="01:09:12.250" style="s2">grades were highly correlated with</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.060" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">future success linkages turned out yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.250" end="01:09:15.160" style="s2">it&#39;s mathematically coherent but we do</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:16.870" style="s2">this and it turns out that people with</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.160" end="01:09:19.000" style="s2">high GPAs do better than people with low</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.870" end="01:09:22.569" style="s2">GPAs and there&#39;s a little bit of that</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.000" end="01:09:24.190" style="s2">though to my surprise I tried searching</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.569" end="01:09:25.900" style="s2">you know throw all these journals and</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.190" end="01:09:29.140" style="s2">using Google Scholar for literature on</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.900" end="01:09:31.900" style="s2">what does future great GPA predict about</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.140" end="01:09:34.750" style="s2">people&#39;s outcomes and it looks like not</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.900" end="01:09:37.150" style="s2">that much maybe high school GPA matters</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.750" end="01:09:39.370" style="s2">a lot more than college GPA but it</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.150" end="01:09:40.750" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to matter that much yeah we</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.370" end="01:09:43.089" style="s2">all remember that you could pick and</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.750" end="01:09:45.100" style="s2">choose amongst known gut courses to pad</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.089" end="01:09:46.180" style="s2">your GPA have nothing else right</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.100" end="01:09:47.710" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.180" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">yeah we professors we complain about</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.710" end="01:09:52.210" style="s2">students of teaching we are absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:53.680" style="s2">right to do so and then but we should</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.210" end="01:09:57.310" style="s2">apply those same standards to our own</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.680" end="01:10:00.220" style="s2">process of grading and grading does not</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.310" end="01:10:01.750" style="s2">pass grading gets an F all right then</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.220" end="01:10:04.720" style="s2">now I don&#39;t recall it being in the book</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.750" end="01:10:07.300" style="s2">but do you have a theory on what might</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.720" end="01:10:09.100" style="s2">work better for evaluating students yeah</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.300" end="01:10:10.570" style="s2">actually I do sit in the book and then I</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.100" end="01:10:11.740" style="s2">say we because we&#39;re selfish we hope</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.570" end="01:10:13.750" style="s2">that our own universities don&#39;t follow</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.740" end="01:10:16.150" style="s2">our advice what we should do is give</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.750" end="01:10:18.160" style="s2">them qualitative feedback on how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.150" end="01:10:19.450" style="s2">doing with written descriptions of what</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.160" end="01:10:21.790" style="s2">they did well and what they did badly</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.450" end="01:10:23.170" style="s2">and give that to them there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.790" end="01:10:26.070" style="s2">good evidence that that makes them learn</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.170" end="01:10:28.210" style="s2">more and it avoids the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.070" end="01:10:29.710" style="s2">students engaging and great rubbing</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.210" end="01:10:31.990" style="s2">behavior or students chasing the grade</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.710" end="01:10:33.310" style="s2">rather than chasing quality it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.990" end="01:10:35.320" style="s2">evidence that works and people learn</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.310" end="01:10:38.470" style="s2">more when you do it however it takes</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.320" end="01:10:40.480" style="s2">much much more time and I selfishly</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.470" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">don&#39;t want to spend more time on grading</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.480" end="01:10:44.260" style="s2">I want to spend more time writing papers</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.400" end="01:10:47.410" style="s2">again if I spend an extra 40 hours a</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.260" end="01:10:48.580" style="s2">semester grading that&#39;s time I could</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.410" end="01:10:50.560" style="s2">have written an article if I write an</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.580" end="01:10:52.000" style="s2">article I get a bigger race again we</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.560" end="01:10:54.640" style="s2">come back to our incentives problem</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.000" end="01:10:57.100" style="s2">right so if we you know put more</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.640" end="01:10:58.870" style="s2">incentive on teaching and required good</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.100" end="01:11:00.910" style="s2">qualitative feedback that you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.870" end="01:11:03.160" style="s2">some serious time in education may be</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.910" end="01:11:04.570" style="s2">improved though maybe you have to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.160" end="01:11:07.000" style="s2">more work to make your money but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.570" end="01:11:09.220" style="s2">okay we&#39;ll talk maybe very briefly at</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.000" end="01:11:11.800" style="s2">the end about college costs and what the</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.220" end="01:11:14.410" style="s2"> is going on there but before we do</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.800" end="01:11:16.240" style="s2">that let&#39;s jump up to another topic and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.410" end="01:11:18.010" style="s2">this had a very nice inflammatory</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.240" end="01:11:20.860" style="s2">chapter heading</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.010" end="01:11:23.830" style="s2">most academic advertising is immoral</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.860" end="01:11:25.900" style="s2"> yeah yeah for what it&#39;s worth I</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.830" end="01:11:27.820" style="s2">recently gave a talk at the Department</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.900" end="01:11:28.450" style="s2">of Education here in DC on that very</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.820" end="01:11:31.390" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.450" end="01:11:33.190" style="s2">so if five years from now it turns out</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.390" end="01:11:34.750" style="s2">that academic advertising is regulated</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.190" end="01:11:37.930" style="s2">heavily then you might be able to thank</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.750" end="01:11:41.020" style="s2">me but you know there&#39;s nothing quite so</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.930" end="01:11:43.450" style="s2">tasty as the hand that feeds here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.020" end="01:11:44.980" style="s2">worry the opening of that chapter we go</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.450" end="01:11:47.620" style="s2">through a lot of the advertising that</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.980" end="01:11:49.720" style="s2">colleges do universities in general and</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.620" end="01:11:51.220" style="s2">make these promises about how education</p>

<p begin="01:12:05.250" end="01:12:09.850" style="s2">liberal arts colleges in particular at</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.780" end="01:12:11.230" style="s2">universities you know like you know so</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.850" end="01:12:13.810" style="s2">Arizona State has a liberal arts</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.230" end="01:12:15.430" style="s2">division they&#39;ll say things like oh well</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.810" end="01:12:17.110" style="s2">you know liberal arts training it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.430" end="01:12:18.640" style="s2">professional training but the good news</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.110" end="01:12:20.500" style="s2">is it&#39;s better than professional</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.640" end="01:12:22.570" style="s2">training because we&#39;re going to have you</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.500" end="01:12:24.640" style="s2">analyze Shakespearean sonnets and right</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.570" end="01:12:27.010" style="s2">philosophy essays and think about</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.640" end="01:12:28.630" style="s2">sociological problems but the skills</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.010" end="01:12:30.310" style="s2">that you learn in class you can apply</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.630" end="01:12:31.930" style="s2">them to any job that you&#39;ll be more</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.310" end="01:12:34.030" style="s2">creative and more open-minded and a</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.930" end="01:12:35.590" style="s2">better thinker and better writer no</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.030" end="01:12:37.000" style="s2">matter what you&#39;re doing I don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.590" end="01:12:38.140" style="s2">specific departments and I pick</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.000" end="01:12:40.870" style="s2">philosophy because I have a philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.140" end="01:12:42.640" style="s2">PhD they&#39;ll make claims like well</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.870" end="01:12:45.310" style="s2">philosophy students get the best scores</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.640" end="01:12:47.710" style="s2">on the LSAT and the UM CAD and the best</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.310" end="01:12:50.080" style="s2">GRE scores so philosophy obviously is</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.710" end="01:12:51.580" style="s2">making you smarter and every major in it</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.080" end="01:12:53.410" style="s2">it also turns out the philosophy majors</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.580" end="01:12:55.510" style="s2">despite the joke about becoming</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.410" end="01:12:57.310" style="s2">hamburger flippers in reality they</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.510" end="01:12:58.990" style="s2">actually make a lot of money and do</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.310" end="01:13:00.460" style="s2">really well after about ten years on a</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.990" end="01:13:02.500" style="s2">college thing that making more money</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.460" end="01:13:03.640" style="s2">than almost any other major so therefore</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.500" end="01:13:06.220" style="s2">we&#39;re actually helping you make money</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.640" end="01:13:07.630" style="s2">you should major in philosophy okay</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.220" end="01:13:09.310" style="s2">that&#39;s what they say and we give lots of</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.630" end="01:13:10.990" style="s2">examples we even invite you as the</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.310" end="01:13:12.520" style="s2">reader to just pick a college near you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.990" end="01:13:14.830" style="s2">go to their website see what sorts of</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.520" end="01:13:18.160" style="s2">promises they make so here&#39;s the problem</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.830" end="01:13:20.320" style="s2">with all that one problem is many of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.160" end="01:13:22.780" style="s2">outcomes of college are not the result</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.320" end="01:13:24.190" style="s2">of what the college did for you but the</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.780" end="01:13:26.800" style="s2">fact that you aren&#39;t good enough to get</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.190" end="01:13:28.330" style="s2">in that&#39;s called the selection effect so</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.800" end="01:13:29.410" style="s2">if you think about a hundred people</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.330" end="01:13:31.540" style="s2">who&#39;ve been admitted to Harvard</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.410" end="01:13:33.730" style="s2">University think of how hard it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.540" end="01:13:35.500" style="s2">get into Harvard they&#39;re like oh at 4.1%</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.730" end="01:13:37.360" style="s2">acceptance rate you have to be</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.500" end="01:13:40.270" style="s2">incredibly smart incredibly talented</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.360" end="01:13:42.550" style="s2">incredibly driven or even just have good</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.270" end="01:13:44.350" style="s2">connections to to get into Harvard and</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.550" end="01:13:46.750" style="s2">then can consume people get into like</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.350" end="01:13:48.880" style="s2">Keene State University and some southern</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.750" end="01:13:51.160" style="s2">New Hampshire to get in there you kind</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.880" end="01:13:52.540" style="s2">of have to have a pulse and be alive I</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.160" end="01:13:54.460" style="s2">guess it&#39;s about that&#39;s pretty much what</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.540" end="01:13:57.640" style="s2">it takes high school diploma and be</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.460" end="01:13:59.230" style="s2">alive so made no offense to the schools</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.640" end="01:14:01.690" style="s2">because I&#39;m about to like criticize</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.230" end="01:14:03.070" style="s2">Harvard as I say this but the people who</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.690" end="01:14:05.320" style="s2">get to Harvard are really impressive so</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.070" end="01:14:07.060" style="s2">it&#39;s not a surprise when they graduate</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.320" end="01:14:08.560" style="s2">that they do really well because you had</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.060" end="01:14:10.150" style="s2">to be the kind of person who was bound</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.560" end="01:14:13.630" style="s2">to her success to get him in the first</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.150" end="01:14:15.100" style="s2">place so uh Ellen Kruger and Stacy Dale</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.630" end="01:14:17.320" style="s2">and a few others have done studies where</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.100" end="01:14:18.820" style="s2">they look at people who are admitted to</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.320" end="01:14:21.190" style="s2">these really fancy schools that have</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.820" end="01:14:22.690" style="s2">incredibly high selection criteria but</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.190" end="01:14:24.430" style="s2">then it actually go to the schools</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.690" end="01:14:26.470" style="s2">versus people that been admitted and</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.430" end="01:14:28.570" style="s2">then go to a much lower tier University</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.470" end="01:14:31.540" style="s2">because now you can start seeing okay</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.570" end="01:14:32.680" style="s2">you have the same quality person but one</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.540" end="01:14:34.000" style="s2">goes to the school and one doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.680" end="01:14:36.280" style="s2">what&#39;s the difference in their life</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.000" end="01:14:38.110" style="s2">outcomes it turns out in terms of salary</p>

<p begin="01:15:51.610" end="01:15:55.989" style="s2">on is our model liberal arts education</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.130" end="01:15:57.999" style="s2">is based upon a theory of psychology</p>

<p begin="01:16:04.239" end="01:16:08.079" style="s2">worse is that college is extremely</p>

<p begin="01:16:08.079" end="01:16:12.159" style="s2">a high opportunity cost so we make all</p>

<p begin="01:18:16.639" end="01:18:21.110" style="s2">system kind of fix I think if someone</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.590" end="01:18:22.280" style="s2">sued and won then that would change</p>

<p begin="01:18:23.570" end="01:18:27.800" style="s2">where I know people are suing certain</p>

<p begin="01:20:32.459" end="01:20:37.229" style="s2">and I was a working-class kid my father</p>

<p begin="01:20:43.530" end="01:20:49.679" style="s2">somehow I managed to scrape my way</p>

<p begin="01:20:57.570" end="01:21:05.369" style="s2">looked up the MIT s forecast what four</p>

<p begin="01:21:05.369" end="01:21:11.999" style="s2">went looked at the st. Louis feds</p>

<p begin="01:21:15.179" end="01:21:20.429" style="s2">have become 62k in those years but</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.959" end="01:21:22.769" style="s2">instead it&#39;s three hundred thousand what</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.429" end="01:21:25.229" style="s2">the right and of course you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.769" end="01:21:27.749" style="s2">the issue is that it works quote unquote</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.229" end="01:21:29.639" style="s2">on the numbers and higher ed has</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.749" end="01:21:31.709" style="s2">essentially become a positional good you</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.639" end="01:21:33.479" style="s2">know I want higher ed just so I can say</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.709" end="01:21:35.999" style="s2">that I have it probably for signaling</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.479" end="01:21:38.969" style="s2">purposes etc and that puts us all in</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.999" end="01:21:41.309" style="s2">this crazed race degenerate game theory</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.969" end="01:21:44.399" style="s2">race to grab our spot at whatever price</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.309" end="01:21:46.409" style="s2">they charge us because it perversely is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.399" end="01:21:49.769" style="s2">valuable and the thing that screams to</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.409" end="01:21:53.189" style="s2">me is why hasn&#39;t an industry arisen that</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.769" end="01:21:54.959" style="s2">does signaling an evaluation that is not</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.189" end="01:21:56.760" style="s2">free because we know that a free signal</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.959" end="01:22:00.300" style="s2">is not worth anything but it&#39;s expensive</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.760" end="01:22:02.429" style="s2">enough to be a good signal but is way</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.300" end="01:22:05.539" style="s2">less expensive and I can imagine in a</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.429" end="01:22:08.869" style="s2">six-month process of physical mental</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.539" end="01:22:11.849" style="s2">moral evaluation that could probably</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.869" end="01:22:15.749" style="s2">tell me as a higher err more about who</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.849" end="01:22:17.789" style="s2">I&#39;m hiring than $300,000 worth of fancy</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.749" end="01:22:19.409" style="s2">higher ed why hasn&#39;t that happen yeah</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.789" end="01:22:21.599" style="s2">good question so he have to gonna</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.409" end="01:22:22.829" style="s2">speculate here about these things what</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.599" end="01:22:24.690" style="s2">one thing&#39;s worth noting though is that</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.829" end="01:22:26.460" style="s2">the sticker price of these universe</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.690" end="01:22:30.120" style="s2">the actual price is often very different</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.460" end="01:22:31.290" style="s2">so uh you know my university its sticker</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.120" end="01:22:33.540" style="s2">price for four years is two hundred</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.290" end="01:22:36.449" style="s2">seventy thousand dollars but on average</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.540" end="01:22:39.330" style="s2">people are paying 120 all including all</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.449" end="01:22:41.850" style="s2">expenses because people have financial</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.330" end="01:22:42.989" style="s2">aid they get kind of grants and</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.850" end="01:22:45.930" style="s2">scholarships and other sorts of things</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.989" end="01:22:47.670" style="s2">so they&#39;re the real price is lower but</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.930" end="01:22:49.350" style="s2">it&#39;s still even when you take into</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.670" end="01:22:51.030" style="s2">account inflation it&#39;s still much higher</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.350" end="01:22:53.190" style="s2">than it should be so like the average</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.030" end="01:22:54.600" style="s2">student in MIT you can go on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.190" end="01:22:55.980" style="s2">Department of Education website right</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.600" end="01:22:57.030" style="s2">now look it up I wouldn&#39;t be surprised</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.980" end="01:22:59.130" style="s2">that they&#39;re paying on average about a</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.030" end="01:23:00.270" style="s2">hundred twenty-five but as you said it</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.130" end="01:23:02.070" style="s2">they were just keeping pace with</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.270" end="01:23:04.949" style="s2">inflation it should have been like 62 or</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.070" end="01:23:07.320" style="s2">65 so it&#39;s much higher than it should be</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.949" end="01:23:08.820" style="s2">even even taking that into account there</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.320" end="01:23:11.610" style="s2">was a lot of financial aid back in my</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.820" end="01:23:14.270" style="s2">Bay I mean my 16k half of it was</p>
<p begin="01:23:11.610" end="01:23:16.770" style="s2">financial aid yeah okay there you go um</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.270" end="01:23:18.690" style="s2">yeah why is it why don&#39;t we do about</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.770" end="01:23:20.969" style="s2">this why is it so high a couple things</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.690" end="01:23:22.710" style="s2">one is there&#39;s this thing called bobbles</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.969" end="01:23:24.360" style="s2">costs disease it&#39;s explaining some of</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.710" end="01:23:26.520" style="s2">the pricing problem in fact it might</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.360" end="01:23:28.410" style="s2">even be explaining most of it Danny bhai</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.520" end="01:23:30.540" style="s2">bobbles price disease is that certain</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.410" end="01:23:32.010" style="s2">kinds of fields become more efficient</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.540" end="01:23:35.239" style="s2">over time and others don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.010" end="01:23:38.100" style="s2">and so his example he was using was</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.239" end="01:23:39.780" style="s2">opera the technology for doing opera is</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.100" end="01:23:41.820" style="s2">basically the same I mean now we have</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.780" end="01:23:42.870" style="s2">microphones inside of Opera House some</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.820" end="01:23:44.100" style="s2">opera houses you&#39;re not really supposed</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.870" end="01:23:47.699" style="s2">to you&#39;re not that&#39;s actually considered</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.100" end="01:23:49.380" style="s2">a bad thing but opera singing is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.699" end="01:23:51.060" style="s2">really more efficient but in order to</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.380" end="01:23:52.890" style="s2">hire someone we have them do opera</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.060" end="01:23:55.020" style="s2">you&#39;re basically competing with all the</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.890" end="01:23:56.580" style="s2">other things that that person can do and</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.020" end="01:23:58.770" style="s2">other fields have become much more</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.580" end="01:24:01.410" style="s2">productive like auto manufacturing and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.770" end="01:24:03.239" style="s2">so on and so since they could be lured</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.410" end="01:24:05.580" style="s2">away to do these other sorts of jobs you</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.239" end="01:24:07.170" style="s2">have to pay people more to do that the</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.580" end="01:24:09.030" style="s2">job you want them to do even though</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.170" end="01:24:10.170" style="s2">you&#39;re not they&#39;re not more efficient or</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.030" end="01:24:12.330" style="s2">more productive and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.170" end="01:24:13.920" style="s2">bobbles cost disease that might be</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.330" end="01:24:16.320" style="s2">explaining like half of what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.920" end="01:24:18.330" style="s2">in higher ed another problem though is</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.320" end="01:24:20.190" style="s2">the fact that we subsidize higher ed</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.330" end="01:24:22.830" style="s2">actually increases the cost of higher ed</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.190" end="01:24:24.570" style="s2">so to analyze that imagine you know a</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.830" end="01:24:26.160" style="s2">new candidate comes to power over the</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.570" end="01:24:28.080" style="s2">next couple in the next election he says</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.160" end="01:24:30.570" style="s2">I&#39;m worried that too many Americans</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.080" end="01:24:31.860" style="s2">cannot afford a Honda Civic you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.570" end="01:24:34.440" style="s2">they should be able to buy like a a</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.860" end="01:24:36.840" style="s2">small high-quality compact four-door</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.440" end="01:24:38.670" style="s2">sedan but too many them can&#39;t afford it</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.840" end="01:24:40.860" style="s2">so what I&#39;m going to do is</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.670" end="01:24:43.110" style="s2">everyone in the country gets a $15,000</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.860" end="01:24:45.360" style="s2">tax credit to be spent on Honda Civics</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.110" end="01:24:46.800" style="s2">or any other car like that and then yes</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.360" end="01:24:48.540" style="s2">well what would happen to the price of</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.800" end="01:24:49.890" style="s2">Honda Civics like how do you think auto</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.540" end="01:24:51.870" style="s2">dealers would respond if we did that</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.890" end="01:24:53.550" style="s2">they would they would raise prices right</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.870" end="01:24:55.679" style="s2">yeah they would raise prices probably by</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.550" end="01:24:57.300" style="s2">about $15,000 in fact that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.679" end="01:24:59.340" style="s2">companies do when you give math</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.300" end="01:25:01.380" style="s2">subsidies if you give like a targeted</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.340" end="01:25:02.730" style="s2">subsidy a small number of very poor</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.380" end="01:25:04.440" style="s2">people and won&#39;t have much of effect in</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.730" end="01:25:06.780" style="s2">prices but if you give a subsidy to</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.440" end="01:25:08.460" style="s2">almost everybody then what happens is</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.780" end="01:25:11.640" style="s2">the price of that good goes up but</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.460" end="01:25:13.410" style="s2">that&#39;s for profit auto dealers of course</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.640" end="01:25:13.949" style="s2">those greedy jerks are going to try and</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.410" end="01:25:16.590" style="s2">take the money</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.949" end="01:25:18.449" style="s2">but obviously noble people working at</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.590" end="01:25:20.130" style="s2">Harvard and Princeton and you know Keene</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.449" end="01:25:21.630" style="s2">State College or not going to do that</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.130" end="01:25:24.300" style="s2">unfortunately it turns out they do</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.630" end="01:25:25.739" style="s2">so when governments put subsidies</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.300" end="01:25:26.910" style="s2">towards universities universities</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.739" end="01:25:29.190" style="s2">respond by saying oh there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.910" end="01:25:31.080" style="s2">artificial increase in effective demand</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.190" end="01:25:32.730" style="s2">we can charge more money and then we can</p>

<p begin="01:25:35.610" end="01:25:40.320" style="s2">now they have the experience as a</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.610" end="01:25:42.090" style="s2">student might be a lot more fun because</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.320" end="01:25:43.739" style="s2">they have the rock climbing walls and</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.090" end="01:25:45.480" style="s2">the lazy river and it&#39;s more on the</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.739" end="01:25:47.460" style="s2">dorms are nicer and it&#39;s like more of a</p>

<p begin="01:25:47.460" end="01:25:50.880" style="s2">that money and like do more research now</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.469" end="01:25:54.050" style="s2">than they were doing in the past and</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.880" end="01:25:55.890" style="s2">have like a bigger faculty and so on so</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.050" end="01:25:57.929" style="s2">universities react the same way auto</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.890" end="01:25:59.340" style="s2">dealers do they they just capture all</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.929" end="01:26:02.070" style="s2">that extra money and they keep raising</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.340" end="01:26:04.500" style="s2">prices so the perverse thing is that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.070" end="01:26:06.239" style="s2">phenomenon of subsidizing everyone is</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.500" end="01:26:08.400" style="s2">actually increasing the cost of college</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.239" end="01:26:09.960" style="s2">and making it ever more unaffordable I</p>

<p begin="01:26:09.960" end="01:26:13.380" style="s2">doing it there&#39;s phenomena that would</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.429" end="01:26:14.969" style="s2">cause it to rise and price even without</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.380" end="01:26:16.830" style="s2">that but it&#39;s still going on</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.969" end="01:26:18.449" style="s2">yeah now you&#39;re asking like what do we</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.830" end="01:26:21.000" style="s2">do about it why don&#39;t we have a fix and</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.449" end="01:26:22.350" style="s2">you pointed out that people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.000" end="01:26:24.660" style="s2">learning that much if it&#39;s just an</p>
<p begin="01:26:22.350" end="01:26:27.719" style="s2">expensive signal why don&#39;t we find some</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.660" end="01:26:30.630" style="s2">other alternative signal I think here my</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.719" end="01:26:32.810" style="s2">buddy Brian Kaplan has a good line where</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.630" end="01:26:35.400" style="s2">he says you know going to college</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.810" end="01:26:37.140" style="s2">signals not just that you&#39;re smart it</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.400" end="01:26:39.870" style="s2">signals not just that your perseverance</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.140" end="01:26:42.060" style="s2">but it also signals that you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.870" end="01:26:43.920" style="s2">normal you&#39;re you doing society expects</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.060" end="01:26:45.690" style="s2">of you like I imagine you know they</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.920" end="01:26:47.520" style="s2">think about signaling when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.690" end="01:26:49.980" style="s2">you proposing to my wife one thing I</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.520" end="01:26:51.670" style="s2">could do to prove them sincere is by our</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.980" end="01:26:53.560" style="s2">$5,000 ring and say well</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.670" end="01:26:56.199" style="s2">I&#39;ve wasted money on a trinket I really</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.560" end="01:26:58.390" style="s2">love you another thing I could do is cut</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.199" end="01:27:00.790" style="s2">my arm open and believe right up until</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.390" end="01:27:02.110" style="s2">the point of death and go look I want</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.790" end="01:27:03.580" style="s2">you to marry me to prove that I want you</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.110" end="01:27:05.260" style="s2">to marry me I&#39;m going to believe for</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.580" end="01:27:06.820" style="s2">four hours and then I&#39;m gonna stop right</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.260" end="01:27:08.590" style="s2">before I die and call an ambulance</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.820" end="01:27:09.940" style="s2">now those are both really good signals</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.590" end="01:27:11.650" style="s2">of sincerity in fact the second one</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.940" end="01:27:13.270" style="s2">might be better but she&#39;d probably be</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.650" end="01:27:14.710" style="s2">more likely to take me in the first one</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.270" end="01:27:15.670" style="s2">in the second because the second one is</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.710" end="01:27:18.070" style="s2">so weird</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.670" end="01:27:20.320" style="s2">she&#39;d be like who the hell is this guy</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.070" end="01:27:21.429" style="s2">like I don&#39;t know if I can he means he</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.320" end="01:27:22.690" style="s2">really just want to marry me but he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.429" end="01:27:24.670" style="s2">creep and a weirdo I don&#39;t know if I</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.690" end="01:27:27.400" style="s2">should be with this guy and the worry is</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.670" end="01:27:28.780" style="s2">that alternative mechanisms of proving</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.400" end="01:27:31.449" style="s2">that you&#39;ve got what it takes in your</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.780" end="01:27:32.949" style="s2">the right kind of person come across as</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.449" end="01:27:34.600" style="s2">being like the person who cuts himself</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.949" end="01:27:36.699" style="s2">to bleed and in order to show he wants</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.600" end="01:27:38.170" style="s2">to get married and employers are like I</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.699" end="01:27:40.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know we should take a risk on</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.170" end="01:27:42.310" style="s2">these people they&#39;re weirdos so</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.210" end="01:27:44.440" style="s2">education has the benefit of being a</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.310" end="01:27:46.719" style="s2">conformist behavior that proves you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.440" end="01:27:48.070" style="s2">the normal kind of person and why take</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.719" end="01:27:49.960" style="s2">the risk on something else</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.070" end="01:27:52.570" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s unfortunate but</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.960" end="01:27:54.460" style="s2">unfortunately probably true well yet we</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.570" end="01:27:57.489" style="s2">have time for one last question I got</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.460" end="01:27:59.530" style="s2">bunch more on my on my list here but in</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.489" end="01:28:01.300" style="s2">the spirit of throwing elbows every</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.530" end="01:28:04.510" style="s2">which way why don&#39;t you talk a little</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.300" end="01:28:07.210" style="s2">bit about the moral grandstanding around</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.510" end="01:28:09.940" style="s2">tenure yeah moral grandstand is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.210" end="01:28:11.890" style="s2">phenomenon about using moral language in</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.940" end="01:28:14.710" style="s2">order to promote your own status</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.890" end="01:28:16.120" style="s2">you see talk about morality and it</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.710" end="01:28:17.350" style="s2">sounds like if you just take what people</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.120" end="01:28:18.790" style="s2">literally think they&#39;re concerned about</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.350" end="01:28:20.230" style="s2">ethics but in reality what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.790" end="01:28:22.660" style="s2">trying to do is show that they&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.230" end="01:28:25.390" style="s2">person and we engage in a lot of moral</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.660" end="01:28:26.710" style="s2">discussion in academia when we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.390" end="01:28:28.179" style="s2">promoting our self-interest</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.710" end="01:28:29.500" style="s2">so we&#39;ll say you know the English</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.179" end="01:28:30.760" style="s2">department will say things like the</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.500" end="01:28:32.710" style="s2">reason we need to force people to take</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.760" end="01:28:34.030" style="s2">four courses in English is because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.710" end="01:28:35.650" style="s2">good for the students and they&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.030" end="01:28:37.300" style="s2">more and become better writers but the</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.650" end="01:28:38.530" style="s2">truth is we need to force them to take</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.300" end="01:28:40.630" style="s2">four courses in English because that</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.530" end="01:28:43.270" style="s2">gives us money and status so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.630" end="01:28:45.429" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of behavior tenure looks</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.270" end="01:28:47.650" style="s2">like another example of this the</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.429" end="01:28:49.449" style="s2">arguments for tenure things like people</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.650" end="01:28:51.580" style="s2">need to have academic freedom in order</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.449" end="01:28:54.400" style="s2">to do high-level research and risky</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.580" end="01:28:56.140" style="s2">research you give to people tenure as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.400" end="01:28:58.630" style="s2">reward to give them the freedom to swing</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.140" end="01:29:01.929" style="s2">for the fences and do risky things that</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.630" end="01:29:04.540" style="s2">might not pay off okay good hypotheses</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.929" end="01:29:05.350" style="s2">testable hypotheses they&#39;ve been tested</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.540" end="01:29:07.960" style="s2">and they&#39;re fall</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.350" end="01:29:10.450" style="s2">it turns out as you would expect in any</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.960" end="01:29:13.140" style="s2">other field when you give people a job</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.450" end="01:29:15.610" style="s2">for life that&#39;s very hard to lose they</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.140" end="01:29:18.850" style="s2">stop working as hard they publish less</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.610" end="01:29:20.680" style="s2">their ideas become smaller rather than</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.850" end="01:29:22.210" style="s2">bigger they don&#39;t swing for the fences</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.680" end="01:29:25.000" style="s2">they don&#39;t go for like the bigger</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.210" end="01:29:27.370" style="s2">long-term riskier projects they just do</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.000" end="01:29:29.230" style="s2">less work people&#39;s research productivity</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.370" end="01:29:31.450" style="s2">there&#39;s much higher when they&#39;re chasing</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.230" end="01:29:33.550" style="s2">tenure then after they get it on average</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.450" end="01:29:34.840" style="s2">again it&#39;s not true of everybody I mean</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.550" end="01:29:36.490" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;m publishing a higher rate of</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.840" end="01:29:39.100" style="s2">books now that I was before I got tenure</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.490" end="01:29:41.050" style="s2">but I&#39;m a weirdo and probably at some</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.100" end="01:29:43.120" style="s2">point I&#39;ll get lazy too like on average</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.050" end="01:29:45.340" style="s2">people slow down after getting tenure</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.120" end="01:29:47.590" style="s2">they take lower risk projects they go</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.340" end="01:29:49.630" style="s2">for smaller ideas rather than big ideas</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.590" end="01:29:51.220" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect in</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.630" end="01:29:52.810" style="s2">any other field if you&#39;re working at an</p>
<p begin="01:29:51.220" end="01:29:54.810" style="s2">ottoman as an auto mechanic and your</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.810" end="01:29:57.520" style="s2">boss said to you hey here&#39;s the deal I</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.810" end="01:29:59.350" style="s2">don&#39;t care how many cars you fix or how</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.520" end="01:30:00.910" style="s2">much the value of the repairs is as long</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.350" end="01:30:02.620" style="s2">as you avoid sexually assaulting the</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.910" end="01:30:04.540" style="s2">other people who work here and you just</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.620" end="01:30:06.430" style="s2">show up every day and do like the bare</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.540" end="01:30:09.040" style="s2">minimum you can keep your job forever</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.430" end="01:30:10.720" style="s2">and get a 5% raise year after year you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.040" end="01:30:11.560" style="s2">expect that auto mechanic would probably</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.720" end="01:30:14.710" style="s2">slack off</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.560" end="01:30:16.450" style="s2">that&#39;s what faculty do - the only really</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.710" end="01:30:18.970" style="s2">good argument I saw for tenure was an</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.450" end="01:30:21.070" style="s2">argument that said that maybe holds up</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.970" end="01:30:23.260" style="s2">was an argument that said if we were all</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.070" end="01:30:24.940" style="s2">able to get fired as soon as there was a</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.260" end="01:30:26.710" style="s2">financial extension see then what we</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.940" end="01:30:28.630" style="s2">would do when we hire people because</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.710" end="01:30:30.820" style="s2">faculty decide who gets hired in their</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.630" end="01:30:33.220" style="s2">own department we would purposely try to</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.820" end="01:30:34.660" style="s2">hire people that are inferior to us and</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.220" end="01:30:36.100" style="s2">that seems right I mean if I knew that</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.660" end="01:30:37.630" style="s2">like the next time University is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.100" end="01:30:39.430" style="s2">budget crisis they were just gonna start</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.630" end="01:30:40.450" style="s2">firing the least productive faculty well</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.430" end="01:30:41.980" style="s2">then I would make sure the next time we</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.450" end="01:30:43.450" style="s2">have a job I try to hire people that</p>
