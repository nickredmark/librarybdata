<p begin="00:00:09.500" end="00:00:18.210" style="s2">okay so we&#39;re speaking here with Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:19.470" style="s2">Roy and Jonathan Rosen and we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.210" end="00:00:22.109" style="s2">about bonitas</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.470" end="00:00:24.660" style="s2">new let&#39;s say it seems like a manifesto</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.109" end="00:00:28.410" style="s2">to me on some level even though that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.660" end="00:00:30.510" style="s2">rather dramatic way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.410" end="00:00:33.360" style="s2">but we are living in dramatic times and</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.510" end="00:00:36.210" style="s2">the article for emerge is called Corona</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.360" end="00:00:43.170" style="s2">19 a tale of two systems bonita you</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.210" end="00:00:46.410" style="s2">wrote this article proposing that we you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.170" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">had six steps towards creating a new</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.410" end="00:00:52.379" style="s2">prospect kind of prosperity okay in</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.899" end="00:00:54.660" style="s2">light of the crisis that that&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.379" end="00:00:58.020" style="s2">and systems collapse and what can can</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.660" end="00:00:59.640" style="s2">sort of come next and one of them was</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.020" end="00:01:02.430" style="s2">expand our political economic</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.640" end="00:01:04.830" style="s2">imagination design a global commons and</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.430" end="00:01:07.260" style="s2">service to life experience the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">sources of connection expand circles of</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.260" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">trust and concern reinvent education for</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:18.530" style="s2">the future and pivot to digital</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:21.840" style="s2">naturalism so that&#39;s a lot of stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.530" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">and you also divide you sort of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.840" end="00:01:27.900" style="s2">you&#39;re dividing the current systems of</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:29.820" style="s2">the world into two systems two worlds so</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.900" end="00:01:33.390" style="s2">in a way we&#39;re living in two worlds and</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.820" end="00:01:37.009" style="s2">and one world is sort of doomed and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.390" end="00:01:39.990" style="s2">other world has some kind of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.009" end="00:01:43.579" style="s2">so is that enough for you to work in may</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.990" end="00:01:48.329" style="s2">kind of introduce your vision bonita</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.579" end="00:01:50.369" style="s2">yeah I think we should back up and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.329" end="00:01:52.619" style="s2">so that was interesting so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.369" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">reflected like how the article might</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.619" end="00:01:56.369" style="s2">impacted you but I want I want to start</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:59.040" style="s2">with something Jonathan said when he</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.369" end="00:02:03.570" style="s2">asked me to make a contribution on</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:05.790" style="s2">corona and I think you said it like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.570" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">a lot of stuff and Jonathan said why is</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.790" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">this list important like it you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.209" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of less people put up</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.170" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">and and I really appreciated that</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.209" end="00:02:16.109" style="s2">feedback because I feel the same way</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:19.409" style="s2">like why these five things why not those</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.109" end="00:02:24.439" style="s2">five things so why these and so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.409" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">can backtrack and kind of frame it in</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.439" end="00:02:31.379" style="s2">Jonathan was looking at the drafts in</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:33.420" style="s2">the process and his invitation yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.379" end="00:02:35.730" style="s2">maybe we can we can start start with</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.420" end="00:02:38.849" style="s2">that I&#39;ll just briefly speak to that so</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.730" end="00:02:43.139" style="s2">I mean I run a charity in London called</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.849" end="00:02:45.349" style="s2">perspectiva and and we was co-founded</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.139" end="00:02:50.700" style="s2">the Thomas Bjorkman who some of your</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.349" end="00:02:53.040" style="s2">viewers will know and we you know three</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.700" end="00:02:54.720" style="s2">or four years ago began to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.040" end="00:02:56.819" style="s2">if you want understand complex systems</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.720" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">we need to also bring in the soul</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.819" end="00:03:01.739" style="s2">somehow and a part of the problem with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:03.689" style="s2">lot of thinking was that you could have</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.739" end="00:03:05.459" style="s2">a sort of view of systems thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.689" end="00:03:07.260" style="s2">economic change and political change on</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.459" end="00:03:09.239" style="s2">the one hand and you also had people</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.260" end="00:03:11.489" style="s2">talking about personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.239" end="00:03:14.099" style="s2">and spiritual growth on the other and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.489" end="00:03:16.680" style="s2">they were not very often talking to each</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.099" end="00:03:19.290" style="s2">other there were communities where they</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.680" end="00:03:21.239" style="s2">were but even in those conversations it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.290" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">wasn&#39;t clear how how productive and</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.239" end="00:03:24.599" style="s2">creative the conversations were there</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:26.879" style="s2">was a sense in which people had their</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.599" end="00:03:29.639" style="s2">natural biases how do they want to speak</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:31.919" style="s2">about all the things we should do to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.639" end="00:03:33.870" style="s2">economic model or they were more</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.919" end="00:03:36.720" style="s2">inclined to talk about stages of human</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.870" end="00:03:38.909" style="s2">spiritual maturation and the kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.720" end="00:03:41.579" style="s2">practices we should do to get there and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.909" end="00:03:43.500" style="s2">perspectiva was founded partly to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.579" end="00:03:46.019" style="s2">sense of that connection and realize</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.500" end="00:03:48.419" style="s2">it&#39;s a long-term conversation we call</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.019" end="00:03:50.280" style="s2">ourselves an urgent 100 year project for</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.419" end="00:03:52.680" style="s2">that reason because we recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.280" end="00:03:55.379" style="s2">you know systems are complex and often</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.680" end="00:03:56.790" style="s2">in any given case and you have multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.379" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">systems interlocking as we do at the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.790" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:02.250" style="s2">but you also have the kind of interior</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:04.280" style="s2">&#39;ti of the systems and so when you bring</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.250" end="00:04:07.019" style="s2">all those things together you get a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.280" end="00:04:08.669" style="s2">deliciously complex but often hard to</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.019" end="00:04:11.159" style="s2">communicate set of insights and ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.669" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">and there are there aren&#39;t that many</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.159" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">people who can sort of play at that</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:19.500" style="s2">level if you like but it&#39;s uh certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:20.909" style="s2">one of them Zachary Stein whom we asked</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.500" end="00:04:24.690" style="s2">thought to write for us as well as</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.909" end="00:04:26.090" style="s2">another and they appear on the emerge</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.690" end="00:04:29.990" style="s2">website because Amer</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.090" end="00:04:31.699" style="s2">as part of perspectiva we were part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.990" end="00:04:33.260" style="s2">the creation of it and over time we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.699" end="00:04:35.930" style="s2">taken more more responsibility towards</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.260" end="00:04:37.340" style="s2">it in due course the distinction is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.930" end="00:04:40.130" style="s2">basically they emerge is meant to be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.340" end="00:04:42.250" style="s2">relatively accessible emerges is</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.130" end="00:04:44.240" style="s2">designed to be reaching a large audience</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.250" end="00:04:47.650" style="s2">whereas perspective is maybe a little</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.240" end="00:04:50.690" style="s2">bit more challenging precise</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.650" end="00:04:52.760" style="s2">intellectually exacting and so the in</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.690" end="00:04:54.470" style="s2">ideal world we get these pieces pitch to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.760" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">refined and edited so they can reach</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.470" end="00:04:58.460" style="s2">many people but then we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">further as we are here and get drill</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.460" end="00:05:02.630" style="s2">down a little bit more depth and clarity</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:05.330" style="s2">about what&#39;s being said right because</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.630" end="00:05:09.380" style="s2">one of the things that Bonita mentions I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.330" end="00:05:12.169" style="s2">think often is the danger of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.380" end="00:05:14.210" style="s2">very reductive thinking and I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.169" end="00:05:16.310" style="s2">danger of manifesto in a sense and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.210" end="00:05:21.260" style="s2">calling it that you didn&#39;t call it that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.310" end="00:05:24.500" style="s2">but it does have a let&#39;s say a vision to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.260" end="00:05:27.800" style="s2">it one of the dangers is is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.500" end="00:05:29.870" style="s2">reductionism so I wonder if we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.800" end="00:05:33.590" style="s2">in a time where you know there is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.870" end="00:05:35.389" style="s2">danger of a very very quick quick we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.590" end="00:05:37.940" style="s2">living in a time that&#39;s very urgent on</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.389" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2">one hand and an end at a time that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.940" end="00:05:42.349" style="s2">requires very careful careful thought at</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:46.760" style="s2">the other and maybe that&#39;s the that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.349" end="00:05:51.830" style="s2">the line or that&#39;s the attention yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.760" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">I want to call it a halt a pesto so it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.830" end="00:05:59.000" style="s2">looks like a manifesto but it has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:06:01.220" style="s2">holistic kind of view instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.000" end="00:06:02.810" style="s2">reductive view so if you want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.220" end="00:06:07.160" style="s2">calling it something we can go out a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.810" end="00:06:12.169" style="s2">hole of Festo so here&#39;s where we need to</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.160" end="00:06:14.539" style="s2">be careful there is reductionism that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.169" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">like scientific reductionism so we</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.539" end="00:06:20.030" style="s2">abstract from experience down to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:22.190" style="s2">concepts and then we can manipulate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:25.099" style="s2">concepts as if they stand in for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.190" end="00:06:30.080" style="s2">whole that&#39;s one thing now the</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.099" end="00:06:34.219" style="s2">postmodern systemic mind moves away from</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.080" end="00:06:36.950" style="s2">that kind of reductionism toward what we</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.219" end="00:06:39.830" style="s2">would call synthetic systems making so</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.950" end="00:06:42.970" style="s2">larger and larger systems more and more</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.830" end="00:06:45.710" style="s2">points to contextualise you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.970" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">transdisciplinary kind of integrations</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.710" end="00:06:52.780" style="s2">and syntheses and these build hyper</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:57.800" style="s2">objects right so it&#39;s not reductionist</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.780" end="00:07:00.520" style="s2">but it has its own liability there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.800" end="00:07:03.830" style="s2">there&#39;s no pivot point in which to act</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.520" end="00:07:07.159" style="s2">you can&#39;t get in there okay that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.830" end="00:07:09.470" style="s2">I wanted to actually bring up as like</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.159" end="00:07:12.710" style="s2">you mentioned in your email that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.470" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">wanted this stuff to be actionable hmm</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.710" end="00:07:18.409" style="s2">yeah so then what&#39;s the Third Way right</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:21.620" style="s2">if we don&#39;t want to build hyper objects</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.409" end="00:07:25.009" style="s2">and and I&#39;m not saying all the first two</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.620" end="00:07:30.199" style="s2">are not necessary I&#39;m saying that they</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.009" end="00:07:32.810" style="s2">each give us valuable insight into what</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.199" end="00:07:36.169" style="s2">we&#39;re dealing with but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.810" end="00:07:40.310" style="s2">third way and this Third Way has is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.169" end="00:07:43.190" style="s2">a move into the felt sense a move into</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.310" end="00:07:48.069" style="s2">the body a move into like getting real</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.190" end="00:07:51.529" style="s2">with what is your despair or what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.069" end="00:07:56.539" style="s2">what is possible from here like what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.529" end="00:07:58.430" style="s2">simply possible from here and as as</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.539" end="00:08:00.349" style="s2">Jonathan knows I went through this</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.430" end="00:08:03.469" style="s2">process with this article because first</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.349" end="00:08:06.949" style="s2">it was big and synthetic and I hated it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.469" end="00:08:09.830" style="s2">because it was just a clever use of your</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.949" end="00:08:12.889" style="s2">mind in a certain way hmm so what is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.830" end="00:08:16.340" style="s2">being asked of me what is being asked of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.889" end="00:08:20.289" style="s2">me at this point in history you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.340" end="00:08:25.069" style="s2">what and from there and this article</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.289" end="00:08:28.789" style="s2">emerges and so for example I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.069" end="00:08:32.079" style="s2">give you how it&#39;s how it can play out</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.789" end="00:08:36.820" style="s2">after I wrote the article I was in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.079" end="00:08:40.130" style="s2">process of doing these community calls</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.820" end="00:08:42.649" style="s2">with various different groups for a week</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.130" end="00:08:45.740" style="s2">once a week for three weeks and in this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.649" end="00:08:48.170" style="s2">one group someone said Oh what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:52.970" style="s2">working with so-and-so and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.970" end="00:09:00.350" style="s2">to recreate the whole US economy and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.889" end="00:09:03.800" style="s2">know it&#39;s very bright person and then he</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.350" end="00:09:06.649" style="s2">said but the problem of course is only</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.800" end="00:09:09.050" style="s2">you know not even 20% of people will</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.649" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">actually get it they&#39;re too stupid and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.050" end="00:09:15.439" style="s2">said we don&#39;t need sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:17.629" style="s2">financial instruments we need simple</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.439" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">financial instruments that everyone can</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.629" end="00:09:23.029" style="s2">understand that guaranteed to work for</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:24.350" style="s2">them you see the difference now it took</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.029" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">me a long time</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.350" end="00:09:30.199" style="s2">actually not until I wrote this article</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:32.689" style="s2">did even I get it because I was like</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.199" end="00:09:35.509" style="s2">chasing like more and more complexity in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.689" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">this and that and when I realized that</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.509" end="00:09:40.129" style="s2">we could just have a simple funnier</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:41.660" style="s2">everyone understands how to do this that</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.129" end="00:09:44.449" style="s2">didn&#39;t have to take down the whole</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.660" end="00:09:46.759" style="s2">economy I thought oh my god what if I</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.449" end="00:09:48.769" style="s2">thought more like this maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.759" end="00:09:51.019" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot hidden in plain sight a</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.769" end="00:09:53.329" style="s2">lot of potential in plain sight but this</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.019" end="00:09:54.800" style="s2">is a different kind of thinking and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.329" end="00:09:57.199" style="s2">don&#39;t you know want to go meta on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.800" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">thinking one of your audience will</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.199" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole nother you know PhD in</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:07.069" style="s2">that but this is like for me what what</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:09.110" style="s2">the invitation is that Jonathan is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.069" end="00:10:11.600" style="s2">looking for and like Zak does the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.110" end="00:10:15.110" style="s2">he does a similar thing but you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.600" end="00:10:16.399" style="s2">it&#39;s all orthogonal to like he said I</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.110" end="00:10:19.100" style="s2">think on your video</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.399" end="00:10:21.199" style="s2">I didn&#39;t even propose anything you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.100" end="00:10:23.629" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t even arguing for anything he he</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.199" end="00:10:26.269" style="s2">he took something from insider and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.629" end="00:10:32.389" style="s2">himself and put it in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.269" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">this and so this is I think what</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.389" end="00:10:39.649" style="s2">Jonathan has it&#39;s a nose for but you</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:43.850" style="s2">know anyway something like imaginal is</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.649" end="00:10:46.250" style="s2">the word that comes to mind or or this a</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.850" end="00:10:47.930" style="s2">word I got from from John Verve a key he</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.250" end="00:10:50.750" style="s2">talks the difference between imagination</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.930" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">just imagining all these things and kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.750" end="00:10:54.949" style="s2">of going into a fantasy of how the world</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">could be where as actual concrete</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.949" end="00:10:59.949" style="s2">imaginal I think that&#39;s what Zak was</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:02.209" style="s2">doing he was putting forth imaginal</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.949" end="00:11:04.399" style="s2">structures that we could work with</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.209" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">rather than let&#39;s say a research paper</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.399" end="00:11:07.699" style="s2">more</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:10.249" style="s2">something like that did you want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.699" end="00:11:12.170" style="s2">respond Jonathan yeah sure so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.249" end="00:11:15.319" style="s2">lot going on and it&#39;s fascinating to</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.170" end="00:11:18.589" style="s2">hear the process angle on what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.319" end="00:11:20.929" style="s2">said before we get delving into material</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.589" end="00:11:22.189" style="s2">of it the substance of it um I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.929" end="00:11:23.629" style="s2">going through a little bit of a trip</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.189" end="00:11:25.699" style="s2">myself for the last few weeks because</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.629" end="00:11:29.149" style="s2">I&#39;ve been countered partly through</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.699" end="00:11:32.269" style="s2">Benitez SC we should use the word origin</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.149" end="00:11:33.829" style="s2">arey mmm the use this word origin arey I</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.269" end="00:11:35.389" style="s2">thought she&#39;d be the type of right which</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.829" end="00:11:36.709" style="s2">is it which is kind of embarrassing but</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.389" end="00:11:38.929" style="s2">an embarrassment and happy tune up see</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.709" end="00:11:42.170" style="s2">and ordinary is actually a term from</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.929" end="00:11:45.739" style="s2">jean gebser and it&#39;s a really important</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.170" end="00:11:48.589" style="s2">notion and it&#39;s usefully juxtaposed with</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.739" end="00:11:51.079" style="s2">imaginary and you&#39;ve mentioned the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.589" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">imaginal and Rousseau to sort of frame</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.079" end="00:11:58.040" style="s2">these different notions the imaginary is</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:59.209" style="s2">often this sort of the kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.040" end="00:12:01.220" style="s2">inside of the whole world</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.209" end="00:12:07.309" style="s2">the imaginary is something like how we</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.220" end="00:12:09.049" style="s2">experience culture writ large and how it</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.309" end="00:12:11.989" style="s2">circumscribes our notion of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.049" end="00:12:13.399" style="s2">normal the imaginary is that which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.989" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">it&#39;s several layers of abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.399" end="00:12:19.669" style="s2">beyond you know your immediate</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:21.529" style="s2">experience than your culture it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.669" end="00:12:23.929" style="s2">of a holding pattern for a subjective an</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.529" end="00:12:25.489" style="s2">interest subjective experience and there</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.929" end="00:12:28.069" style="s2">are ways of describing I think Charles</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.489" end="00:12:30.649" style="s2">Taylor calls it the widest possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.069" end="00:12:32.569" style="s2">grasp of our whole predicament right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.649" end="00:12:34.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a nice area a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.569" end="00:12:36.679" style="s2">been speaking recently about the need</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.160" end="00:12:38.239" style="s2">for a new social imaginary because their</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.679" end="00:12:41.569" style="s2">master we have is basically as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.239" end="00:12:44.449" style="s2">consumerist late capitalist world</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.569" end="00:12:45.889" style="s2">falling apart imaginary and maybe we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.449" end="00:12:49.329" style="s2">be better and that&#39;s one of the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.889" end="00:12:52.669" style="s2">out there but with the richer deeper</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.329" end="00:12:53.809" style="s2">perhaps more profound notion which is</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.669" end="00:12:55.939" style="s2">connected with the evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.809" end="00:12:58.850" style="s2">consciousness which is sort of saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.939" end="00:13:00.919" style="s2">look these imaginaries will either be</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.850" end="00:13:04.100" style="s2">given unto us by processes of history</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.919" end="00:13:05.389" style="s2">mostly material processes like what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.100" end="00:13:06.410" style="s2">happening to land what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.389" end="00:13:08.269" style="s2">technology what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.410" end="00:13:09.949" style="s2">population movements we will give rise</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.269" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">to subjective an interest subjective</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.949" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">experience right and that keeps on</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:16.309" style="s2">happening until we get to a point now</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:17.809" style="s2">where something you become aware hang on</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.309" end="00:13:18.960" style="s2">we&#39;re calling this thing called the</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.809" end="00:13:21.330" style="s2">imaginary what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.960" end="00:13:22.860" style="s2">can we change it are we are we subject</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.330" end="00:13:25.560" style="s2">to it is there a sense in which we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.860" end="00:13:27.570" style="s2">build our own imaginary that&#39;s a highly</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.560" end="00:13:30.750" style="s2">non-trivial process because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.570" end="00:13:32.790" style="s2">you know a spiderweb being reconstructed</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.750" end="00:13:36.000" style="s2">after it&#39;s broken up broken down your</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.790" end="00:13:38.970" style="s2">your your coming out of something kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.000" end="00:13:41.040" style="s2">of natural and process-driven</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.970" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">and cleaning that you can through a sort</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.040" end="00:13:46.290" style="s2">of effort who will recreates it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.980" end="00:13:47.910" style="s2">highly questionable that we can which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.290" end="00:13:50.339" style="s2">where the idea of the origin area</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.910" end="00:13:52.260" style="s2">becomes interesting because in effect</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.339" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">you&#39;re saying look look more deeply at</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.260" end="00:13:57.390" style="s2">those processes follow them back to</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:59.250" style="s2">where they started look at the origin</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.390" end="00:14:01.020" style="s2">right and this is where again steep</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.250" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">which is you know what kind of origin</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.020" end="00:14:05.670" style="s2">well mathematical origin certainly</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:07.589" style="s2">mathematical becoming physical becoming</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.670" end="00:14:09.830" style="s2">chemical becoming biological becoming</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.589" end="00:14:13.890" style="s2">evolution becoming psychological</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.830" end="00:14:17.070" style="s2">becoming spiritual but arguably right at</p>

<p begin="00:14:17.070" end="00:14:20.130" style="s2">is since our theological water but the</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.010" end="00:14:30.209" style="s2">sort of false authority here but but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.110" end="00:14:32.790" style="s2">excited by his work because it tallies</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.209" end="00:14:35.160" style="s2">with a lot of other thinkers mark Vernon</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.940" end="00:14:43.560" style="s2">something different about participator</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.430" end="00:14:45.690" style="s2">annoying but as Bonnie I think was</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.560" end="00:14:47.370" style="s2">alluding to earlier getting away from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.690" end="00:14:49.980" style="s2">way of knowing that is sort of abstract</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.370" end="00:14:51.740" style="s2">and sort of event mental models and</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.980" end="00:14:53.970" style="s2">getting back into the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.740" end="00:14:56.760" style="s2">rediscovering your original tacit</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.970" end="00:14:59.220" style="s2">understanding of things and no longer in</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.760" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">a naive way recognizing that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.220" end="00:15:03.209" style="s2">situated within these cultural contexts</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:05.130" style="s2">these are national contexts but no</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.209" end="00:15:07.170" style="s2">longer being asked subject to them being</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.130" end="00:15:08.910" style="s2">able to somehow get back to you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.170" end="00:15:11.310" style="s2">it&#39;s like in the Zen tradition this</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.910" end="00:15:13.170" style="s2">because before enlightenment carrying</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.310" end="00:15:15.060" style="s2">water and chopping wood and after and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.170" end="00:15:17.370" style="s2">light carrying water chopping wood so</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.060" end="00:15:19.500" style="s2">the origin Airy for me this notion is</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.370" end="00:15:21.990" style="s2">quite a profound wise it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.500" end="00:15:24.630" style="s2">like saying there is a challenge with</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.990" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">our social imaginary for the essence of</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.630" end="00:15:30.750" style="s2">the challenge is that we have to find a</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:32.330" style="s2">way to rediscover the origin Airy the</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.750" end="00:15:34.310" style="s2">sort of origin of this</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.330" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">of creation and recreation that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.310" end="00:15:40.040" style="s2">caught up in and I become conscious</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.560" end="00:15:41.330" style="s2">agents of that in some way and how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.040" end="00:15:43.550" style="s2">don&#39;t know but that&#39;s where we are I</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.330" end="00:15:46.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s wonderful and before you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.550" end="00:15:47.630" style="s2">speak on that Bonita I remember in your</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.040" end="00:15:51.170" style="s2">article you mentioned something about</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.630" end="00:15:53.720" style="s2">how you compared sort of the project of</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.170" end="00:15:55.670" style="s2">going to the moon right as this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.720" end="00:15:58.520" style="s2">something that the American ego felt</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.670" end="00:16:01.880" style="s2">like it needed to do to go to the moon</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.520" end="00:16:05.000" style="s2">like land on the moon right to define</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.880" end="00:16:06.770" style="s2">itself to be to be something whereas</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.000" end="00:16:08.420" style="s2">whereas you were saying that our task</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.770" end="00:16:10.520" style="s2">right now and this is just putting</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.420" end="00:16:12.440" style="s2">simply what what Jonathan sakes is</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:14.810" style="s2">saying about the originally this is just</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.440" end="00:16:20.060" style="s2">step on the earth like that&#39;s the more</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.810" end="00:16:23.630" style="s2">difficult task that we have to do does</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.060" end="00:16:25.870" style="s2">that does that ring true is that is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.630" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">a good segue to what Jonathan was saying</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.870" end="00:16:36.200" style="s2">yeah so you know I really I wasn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:37.100" style="s2">wasn&#39;t critiquing the moon shot yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.200" end="00:16:40.400" style="s2">sorry</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.100" end="00:16:41.660" style="s2">Rick that was my critiques yeah yeah not</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.400" end="00:16:44.360" style="s2">yours excuse me you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.660" end="00:16:48.140" style="s2">interesting because I linked that speech</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.360" end="00:16:50.270" style="s2">and many people emailed me and they were</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.140" end="00:16:54.110" style="s2">blown away like there are young people</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.270" end="00:16:56.090" style="s2">who never see leaders talk like that so</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.110" end="00:16:59.840" style="s2">whether you think it you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.090" end="00:17:03.170" style="s2">your your retrospective historical</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.840" end="00:17:07.450" style="s2">critique on those times is that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.170" end="00:17:07.450" style="s2">how it was playing out at the time so</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:14.930" style="s2">yeah but now it&#39;s a different you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.940" end="00:17:18.850" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a different need it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.930" end="00:17:18.850" style="s2">different calling it&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.720" end="00:17:26.450" style="s2">aspiration let&#39;s say it&#39;s you know and</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.660" end="00:17:31.550" style="s2">for me like part of what I said in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.450" end="00:17:35.090" style="s2">last part about digital naturalism is a</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.550" end="00:17:37.550" style="s2">lot of for me a lot of is that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.090" end="00:17:41.590" style="s2">what we need to do is hidden in plain</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.550" end="00:17:44.680" style="s2">sight but our way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.590" end="00:17:46.100" style="s2">intelligence and development means that</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.680" end="00:17:49.010" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.100" end="00:17:51.910" style="s2">in the future and more complexity as</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.010" end="00:17:55.250" style="s2">always his progress represents progress</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.910" end="00:17:59.570" style="s2">this is not surprising because we live</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.250" end="00:18:02.210" style="s2">in a competitive growth economy based on</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.570" end="00:18:06.530" style="s2">information so we escalate the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.210" end="00:18:09.440" style="s2">complexity of information regardless of</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.530" end="00:18:13.910" style="s2">whether it&#39;s in the right direction so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.440" end="00:18:16.310" style="s2">we don&#39;t really in general this is true</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.910" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">in organizations as well as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.310" end="00:18:23.800" style="s2">in general we don&#39;t create organizations</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.730" style="s2">that are committed to a task in the past</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.800" end="00:18:27.170" style="s2">organizations would commit to a task</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.730" end="00:18:29.570" style="s2">they built something and then they would</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.170" end="00:18:31.790" style="s2">they would die out now we create</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.570" end="00:18:35.980" style="s2">organizations that are committed to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.790" end="00:18:39.980" style="s2">life lifelong profit of the organization</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.980" end="00:18:42.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter what the task is so very</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.980" end="00:18:45.470" style="s2">few people get really clean on what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.830" end="00:18:47.180" style="s2">the task what are we trying to do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.470" end="00:18:47.720" style="s2">know killings and so the moonshot is</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.180" end="00:18:49.790" style="s2">perfect</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:53.090" style="s2">it&#39;s very clear we&#39;re going to the moon</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.790" end="00:18:56.930" style="s2">all the learnings and all the other</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.090" end="00:19:03.580" style="s2">things are inside that commitment in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.930" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">that goal so and so we need that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.580" end="00:19:09.100" style="s2">you&#39;re saying we need that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:12.460" style="s2">direction that kind of intense you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.100" end="00:19:15.230" style="s2">direction even that that sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.460" end="00:19:17.060" style="s2">grand narrative that we need though you</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.230" end="00:19:21.020" style="s2">know going to the moon is a big project</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.060" end="00:19:23.660" style="s2">right so I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.020" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">a a paradox and what you&#39;re saying is</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.660" end="00:19:29.060" style="s2">that we don&#39;t we don&#39;t want to be too</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:34.790" style="s2">grandiose about about our project but it</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.060" end="00:19:40.970" style="s2">has to be a grand project so I have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.790" end="00:19:45.920" style="s2">thought yeah I make it reminds me pretty</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.970" end="00:19:47.720" style="s2">much distinction by the the teachers at</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.920" end="00:19:49.910" style="s2">the Harvard Kennedy School called long</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.720" end="00:19:52.970" style="s2">high fights and these things things</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.910" end="00:19:55.340" style="s2">between technical problems and adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.970" end="00:19:57.740" style="s2">problems or technical challenges and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.340" end="00:19:59.120" style="s2">adaptive challenges through precise</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.740" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">and he says that so much of leadership</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.120" end="00:20:03.860" style="s2">makes the mistake of treating adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:05.960" style="s2">challenges as technical problems but</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.860" end="00:20:08.870" style="s2">most leadership errors stem from that</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.960" end="00:20:10.220" style="s2">mistake and I know this would not apply</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.870" end="00:20:12.170" style="s2">to Bonnie but it&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.220" end="00:20:15.320" style="s2">juxtaposition when you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.170" end="00:20:17.000" style="s2">moonshot it&#39;s true that that rallied a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.320" end="00:20:19.750" style="s2">lot of attention and imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.000" end="00:20:21.980" style="s2">excitement the earth became somehow</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.750" end="00:20:23.780" style="s2">object rather than subject because we</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.980" end="00:20:25.220" style="s2">can escape from it and then we can look</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.780" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">down on it and see how beautiful it was</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.220" end="00:20:30.050" style="s2">and that&#39;s a huge achievement so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:31.250" style="s2">not simply technical but it&#39;s also true</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.050" end="00:20:33.890" style="s2">that the problem of how to get to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.250" end="00:20:38.090" style="s2">moon is technical in nature where is the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.890" end="00:20:40.760" style="s2">problem of how do you design governance</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.090" end="00:20:43.420" style="s2">structures and viable economies for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.760" end="00:20:45.290" style="s2">roughly eight billion people on</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.420" end="00:20:47.780" style="s2">ecologically compromised and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.290" end="00:20:49.340" style="s2">technologically imperious world that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.780" end="00:20:52.190" style="s2">not a technical problem that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.340" end="00:20:54.290" style="s2">adaptive challenge at scale and so while</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.190" end="00:20:55.910" style="s2">we do need a new moonshot in spirit</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.290" end="00:20:58.280" style="s2">there will have to be a very different</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.910" end="00:21:00.050" style="s2">kind of endeavor it&#39;s an endeavor in</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.280" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">which were thoroughly implicated not as</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.050" end="00:21:07.130" style="s2">bystanders but as participants so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:09.020" style="s2">you could speak to that Bonnie yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.130" end="00:21:10.760" style="s2">principles and what act what should we</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.020" end="00:21:13.670" style="s2">do again as you say you wanted this to</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.760" end="00:21:15.440" style="s2">be very yeah so people are always</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.670" end="00:21:18.559" style="s2">there&#39;s have been a lot of talk a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.440" end="00:21:20.960" style="s2">podcasts yeah what sound the actions be</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.559" end="00:21:22.820" style="s2">sorry yeah no I think that that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.960" end="00:21:25.250" style="s2">beautiful so I completely agree with</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.820" end="00:21:28.970" style="s2">what Jonathan said and I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.250" end="00:21:31.940" style="s2">learning and really rich perspectives on</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.870" end="00:21:44.570" style="s2">working now is very fractionalized right</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.870" end="00:21:46.670" style="s2">so this group this group of the voting</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.570" end="00:21:48.380" style="s2">population what&#39;s free education this</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.670" end="00:21:50.630" style="s2">group wants this this group so in fact</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.380" end="00:21:53.420" style="s2">this group wants that and so it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.630" end="00:21:56.920" style="s2">there&#39;s no one that holds a vision</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.420" end="00:22:00.460" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no so the moonshot</p>

<p begin="00:22:09.740" end="00:22:16.990" style="s2">was starting up not really didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.950" end="00:22:21.289" style="s2">have a challenge it created this</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.990" end="00:22:24.049" style="s2">rearranged the Geo social world big time</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.289" end="00:22:26.809" style="s2">it created the opportunity for GPS all</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.049" end="00:22:28.820" style="s2">these things it also created a great</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.809" end="00:22:31.909" style="s2">opportunity for women at the time which</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.820" end="00:22:35.450" style="s2">is underreported so it&#39;s like one-stop</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.909" end="00:22:40.510" style="s2">shopping what is a moonshot that</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.450" end="00:22:44.059" style="s2">naturally aggregates or creates holistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.510" end="00:22:46.340" style="s2">interdependencies so you get more you</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.059" end="00:22:49.909" style="s2">know more bang for your buck so it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.340" end="00:22:52.399" style="s2">me that was like so what are the what</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.909" end="00:22:54.799" style="s2">are the I think I started with 12 some</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.399" end="00:22:57.289" style="s2">of them were unfolded and others what</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.799" end="00:22:59.330" style="s2">are the what could be something like</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.289" end="00:23:04.309" style="s2">that and so that&#39;s how we come with the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.330" end="00:23:07.460" style="s2">SIP so for example if you and I try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.309" end="00:23:10.429" style="s2">take things that were doable and</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.460" end="00:23:15.370" style="s2">emerging already so the notion of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.429" end="00:23:17.840" style="s2">citizen&#39;s currency is very very much</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.370" end="00:23:20.659" style="s2">embedded in a lot of work that people</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.840" end="00:23:23.960" style="s2">are doing with digital currency but also</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.659" end="00:23:26.929" style="s2">with PayPal I mean when PayPal came</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.960" end="00:23:29.149" style="s2">online it was extraordinary because up</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.929" end="00:23:30.799" style="s2">until then the sec the Security and</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.149" end="00:23:34.220" style="s2">Exchange Committee would have shut them</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.799" end="00:23:38.169" style="s2">down without a doubt because you</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.220" end="00:23:42.370" style="s2">couldn&#39;t build your own kind of currency</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.169" end="00:23:46.100" style="s2">thing he wasn&#39;t a bank per se these</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.370" end="00:23:50.570" style="s2">imaginaries these these these you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.100" end="00:23:53.390" style="s2">expansion of our economic imagination</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.570" end="00:23:56.330" style="s2">there&#39;s lots in the system already but</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.390" end="00:23:58.039" style="s2">as I said earlier it&#39;s like what is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.330" end="00:24:01.510" style="s2">easiest one what is the low-hanging</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.039" end="00:24:03.770" style="s2">fruit that we could just do today now</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.510" end="00:24:06.649" style="s2">coronavirus has given us an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.770" end="00:24:09.230" style="s2">to remind people that they&#39;re interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.649" end="00:24:12.799" style="s2">now in their food chain and it&#39;d be easy</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.230" end="00:24:16.730" style="s2">in fact some of us have been researching</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.799" end="00:24:19.610" style="s2">apps this really cool apps to find you</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.730" end="00:24:23.389" style="s2">know to watch your food chain and have</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.610" end="00:24:28.579" style="s2">that currency the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.389" end="00:24:32.329" style="s2">off the value-added investment interest</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.579" end="00:24:33.679" style="s2">currency and that would be ubi would be</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.329" end="00:24:36.289" style="s2">a better type a ubi</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.679" end="00:24:39.589" style="s2">because it would not be subject to the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.289" end="00:24:42.169" style="s2">extractive financial instruments in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.589" end="00:24:44.869" style="s2">main economy so can we just move the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.169" end="00:24:47.929" style="s2">needle there now all of a sudden what</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.869" end="00:24:50.989" style="s2">happens a lot happens if you could get</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.929" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">your let&#39;s say health care and food from</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.989" end="00:24:56.450" style="s2">this currency and let&#39;s say you keep</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:59.869" style="s2">rent in housing and mortgages on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.450" end="00:25:02.359" style="s2">other currency and then your and then</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.869" end="00:25:04.249" style="s2">your landlord tells you to you know you</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.359" end="00:25:07.009" style="s2">can&#39;t pay your rent your landlord says</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.249" end="00:25:09.019" style="s2">get out or don&#39;t pay your rent get out</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.009" end="00:25:11.479" style="s2">will you said well I&#39;ll get out like</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.019" end="00:25:14.109" style="s2">you&#39;re so much more fluid now so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.479" end="00:25:16.429" style="s2">rental charge to all the all the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.109" end="00:25:19.719" style="s2">pressure will now be on renters they</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.429" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">would be competing with themselves and</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.719" end="00:25:24.259" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of young people who like</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.950" end="00:25:25.549" style="s2">to go back into rural areas and build</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.259" end="00:25:27.739" style="s2">farms but they can&#39;t because you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.549" end="00:25:30.859" style="s2">starve to death basically it takes like</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.739" end="00:25:34.190" style="s2">ten years but if you had your health</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.859" end="00:25:39.429" style="s2">care and your food paid for then you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:43.849" style="s2">get rural revitalization if you add this</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.429" end="00:25:46.099" style="s2">local currency for health care you could</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.849" end="00:25:51.589" style="s2">get a lot of more health care services</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.099" end="00:25:52.999" style="s2">like like they do in I think Amsterdam</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.589" end="00:25:58.999" style="s2">there&#39;s something that&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.999" end="00:26:02.779" style="s2">Morningstar but where you have local</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.999" end="00:26:05.649" style="s2">knowledge for certain kind of health</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.779" end="00:26:09.469" style="s2">care outside of the insurance system</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.649" end="00:26:10.719" style="s2">like you know chiropractic started that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.469" end="00:26:14.179" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.719" end="00:26:19.849" style="s2">homeopathic started that way I when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.179" end="00:26:23.989" style="s2">got it so so just to show you how how</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.849" end="00:26:26.299" style="s2">big a deal this is when I left my job</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.989" end="00:26:29.359" style="s2">and lost my health care I got a very bad</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.299" end="00:26:31.339" style="s2">injury in my arm I needed like 120</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.359" end="00:26:36.109" style="s2">internal stitches and 80 external</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.339" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">stitches antibiotics and an x-ray but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.109" end="00:26:40.050" style="s2">didn&#39;t have health and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:42.270" style="s2">I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t get a surgeon I got a</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.050" end="00:26:45.900" style="s2">medical technician who done two tours in</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.270" end="00:26:49.650" style="s2">Iraq he did a beautiful job and it cost</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.900" end="00:26:53.240" style="s2">me $1,900 that&#39;s it that&#39;s the true cost</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.650" end="00:26:57.540" style="s2">of health care a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.240" end="00:27:01.230" style="s2">artisan vocational knowledge and X</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.540" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">amount of hours in us you know in a room</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.230" end="00:27:06.300" style="s2">in an office so but this won&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:09.240" style="s2">can&#39;t happen when it&#39;s run on the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.300" end="00:27:10.890" style="s2">extractive system because you get you</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.240" end="00:27:12.540" style="s2">know you get the taxes you get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.890" end="00:27:14.790" style="s2">interest you get the loans you get the</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.540" end="00:27:17.040" style="s2">insurance companies all of this inflates</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.790" end="00:27:19.170" style="s2">the cost of health insurance so our</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.040" end="00:27:22.050" style="s2">government for example in the u.s. we</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.170" end="00:27:23.790" style="s2">want universal health care but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.050" end="00:27:25.200" style="s2">going to pay the health care workers</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.790" end="00:27:27.360" style="s2">we&#39;re going to pay the insurance so your</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.200" end="00:27:31.140" style="s2">versal health care under the existing</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.360" end="00:27:34.680" style="s2">system means universal raping of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.140" end="00:27:39.030" style="s2">labor into insurance profits so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.680" end="00:27:41.850" style="s2">just one move can start to peel away it</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.030" end="00:27:45.210" style="s2">really incentivizes just natural human</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.850" end="00:27:48.270" style="s2">activity in the way we want so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.210" end="00:27:52.910" style="s2">why it&#39;s not just all of these I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.270" end="00:27:55.920" style="s2">are multiple have multiple leverages</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.910" end="00:27:59.880" style="s2">leverage points and support each other</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.920" end="00:28:02.280" style="s2">so maybe if we could just do the other</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.880" end="00:28:06.390" style="s2">ones in a little bit yeah that&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.280" end="00:28:09.690" style="s2">um so so basically once people have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.390" end="00:28:12.540" style="s2">baseline of survival uh-huh without the</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.690" end="00:28:16.530" style="s2">fear of you know being hungry and if we</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.540" end="00:28:19.140" style="s2">diversified the if we diversified money</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.530" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">so that our value or into something</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.140" end="00:28:24.990" style="s2">called the citizens currency then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:26.310" style="s2">you were suggesting that the both both</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.990" end="00:28:28.290" style="s2">systems like we would have different</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.310" end="00:28:30.060" style="s2">systems of money different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.290" end="00:28:32.580" style="s2">currencies of systems and that would</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.060" end="00:28:34.440" style="s2">that would this diversification would</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.580" end="00:28:36.270" style="s2">allow us to be more natural in our and</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.440" end="00:28:38.580" style="s2">our activities</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.270" end="00:28:41.190" style="s2">I think the diversification itself would</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.580" end="00:28:43.830" style="s2">enable us to take a look at the the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.190" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">extractive economy that we have the</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.830" end="00:28:47.880" style="s2">central banking economy yeah and so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:49.370" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t so that&#39;s also another</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.880" end="00:28:53.090" style="s2">advantage do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.370" end="00:28:54.710" style="s2">and now you can see do we need this and</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.090" end="00:28:58.300" style="s2">maybe there are advantages you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.710" end="00:29:00.980" style="s2">gifts so it&#39;s like it&#39;s different then</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.300" end="00:29:02.900" style="s2">becoming more and more complex in trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.980" end="00:29:06.110" style="s2">to see how I&#39;m gonna solve everything at</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.900" end="00:29:08.510" style="s2">once it&#39;s like this is doable it&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.110" end="00:29:11.450" style="s2">in front of our face I even talked about</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.510" end="00:29:13.760" style="s2">like people having reports quarterly</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.450" end="00:29:17.150" style="s2">reports of where the money&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.760" end="00:29:18.830" style="s2">farmers needed it here we these farmers</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.150" end="00:29:23.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t need it you know you could start</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.830" end="00:29:28.940" style="s2">to see currency as this network effect</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.140" end="00:29:32.450" style="s2">mmm so I I see promise on that idea but</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.940" end="00:29:36.020" style="s2">I also see lots of potential qualms and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.450" end="00:29:37.730" style="s2">I&#39;m sure Bonnie herself you know where</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.020" end="00:29:39.160" style="s2">someone else to propose these ideas she</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.730" end="00:29:41.210" style="s2">would be quick to see that there are</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.160" end="00:29:46.070" style="s2">perspectives that need to be brought to</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.210" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">bear you know for example it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.070" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">happening in one country alone and if it</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:53.750" style="s2">is that creates certain even greater</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:58.490" style="s2">immigration pressures on that country</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.750" end="00:30:00.350" style="s2">it also will it will impact on you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.490" end="00:30:02.420" style="s2">is it okay for the central government to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.350" end="00:30:04.460" style="s2">allow it affect multiple money supplies</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.420" end="00:30:07.550" style="s2">what will that mean for things like</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.460" end="00:30:10.910" style="s2">inflation and interest rates on</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.550" end="00:30:13.790" style="s2">mortgages and so forth um I&#39;m not sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.910" end="00:30:16.520" style="s2">of bonafide the economists that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.790" end="00:30:18.020" style="s2">spent enough time reading economics</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.520" end="00:30:19.690" style="s2">books but I know that there are are</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.020" end="00:30:21.620" style="s2">economists who would be interested</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.690" end="00:30:22.370" style="s2">you&#39;re interesting to ask about these</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.620" end="00:30:25.309" style="s2">things this is quite an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.370" end="00:30:27.380" style="s2">conversation in the sense that it caught</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.309" end="00:30:30.170" style="s2">economics is too important to be left to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.380" end="00:30:31.790" style="s2">just the economists on the one hand but</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.170" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">it&#39;s also true that once you get an idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.790" end="00:30:38.030" style="s2">like here&#39;s an app for a new idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:39.410" style="s2">currency and we can tailor make it to</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.030" end="00:30:41.330" style="s2">parts and some parts of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.410" end="00:30:42.650" style="s2">which are essential and keep it out of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.330" end="00:30:44.510" style="s2">the parts of the economy which are about</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.650" end="00:30:46.640" style="s2">revenue extraction and</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.510" end="00:30:49.910" style="s2">interest and debt and all the rest of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">now I think maybe I&#39;m I&#39;m very open to</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.910" end="00:30:55.160" style="s2">it but I&#39;m also keen to stress that we</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.510" style="s2">don&#39;t really know so this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.160" end="00:30:58.160" style="s2">difference between bonny having an</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.510" end="00:31:00.050" style="s2">interesting idea and let&#39;s explore it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.160" end="00:31:01.040" style="s2">let&#39;s see what it looks like and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.050" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">very differently saying here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.040" end="00:31:04.930" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:06.340" style="s2">it&#39;s much more about saying here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.930" end="00:31:10.540" style="s2">different way of thinking about money</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.340" end="00:31:12.040" style="s2">and technology and human need and their</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.540" end="00:31:15.520" style="s2">magnificent</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.040" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">combination let&#39;s look into why we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.520" end="00:31:18.100" style="s2">do that and whether we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:20.350" style="s2">build it ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.100" end="00:31:21.490" style="s2">but equally while you&#39;re doing that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.350" end="00:31:23.140" style="s2">might find there some killer a</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.490" end="00:31:25.630" style="s2">counter-argument to say sorry you just</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.140" end="00:31:26.860" style="s2">can&#39;t do that I don&#39;t know what it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.630" end="00:31:29.400" style="s2">I&#39;m just saying we should be open to</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.860" end="00:31:34.690" style="s2">that no I agree and I think the call</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.400" end="00:31:37.690" style="s2">really the next step call is can we</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.690" end="00:31:41.380" style="s2">start communities of practices that are</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.690" end="00:31:44.740" style="s2">working aligned in in this one or</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.380" end="00:31:48.700" style="s2">something like this I don&#39;t and but so</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.740" end="00:31:50.410" style="s2">this is that so but I really like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.700" end="00:31:52.450" style="s2">fact that these questions are asked</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.410" end="00:31:54.340" style="s2">immediately so I call it a citizen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.450" end="00:31:57.550" style="s2">currency because when I work it out it</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.340" end="00:32:00.730" style="s2">the first step has to be bounded by the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.550" end="00:32:02.710" style="s2">nation-state it gets crazy so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.730" end="00:32:05.620" style="s2">worked that out so I call her citizens</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.710" end="00:32:07.180" style="s2">currency so it would be limited at first</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.620" end="00:32:13.900" style="s2">because then there would have to be some</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.180" end="00:32:16.300" style="s2">changes but the demand inside the nation</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.900" end="00:32:18.790" style="s2">would would cause smart changes so</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.300" end="00:32:22.270" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s clear and then there would</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.790" end="00:32:27.550" style="s2">have to be certain subsidies and trade</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.270" end="00:32:30.370" style="s2">agreements that that enable the</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.550" end="00:32:32.140" style="s2">countries that want to try this to do</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.370" end="00:32:33.610" style="s2">this without disrupting everything so</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.140" end="00:32:36.550" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s called a citizen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.610" end="00:32:41.340" style="s2">currency and for those people working on</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.550" end="00:32:41.340" style="s2">blockchain etc it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.610" end="00:32:46.420" style="s2">suggestion that they work at that scale</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.440" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">and not at the scale be internet for</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.420" end="00:32:50.290" style="s2">example which most people are working so</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:54.030" style="s2">this is an interesting thing it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.290" end="00:32:57.570" style="s2">disruptive also in terms of immigration</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.030" end="00:33:05.100" style="s2">I&#39;ve been thinking about it as a natural</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.570" end="00:33:09.220" style="s2">instrument to preserve and improve the</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.100" end="00:33:10.660" style="s2">immigration flows of farmworkers so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.220" end="00:33:14.580" style="s2">doesn&#39;t solve all of immigration</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.660" end="00:33:14.580" style="s2">obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.610" end="00:33:19.710" style="s2">these are ways in which you can take one</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.830" end="00:33:22.320" style="s2">simple idea and start to weave in some</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.710" end="00:33:26.309" style="s2">things like you just discussed that are</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.320" end="00:33:28.350" style="s2">important but I do see it as bounded</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.309" end="00:33:32.700" style="s2">unless somebody can think outside the</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.350" end="00:33:35.279" style="s2">box I just see that it would require but</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.700" end="00:33:39.299" style="s2">then there&#39;s that that there there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.279" end="00:33:42.299" style="s2">interest in having a little more kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.299" end="00:33:45.390" style="s2">kind of stepping back to a little more</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.299" end="00:33:47.880" style="s2">sense of nationhood already so some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.390" end="00:33:51.840" style="s2">these things might be it might be timely</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.880" end="00:33:54.570" style="s2">right I mean for my part I don&#39;t doubt</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.840" end="00:33:58.559" style="s2">that some version of a citizen&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.570" end="00:34:00.389" style="s2">currency and the citizen you know could</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.559" end="00:34:02.070" style="s2">be citizens of the world potentially but</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.389" end="00:34:05.669" style="s2">I can see why there would be good design</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.070" end="00:34:08.010" style="s2">reasons for beginning more locally and I</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.669" end="00:34:10.889" style="s2">also can hear people who are outraged</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.010" end="00:34:12.690" style="s2">because somehow for them it&#39;s almost a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.889" end="00:34:15.389" style="s2">sacred notion that one works for one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.690" end="00:34:17.310" style="s2">own key and then I can see the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.389" end="00:34:18.810" style="s2">of that saying well that&#39;s all very well</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.310" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">in principle but we live in being</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.810" end="00:34:21.960" style="s2">thoroughly interconnected highly</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:23.909" style="s2">urbanised worlds where it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.960" end="00:34:27.300" style="s2">that easy and often you starve if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.909" end="00:34:29.339" style="s2">try yeah so it&#39;s a it&#39;s a complex pitch</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.300" end="00:34:32.220" style="s2">right I suppose my question back to you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.339" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">is when we come up with an idea like</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.220" end="00:34:36.480" style="s2">this or a variation of it and</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:39.570" style="s2">simultaneously you have other ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.480" end="00:34:40.919" style="s2">you have in your list and we know there</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.570" end="00:34:42.869" style="s2">are plenty of other ideas out there</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.919" end="00:34:45.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a question of orientation like</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.869" end="00:34:46.950" style="s2">where do you start the thinking process</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.330" end="00:34:49.020" style="s2">and because one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.950" end="00:34:51.389" style="s2">been interesting about Col vid and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.020" end="00:34:53.490" style="s2">pandemic is some people have begun to</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.389" end="00:34:56.940" style="s2">realize okay where do we start so I</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.490" end="00:34:59.240" style="s2">noticed for example the in in ethical</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.940" end="00:35:01.710" style="s2">Theory there are sort of main schools of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.240" end="00:35:03.210" style="s2">with a canteen or the ontological view</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.710" end="00:35:05.130" style="s2">that certain things are better than</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.210" end="00:35:08.730" style="s2">enough themselves so saving life is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.130" end="00:35:10.140" style="s2">kind of preeminent necessity but then</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.730" end="00:35:12.540" style="s2">you have a more consequential view which</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.140" end="00:35:14.070" style="s2">is something like well and we can&#39;t save</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.540" end="00:35:15.660" style="s2">all the lines and and if we do try and</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.070" end="00:35:17.460" style="s2">save all the lines then we&#39;ll damages a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.660" end="00:35:18.810" style="s2">lot of things and so we&#39;ve let&#39;s through</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.460" end="00:35:20.490" style="s2">the trade-offs and that&#39;s another way of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.810" end="00:35:22.410" style="s2">thinking then you have something like</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.490" end="00:35:24.230" style="s2">virtue theory which is more about one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.410" end="00:35:26.280" style="s2">the inherent qualities of human</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.230" end="00:35:29.869" style="s2">character that we need to cultivate at</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.280" end="00:35:33.619" style="s2">this moment here and kind</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.869" end="00:35:34.940" style="s2">reciprocity and things like this now</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.619" end="00:35:36.799" style="s2">those things are all swirling around and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.940" end="00:35:39.109" style="s2">I noticed in my own reaction that my</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.799" end="00:35:41.930" style="s2">inner cancion became sort of heightened</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.109" end="00:35:43.609" style="s2">when the pandemic broke I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.930" end="00:35:46.460" style="s2">first save all the lights so that was my</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.609" end="00:35:48.680" style="s2">very strong primal instinct like just</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.460" end="00:35:52.700" style="s2">keep people inside figure out what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.680" end="00:35:54.470" style="s2">going on and let&#39;s see like but let&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.700" end="00:35:56.780" style="s2">least now that we understand you know</p>

<p begin="00:35:56.780" end="00:36:00.530" style="s2">look like you can see that this could</p>

<p begin="00:36:00.530" end="00:36:05.809" style="s2">bit counts and therefore begin I took my</p>

<p begin="00:36:05.809" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">government advice because I sense this</p>

<p begin="00:36:12.740" end="00:36:17.000" style="s2">because in their more broader sense when</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.349" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">you&#39;re thinking of redesigning society</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.000" end="00:36:22.369" style="s2">or the economy and a potentially global</p>

<p begin="00:36:22.369" end="00:36:26.270" style="s2">because as you said Andrea and as</p>

<p begin="00:36:52.150" end="00:36:57.200" style="s2">about health broadly conceived I know</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.329" end="00:36:59.930" style="s2">there are people who are thinking about</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.930" end="00:37:04.190" style="s2">there&#39;s also the question of education</p>

<p begin="00:37:04.190" end="00:37:08.630" style="s2">compelling peace there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.099" end="00:37:09.980" style="s2">educationally at the moment you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.630" end="00:37:12.920" style="s2">it&#39;s not just that kids are not in</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.980" end="00:37:15.589" style="s2">school I know as a parent I&#39;m having to</p>

<p begin="00:37:19.880" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">and that&#39;s not easy it&#39;s a steep</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.829" end="00:37:25.670" style="s2">learning curve for all of us and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:28.339" style="s2">there&#39;s a bigger question of you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.670" end="00:37:30.799" style="s2">learning as a as a species wide</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.339" end="00:37:33.020" style="s2">challenge to make sense of civilization</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.799" end="00:37:35.829" style="s2">and its purposes and for that you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.020" end="00:37:38.930" style="s2">to think well if it&#39;s not indefinite</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.829" end="00:37:40.460" style="s2">indefinite economic growth if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.930" end="00:37:41.800" style="s2">just trying to get richer and assuming</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.460" end="00:37:45.160" style="s2">it will somehow trickle</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.800" end="00:37:46.930" style="s2">what are we doing and that&#39;s where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.160" end="00:37:48.910" style="s2">curious to ask Bonnie about the list</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.930" end="00:37:50.550" style="s2">because it&#39;s like okay I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.910" end="00:37:53.260" style="s2">these are all interesting things to do</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.550" end="00:37:55.360" style="s2">what is their underlying dynamic what</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.260" end="00:38:00.340" style="s2">are they are they are they aimed of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.360" end="00:38:01.750" style="s2">increase of love or well-being or what</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.340" end="00:38:04.540" style="s2">is it you know what you know how do you</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.750" end="00:38:06.310" style="s2">orient yourself in that regard yes so a</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.540" end="00:38:08.230" style="s2">couple of comments I hope I remember</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.310" end="00:38:11.040" style="s2">them all excellent questions so the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.230" end="00:38:13.690" style="s2">first one is yes save all the lives</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.040" end="00:38:16.630" style="s2">what&#39;s the trade-off that we&#39;re faced</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.690" end="00:38:19.480" style="s2">with those say save all the lives or</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.630" end="00:38:21.880" style="s2">ruin the economy I mean does does that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.480" end="00:38:24.310" style="s2">something I aspirational how about save</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.880" end="00:38:27.120" style="s2">all the lives or build the world we want</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.310" end="00:38:30.820" style="s2">to see ah now becomes very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.120" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">now there&#39;s you know you move from</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.820" end="00:38:39.880" style="s2">content to some posing like carica</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:44.140" style="s2">Guardian yeah yeah so so the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.880" end="00:38:45.640" style="s2">saving lives then becomes at once maybe</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.140" end="00:38:50.290" style="s2">more transcendent don&#39;t put more</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.640" end="00:38:53.290" style="s2">primitive right you know people will</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.290" end="00:38:55.540" style="s2">yeah so so but that we don&#39;t have that</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.290" end="00:39:01.780" style="s2">right we don&#39;t have that save the lives</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.540" end="00:39:04.680" style="s2">or you know save the economy and but we</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.780" end="00:39:10.600" style="s2">do have it&#39;s a live save the economy or</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.680" end="00:39:12.610" style="s2">take the saving of the lives response to</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.600" end="00:39:15.310" style="s2">look at something new this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.610" end="00:39:18.520" style="s2">the third wave that&#39;s been coming out in</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.310" end="00:39:21.900" style="s2">this thing you know I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.520" end="00:39:25.240" style="s2">not what people really wanted to do so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.900" end="00:39:28.630" style="s2">so that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.240" end="00:39:32.650" style="s2">thing is that you asked about healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.630" end="00:39:35.050" style="s2">and this is why you know the the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.650" end="00:39:39.310" style="s2">interactive dynamics as the six are</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.050" end="00:39:41.470" style="s2">important because you what health care</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.310" end="00:39:44.920" style="s2">depends a lot of time education I think</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.470" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">we should teach you know we&#39;ll if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.920" end="00:39:49.300" style="s2">live on a farm and you have a vet that</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:51.130" style="s2">you like and you have a lot of animals</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.300" end="00:39:54.760" style="s2">you basically do a lot of health care</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.130" end="00:39:57.550" style="s2">yourself like a lot that you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.760" end="00:39:59.140" style="s2">it&#39;s not that hard but most people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.550" end="00:40:02.020" style="s2">know anything about their bodies or the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.140" end="00:40:03.790" style="s2">immune system or you can&#39;t even google</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.020" end="00:40:05.380" style="s2">and understand anything they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.790" end="00:40:09.070" style="s2">how to take care of themselves and I eat</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.380" end="00:40:12.700" style="s2">all of this inflates you know this big</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.070" end="00:40:14.140" style="s2">systemic need for this big behemoth type</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.700" end="00:40:15.970" style="s2">of health care this is true in all</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.140" end="00:40:19.300" style="s2">Western cultures it&#39;s beginning to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.970" end="00:40:22.450" style="s2">more true in the Eastern cultures so if</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.300" end="00:40:25.480" style="s2">you have more education around health</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.450" end="00:40:30.280" style="s2">care then you could have more</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.480" end="00:40:31.810" style="s2">distributed nodes for carrying and so</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.280" end="00:40:34.660" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing and I&#39;ll get back to</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.810" end="00:40:37.480" style="s2">education but the connection piece</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.660" end="00:40:40.630" style="s2">really helps health care because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.480" end="00:40:43.390" style="s2">problem is we&#39;re not connected to how we</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.630" end="00:40:45.130" style="s2">are human how our health is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.390" end="00:40:48.640" style="s2">living world we&#39;re not we don&#39;t we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.130" end="00:40:50.950" style="s2">not connected to with you know how we do</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.640" end="00:40:53.590" style="s2">our forestry is part of our healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.950" end="00:40:56.410" style="s2">system you know how we what the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.590" end="00:40:57.640" style="s2">decisions we make on land use is part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.410" end="00:41:00.330" style="s2">our healthcare system</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.640" end="00:41:03.880" style="s2">decisions we make in animal husbandry</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.330" end="00:41:06.190" style="s2">which is why we have swine flu avian flu</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.880" end="00:41:10.180" style="s2">and coronavirus is part of our health</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.190" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">insurance healthcare so we need to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.180" end="00:41:16.420" style="s2">cultivate this sense of origin Airy</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:17.860" style="s2">connection that itself solves a lot you</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.420" end="00:41:20.500" style="s2">know we&#39;re not even connected to our</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.860" end="00:41:24.250" style="s2">bodies you know like the comorbidities</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.500" end="00:41:28.030" style="s2">around diabetes and and and covered 19</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.250" end="00:41:32.590" style="s2">are huge right so and diabetes is much</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.030" end="00:41:35.230" style="s2">more is a much larger and more dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.590" end="00:41:38.200" style="s2">pandemic because the young kids I mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.230" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">it&#39;s just infecting all the global for</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.200" end="00:41:46.480" style="s2">long term so so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so that</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:48.580" style="s2">so the connection piece works with the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.480" end="00:41:50.920" style="s2">educate health care education with</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.580" end="00:41:54.870" style="s2">health care but you also said you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.920" end="00:41:58.390" style="s2">I&#39;m not into giving people young people</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.870" end="00:42:01.060" style="s2">basic income and free free college and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.390" end="00:42:03.100" style="s2">so part of the education piece which I</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.060" end="00:42:04.640" style="s2">know is a very big piece because you and</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.100" end="00:42:09.650" style="s2">I are working on it</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.640" end="00:42:13.220" style="s2">is to have work-study college credits so</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.650" end="00:42:14.840" style="s2">that just like you know the GI Bill and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.220" end="00:42:17.140" style="s2">you and those credits would come from</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.840" end="00:42:20.150" style="s2">working in education healthcare</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.140" end="00:42:22.190" style="s2">environment things like hospice and farm</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.150" end="00:42:24.560" style="s2">and food so they have this like perfect</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.190" end="00:42:27.020" style="s2">circle and so then when people go to</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.560" end="00:42:30.620" style="s2">college and it this is proven to be true</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.020" end="00:42:33.950" style="s2">they&#39;re more respectful they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.620" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">informed of what what college means or</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.950" end="00:42:38.900" style="s2">what college can be and so I would I</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:40.850" style="s2">would stop says here go</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.900" end="00:42:42.890" style="s2">I&#39;ll never run for office in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.850" end="00:42:47.570" style="s2">country I would stop subsidizing all</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.890" end="00:42:49.790" style="s2">higher education and and use use that</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.570" end="00:42:50.600" style="s2">subsidy and let people who have the</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.790" end="00:42:53.450" style="s2">money go</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.600" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">because basically let them go and try to</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.450" end="00:42:57.890" style="s2">preserve the world that makes them rich</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:59.630" style="s2">that&#39;s what education does it teaches</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.890" end="00:43:03.580" style="s2">you how to preserve the world for rich</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.630" end="00:43:07.790" style="s2">people I would use that money instead to</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.580" end="00:43:11.840" style="s2">to design these work these I think it</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.790" end="00:43:14.660" style="s2">starts in my my my project it starts</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.840" end="00:43:17.810" style="s2">from 16 to 18 years old you start to</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.660" end="00:43:22.900" style="s2">have a vocational support for working in</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.810" end="00:43:26.120" style="s2">the society and then you can get work</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.900" end="00:43:28.430" style="s2">credits for going to higher education</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.120" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">whatever that may look like at that time</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.430" end="00:43:34.010" style="s2">so a lot of this stuff is like if if we</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:37.460" style="s2">had enough conversations you could see</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.010" end="00:43:40.010" style="s2">they&#39;re all deeply embedded in each</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.460" end="00:43:41.930" style="s2">other I&#39;m absolutely sure that having</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.010" end="00:43:43.700" style="s2">not just having read it but know your</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.930" end="00:43:46.730" style="s2">other work you know just knowing of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.700" end="00:43:49.130" style="s2">kinds of countries I guess I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.730" end="00:43:50.750" style="s2">curious about when I got my original</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.130" end="00:43:55.130" style="s2">question why this list not known</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.750" end="00:43:56.990" style="s2">otherwise you know there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.130" end="00:43:59.090" style="s2">books out there with it with in effect</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.990" end="00:44:03.200" style="s2">10-point plans for how civilization</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.090" end="00:44:04.520" style="s2">renews itself and many of them are a</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.200" end="00:44:06.950" style="s2">little bit open-ended but they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.520" end="00:44:11.000" style="s2">like that and in all cases that have two</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.950" end="00:44:13.280" style="s2">main qualms one is there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.000" end="00:44:15.530" style="s2">about the planning nature of it that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.280" end="00:44:17.930" style="s2">troubles me is that it&#39;s insufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.530" end="00:44:18.619" style="s2">receptive the what might come being</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.930" end="00:44:21.589" style="s2">sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.619" end="00:44:23.749" style="s2">curious about almost you know that joke</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.589" end="00:44:25.999" style="s2">about man</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.749" end="00:44:27.920" style="s2">man plans God laughs you know that sort</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.999" end="00:44:29.420" style="s2">of thing is it&#39;s as if like is if we</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.920" end="00:44:32.539" style="s2">could figure it out when there&#39;s so much</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.420" end="00:44:36.349" style="s2">that&#39;s beyond our control um but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.539" end="00:44:41.170" style="s2">also this issue of underlying underlying</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.349" end="00:44:43.910" style="s2">value a kind of that was a sort of meta</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.170" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">meta ethics in a way sort of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.910" end="00:44:49.490" style="s2">about what what are the real ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:51.529" style="s2">values that are driving the endeavor so</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.490" end="00:44:55.609" style="s2">I don&#39;t die that the six point she</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.529" end="00:44:56.980" style="s2">raised could spin us towards or what</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.609" end="00:45:01.369" style="s2">would the right metaphor be it would</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.980" end="00:45:03.529" style="s2">move us towards or some ball yeah tumble</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.369" end="00:45:05.829" style="s2">to Wars yeah something on that playfully</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.529" end="00:45:09.410" style="s2">fold on the hill towards whatever and</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.829" end="00:45:11.630" style="s2">basically I agree that could be the case</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.410" end="00:45:15.950" style="s2">but I&#39;m curious in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.630" end="00:45:18.259" style="s2">decisions do we or do we not need some</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.950" end="00:45:23.239" style="s2">kind of underlying commitment to certain</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.259" end="00:45:25.039" style="s2">core virtues or processes of</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.239" end="00:45:27.079" style="s2">understanding where its shoes or you</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.039" end="00:45:29.779" style="s2">know whatever that is is there not some</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.079" end="00:45:30.619" style="s2">one aspect or am I looking for something</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.779" end="00:45:34.609" style="s2">that just isn&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.619" end="00:45:37.519" style="s2">no no so can I say can I just make one</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.609" end="00:45:39.769" style="s2">thing when you&#39;re talking what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.519" end="00:45:42.259" style="s2">hearing Jonathan say maybe is that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.769" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">need a metaphysical system as well as</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.259" end="00:45:46.759" style="s2">just this idea of changing stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.799" style="s2">like a religion or something you know a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.759" end="00:45:51.819" style="s2">religion is a metaphysical system that</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.799" end="00:45:55.730" style="s2">sort of keeps the society together and</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.819" end="00:45:58.119" style="s2">is that fair just to quickly spin on</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.730" end="00:45:59.930" style="s2">that before when it comes in and yes</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.119" end="00:46:01.069" style="s2">metaphysics I nobody&#39;s written about</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.930" end="00:46:03.950" style="s2">that so it&#39;s an interesting chance for</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.069" end="00:46:05.900" style="s2">her to go into that it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.950" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">metaphysics though so it is something</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.900" end="00:46:12.859" style="s2">about ultimate commitments</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:14.630" style="s2">I suppose it&#39;s also about the the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.859" end="00:46:17.720" style="s2">rhetorical function of the plan</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.630" end="00:46:20.029" style="s2">something about making sense the people</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.720" end="00:46:23.480" style="s2">of why we should do X and not Y by</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.029" end="00:46:25.430" style="s2">appealing to Zed um so meaning right</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.480" end="00:46:25.759" style="s2">meaning what&#39;s the meaning of what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.430" end="00:46:27.859" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.759" end="00:46:29.839" style="s2">the point is you see meaning someone</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.859" end="00:46:32.570" style="s2">else&#39;s happiness someone else&#39;s justice</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.839" end="00:46:35.750" style="s2">someone else&#39;s diversity some</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.570" end="00:46:37.100" style="s2">Elsie&#39;s hell I don&#39;t want to know of how</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.750" end="00:46:38.930" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna deal with that or are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.100" end="00:46:40.850" style="s2">just gonna say everyone&#39;s welcome we can</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.930" end="00:46:44.150" style="s2">do together and bring all your values</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.850" end="00:46:46.040" style="s2">with you like hi reet so how do we solve</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.150" end="00:46:51.530" style="s2">that conundrum in a busy Taoist way</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.040" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">maybe yes the thing is designed to solve</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.530" end="00:46:57.650" style="s2">itself so I just step back know and</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:47:01.100" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a joke okay so here are</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.650" end="00:47:03.530" style="s2">different ways to look at it one is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.100" end="00:47:05.890" style="s2">informed by a lot of key features of my</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.530" end="00:47:08.330" style="s2">work right release complexity</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.890" end="00:47:10.700" style="s2">self-organization it&#39;s it&#39;s designed so</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.330" end="00:47:12.650" style="s2">if people buy in then you really have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.700" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">lot of experiments going on it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.650" end="00:47:16.820" style="s2">top-down thing this notion of releasing</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:19.190" style="s2">complexity this notion of the different</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.820" end="00:47:21.230" style="s2">type of meta move it is and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.190" end="00:47:23.690" style="s2">that it like literally almost killed me</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.230" end="00:47:26.120" style="s2">to write it like what do you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.690" end="00:47:30.440" style="s2">but so maybe it&#39;s only authentic though</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.120" end="00:47:33.680" style="s2">one person that but all these things</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.440" end="00:47:36.230" style="s2">depend upon timing you know like is</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.680" end="00:47:38.660" style="s2">there sufficient that is this speaking</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.230" end="00:47:41.120" style="s2">to other people what they can&#39;t get out</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.660" end="00:47:42.770" style="s2">of themselves you know and I had a</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.120" end="00:47:44.810" style="s2">community call the other day and people</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.770" end="00:47:47.270" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of people close to</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.810" end="00:47:49.130" style="s2">saying certain similar things but they</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.270" end="00:47:51.230" style="s2">don&#39;t say it in public because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.130" end="00:47:53.930" style="s2">like retro Romanticism you ask that</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.230" end="00:47:56.300" style="s2">question it has all these maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.930" end="00:47:58.580" style="s2">not I get away with it because I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.300" end="00:48:00.260" style="s2">like writing complex metaphysics so</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.580" end="00:48:01.850" style="s2">people think well she must be smart</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.260" end="00:48:03.590" style="s2">I mean basically that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.850" end="00:48:05.210" style="s2">reasons why people like Zack and I get</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.590" end="00:48:08.690" style="s2">away first with saying these things</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.210" end="00:48:12.500" style="s2">because we had to prove that yes all of</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.690" end="00:48:15.080" style="s2">that and yet there&#39;s something else</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.500" end="00:48:16.820" style="s2">right so that&#39;s part of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.080" end="00:48:18.890" style="s2">question is like Wilbur I mean Wilbur&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.820" end="00:48:21.500" style="s2">work was great but it was also timely</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.890" end="00:48:24.500" style="s2">he didn&#39;t say so anything that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.500" end="00:48:28.400" style="s2">said in little places elsewhere yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.500" end="00:48:30.680" style="s2">he represents through the same process</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.400" end="00:48:32.810" style="s2">and I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know if this</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.680" end="00:48:35.090" style="s2">is gonna be a big deal or not but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.810" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">one of those things for me that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.090" end="00:48:42.310" style="s2">thing but the other thing you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:45.530" style="s2">about is yes because you&#39;re so astute</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.310" end="00:48:48.350" style="s2">there are underneath it</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.530" end="00:48:51.680" style="s2">you could say what are the as I said in</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.350" end="00:48:53.540" style="s2">my spirituality we need one of the</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.680" end="00:48:55.550" style="s2">ontological epistemological and</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.540" end="00:48:58.430" style="s2">metaphysical and Axia logical</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.550" end="00:49:00.680" style="s2">commitments that we need today and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.430" end="00:49:02.990" style="s2">think you can see from that short video</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.680" end="00:49:05.900" style="s2">I did that that is what underlies this</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.990" end="00:49:07.910" style="s2">but of course that&#39;s all I can say so</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.900" end="00:49:11.390" style="s2">that&#39;s why I know there&#39;s also this</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.910" end="00:49:15.410" style="s2">deeper holism it&#39;s me trying to come to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.390" end="00:49:17.480" style="s2">terms with Who am I at this time in</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.410" end="00:49:20.810" style="s2">history as a person given all the work</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.480" end="00:49:22.670" style="s2">I&#39;ve done and can that be helpful this</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.810" end="00:49:26.680" style="s2">is interesting to me like it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.670" end="00:49:30.410" style="s2">rather than a bunch of commandments like</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.680" end="00:49:32.450" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about commitments</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.410" end="00:49:37.280" style="s2">that we should make that are based in</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.450" end="00:49:39.560" style="s2">this moment of time is that is that my</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.280" end="00:49:41.180" style="s2">understanding you which might which is</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.560" end="00:49:43.040" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing than saying we</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.180" end="00:49:46.460" style="s2">should always you know thou shalt not</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.040" end="00:49:50.450" style="s2">kill or you know it&#39;s it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.460" end="00:49:52.460" style="s2">okay it right now we&#39;re not gonna build</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.450" end="00:49:55.100" style="s2">a thing to go to the moon right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.460" end="00:49:56.780" style="s2">inappropriate in this time maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.100" end="00:49:59.470" style="s2">whole discussion about going to Mars</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.780" end="00:50:02.480" style="s2">feels to me kind of inappropriate when</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.470" end="00:50:06.620" style="s2">wildfires are burning in you know in</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.480" end="00:50:10.040" style="s2">Australia so so yeah so what are what</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.620" end="00:50:11.810" style="s2">are those what do you think I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.040" end="00:50:14.960" style="s2">first thing is to realize you have them</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.810" end="00:50:16.340" style="s2">and then you say wow these good these</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.960" end="00:50:18.020" style="s2">actually a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.340" end="00:50:20.360" style="s2">commitments that are not in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.020" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">direction of the values they espouse and</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.360" end="00:50:26.930" style="s2">that&#39;s why they never get anything done</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:28.930" style="s2">so I have watched the video Bonita</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.930" end="00:50:31.400" style="s2">alluded to have also seen the text</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.930" end="00:50:34.100" style="s2">because I edited well very lightly and</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.400" end="00:50:36.890" style="s2">it&#39;s great other words which will go</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.100" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">online shortly actually but what she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.890" end="00:50:42.280" style="s2">alluding to is a series by Bruce</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:44.890" style="s2">alderman about the spirituality of</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.280" end="00:50:46.760" style="s2">tomorrow or or the one we need today or</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.890" end="00:50:50.060" style="s2">respectively the same thing in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.760" end="00:50:52.610" style="s2">and and it was a particularly cogent</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.060" end="00:50:55.430" style="s2">piece where Bonnie does kind of lay out</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.610" end="00:50:58.610" style="s2">her metaphysics of choice and they</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.430" end="00:50:59.330" style="s2">include commitments to axiology which is</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.610" end="00:51:01.330" style="s2">roughly the</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.330" end="00:51:04.190" style="s2">structure of value or underlying</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.330" end="00:51:06.770" style="s2">premises of value and goodness and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.190" end="00:51:07.880" style="s2">forth and mr. Balaji which is about how</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.770" end="00:51:10.310" style="s2">do we know and how should we know</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.880" end="00:51:12.590" style="s2">ontology roughly what is real what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.310" end="00:51:18.500" style="s2">the world made of and what do we know to</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.590" end="00:51:21.290" style="s2">be real what is there and then also your</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.500" end="00:51:23.180" style="s2">fourth process metaphysics which is in</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.290" end="00:51:26.750" style="s2">some ways what I wanted to get to yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.180" end="00:51:28.580" style="s2">so think about a process metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.750" end="00:51:32.090" style="s2">that&#39;s very relevant in regard to my</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.580" end="00:51:34.670" style="s2">aunt my question is that it&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.090" end="00:51:35.980" style="s2">somewhat content and provisional right</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.670" end="00:51:44.060" style="s2">it&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.980" end="00:51:47.180" style="s2">no Kantian right it&#39;s creative minute to</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.060" end="00:51:49.970" style="s2">process metaphysics then giving any</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.180" end="00:51:51.290" style="s2">given list is a way of saying this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.970" end="00:51:53.900" style="s2">where we are in the process at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.290" end="00:51:57.950" style="s2">moment right the list is a way of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.900" end="00:52:00.230" style="s2">process unfolding and speaking and you</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.950" end="00:52:02.690" style="s2">you know answer the question of why</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.230" end="00:52:05.300" style="s2">these points and that other is you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.690" end="00:52:07.400" style="s2">give more or less good cartographical</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.300" end="00:52:08.840" style="s2">references say well I actually touched</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.400" end="00:52:11.090" style="s2">all the four quadrants of Wilbur&#39;s math</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.840" end="00:52:13.160" style="s2">and this is a little bit a purse per</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.090" end="00:52:16.040" style="s2">table and captures theory and it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.160" end="00:52:17.990" style="s2">and that you can do that and your your</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.040" end="00:52:22.070" style="s2">list may look more or less credible as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.990" end="00:52:24.710" style="s2">result I suppose the thing I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.070" end="00:52:27.530" style="s2">get to is is that enough is that as much</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.710" end="00:52:30.140" style="s2">as we can do and if so let&#39;s just get on</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.530" end="00:52:33.460" style="s2">with it or is it more is it that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.140" end="00:52:35.570" style="s2">another way of doing this such that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.460" end="00:52:38.000" style="s2">bring together the best and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.570" end="00:52:40.280" style="s2">brightest as it were bringing all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.000" end="00:52:42.260" style="s2">lists happy everyone has their ten-point</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.280" end="00:52:44.510" style="s2">plan and there&#39;s a thousand of them and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.260" end="00:52:46.520" style="s2">then you Whittle that down to one</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.510" end="00:52:48.710" style="s2">ten-point plan at the end because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.520" end="00:52:51.050" style="s2">the one that survived that doesn&#39;t seem</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.710" end="00:52:53.150" style="s2">right that seems bogus right and and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.050" end="00:52:57.980" style="s2">I&#39;m wondering the reason it seems bogus</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.150" end="00:53:03.200" style="s2">is something about the nature of in your</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.980" end="00:53:06.070" style="s2">model knowing valuing being and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.200" end="00:53:08.900" style="s2">holds all of that is is radically</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.070" end="00:53:12.460" style="s2">respectable in other words it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.900" end="00:53:15.240" style="s2">depends upon the context and the person</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.460" end="00:53:18.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not true for everyone and always</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.240" end="00:53:19.810" style="s2">necessarily and therefore all you can do</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.160" end="00:53:20.260" style="s2">is say this is what I think we should do</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.810" end="00:53:21.700" style="s2">next</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.260" end="00:53:26.080" style="s2">given our best available knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.700" end="00:53:28.540" style="s2">judgment and if that&#39;s the case you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.080" end="00:53:31.839" style="s2">good luck but that&#39;s maybe that&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.540" end="00:53:37.000" style="s2">that&#39;s all there it is yeah and I also</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.839" end="00:53:43.859" style="s2">tried to highlight what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.000" end="00:53:43.859" style="s2">possible okay there&#39;s a lot going on</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.670" end="00:53:50.890" style="s2">it&#39;s always like playing a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.880" end="00:53:54.010" style="s2">extraordinarily rich chess game with</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.890" end="00:53:56.320" style="s2">Jonathan yeah cuz cuz every new move is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.010" end="00:53:57.700" style="s2">so many more possibilities you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.320" end="00:54:02.200" style="s2">although it doesn&#39;t have this</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.700" end="00:54:05.260" style="s2">competitive feel to it so good I could I</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.200" end="00:54:06.400" style="s2">may throw in one little thing when I say</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.260" end="00:54:10.810" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about process</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.400" end="00:54:14.260" style="s2">philosophy it seems to be a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.810" end="00:54:17.080" style="s2">creative process of unknowing and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.260" end="00:54:19.000" style="s2">wait and then the and then there is also</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.080" end="00:54:21.550" style="s2">maybe the need for metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.000" end="00:54:23.470" style="s2">certainty of some kinds on the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.550" end="00:54:25.240" style="s2">side right like you don&#39;t do any harm</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.470" end="00:54:28.330" style="s2">right that might be a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.240" end="00:54:30.670" style="s2">universal Kantian category so I&#39;m almost</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.330" end="00:54:32.349" style="s2">feeling like I&#39;m almost feeling these</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.670" end="00:54:35.770" style="s2">the two worlds let&#39;s say a Buddhistic</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.349" end="00:54:38.770" style="s2">world or eastern taoist world and Ana</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.770" end="00:54:41.890" style="s2">and Ana County and Christian world view</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.770" end="00:54:44.320" style="s2">being being sort of compared to each</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.890" end="00:54:46.000" style="s2">other yeah and I want to say to all my</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.320" end="00:54:48.640" style="s2">dallas friends I mean I call myself a</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.000" end="00:54:51.430" style="s2">Taoist but I&#39;ve obviously upgraded what</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.640" end="00:54:53.710" style="s2">that I think that means to me I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.430" end="00:54:56.910" style="s2">some doll is so very you know that</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.710" end="00:55:01.839" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of Dallas but a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.910" end="00:55:04.089" style="s2">commonalities so but but what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.839" end="00:55:06.790" style="s2">interesting I think any list would be</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.089" end="00:55:09.970" style="s2">fine it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.790" end="00:55:12.070" style="s2">you know maybe exactly how you do the</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.970" end="00:55:14.260" style="s2">steps but these features that it</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.070" end="00:55:18.130" style="s2">releases complexity doesn&#39;t use them it</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.260" end="00:55:23.410" style="s2">you know medicine thetic mind that it it</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.130" end="00:55:25.490" style="s2">arises from you know some deep inner</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.410" end="00:55:28.099" style="s2">some sensing and</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.490" end="00:55:30.579" style="s2">and that means you&#39;re it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.099" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">back by these other commitments deep</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.579" end="00:55:37.970" style="s2">inner sensing is your kind of tracking</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.500" style="s2">through some kind of set of commitments</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.970" end="00:55:40.819" style="s2">so you have to know what those</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.500" end="00:55:45.079" style="s2">commitments are if that could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.819" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">explicated also I try to work you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.079" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">to release complexity I tried to work</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">with things that are already underway</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:54.460" style="s2">you know the one that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:58.819" style="s2">emergent is digital naturalism but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.460" end="00:56:02.450" style="s2">tried to also ask the coronavirus like</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.819" end="00:56:06.109" style="s2">what what are you telling us you know so</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.450" end="00:56:07.970" style="s2">that&#39;s the the food to farm thing and</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.109" end="00:56:11.119" style="s2">the way people are working and with</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.970" end="00:56:15.920" style="s2">making bread and like the other day I</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.119" end="00:56:18.290" style="s2">saw this guy who generally sells eggs to</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.920" end="00:56:21.410" style="s2">restaurants had to was was going to have</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.290" end="00:56:24.170" style="s2">to call his flock and he went straight</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.410" end="00:56:26.930" style="s2">to Facebook and they he sells like two</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.170" end="00:56:30.410" style="s2">months of eggs over Facebook this is the</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.930" end="00:56:32.839" style="s2">move like you just go directly and now</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.410" end="00:56:34.849" style="s2">that the system has to breathe food here</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.839" end="00:56:37.250" style="s2">then it has to move food here this is</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.849" end="00:56:39.710" style="s2">the move I try to work within the</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.250" end="00:56:43.309" style="s2">intelligence and pro-social impulses of</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.710" end="00:56:45.619" style="s2">human I try so there&#39;s certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.309" end="00:56:47.720" style="s2">things if somebody else can if they have</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.619" end="00:56:50.720" style="s2">these deeper touch points so maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.720" end="00:56:52.579" style="s2">could be any other list but but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.720" end="00:56:54.020" style="s2">think there&#39;s a whole if you had all</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.579" end="00:56:58.040" style="s2">those touch points I don&#39;t think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.020" end="00:57:00.799" style="s2">a whole lot of yeah I wanted to ask you</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.040" end="00:57:03.230" style="s2">about like hyper objects to the word</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.799" end="00:57:05.200" style="s2">hyper object and it seems I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.230" end="00:57:07.220" style="s2">if I understand what that means exactly</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.200" end="00:57:10.809" style="s2">maybe people could benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.220" end="00:57:13.609" style="s2">understanding that but I wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.809" end="00:57:15.980" style="s2">removing the hyper object to have a more</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.609" end="00:57:18.200" style="s2">direct relationship with with the world</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.980" end="00:57:22.880" style="s2">is a bit what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.200" end="00:57:24.950" style="s2">that um I can just briefly speak to that</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.880" end="00:57:26.150" style="s2">I know you&#39;re asking Bonnie but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.950" end="00:57:29.540" style="s2">a reason I wanted to come in which was</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.150" end="00:57:31.339" style="s2">that I think this is one of the more</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.540" end="00:57:33.740" style="s2">exciting features of bonitas thought</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.339" end="00:57:35.900" style="s2">because I spend a lot of time with</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.740" end="00:57:38.990" style="s2">people who think about the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.900" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">civilization and the design</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.990" end="00:57:44.900" style="s2">anyone you know gain be is is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:46.990" style="s2">nested notion but a lot of people in</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.900" end="00:57:49.520" style="s2">that world I&#39;ll do think in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.990" end="00:57:51.050" style="s2">something like a transcendental design</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.520" end="00:57:52.850" style="s2">in which you think it all through and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.050" end="00:57:54.320" style="s2">map out what this world would be like</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.850" end="00:57:56.690" style="s2">with different underlying principles</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.320" end="00:57:58.100" style="s2">different motivations different</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.690" end="00:57:59.990" style="s2">incentive structures different</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.100" end="00:58:03.230" style="s2">technologies different feedback loops</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.990" end="00:58:04.820" style="s2">and so it goes on and whenever I hear</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.230" end="00:58:06.860" style="s2">those things they don&#39;t feel all</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.820" end="00:58:08.390" style="s2">together real and it&#39;s not because I</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.860" end="00:58:10.280" style="s2">don&#39;t think we need that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.390" end="00:58:11.690" style="s2">thinking it&#39;s because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.280" end="00:58:16.180" style="s2">about the getting from here to there</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.690" end="00:58:19.100" style="s2">that it&#39;s sort of ignored as if somehow</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.180" end="00:58:22.220" style="s2">the process of getting from A to B was</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.100" end="00:58:24.500" style="s2">not itself part of the story rather than</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.220" end="00:58:25.640" style="s2">just what&#39;s a and what&#39;s B and so this</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.500" end="00:58:28.010" style="s2">idea of working with what&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.640" end="00:58:29.600" style="s2">there and sort of bill very very</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.010" end="00:58:31.310" style="s2">important yeah yeah it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.600" end="00:58:33.110" style="s2">so when we need to asks it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.310" end="00:58:36.590" style="s2">noticing you know what does the</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.110" end="00:58:37.670" style="s2">coronavirus saying to us it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.590" end="00:58:39.800" style="s2">very interesting way of posing the</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.670" end="00:58:42.920" style="s2">question I feel it to be profoundly</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.800" end="00:58:45.410" style="s2">ethical but not moralistic like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.920" end="00:58:47.380" style="s2">looking at the complex situation we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.410" end="00:58:52.160" style="s2">not we&#39;re not imposing a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.380" end="00:58:55.160" style="s2">moralistic map of or even let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.160" end="00:58:57.980" style="s2">trying to engineer this you know this</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.160" end="00:58:59.480" style="s2">utopian society we&#39;re trying to really</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.980" end="00:59:02.450" style="s2">work with the forces that are moving</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.480" end="00:59:04.670" style="s2">through us and our communities and and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.450" end="00:59:08.710" style="s2">whatever happens to appear which might</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.670" end="00:59:11.960" style="s2">be coronavirus right now yeah no I I</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.710" end="00:59:13.430" style="s2">that&#39;s right I want to hear what bunny</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.960" end="00:59:14.810" style="s2">wants to say about hyper objects but I</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.430" end="00:59:16.580" style="s2">also have something to add the only feel</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.810" end="00:59:19.540" style="s2">in the last few days I&#39;ve really made my</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.580" end="00:59:23.630" style="s2">pizza like objects in a certain sense so</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.540" end="00:59:25.670" style="s2">yeah so this is work I&#39;ve been doing for</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.630" end="00:59:30.080" style="s2">a long time is you know Jonathan and</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.670" end="00:59:32.480" style="s2">that is I&#39;ve for a long time believed</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.080" end="00:59:35.619" style="s2">that the complexity in human</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.480" end="00:59:38.359" style="s2">consciousness as measured by</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.619" end="00:59:41.710" style="s2">hierarchical developmental stage theory</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.359" end="00:59:44.000" style="s2">is a product of adapting to an</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.710" end="00:59:48.100" style="s2">information economy in a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.000" end="00:59:51.230" style="s2">society now actually the early Daoists</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.100" end="00:59:52.300" style="s2">talked about this in terms of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.230" end="00:59:53.920" style="s2">they said</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.300" end="00:59:56.410" style="s2">now they&#39;ll have print their principles</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.920" end="00:59:57.520" style="s2">don&#39;t touch any your brother&#39;s wife and</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.410" end="01:00:01.360" style="s2">then they&#39;ll say well what if she falls</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.520" end="01:00:04.090" style="s2">in the water they then they have context</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.360" end="01:00:06.010" style="s2">but they when they argued with the mo s</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.090" end="01:00:07.600" style="s2">they said you don&#39;t want to have more</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.010" end="01:00:09.580" style="s2">and more complex rules because then</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.600" end="01:00:11.020" style="s2">you&#39;ll only have you have to pay a few</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.580" end="01:00:12.730" style="s2">people you don&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.020" end="01:00:14.860" style="s2">talking about and the average person</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.730" end="01:00:17.380" style="s2">cannot make a moral decision so they</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.860" end="01:00:19.270" style="s2">predicted that the the way complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.380" end="01:00:25.180" style="s2">thinking works in the moral sphere is</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.270" end="01:00:28.270" style="s2">highly problematic so now with this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.180" end="01:00:31.540" style="s2">not about that but but what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.270" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">is that here&#39;s the challenge to smart</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.540" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">people today the challenge is not to</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:40.180" style="s2">design double and triple loop systems is</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:43.180" style="s2">to design single loop feedback systems</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.180" end="01:00:46.170" style="s2">that work they&#39;re inherently inclusive</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.180" end="01:00:48.300" style="s2">of everyone including young people and</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.170" end="01:00:52.060" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.300" end="01:00:54.670" style="s2">everyone knows how to use currency this</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.060" end="01:00:57.490" style="s2">move to making systems more more and</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.670" end="01:00:59.710" style="s2">more complex is inherently a rivalry</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.490" end="01:01:02.140" style="s2">smooth and a capitalist information</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.710" end="01:01:04.990" style="s2">economy now you don&#39;t have to buy into</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.140" end="01:01:07.390" style="s2">that it&#39;s highly provocative I happen to</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.990" end="01:01:09.600" style="s2">believe it and some people are studying</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.390" end="01:01:12.750" style="s2">to also come around to it</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.600" end="01:01:14.890" style="s2">Roy - star for example this was his</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.750" end="01:01:19.630" style="s2">critique of the Texas well-versed</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.890" end="01:01:22.090" style="s2">taxonomy so that&#39;s that so this moving</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.630" end="01:01:24.280" style="s2">and hyper objects is is that move just</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.090" end="01:01:26.250" style="s2">taking things and making them more and</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.280" end="01:01:30.520" style="s2">more complex in a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.250" end="01:01:32.610" style="s2">complexity that money can I come in</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.520" end="01:01:36.130" style="s2">there because two things there one is</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.610" end="01:01:38.200" style="s2">and not to hear more about what what</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.130" end="01:01:40.780" style="s2">exactly you mean that is you seem to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.200" end="01:01:43.780" style="s2">saying that they developed the impulse</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.780" end="01:01:45.820" style="s2">to understand cognitive complexity</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.780" end="01:01:49.570" style="s2">through developments or models is</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.820" end="01:01:52.030" style="s2">somehow beholden to the capital</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.570" end="01:01:53.920" style="s2">informational infrastructure and</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.030" end="01:01:56.260" style="s2">therefore know exactly beholdin but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.920" end="01:01:58.390" style="s2">sort of shaped by it and serves it in a</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.260" end="01:02:01.720" style="s2">certain sense I would put a little</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.390" end="01:02:04.720" style="s2">cleaner than that developmental stage</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.720" end="01:02:05.380" style="s2">models correctly reflect what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.720" end="01:02:07.569" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.380" end="01:02:09.670" style="s2">but that&#39;s not because our mind is like</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.569" end="01:02:12.700" style="s2">that that&#39;s because it&#39;s a mind that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.670" end="01:02:14.559" style="s2">developed in a rival risk okay yes so</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.700" end="01:02:17.079" style="s2">they&#39;re there it&#39;s called the empirical</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.559" end="01:02:19.239" style="s2">fallacy but they got evidence that</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.079" end="01:02:21.249" style="s2">that&#39;s happening but they act as if this</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.239" end="01:02:23.499" style="s2">is a deep structure of their mind I see</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.249" end="01:02:26.019" style="s2">okay brilliant so it&#39;s not so in some</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.499" end="01:02:27.670" style="s2">ways you could say it&#39;s a piston ology</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.019" end="01:02:31.119" style="s2">claiming to be ontology something like</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.670" end="01:02:33.099" style="s2">that yes right okay got it right so the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.119" end="01:02:36.009" style="s2">next question was about high progress</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.099" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">because only recently I feel I read</p>

<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:43.630" style="s2">time ago I&#39;ve spoken to here my trusted</p>

<p begin="01:02:58.630" end="01:03:02.170" style="s2">there&#39;s a more generous way to view more</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.119" end="01:04:08.170" style="s2">blueprints and the games here at</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.339" end="01:04:12.819" style="s2">theoretic understandings and saying no</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.170" end="01:04:14.650" style="s2">just grinding in your own experience the</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.819" end="01:04:17.739" style="s2">hyper organs our way of saying youth</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.650" end="01:04:19.099" style="s2">that function has limitations it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.739" end="01:04:21.799" style="s2">saying here is the</p>

<p begin="01:04:21.799" end="01:04:26.479" style="s2">must surrender that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.019" end="01:04:27.949" style="s2">archetypes and symbols and stuff too</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.479" end="01:04:30.410" style="s2">right so it&#39;s just sort of an uber</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.949" end="01:04:32.059" style="s2">archetype a big big well yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.410" end="01:04:33.529" style="s2">understand it this is why you deciding</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.059" end="01:04:35.239" style="s2">and Bonnie can correct me on this but as</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.529" end="01:04:36.979" style="s2">I understand that one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.239" end="01:04:39.799" style="s2">people that gets further exciting is</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.979" end="01:04:41.420" style="s2">precisely because those ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.799" end="01:04:44.269" style="s2">the more magic mythic kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.420" end="01:04:46.849" style="s2">perspectives are coming back people are</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.269" end="01:04:48.589" style="s2">reaching for them and and feeling more</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.849" end="01:04:50.479" style="s2">attune to them and that&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.589" end="01:04:52.249" style="s2">they&#39;re more mental structures that</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.479" end="01:04:55.069" style="s2">we&#39;ve been living with predominantly for</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.249" end="01:04:57.650" style="s2">the last decades and centuries are</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.069" end="01:04:59.299" style="s2">losing their preeminence they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.650" end="01:05:02.959" style="s2">there we still need them you don&#39;t throw</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.299" end="01:05:04.969" style="s2">your intellect I lightly you sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.959" end="01:05:06.319" style="s2">need it but there are other things going</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.969" end="01:05:08.839" style="s2">on one of the things that&#39;s going on is</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.319" end="01:05:10.819" style="s2">this kind of a purse for table view</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.839" end="01:05:12.650" style="s2">which is a weight which is not a way of</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.819" end="01:05:14.869" style="s2">saying you don&#39;t take perspective or you</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.650" end="01:05:16.910" style="s2">don&#39;t have concepts but it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.869" end="01:05:19.999" style="s2">recognizing that you can experience the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.910" end="01:05:23.869" style="s2">whole thing and not be able to explain</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.999" end="01:05:26.449" style="s2">it conceptually and that&#39;s partly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.869" end="01:05:28.609" style="s2">going on with with the covert 19 crisis</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.449" end="01:05:29.989" style="s2">of endemic but also the bigger issues</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.609" end="01:05:31.699" style="s2">like climate change people speaking</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.989" end="01:05:35.209" style="s2">about the meta crisis what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.699" end="01:05:37.969" style="s2">alluding to is the ineffable wholeness</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.209" end="01:05:39.319" style="s2">of our existential predicament expressed</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.969" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">in systemic terms that are beyond my</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.319" end="01:05:44.119" style="s2">understanding and that&#39;s where hyper</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:45.940" style="s2">objects are a bit more like your friend</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.119" end="01:05:48.289" style="s2">you know they&#39;re a bit more like okay I</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.940" end="01:05:50.690" style="s2">see why I can&#39;t get that it&#39;s a hyper</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.289" end="01:05:52.069" style="s2">object and that&#39;s okay because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.690" end="01:05:54.170" style="s2">limit to what I can understand because</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.069" end="01:05:57.380" style="s2">I&#39;m a single human being with epistemic</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.170" end="01:06:00.249" style="s2">limitations that&#39;s how I see it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.380" end="01:06:02.569" style="s2">a necessary kind of short form for</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.249" end="01:06:04.039" style="s2">communication between peak between</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.569" end="01:06:06.559" style="s2">people to understand things that are</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.039" end="01:06:09.229" style="s2">that are beyond our understanding</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.559" end="01:06:14.299" style="s2">come on I&#39;ll let Bonnie come in now I</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.229" end="01:06:19.579" style="s2">mean I think that just like all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.299" end="01:06:22.549" style="s2">new waves of understanding they they</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.579" end="01:06:24.440" style="s2">morph and they get popularized and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.549" end="01:06:26.900" style="s2">mostly critiquing the popularized</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.440" end="01:06:29.599" style="s2">version when I teach Timothy Moore and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.900" end="01:06:32.400" style="s2">always teach hyper objects in</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.599" end="01:06:34.650" style="s2">conjunction to his other book</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.400" end="01:06:38.549" style="s2">which I can&#39;t remember what the title of</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.650" end="01:06:42.630" style="s2">it is but the subtitle is is something</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.549" end="01:06:44.670" style="s2">about you know really having</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.630" end="01:06:47.309" style="s2">relationships with the non-moving world</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.670" end="01:06:49.920" style="s2">is a type of neo animism and I think the</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.309" end="01:06:52.710" style="s2">two have to go hand-in-hand and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.920" end="01:06:59.339" style="s2">second version is is usually much more</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.710" end="01:07:01.499" style="s2">foreign to people that objects are part</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.339" end="01:07:04.410" style="s2">you can participate with objects they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.499" end="01:07:07.920" style="s2">non-trivial I like to say for example</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.410" end="01:07:10.380" style="s2">that coffee moves billion people every</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.920" end="01:07:15.269" style="s2">morning and I don&#39;t mean it in a trivial</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.380" end="01:07:17.519" style="s2">way this is if you investigate you you</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.269" end="01:07:20.609" style="s2">know what catalyzes your actions and</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.519" end="01:07:22.019" style="s2">mate in many cases it&#39;s there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.609" end="01:07:25.380" style="s2">what we would call objects</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.019" end="01:07:28.859" style="s2">so this those two pieces have to come</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.380" end="01:07:32.519" style="s2">together for me in understanding Timothy</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.859" end="01:07:34.079" style="s2">Morton but yes if you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.519" end="01:07:41.579" style="s2">different ways to understand hyper</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.079" end="01:07:47.940" style="s2">objects I agree with you yeah so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.579" end="01:07:50.970" style="s2">you know this could that could be a list</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.940" end="01:07:53.309" style="s2">of six things we should sort of do is</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.970" end="01:07:55.559" style="s2">that they&#39;re there somewhere straddle</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.309" end="01:07:57.779" style="s2">between the perspectival in the ape</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.559" end="01:07:59.579" style="s2">respect idol they&#39;re sort of as a bridge</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.779" end="01:08:01.950" style="s2">from one to the other so you want where</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.579" end="01:08:04.279" style="s2">you want to get to are these tacit</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.950" end="01:08:07.319" style="s2">understandings based on embeddedness in</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.279" end="01:08:09.390" style="s2">relationship right but to get there you</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.319" end="01:08:11.130" style="s2">need to build this sort of quasi</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.390" end="01:08:13.980" style="s2">conceptual bridge that has practice</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.130" end="01:08:16.230" style="s2">built into it so that we don&#39;t we know</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.980" end="01:08:19.259" style="s2">where we&#39;re going to some extent yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.230" end="01:08:21.480" style="s2">and it has to have you know it has to be</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.259" end="01:08:23.969" style="s2">anchored in the real dynamics of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.480" end="01:08:26.069" style="s2">real world like is it possible to have a</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.969" end="01:08:27.600" style="s2">currency like that is it possible to</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.069" end="01:08:31.500" style="s2">track its food chain you know these</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.600" end="01:08:33.480" style="s2">things are possible what I wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.500" end="01:08:37.440" style="s2">you Bonnie about that it&#39;s okay with</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.480" end="01:08:38.909" style="s2">Andrew is that you know the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.440" end="01:08:40.500" style="s2">critique they become one is the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.909" end="01:08:42.060" style="s2">a statistical romanticism the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.500" end="01:08:44.190" style="s2">critique that I didn&#39;t mention that I</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.060" end="01:08:46.739" style="s2">couldn&#39;t iron is how much you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.190" end="01:08:48.509" style="s2">assuming about human you will</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.739" end="01:08:51.179" style="s2">how much we&#39;re assuming that our better</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.509" end="01:08:52.830" style="s2">natures are latent waiting to come out</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.179" end="01:08:55.739" style="s2">and just need the right systems and</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.830" end="01:08:59.759" style="s2">structures to elicit them and the what</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.739" end="01:09:02.159" style="s2">extent are we just morally compromised</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.759" end="01:09:03.810" style="s2">and self-interested and we&#39;ll there will</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.159" end="01:09:06.119" style="s2">always be a critical mass of people in</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.810" end="01:09:09.480" style="s2">any given group who will seek to subvert</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.119" end="01:09:11.880" style="s2">the Commons and subvert patterns of</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.480" end="01:09:14.969" style="s2">collaboration for their own selfish</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.880" end="01:09:18.359" style="s2">advantage I know that people like</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.969" end="01:09:19.949" style="s2">manuals frankenburger is very clear that</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.359" end="01:09:21.630" style="s2">this is one of the main problems what he</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.949" end="01:09:25.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really trust in anything within</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.630" end="01:09:27.449" style="s2">our current competitive system is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.920" end="01:09:28.679" style="s2">as long as those people are there they</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.449" end="01:09:31.679" style="s2">will ultimately destroy things for</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.679" end="01:09:32.969" style="s2">everyone and so I suppose I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.679" end="01:09:34.619" style="s2">curious to know where you are with that</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.969" end="01:09:36.029" style="s2">because you something to speak as though</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.619" end="01:09:38.909" style="s2">there is this better nature that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.029" end="01:09:46.980" style="s2">universal but I&#39;m just not sure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.909" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">the case I would say that you have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.980" end="01:09:57.239" style="s2">have an optimistic you have to be able</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:10:01.350" style="s2">to imagine optimistically but not that</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.239" end="01:10:03.780" style="s2">people are good so for example one of</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.350" end="01:10:07.860" style="s2">the one of the one of the hopes in</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.780" end="01:10:09.389" style="s2">something like this is oh I wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.860" end="01:10:10.110" style="s2">just spring in you know wouldn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.389" end="01:10:11.730" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.110" end="01:10:13.290" style="s2">working with what we have you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.730" end="01:10:16.139" style="s2">that&#39;s a big thing in Jake Snowden&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.290" end="01:10:18.929" style="s2">work of exaptation right and I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.139" end="01:10:20.940" style="s2">that we should also work with what we</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.929" end="01:10:25.110" style="s2">have in terms of people people are going</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.940" end="01:10:28.290" style="s2">people are not so good or whatever what</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.110" end="01:10:30.869" style="s2">I see though however is the biggest of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.290" end="01:10:35.570" style="s2">reality of the moral quandary we have as</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.869" end="01:10:40.590" style="s2">people now is not that we&#39;re not good</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.570" end="01:10:45.869" style="s2">intentioned it&#39;s that there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.590" end="01:10:50.969" style="s2">intentions funneled through perverse</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.869" end="01:10:53.010" style="s2">incentives and and I think everything</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.969" end="01:10:54.659" style="s2">like people like Kant that currency be</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.010" end="01:10:57.599" style="s2">gamed I&#39;m like yeah sure any currency</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.659" end="01:10:59.670" style="s2">can be gained but there&#39;s there&#39;s a it</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.599" end="01:11:02.190" style="s2">can if there&#39;s a lot less it can do</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.670" end="01:11:04.020" style="s2">so you know you can&#39;t invest in you</p>

<p begin="01:11:04.020" end="01:11:08.580" style="s2">so you want a lot of little</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.900" end="01:11:11.670" style="s2">transgressions this is one of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.580" end="01:11:13.920" style="s2">problems with Bitcoin it&#39;s that I think</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.670" end="01:11:15.840" style="s2">they&#39;re working on it with hollow chain</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.920" end="01:11:18.840" style="s2">successfully because hollow chain has</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.840" end="01:11:22.350" style="s2">different levels of permissions so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.840" end="01:11:25.920" style="s2">closed circles can be a lot more wiggle</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.350" end="01:11:29.280" style="s2">room but in a lot of big Bitcoin bit</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.920" end="01:11:33.390" style="s2">chains blockchain technology imagines a</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.280" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">transgressed with society which is like</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.390" end="01:11:38.040" style="s2">a dead society you know I mean our</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:40.469" style="s2">values and our ways of imagining</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.040" end="01:11:43.219" style="s2">ourselves evolved and they always come</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.469" end="01:11:47.370" style="s2">online they emerge as deviant form so</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.219" end="01:11:52.880" style="s2">this is something to think about in</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.370" end="01:11:57.540" style="s2">terms of going forward and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.880" end="01:12:01.260" style="s2">something about you know if you start to</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.540" end="01:12:03.719" style="s2">look at how nature is composed itself</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.260" end="01:12:05.910" style="s2">right versus the systems that we make we</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.719" end="01:12:07.910" style="s2">want to always make systems that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.910" end="01:12:14.370" style="s2">know can&#39;t be gamed are systems that</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.910" end="01:12:20.040" style="s2">whatever retreat a withdrawal but things</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.370" end="01:12:23.960" style="s2">like cheating and parasitism all these</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.040" end="01:12:30.390" style="s2">things are highly evolutionary in nature</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.960" end="01:12:32.880" style="s2">and so that&#39;s again you know a lot a lot</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.390" end="01:12:36.390" style="s2">of this conversation and and it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.880" end="01:12:37.770" style="s2">for me to so I&#39;m not saying not just</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.390" end="01:12:41.190" style="s2">throwing stones here a lot of this</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.770" end="01:12:44.880" style="s2">conversation is from the impression that</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.190" end="01:12:47.370" style="s2">the system is big and you know system</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.880" end="01:12:50.940" style="s2">number one the big we we can hardly use</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.370" end="01:12:53.730" style="s2">that word and not think of nature as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.940" end="01:12:55.590" style="s2">system it&#39;s so distributed we don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.730" end="01:12:56.130" style="s2">it&#39;s not even a system because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.590" end="01:13:00.060" style="s2">open</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.130" end="01:13:04.170" style="s2">yeah and so part of this work if people</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.060" end="01:13:07.140" style="s2">wanted to work on this approach is</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.170" end="01:13:09.810" style="s2">helping each other even understand what</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.140" end="01:13:14.449" style="s2">we mean when we talk about that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.810" end="01:13:21.929" style="s2">system yeah because it&#39;s not bounded</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.449" end="01:13:25.110" style="s2">and you know so if I have a really good</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.929" end="01:13:27.179" style="s2">series of articles and medium that</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.110" end="01:13:29.309" style="s2">sounded self-promotional but it goes</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.179" end="01:13:31.340" style="s2">through like the different levels of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.309" end="01:13:34.320" style="s2">system thinking zero level which is just</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.340" end="01:13:36.929" style="s2">participation all the way and it shows</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.320" end="01:13:39.210" style="s2">all the moves that are made by the mind</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.929" end="01:13:42.499" style="s2">to increase the complexity of those</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.210" end="01:13:46.289" style="s2">systems and so what you can do with that</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.499" end="01:13:48.599" style="s2">that analysis is systematically work</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.289" end="01:13:51.389" style="s2">back so for example at a certain level</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.599" end="01:13:54.090" style="s2">of systems thinking you D animate some</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.389" end="01:13:58.199" style="s2">part of the system and there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.090" end="01:14:01.860" style="s2">there&#39;s a liability to that so you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.199" end="01:14:04.170" style="s2">I think that Nora Bateson you people in</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.860" end="01:14:09.679" style="s2">our community Dave Snowden we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.170" end="01:14:15.380" style="s2">trying to figure out the language and</p>
<p begin="01:14:09.679" end="01:14:15.380" style="s2">what is it to talk about this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.219" end="01:14:23.070" style="s2">process or dynamics that it doesn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.650" end="01:14:24.929" style="s2">so that&#39;s kind of a challenge you said D</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.070" end="01:14:27.420" style="s2">animating the system which I thought was</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.929" end="01:14:31.199" style="s2">kind of interesting because in these</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.420" end="01:14:33.239" style="s2">theoretical two worlds the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.199" end="01:14:34.920" style="s2">the present world is there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.239" end="01:14:37.170" style="s2">dead structures right that need to be</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.920" end="01:14:40.889" style="s2">kind of animated that means it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.170" end="01:14:44.099" style="s2">fall apart before more positive</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.889" end="01:14:46.860" style="s2">structures can emerge yeah what I meant</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.099" end="01:14:52.260" style="s2">by that is like the original sin of the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.860" end="01:14:55.079" style="s2">ecological management movement we can</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.260" end="01:14:59.340" style="s2">manage ecosystem so that we are active</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.079" end="01:15:01.829" style="s2">and the ecosystems D animated and there</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.340" end="01:15:03.809" style="s2">is this is one of the original</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.829" end="01:15:06.239" style="s2">incentives of whole it would I call</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.809" end="01:15:08.849" style="s2">holistic systems thinking it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.239" end="01:15:12.420" style="s2">control right yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a mania for</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.849" end="01:15:15.630" style="s2">controlling whatever it could come from</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.420" end="01:15:18.420" style="s2">from good intentions but you notice you</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.630" end="01:15:21.360" style="s2">say you know I&#39;m subject your object to</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.420" end="01:15:23.639" style="s2">that and whenever you do that then the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.360" end="01:15:26.249" style="s2">system is going to come back to bite you</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.639" end="01:15:27.090" style="s2">right or management systems management</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.249" end="01:15:29.380" style="s2">thinking</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.090" end="01:15:35.350" style="s2">different theories of management show</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.380" end="01:15:37.570" style="s2">how you can they envision the workers as</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.350" end="01:15:39.370" style="s2">being agents but then the manager can</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.570" end="01:15:42.910" style="s2">step outside and see it as a human</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.370" end="01:15:44.770" style="s2">system and act on it right so now I have</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.910" end="01:15:48.040" style="s2">a privileged position from which I can</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.770" end="01:15:50.770" style="s2">act on the system well this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.040" end="01:15:53.380" style="s2">not true in highly caught it&#39;s not true</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.770" end="01:15:56.710" style="s2">of nature it&#39;s not true the coronavirus</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.380" end="01:15:59.200" style="s2">this is exactly what the model mental</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.710" end="01:16:01.510" style="s2">model is of coronavirus that we can act</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.200" end="01:16:03.210" style="s2">on something that&#39;s not true you have to</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.510" end="01:16:05.770" style="s2">take a different orientation and</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.210" end="01:16:10.510" style="s2">understand that the orientation is is</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.770" end="01:16:13.510" style="s2">really good work but that&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.510" end="01:16:16.140" style="s2">there&#39;s nine I think different features</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.510" end="01:16:20.320" style="s2">of systems thinking they can move you to</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.140" end="01:16:24.160" style="s2">this this other way of yeah being with</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.320" end="01:16:28.980" style="s2">complexity oh yeah that makes the</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.160" end="01:16:31.570" style="s2">question is like how do we act and with</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.980" end="01:16:33.880" style="s2">what is our agency and all of these</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.570" end="01:16:35.710" style="s2">things and and and part of that is I</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.880" end="01:16:37.720" style="s2">guess activity and part of that is like</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.710" end="01:16:39.280" style="s2">you&#39;re the Taoist King and you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.720" end="01:16:44.850" style="s2">facing south and that&#39;s how you roll</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.280" end="01:16:49.300" style="s2">your kingdom not by by messing with</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.850" end="01:16:51.550" style="s2">whatever&#39;s going on sorry Jonathan you</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.300" end="01:16:54.760" style="s2">wanted to well just just to sort of that</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.550" end="01:16:56.020" style="s2">cool I&#39;m red bow nice piece on it sounds</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.760" end="01:16:59.380" style="s2">fascinating on different ways of</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.020" end="01:17:01.570" style="s2">understanding systems thinking but I am</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.380" end="01:17:05.050" style="s2">aware of the fact that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.570" end="01:17:08.680" style="s2">talk of changing the system a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.050" end="01:17:11.500" style="s2">times change and not that much</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.680" end="01:17:14.830" style="s2">reflection on what we mean precisely by</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.500" end="01:17:17.470" style="s2">system nor the scales that that applies</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.830" end="01:17:20.980" style="s2">to micro macro so and everything else in</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.470" end="01:17:25.060" style="s2">between and then the different kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.980" end="01:17:27.120" style="s2">systems such that you know the sort of</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.060" end="01:17:30.550" style="s2">self-organizing system that is the mind</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.120" end="01:17:32.800" style="s2">is very very different from the kind</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.550" end="01:17:34.630" style="s2">before system that is the virus and</p>
<p begin="01:17:32.800" end="01:17:37.780" style="s2">again I like what you&#39;re saying it may</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.630" end="01:17:41.030" style="s2">be it isn&#39;t even a system well the</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.780" end="01:17:42.860" style="s2">ecosystem is not a system maybe well</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.030" end="01:17:46.400" style="s2">but we were so used to thinking in those</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.860" end="01:17:48.860" style="s2">terms but they&#39;re not exactly what I</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.400" end="01:17:52.270" style="s2">think what I&#39;m sort of maybe in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.860" end="01:17:55.850" style="s2">pulling my punches a bit I just feel</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.270" end="01:17:57.740" style="s2">systems systems thinking unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.850" end="01:18:00.410" style="s2">given the kind of texture that when he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.740" end="01:18:02.510" style="s2">disappointing to risk being Hollow</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.410" end="01:18:05.780" style="s2">it risks being a kind of picking</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.510" end="01:18:10.090" style="s2">something out of the social surround to</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.780" end="01:18:12.980" style="s2">sign clever design insightful but actual</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.090" end="01:18:15.680" style="s2">to really feel systems and to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.980" end="01:18:19.160" style="s2">one&#39;s participation in them is it</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.680" end="01:18:22.130" style="s2">altogether more and more exacting</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.160" end="01:18:24.740" style="s2">challenging tasks because as Bonnie says</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.130" end="01:18:26.840" style="s2">we are we have multiple systems inside</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.740" end="01:18:28.370" style="s2">of us there is a sense in which we are</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.840" end="01:18:31.040" style="s2">one system ourselves but then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.370" end="01:18:34.460" style="s2">embedded in many others so to even speak</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.040" end="01:18:38.320" style="s2">of systems is to bring into the room</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.460" end="01:18:41.150" style="s2">like thousands of layers of complexity</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.320" end="01:18:43.640" style="s2">and ok there&#39;s no point in getting lost</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.150" end="01:18:47.930" style="s2">in that you need to get back to and</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.640" end="01:18:50.660" style="s2">therefore but just that we maybe need to</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.930" end="01:18:53.600" style="s2">refine our conception of when we say</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.660" end="01:18:56.420" style="s2">system I mean X just as when we sit in a</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.600" end="01:18:57.980" style="s2">moment and we say when I say I mean this</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.420" end="01:19:00.610" style="s2">version of it or when I say democracy I</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.980" end="01:19:04.910" style="s2">mean this I mean the little demo</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.610" end="01:19:08.780" style="s2">likewise the system changing the system</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.910" end="01:19:11.150" style="s2">I&#39;ve often thought was a bit bit hollow</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.780" end="01:19:15.620" style="s2">and also it has a kind of ingratitude</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.150" end="01:19:17.900" style="s2">for you know we&#39;ve got to this point in</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.620" end="01:19:19.790" style="s2">culture and we&#39;ve been struggling with</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.900" end="01:19:23.570" style="s2">it if you just want to change the system</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.790" end="01:19:30.500" style="s2">there&#39;s this deep deep history that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.570" end="01:19:31.910" style="s2">system is is is comes from right and you</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.500" end="01:19:33.560" style="s2">know people that people have this</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.910" end="01:19:35.060" style="s2">tendency to want to wipe everything away</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.560" end="01:19:38.720" style="s2">in this sort of blank slate that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.060" end="01:19:39.800" style="s2">that&#39;s I think the heart of the point me</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.720" end="01:19:41.000" style="s2">turning through and there&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.800" end="01:19:44.360" style="s2">reason for that and that&#39;s what is</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.000" end="01:19:47.540" style="s2">uniquely Benito&#39;s in some ways and for</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.360" end="01:19:49.340" style="s2">me at least because I&#39;m also resting</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.540" end="01:19:51.920" style="s2">with that being in a communities where</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.340" end="01:19:54.090" style="s2">the language is very much of things have</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.920" end="01:19:56.520" style="s2">to die before they can be reborn</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.090" end="01:19:58.409" style="s2">and we need to tear down capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.520" end="01:20:00.780" style="s2">we need and democracy is finished and</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.409" end="01:20:02.790" style="s2">and none of this quite rings true and</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.780" end="01:20:06.440" style="s2">yet it doesn&#39;t ring wholly false either</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.790" end="01:20:11.369" style="s2">there is a sense in which the</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.440" end="01:20:14.159" style="s2">interlocking pressures of multiple great</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.369" end="01:20:16.830" style="s2">systemic breakdowns and their</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.159" end="01:20:19.980" style="s2">relationship does mean we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.830" end="01:20:23.790" style="s2">encountering something like existential</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.980" end="01:20:25.619" style="s2">risks if not catastrophic risks and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.790" end="01:20:28.409" style="s2">think that&#39;s kind of right but when it</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.619" end="01:20:30.270" style="s2">comes to what to do we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.409" end="01:20:33.000" style="s2">option of starting from school ground</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.270" end="01:20:34.920" style="s2">zero like it&#39;s just not there what we</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.000" end="01:20:36.780" style="s2">have instead is our next move and chest</p>
<p begin="01:20:34.920" end="01:20:38.340" style="s2">rooms now the position is what the</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.780" end="01:20:40.739" style="s2">position is you the pieces are where the</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.340" end="01:20:42.719" style="s2">pieces are you can play better or worse</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.739" end="01:20:44.429" style="s2">but it&#39;s your move you know that&#39;s how I</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.719" end="01:20:47.099" style="s2">see it</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.429" end="01:20:49.139" style="s2">and yeah to make a good movie to think</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.099" end="01:20:51.050" style="s2">ahead certainly I need to learn from</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.139" end="01:20:53.489" style="s2">what you&#39;ve done wrong in the past right</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.050" end="01:20:55.440" style="s2">well don&#39;t think you can just wipe the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.489" end="01:20:58.889" style="s2">pieces away and start again you know you</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.440" end="01:21:02.010" style="s2">it&#39;s not not how life is yeah and I</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.889" end="01:21:03.780" style="s2">think that I love there&#39;s a lot you just</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.010" end="01:21:04.349" style="s2">said there so I&#39;m gonna pick out some</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.780" end="01:21:07.110" style="s2">gems</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.349" end="01:21:09.330" style="s2">oh so you said the mind is a</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.110" end="01:21:12.270" style="s2">self-organizing adaptive you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.330" end="01:21:15.389" style="s2">self-organizing system now the mind has</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.270" end="01:21:18.090" style="s2">complex feed loops right so that some</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.389" end="01:21:20.310" style="s2">some areas when they get excited inhibit</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.090" end="01:21:21.929" style="s2">other areas and those may be inhibited</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.310" end="01:21:24.900" style="s2">earlier so when they inhibit this you</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.929" end="01:21:27.480" style="s2">know it&#39;s a very complex and so the</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.900" end="01:21:31.949" style="s2">moves we make or the thoughts we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.480" end="01:21:33.540" style="s2">our threshold events like literally if</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.949" end="01:21:36.690" style="s2">I&#39;m like should I go to the store not</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.540" end="01:21:39.090" style="s2">both those are in me sub threshold at</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.690" end="01:21:41.550" style="s2">the same time until what happens and the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.090" end="01:21:44.810" style="s2">reason why this is adaptive is the same</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.550" end="01:21:47.550" style="s2">reason why when you&#39;re receiving a serve</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.810" end="01:21:50.099" style="s2">even moving in the wrong direction is</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.550" end="01:21:53.610" style="s2">better than standing still right look so</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.099" end="01:21:56.369" style="s2">so now if you look at coronavirus and we</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.610" end="01:21:58.440" style="s2">say what is the cell what is the self</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.369" end="01:22:01.440" style="s2">organizing collective intelligence of</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.440" end="01:22:04.230" style="s2">coronavirus well what you would want to</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.440" end="01:22:07.380" style="s2">see is a lot of things going on all the</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.230" end="01:22:07.860" style="s2">time the information ecology rich with</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.380" end="01:22:09.570" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.860" end="01:22:12.000" style="s2">relatives until you have a threshold ago</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.570" end="01:22:14.310" style="s2">and dog that&#39;s what we have so now the</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.000" end="01:22:15.510" style="s2">sudden instead of like having a sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.310" end="01:22:17.010" style="s2">making breakdown</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.510" end="01:22:19.620" style="s2">you know the freaking war on sense</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.010" end="01:22:22.170" style="s2">making you actually see the system is</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.620" end="01:22:25.260" style="s2">doing what he needs to do in complex</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.170" end="01:22:27.960" style="s2">environments now there&#39;s too much need</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.260" end="01:22:31.140" style="s2">for people to want one answer and this</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.960" end="01:22:33.840" style="s2">is where you destroy yourself so you can</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.140" end="01:22:36.840" style="s2">start to see I call it there&#39;s a term I</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.840" end="01:22:39.630" style="s2">use still hunting will you just you just</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.840" end="01:22:41.730" style="s2">all the information ecology I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.630" end="01:22:44.910" style="s2">what to make of it but it&#39;s changing the</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.730" end="01:22:47.730" style="s2">way I I no longer feel like I&#39;m lost</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.910" end="01:22:50.760" style="s2">like it&#39;s this need to think well what</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.730" end="01:22:53.340" style="s2">is the answer and if this then that is</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.760" end="01:22:55.050" style="s2">more actually more confusing than</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.340" end="01:22:57.690" style="s2">watching the self-organized</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.050" end="01:23:00.320" style="s2">collective intelligence we need to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.690" end="01:23:03.330" style="s2">that information ecology more robust but</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.320" end="01:23:05.070" style="s2">when that when that New York doctor you</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.330" end="01:23:05.580" style="s2">know New York knew that was coming their</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.070" end="01:23:07.530" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.580" end="01:23:10.920" style="s2">and weaning he got out and said look I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.530" end="01:23:13.050" style="s2">a pulmonary surgeon or whatever a</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.920" end="01:23:15.060" style="s2">respiratory expert he says I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.050" end="01:23:17.460" style="s2">seen something like this before this is</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.060" end="01:23:18.030" style="s2">not pneumonia and he came on like you</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.460" end="01:23:20.880" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.030" end="01:23:22.830" style="s2">and then scientists looked at all these</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.880" end="01:23:24.960" style="s2">different studies and all these</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.830" end="01:23:27.600" style="s2">different ways of experimenting with</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.960" end="01:23:29.640" style="s2">respirators versus ventilators this was</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.600" end="01:23:32.610" style="s2">in real time and this has never happened</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.640" end="01:23:34.110" style="s2">before the professional career of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.610" end="01:23:36.390" style="s2">doctor would have been at risk and all</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.110" end="01:23:38.250" style="s2">this stuff so the same thing that you</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.390" end="01:23:42.810" style="s2">can look as a breakdown in sense making</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.250" end="01:23:45.510" style="s2">I see as emergent emergent ways of</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.810" end="01:23:48.270" style="s2">working with complexity at that level</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.510" end="01:23:50.700" style="s2">and you want to see these a lot of sub</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.270" end="01:23:53.280" style="s2">thresholds experiments I think Sweden is</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.700" end="01:23:56.610" style="s2">marvelous for doing their own experiment</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.280" end="01:23:59.880" style="s2">you know geopolitically they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.610" end="01:24:02.100" style="s2">able to get away with it but you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.880" end="01:24:05.280" style="s2">start to see and then if you can start</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.100" end="01:24:06.720" style="s2">to see you can it&#39;s already happening</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.280" end="01:24:11.250" style="s2">let&#39;s do more of this and less of that</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.720" end="01:24:13.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not entirely new actually I feel</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.250" end="01:24:18.510" style="s2">quite good about about about this as a</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.950" end="01:24:21.610" style="s2">kind of as a kind of sort of conclusion</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.510" end="01:24:25.630" style="s2">because it makes me feel less</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.610" end="01:24:28.030" style="s2">gloomy about humanity in terms of you</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.630" end="01:24:31.480" style="s2">know it&#39;s self-organizing the potential</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.030" end="01:24:36.180" style="s2">do you have something you want to add to</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.480" end="01:24:36.180" style="s2">that Jonathan what what Bonita said um</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.820" end="01:24:47.320" style="s2">well just just to sort of echo it really</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.620" end="01:24:51.990" style="s2">I suppose I would have I would add just</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.320" end="01:24:55.900" style="s2">this that it very much encapsulates how</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.990" end="01:24:57.580" style="s2">I&#39;m what I&#39;m experiencing in my current</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.900" end="01:25:00.100" style="s2">role which involves working with a lot</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.580" end="01:25:03.250" style="s2">of people who are thinking at this level</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.100" end="01:25:07.180" style="s2">of complexity at a time when people are</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.250" end="01:25:09.070" style="s2">desperate for answers and there&#39;s also I</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.180" end="01:25:12.630" style="s2">think a certain fetishization of</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.070" end="01:25:15.300" style="s2">different types of critique which I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.630" end="01:25:18.220" style="s2">little bit guilty of myself sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.300" end="01:25:22.750" style="s2">the desire to solve a problem the desire</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.220" end="01:25:24.460" style="s2">to see civilization wide phenomena as if</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.750" end="01:25:27.070" style="s2">there were essentially problems that</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.460" end="01:25:29.500" style="s2">could be solved rather than a kind of</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.360" end="01:28:23.530" style="s2">bit ironic I say that because in some</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.770" end="01:28:26.830" style="s2">ways for me the struggle that we face</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.530" end="01:28:29.500" style="s2">now is quite close to how I want to live</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.830" end="01:28:31.690" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like having these big</p>

<p begin="01:28:31.690" end="01:28:36.880" style="s2">act on is is in its own way beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.200" end="01:28:38.380" style="s2">now it&#39;s not to say I wouldn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.880" end="01:28:39.820" style="s2">things more peaceful I don&#39;t want people</p>

<p begin="01:29:04.630" end="01:29:10.030" style="s2">in that way I I don&#39;t know if others can</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.020" end="01:29:11.920" style="s2">I&#39;m curious about that but I think what</p>
