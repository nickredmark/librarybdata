<p begin="00:00:07.029" end="00:00:18.340" style="s2">So the last time we talked, I talked to you<br />about how the knowledge structures that we</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.340" end="00:00:20.930" style="s2">inhabit might be built from the bottom up.</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.930" end="00:00:27.650" style="s2">So I’m showing you this diagram because<br />it might clarify that a little bit.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.650" end="00:00:34.719" style="s2">What you see at the top - this is a hierarchy,<br />a partially built hierarchy and so one way</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.719" end="00:00:40.129" style="s2">of thinking of an attribute like good when<br />you apply it to a person, or bad or evil or</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.129" end="00:00:44.570" style="s2">wonderful, one way to think about it is as<br />a description of an object, but it’s not</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.570" end="00:00:45.570" style="s2">really.</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.570" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">It’s shorthand for a set of - well I think<br />of them as micro personalities, but you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.320" style="s2">also think about them as behavioral patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.320" end="00:00:59.499" style="s2">Now, one of the things I mentioned to you<br />about - I talked to you a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.499" end="00:01:05.920" style="s2">words at one point, and what words signify<br />and this is a very complicated problem so</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.920" end="00:01:11.140" style="s2">most of you are probably Augustinians without<br />even knowing it because St. Augustine originally</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.140" end="00:01:14.150" style="s2">proposed that a word was a label for a thing.</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.150" end="00:01:17.270" style="s2">Of course, that’s how people naturally think.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.270" end="00:01:24.619" style="s2">I’m sure most of you would regard that definition<br />as perfectly suitable, but it’s by no means</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.619" end="00:01:30.750" style="s2">the only definition and it’s by no means<br />necessarily the correct definition.</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.750" end="00:01:34.750" style="s2">There&#39;s a famous philosopher named Wittgenstein<br />who proposed instead that a word was like</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.750" end="00:01:41.619" style="s2">a piece in a chess game which meant that it<br />was something that you did something with,</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.619" end="00:01:43.689" style="s2">or you might think about it actually as a<br />tool.</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.689" end="00:01:48.040" style="s2">And when you think about how you use words,<br />you can see that you&#39;re using them often as</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.040" end="00:01:57.320" style="s2">tools to interact with other people for a<br />purpose.</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.320" end="00:02:03.670" style="s2">What I like about the tool idea - the tool<br />idea is a very evolutionary sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.670" end="00:02:10.979" style="s2">concept, partly because we’re tool using<br />creatures probably beyond our other capacities</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.979" end="00:02:17.090" style="s2">except for possibly imitation and language<br />which set us so far apart from other animals,</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.090" end="00:02:22.420" style="s2">but the thing about a tool is that the difference<br />between a tool and an object doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:23.420" style="s2">a user.</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.420" end="00:02:28.800" style="s2">The word object doesn&#39;t imply user, but the<br />word tool implies user, and it’s not obvious</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.800" end="00:02:32.431" style="s2">that we ever interact with anything in the<br />world without interacting with it in some</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.431" end="00:02:34.110" style="s2">motivated way.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.110" end="00:02:37.549" style="s2">And so, what we’re doing is we’re using<br />words to get through the world.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.549" end="00:02:42.010" style="s2">To interact properly within the world and<br />to move where we want to go.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.010" end="00:02:44.200" style="s2">So that’s the second way of thinking about<br />a word.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.200" end="00:02:46.790" style="s2">Here’s another way of thinking about a word.</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.790" end="00:02:52.670" style="s2">A word is like a box of things and so imagine<br />that you cleaned out your basement and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.670" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">a bunch of boxes downstairs and one box is<br />labeled books.</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:00.940" style="s2">Well inside that box, there could be any manner<br />of books.</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.940" end="00:03:06.989" style="s2">Books is a very very diverse set of phenomena.</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.989" end="00:03:11.489" style="s2">If you&#39;re moving, books are kind of condensed<br />into one thing which are kind of heavy objects</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.489" end="00:03:14.690" style="s2">made out of paper.</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.690" end="00:03:17.610" style="s2">You can also imagine another box that says<br />things.</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.610" end="00:03:21.519" style="s2">And in the thing box, I’m sure you have<br />a thing drawer at home where you put all the</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.519" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">things you don&#39;t know what to do with so it’s<br />like the category of all things you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:27.540" style="s2">know what to do with.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.540" end="00:03:28.540" style="s2">Things.</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.540" end="00:03:36.920" style="s2">Okay so a word can also represent a relatively<br />heterogenous set of tools or entities.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.920" end="00:03:43.409" style="s2">That’s very very very useful to know because<br />one of the things that happens often when</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.409" end="00:03:48.349" style="s2">people are arguing is that they use the same<br />word but each word contains a set of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.349" end="00:03:49.519" style="s2">objects.</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.519" end="00:03:54.939" style="s2">You might say for example, is fear real?</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.939" end="00:03:56.599" style="s2">Questions like that are very strange.</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.599" end="00:04:00.299" style="s2">They&#39;re not really answerable in some sense<br />because it depends on exactly what you mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.299" end="00:04:05.960" style="s2">by fear because fear can contain a lot of<br />heterogenous entities, roughly speaking, and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.960" end="00:04:09.659" style="s2">it means - it also depends on what you mean<br />by real.</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.659" end="00:04:13.730" style="s2">So you can define fear and you can define<br />real and so that fear is a subcategory of</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.730" end="00:04:19.120" style="s2">real or you can define fear and you can define<br />fear so that fear isn’t a subset of real.</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.120" end="00:04:26.220" style="s2">So, the idea that fear is a box that only<br />contains a certain set of entities or a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.220" end="00:04:31.100" style="s2">set of tools and that reality is the same<br />is wrong, and people argue about those sorts</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.100" end="00:04:34.680" style="s2">of things all the time, and they make these<br />binary questions.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.680" end="00:04:35.979" style="s2">Is X a Y?</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.979" end="00:04:41.610" style="s2">Well, X and Y are generally not well enough<br />to find so that you can easily find an answer</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.610" end="00:04:43.430" style="s2">to a binary question like that.</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.430" end="00:04:49.250" style="s2">Okay so, words can also represent a relatively<br />heterogenous set of attributes or objects</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.250" end="00:04:50.370" style="s2">or tools.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.370" end="00:04:55.130" style="s2">When you say that someone’s a good person<br />for example, you don’t mean they’re a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.130" end="00:05:01.350" style="s2">good person all the time or that everything<br />they’ve ever done is good because they wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.350" end="00:05:06.060" style="s2">be a good person then, they would be a saint<br />or some other fictional character like that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.060" end="00:05:11.410" style="s2">So, when you’re applying the label - we’ll<br />call it label for the purposes of this argument.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.410" end="00:05:14.020" style="s2">It’s a descriptive tool actually.</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.020" end="00:05:18.870" style="s2">When you’re applying a term like that to<br />someone, it’s a shorthand for a variety</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.870" end="00:05:21.699" style="s2">of states that this person could exist in.</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.699" end="00:05:24.910" style="s2">The majority of which you regard as positive.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.910" end="00:05:28.970" style="s2">You might say he’s a better person than<br />she is, and then you’d say well the proportion</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.970" end="00:05:35.610" style="s2">of attributes that she has - I think I said<br />she, whatever - it exceeds the proportion</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.610" end="00:05:38.360" style="s2">of positives that this other person has.</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.360" end="00:05:42.240" style="s2">So the other way you can think about a word<br />is - this is more complicated, it involves</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.240" end="00:05:43.500" style="s2">a little bit of visualization.</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.500" end="00:05:46.810" style="s2">So imagine you have a child’s train on a<br />track.</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.810" end="00:05:48.750" style="s2">It’s going around and around the track.</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.750" end="00:05:53.190" style="s2">And it’s got cars on it that you can put<br />things in, and all the cars are full of things,</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.190" end="00:05:58.470" style="s2">and then on the track there’s a box with<br />cutouts in it so that the train can pass through,</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.470" end="00:06:01.160" style="s2">and on top of the box is a word.</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.160" end="00:06:05.090" style="s2">And the word is things, and the train is going<br />through the box.</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.090" end="00:06:09.920" style="s2">In some sense, what that would mean - imagine<br />the train is long enough - at any given second,</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.920" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">the box of things would contain different<br />things, but it would still be a box of things.</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:16.889" style="s2">And a lot of words we use are like that.</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.889" end="00:06:24.259" style="s2">Not only do they represent a heterogenous<br />set of entities, but the set changes depending</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.259" end="00:06:27.740" style="s2">on the context that we use the word in.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.740" end="00:06:32.520" style="s2">So the reason I’m telling you that is because<br />a word, here’s another way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.520" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">a word.</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:39.620" style="s2">This will be good for you computer - well<br />you’re all computer people now of course.</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.620" end="00:06:43.710" style="s2">A word is a low resolution image.</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.710" end="00:06:47.280" style="s2">So you think about it.</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.280" end="00:06:50.870" style="s2">A word is a good enough approximation of the<br />thing that it’s representing.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.870" end="00:06:52.050" style="s2">Sort of like a thumbnail.</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.050" end="00:06:56.860" style="s2">Now obviously one of the differences of a<br />thumbnail and the real thing is that the real</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.860" end="00:07:01.910" style="s2">thing exists at a much more, much higher level<br />of resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.910" end="00:07:03.870" style="s2">It exists at many, many more layers.</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.870" end="00:07:06.160" style="s2">You can use the thumbnail to represent it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.160" end="00:07:11.550" style="s2">The advantage to doing that is that it doesn’t<br />take up much processing time, and it doesn’t</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.550" end="00:07:12.680" style="s2">take up much memory.</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.680" end="00:07:16.520" style="s2">So lots of time, you want to use the shorthand<br />for the thing rather than the thing because</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.520" end="00:07:18.620" style="s2">it’s just too complicated otherwise.</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.620" end="00:07:25.009" style="s2">And then you might say well how do you know<br />your shorthand representation is a good representation</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.009" end="00:07:29.581" style="s2">of the thing you&#39;re trying to represent, and<br />the pragmatists would say well it depends</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.581" end="00:07:31.419" style="s2">on what you want to do with it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.419" end="00:07:33.050" style="s2">That’s the tool-like aspect.</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.050" end="00:07:40.360" style="s2">It’s like if you’re using word X to represent<br />potentially heterogeneous class Y, and when</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.360" end="00:07:44.099" style="s2">you use it, you get to where you&#39;re want or<br />you get close enough to where you want, then</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.099" end="00:07:45.639" style="s2">it’s good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.639" end="00:07:49.729" style="s2">So it’s like how you know a joke is good<br />enough, well someone laughs.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.729" end="00:07:55.319" style="s2">Okay, the joke is good enough, and so one<br />of the things that’s quite interesting about</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.319" end="00:07:59.220" style="s2">the way you interact with the world, and this<br />is something the pragmatists really discovered</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.220" end="00:08:05.229" style="s2">in some sense, was that you&#39;re always aiming<br />at some bounded set of events that’s somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.229" end="00:08:09.490" style="s2">different than the current set of events because<br />otherwise you could just sit there, and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:14.539" style="s2">you put your conceptions to work and your<br />actions to work to manage the transformation,</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.539" end="00:08:19.030" style="s2">and if you manage the transformation, then<br />it’s good enough.</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.030" end="00:08:21.490" style="s2">You don’t have to go any farther than that.</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.490" end="00:08:26.360" style="s2">So that explains partly how you can maneuver<br />in the world with limited knowledge.</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.360" end="00:08:33.500" style="s2">You use low resolution representations to<br />partially hit vague goals, and that generally</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.500" end="00:08:34.500" style="s2">gets you there.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.500" end="00:08:41.270" style="s2">That process was called satisficing by - now<br />what’s his name, an extraordinarily famous</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.270" end="00:08:43.600" style="s2">economist and psychologist.</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.600" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">Anyone remember who coined the word satisficing?</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:48.810" style="s2">Well, an economist psychologist would be Herb<br />Simon.</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.810" end="00:08:50.380" style="s2">That’s right, it’s Simon.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.380" end="00:08:54.970" style="s2">It was Herb Simon, and you know he said well,<br />you’re often not out to optimize.</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.970" end="00:08:59.390" style="s2">Let’s say in a search for a partner, to<br />optimize it you’d have to search through</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.390" end="00:09:00.720" style="s2">several billion people.</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.720" end="00:09:04.170" style="s2">Well you’re not gonna do that because you<br />don’t have the time.</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.170" end="00:09:08.541" style="s2">So then you might say well, you don’t know<br />exactly how to do it but it’s something</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.541" end="00:09:09.970" style="s2">this.</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.970" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">You have five attributes that you’re looking<br />for and maybe two that you don’t know you’re</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:17.410" style="s2">looking for but you are looking for, and the<br />first person that comes along that matches</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.410" end="00:09:20.020" style="s2">those well enough, you pick.</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.020" end="00:09:25.660" style="s2">So it’s not an optimization issue, but given<br />that you have a limited amount of time, you</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.660" end="00:09:27.330" style="s2">can’t wait around for optimized solutions.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.330" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">You have to go ahead with sufficient, and<br />then move to the next issue.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:41.390" style="s2">Okay, so all that’s a conceptual precursor<br />for taking a look at this diagram.</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.390" end="00:09:43.340" style="s2">So we’re calling someone a good person.</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.340" end="00:09:44.340" style="s2">So what does it mean?</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.340" end="00:09:45.930" style="s2">Well we’re going to do a bit of a microanalysis.</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.930" end="00:09:49.580" style="s2">We’re going to assume it’s a bit of a<br />shorthand, low resolution representation of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.580" end="00:09:52.630" style="s2">the person and that you can decompose it.</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.630" end="00:09:57.310" style="s2">If someone says X is a - Henry is a good person,<br />and maybe he’s 45.</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.310" end="00:09:59.420" style="s2">You might say does he have children?</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.420" end="00:10:00.430" style="s2">Then you might say yes.</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.430" end="00:10:03.520" style="s2">Then you might say well is he a good parent<br />because you might assume that if he’s a</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.520" end="00:10:05.690" style="s2">good person, he might be a good parent.</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.690" end="00:10:10.030" style="s2">Now it’s conceivable that he can be a good<br />parent without being a good parent if he was</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.030" end="00:10:12.630" style="s2">good at five other important things.</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.630" end="00:10:16.440" style="s2">But let’s assume as a good person he’s<br />also a good parent.</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.440" end="00:10:21.130" style="s2">I think it’s reasonable to assume that good<br />parent would be a subset of good person, right,</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.130" end="00:10:23.130" style="s2">because it’s more specific.</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.130" end="00:10:28.920" style="s2">More specific means it covers less time and<br />space in some sense because good person is</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.920" end="00:10:33.140" style="s2">a description of a person that covers how<br />the person interacts with the world across</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.140" end="00:10:36.760" style="s2">the broadest possible amount of time and location.</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.760" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">And then good parent, well you can find that<br />out when they’re interacting with children</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:42.850" style="s2">let’s say for the sake of argument.</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.850" end="00:10:46.750" style="s2">There’s other issues, and then you might<br />say well if he’s a good parent what does</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.750" end="00:10:49.660" style="s2">he have to do to be a good parent?</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.660" end="00:10:53.670" style="s2">Well he has to feed his children so he probably<br />needs a job, and it would be better if it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.670" end="00:10:54.670" style="s2">was a good job.</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.670" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">So he’s got a good job and that’s part<br />of being a good person.</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:05.810" style="s2">And then maybe he can care for his family<br />and so care might be regarded as a more specific</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.810" end="00:11:11.980" style="s2">subset of good parent, and so you can decompose<br />caring to, let’s say, play with baby, and</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.980" end="00:11:17.940" style="s2">then you can decompose play into - well I<br />decomposed it into peek, tickle, and clean.</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.940" end="00:11:22.450" style="s2">What’s interesting about this is those are<br />all abstractions, but once you get down to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.450" end="00:11:26.680" style="s2">a high enough level of resolution, they’re<br />no longer abstractions in that they’re actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.680" end="00:11:28.690" style="s2">actions you undertake in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.690" end="00:11:31.330" style="s2">Moving your hand is not an abstraction.</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.330" end="00:11:35.750" style="s2">So at some point - and this is a nice elegant<br />solution to the mind body problem to some</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.750" end="00:11:36.750" style="s2">degree.</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.750" end="00:11:41.930" style="s2">At some level of resolution - high resolution<br />- it stops being conceptual and starts being</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.930" end="00:11:45.250" style="s2">action, and that&#39;s where the mind hits the<br />world.</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.250" end="00:11:50.190" style="s2">If you go into an even higher level of resolution<br />than that, like what do you have to do to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.190" end="00:11:51.350" style="s2">move your hand?</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.350" end="00:11:53.730" style="s2">The answer to that is you don’t know.</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.730" end="00:11:54.740" style="s2">You just do it.</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.740" end="00:11:59.800" style="s2">And so your consciousness bottoms out, in<br />some sense, at the level of motor activity.</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.800" end="00:12:04.420" style="s2">So there’s a level above which you can’t<br />perceive which are the networks that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.420" end="00:12:10.400" style="s2">involved in and there’s a level below which<br />you can’t perceive, which is under normal</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.400" end="00:12:16.150" style="s2">circumstances, procedural control which is<br />whatever enables you to actually move.</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.150" end="00:12:21.130" style="s2">So then you might say well what are all of<br />these things.</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.130" end="00:12:24.130" style="s2">How would you conceptualize a decomposed good<br />person.</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.130" end="00:12:27.400" style="s2">Well then you might say well what are all<br />these things made out of?</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.400" end="00:12:29.550" style="s2">In a sense, what are their constituent elements?</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.550" end="00:12:33.050" style="s2">Good person, good parent, family care, play<br />with baby.</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.050" end="00:12:34.240" style="s2">They&#39;re sort of like games.</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.240" end="00:12:35.370" style="s2">They&#39;re sort of like stories.</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.370" end="00:12:37.170" style="s2">They&#39;re sort of like rituals.</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.170" end="00:12:43.370" style="s2">I think about them in these terms, so if you<br />look at - that’s where we get to this particular</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.370" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">diagram which we’re gonna concentrate on<br />quite a bit.</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:13:11.130" style="s2">Let me shift to it and we’ll talk about<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.130" end="00:13:28.040" style="s2">Now I don’t exactly know how to - what to<br />call this thing.</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.040" end="00:13:34.170" style="s2">I think the best way of thinking about it<br />is it’s a subpersonality and that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.170" end="00:13:38.070" style="s2">I call it a subpersonality is because only<br />a personality has all the attributes that</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.070" end="00:13:40.960" style="s2">this thing has and so the attributes are.</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.960" end="00:13:45.680" style="s2">I talked to you last week about the fact that<br />the Russian neuropsychologist for example</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.680" end="00:13:50.550" style="s2">felt that people had to build models of the<br />world and so you can call this a model of</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.550" end="00:13:52.820" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.820" end="00:13:58.240" style="s2">So the reason they suspected that was because<br />if you brought someone - I think I ran through</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.240" end="00:14:02.190" style="s2">this - if you bring someone into a laboratory<br />and you play them a tone, when they first</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.190" end="00:14:07.520" style="s2">hear the tone they manifest an orienting reflex<br />which is a change in skin conduction, and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.520" end="00:14:10.500" style="s2">that’s actually a consequence of neurological<br />activity.</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.500" end="00:14:14.290" style="s2">And then if you play the tone a bunch, they<br />stop having the reaction and then if you vary</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.290" end="00:14:23.130" style="s2">the tone on any perceptible dimension, the<br />orienting reflex returns, and so the inference</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.130" end="00:14:31.390" style="s2">from that is obviously the person must be<br />constructing a model of the tone because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.390" end="00:14:35.620" style="s2">how would they know if something deviated<br />from it, especially on all those dimensions.</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.620" end="00:14:40.780" style="s2">So not only is it a model, it’s a multi-dimensional<br />model.</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.780" end="00:14:45.890" style="s2">Okay, now the upshot of that is for a long<br />time, people tried to figure out how in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.890" end="00:14:49.750" style="s2">world we model the world, and then they tried<br />to figure out how to make smart machines that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.750" end="00:14:54.660" style="s2">modeled the world that could then plan their<br />actions in the modeled world and then could</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.660" end="00:14:56.290" style="s2">act in the world as a consequence.</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.290" end="00:15:00.930" style="s2">They got nowhere with that because it turned<br />out that the world is so damn complex that</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.930" end="00:15:04.020" style="s2">if you’re gonna model it, you’re gonna<br />spend all the time modeling.</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.020" end="00:15:07.240" style="s2">You’re not gonna spend your time acting<br />in it and you’re not gonna get anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.240" end="00:15:11.930" style="s2">It’s partly because the world is almost<br />infinitely complex, and so if you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.930" end="00:15:16.060" style="s2">to get a computer to look at the world, you<br />might say well what is the computer supposed</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.060" end="00:15:17.240" style="s2">to look at?</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.240" end="00:15:18.240" style="s2">Everything.</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.240" end="00:15:19.750" style="s2">Well, no.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.750" end="00:15:25.910" style="s2">I mean, you look at a lot in some ways, and<br />not very much in others, and half your brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.910" end="00:15:28.840" style="s2">is dedicated, roughly speaking, to visual<br />processing.</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.840" end="00:15:32.260" style="s2">Then you’ve got your other senses to help<br />you figure out what’s going on.</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.260" end="00:15:34.540" style="s2">But you don’t build a model of the whole<br />world.</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.540" end="00:15:37.540" style="s2">You don’t build any model at all of the<br />parts of the world that aren’t relevant</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.540" end="00:15:38.560" style="s2">to you.</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.560" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">For example, your model of this floor is very<br />low resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.560" end="00:15:47.270" style="s2">If I took you guys out in the hallway, assuming<br />the hallway floor isn&#39;t the same color and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.270" end="00:15:49.450" style="s2">I said, what was the color of this floor.</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.450" end="00:15:52.620" style="s2">You would not be able to tell me, and the<br />reason for that is who cares.</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.620" end="00:15:57.260" style="s2">It could be shifting color all the time while<br />you’re sitting here, you know, subtly, and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.260" end="00:15:58.260" style="s2">you’re not gonna care.</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.260" end="00:16:01.670" style="s2">The reason for that is you’re not falling<br />through it, and it isn’t moving.</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.670" end="00:16:05.930" style="s2">So it’s like an invisible presupposition<br />of your current knowledge structure.</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.930" end="00:16:08.900" style="s2">And there&#39;s all sorts of things going on around<br />you that are like that.</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.900" end="00:16:10.660" style="s2">You don&#39;t pay attention to the walls.</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.660" end="00:16:13.660" style="s2">You really don&#39;t pay attention to the people<br />that are around you.</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.660" end="00:16:16.210" style="s2">They could sort themselves in a different<br />way.</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.210" end="00:16:18.530" style="s2">You wouldn&#39;t notice unless you know the person.</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.530" end="00:16:21.520" style="s2">There&#39;s also all sorts of things that you<br />don&#39;t model.</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.520" end="00:16:25.460" style="s2">Now you’ve all seen the invisible gorilla<br />video, I presume.</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.460" end="00:16:26.920" style="s2">Everyone’s seen that.</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.920" end="00:16:30.470" style="s2">Is there anyone here who hasn&#39;t seen that<br />video.</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.470" end="00:16:31.470" style="s2">Okay good.</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.470" end="00:16:32.470" style="s2">So that’s something eh.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.470" end="00:16:35.700" style="s2">It’s really something that there&#39;s a psychology<br />experiment that&#39;s so well known you can talk</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.700" end="00:16:37.910" style="s2">to a crowd now and almost everyone’s seen<br />it.</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.910" end="00:16:38.960" style="s2">It’s so shocking.</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.960" end="00:16:42.560" style="s2">It’s like, of course I can see a gorilla<br />if one was dancing around on a basketball</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.560" end="00:16:43.560" style="s2">court.</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.560" end="00:16:45.030" style="s2">It’s like, ha no you wouldn’t.</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.030" end="00:16:47.410" style="s2">Or there&#39;s a fifty percent chance you wouldn’t.</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.410" end="00:16:54.490" style="s2">Now the reason for that is, fundamentally<br />speaking, is you&#39;re given a task when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.490" end="00:16:59.330" style="s2">watch that video, and the task is to count<br />the number of times the ball is thrown by</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.330" end="00:17:01.870" style="s2">the team in black.</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.870" end="00:17:06.920" style="s2">All of a sudden, your perceptual systems reorient<br />themselves and you&#39;re not really looking at</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.920" end="00:17:07.920" style="s2">people.</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.920" end="00:17:13.760" style="s2">You’re looking at something that might be<br />animated stick figures who are engaged, momentarily,</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.760" end="00:17:19.020" style="s2">in moving the object of perceptual importance<br />around.</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.020" end="00:17:22.770" style="s2">So you can blur them out, which you do because<br />obviously you can’t tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.770" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">between a gorilla and the person dressed in<br />black.</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:28.430" style="s2">The reason you can’t is you don&#39;t need to.</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.430" end="00:17:35.020" style="s2">In order to fulfill the task, you can treat<br />all the people like vaguely moving black objects,</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.020" end="00:17:39.400" style="s2">and as long as that doesn&#39;t interfere with<br />your counting, then it’s irrelevant.</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.400" end="00:17:43.070" style="s2">So actually, you don’t build a model of<br />the whole world.</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.070" end="00:17:47.730" style="s2">And you build a model of only the parts of<br />the world that are relevant to your ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.730" end="00:17:48.730" style="s2">micro action.</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.730" end="00:17:53.060" style="s2">Now the problem that brings up is how do you<br />know what’s relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.060" end="00:17:55.640" style="s2">Well that’s a tough question.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.640" end="00:18:01.010" style="s2">I would say, the reason you know what’s<br />relevant is because some things don’t change</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.010" end="00:18:05.650" style="s2">over time, and you’ve been evolving through<br />three and a half billion years.</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.650" end="00:18:08.150" style="s2">So you’ve built yourself.</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.150" end="00:18:13.300" style="s2">If we go back to that other diagram, you can<br />imagine the levels there from the micro activities</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.300" end="00:18:15.320" style="s2">to the abstractions.</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.320" end="00:18:19.660" style="s2">You think about how much building had to go<br />in so you could undertake those microactions.</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.660" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">So like, here you can move your hand.</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.650" end="00:18:23.220" style="s2">Well that’s great.</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.220" end="00:18:26.020" style="s2">How do you get the hand?</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.020" end="00:18:28.260" style="s2">Well, you know, it took a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.260" end="00:18:32.510" style="s2">It took almost all of the three and a half<br />billion years before you managed to come up</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.510" end="00:18:34.000" style="s2">with a hand.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.000" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">So, even underneath the microactions, there&#39;s<br />this massive evolutionary history that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:45.780" style="s2">built up partially as a consequence of some<br />of the unchanging features of the environment,</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.780" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">or at least in consequence to some of the<br />slower changing features of the environment</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:55.170" style="s2">that has given you this incredibly complex<br />body that’s really good at doing some things</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.170" end="00:18:57.800" style="s2">and not really good at doing other things<br />at all.</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.800" end="00:19:01.940" style="s2">And so, that’s how you solve the relevance<br />problem, and I actually think it’s one of</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.940" end="00:19:07.170" style="s2">the most powerful arguments for the necessity<br />of evolutionary theory.</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.170" end="00:19:11.590" style="s2">It’s like this problem is so complex because<br />it’s not only how you have to adapt to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.590" end="00:19:13.070" style="s2">environment across time.</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.070" end="00:19:15.380" style="s2">So you have to build a body that adapts to<br />the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.380" end="00:19:16.620" style="s2">It’s worse than that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.620" end="00:19:19.340" style="s2">It’s like the train passing through the<br />box.</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.340" end="00:19:20.840" style="s2">The environment is not stable.</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.840" end="00:19:25.550" style="s2">It keeps shifting and turning and moving and<br />twisting, and so not only do you have to adapt</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.550" end="00:19:35.090" style="s2">to the environment, you have to adapt flexibly<br />to the environment while it transforms itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.090" end="00:19:40.570" style="s2">at different levels of totality because sometimes<br />there’s minor changes to the environment.</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.570" end="00:19:45.050" style="s2">Sometimes a meteor hits the Earth and we’re<br />plunged into darkness for four years, or there’s</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.050" end="00:19:46.670" style="s2">an ice age or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.670" end="00:19:52.120" style="s2">So the levels of transformation in the environment<br />can be radical and the evolutionary process</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.120" end="00:19:53.780" style="s2">has to keep up with that.</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.780" end="00:19:57.670" style="s2">The way it works, apparently, like I don’t<br />believe this is the whole story although it’s</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.670" end="00:20:02.840" style="s2">more or less the whole Darwinian story is<br />that something more or less works and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.840" end="00:20:08.010" style="s2">a million copies of itself and there&#39;s tiny<br />variations in those copies often at least</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.010" end="00:20:12.590" style="s2">in principle because of copying error which<br />is where I think the theory is weak.</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.590" end="00:20:15.050" style="s2">And then they all die except for two.</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.050" end="00:20:19.890" style="s2">And so, why didn&#39;t those die, and the answer<br />is well they happened by chance to vary in</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.890" end="00:20:24.410" style="s2">the direction that the environment varied<br />and so they get to continue and so the reason</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.410" end="00:20:28.010" style="s2">evolution works is that everything dies.</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.010" end="00:20:32.560" style="s2">Everything fails because you think well, keeping<br />up with a randomly changing environment is</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.560" end="00:20:34.860" style="s2">impossible, so how do you do it?</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.860" end="00:20:36.840" style="s2">Well you do a million things.</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.840" end="00:20:42.900" style="s2">Most of them don&#39;t work, but you only have<br />to succeed enough to propagate yourself once.</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.900" end="00:20:49.020" style="s2">Now, so I think that that’s not exactly<br />right because I don&#39;t believe that our understanding</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.020" end="00:20:50.320" style="s2">of evolution is complete.</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.320" end="00:20:52.010" style="s2">There’s a bunch of things that I don&#39;t believe<br />in.</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.010" end="00:20:55.340" style="s2">One is DNA is pretty damn complex.</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.340" end="00:21:00.040" style="s2">It’s not obvious how it could have evolved,<br />and even the people who discovered DNA were</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.040" end="00:21:03.000" style="s2">very very complexed that it existed.</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:06.302" style="s2">So one of them - and I told you this - thought<br />that it came from outer space and that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.302" end="00:21:08.500" style="s2">had evolved from somewhere else.</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.500" end="00:21:15.560" style="s2">You might think about that as crazy theory<br />but cosmic winds, like solar winds and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.560" end="00:21:21.680" style="s2">kind of thing, can propel tiny things vast<br />distances relatively rapidly, and over 13.5</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.680" end="00:21:24.430" style="s2">billion years you can really get around.</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.430" end="00:21:30.150" style="s2">I think the estimates, even if you used sub<br />- if you used transportation methods that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.150" end="00:21:33.950" style="s2">are about the speed that we have, you can<br />colonize the whole galaxy in some like 20</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.950" end="00:21:37.100" style="s2">million years because it’s exponential.</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.100" end="00:21:43.020" style="s2">20 million years is a tiny tiny subset of<br />3.5 billion years so it’s not as far fetched</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.020" end="00:21:44.020" style="s2">as it sounds.</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.020" end="00:21:45.850" style="s2">The problem is it doesn&#39;t address the problem.</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.850" end="00:21:48.720" style="s2">Okay it came from somewhere else, but how<br />did it get there?</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.720" end="00:21:50.670" style="s2">It just pushes the problem back.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.670" end="00:21:55.991" style="s2">But there&#39;s this other issue too which is<br />called epigenesis, and that&#39;s really put an</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.991" end="00:22:00.640" style="s2">old spoke in the scientific wheels in the<br />last twenty years because the theory was,</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.640" end="00:22:08.130" style="s2">twenty years ago, that all evolution preceded<br />through random mutation, and it was random.</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.130" end="00:22:12.510" style="s2">But it turns out that&#39;s not exactly right<br />because there had been a number of demonstrations</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.510" end="00:22:18.400" style="s2">that if something happens to generation A,<br />that will produce a transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.400" end="00:22:25.040" style="s2">genetic information that&#39;s transferred to<br />generation B. And the transformation often</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.040" end="00:22:31.030" style="s2">seems not merely as a consequence of damage,<br />but actually a form of adaptation to the new</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.030" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">environment.</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:39.610" style="s2">Now that’s a tough one, like twenty years<br />ago when I was studying evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.610" end="00:22:44.810" style="s2">and evolutionary biology, if someone would<br />have said, well you can transmit acquired</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.810" end="00:22:49.550" style="s2">characteristics, it would have been like you’re<br />over there with the creationists because that</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.550" end="00:22:50.550" style="s2">was no go.</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.550" end="00:22:52.000" style="s2">That was against the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.000" end="00:22:57.010" style="s2">But it does happen, and the fact that epigenesis<br />happens at all means that there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.010" end="00:22:59.680" style="s2">things about how DNA works that we don&#39;t know.</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.680" end="00:23:06.660" style="s2">I actually think what&#39;s happening is that<br />DNA is a very very complex microcomputer,</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.660" end="00:23:10.030" style="s2">and I don’t know exactly how it operates,<br />maybe it’s a quantum computer.</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.030" end="00:23:11.540" style="s2">It’s very complex.</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.540" end="00:23:15.770" style="s2">Remember it’s had three and a half billion<br />years to figure out what&#39;s going on, and it’s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.770" end="00:23:17.200" style="s2">pretty good at surviving.</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.200" end="00:23:22.290" style="s2">So you don’t want to underestimate it, and<br />the structures it builds at the molecular</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.290" end="00:23:27.750" style="s2">level are so complex it just - if you - there’s<br />some great animations of those things going</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.750" end="00:23:29.390" style="s2">on at the molecular level on the net.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.390" end="00:23:34.010" style="s2">They&#39;re so complex that you can&#39;t help but<br />think of them as computational when you watch</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.010" end="00:23:35.010" style="s2">them.</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.010" end="00:23:36.300" style="s2">They&#39;re not random processes man.</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.300" end="00:23:42.920" style="s2">Like I watched the little molecule that checks<br />for error in a DNA replication string.</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.920" end="00:23:48.930" style="s2">I mean, it checks for errors in a DNA replication<br />string man.</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.930" end="00:23:53.420" style="s2">To figure out how it does something like that<br />without some form of computation strikes me</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.420" end="00:23:54.780" style="s2">as impossible.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.780" end="00:23:59.730" style="s2">Anyways I think what happens is that over<br />time the DNA plays, like it can manifest itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.730" end="00:24:03.780" style="s2">in many different forms and it also capitalizes<br />on mutation.</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.780" end="00:24:05.530" style="s2">I think that&#39;s how it works.</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.530" end="00:24:10.960" style="s2">Now you know there&#39;s other I’d say kind<br />of weak evidence for that.</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.960" end="00:24:15.890" style="s2">Maybe it’s only evidence by analogy but<br />if I take one of you and I put you in a radically</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.890" end="00:24:20.880" style="s2">new environment, new genes will turn on in<br />your brain and code for new proteins and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.880" end="00:24:25.320" style="s2">it’s like you&#39;re sitting there but in some<br />sense there’s a whole set of potential yous</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.320" end="00:24:26.320" style="s2">that are sitting there.</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.320" end="00:24:30.050" style="s2">A lot of that potential is actually locked<br />in the genetic code.</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.050" end="00:24:34.309" style="s2">I mean, it’s dependant on the information<br />that&#39;s in the environment around it cause</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.309" end="00:24:37.860" style="s2">it’s not all in the code but it’s enough<br />to get the process started.</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.860" end="00:24:42.790" style="s2">So if I take you out of situation A and put<br />you in situation B, you build new brain structures</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.790" end="00:24:44.200" style="s2">at the microlevel.</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.200" end="00:24:46.090" style="s2">So you’re actually a different person.</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.090" end="00:24:49.830" style="s2">That&#39;s actually a very interesting way of<br />thinking about the consequences of something</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.830" end="00:24:51.400" style="s2">like exposure in psychotherapy.</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.400" end="00:24:55.920" style="s2">It’s like okay, you&#39;re all timid and there&#39;s<br />eighteen things you&#39;re terrified of.</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.920" end="00:24:57.510" style="s2">You go out and master one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.510" end="00:25:00.710" style="s2">It’s like poof, your brain is the not the<br />same.</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.710" end="00:25:01.800" style="s2">Maybe you&#39;re a little braver.</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.800" end="00:25:05.660" style="s2">And then you go master another one, and a<br />bunch more of you turns on.</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.660" end="00:25:10.600" style="s2">Now I don&#39;t know if one thing turns on, something<br />else turns off.</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.600" end="00:25:14.450" style="s2">You know what I mean is that there&#39;s only<br />so much of you that can be turned on at any</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.450" end="00:25:22.420" style="s2">one time, but maybe a lot of more you can<br />be turned on than is turned on, so.</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.420" end="00:25:26.650" style="s2">I think it looks like that because people<br />who really challenge themselves across the</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.650" end="00:25:30.400" style="s2">span of their life, they develop talents in<br />multiple directions.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.400" end="00:25:39.010" style="s2">People can really be amazingly good at a ridiculous<br />number of things.</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.010" end="00:25:48.580" style="s2">Okay so, Sokolov and Vinogradova showed that<br />you model the world right down to the finest</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.580" end="00:25:55.670" style="s2">details, but then Dan Simon and his crew showed<br />“No you don’t, you’re so blind you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.670" end="00:25:56.670" style="s2">even believe it.”</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.670" end="00:26:03.020" style="s2">It’s like okay, those are not the same set<br />of facts, so how do we reconcile that?</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.020" end="00:26:07.020" style="s2">Well here’s one way of getting a bit of<br />sense of it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.020" end="00:26:08.570" style="s2">Look straight ahead.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.570" end="00:26:15.210" style="s2">Okay, now concentrate not on what you see<br />in the middle of your vision but at the sides.</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.210" end="00:26:18.000" style="s2">It’s probably better if you look at a person<br />to do that, but it doesn’t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.000" end="00:26:19.000" style="s2">though.</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.000" end="00:26:23.940" style="s2">So look straight ahead but pay attention to<br />what you see in the periphery.</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.940" end="00:26:29.500" style="s2">So I can tell you what you’ll see because<br />some of it is very difficult to detect.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.500" end="00:26:33.050" style="s2">Way out in the periphery, it’s black and<br />white.</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.050" end="00:26:34.630" style="s2">You can&#39;t tell that though.</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.630" end="00:26:38.220" style="s2">But we know that because if we change colors<br />way out in the periphery on you, you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.220" end="00:26:39.750" style="s2">detect a change.</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.750" end="00:26:44.420" style="s2">And then out to about here, if something isn&#39;t<br />moving, it’s almost impossible to see it.</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.420" end="00:26:47.720" style="s2">But as soon as it moves, you can see that<br />there’s something moving.</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.720" end="00:26:49.740" style="s2">Sort of like dinosaur vision.</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.740" end="00:26:52.140" style="s2">Remember Jurassic Park?</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.140" end="00:26:54.530" style="s2">Don’t move because the dinosaur can see<br />you.</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.530" end="00:26:59.371" style="s2">It’s like well, you have dinosaur movement<br />detector still built into your nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.371" end="00:27:05.380" style="s2">And the answer is why, and the answer is well<br />if you can&#39;t afford to have a lot of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.380" end="00:27:10.841" style="s2">brain wired up in the periphery of your vision<br />because your head is only so big, then you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.841" end="00:27:15.200" style="s2">have to concentrate on only those things that<br />are most likely to be relevant.</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.200" end="00:27:19.270" style="s2">And moving things are more likely to be relevant<br />because they can eat you.</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.270" end="00:27:23.309" style="s2">Moving things are more likely to be relevant<br />than stationary things especially if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.309" end="00:27:27.310" style="s2">been in the environment for a while right,<br />because if you&#39;re in here it’s like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.310" end="00:27:30.890" style="s2">stationary things are going to stay stationary<br />so you can ignore them.</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.890" end="00:27:35.950" style="s2">You don&#39;t even have to see them, but the moving<br />things, they’re transforming at a time rate</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.950" end="00:27:39.059" style="s2">that’s relevant to you so it’s good to<br />be able to detect those.</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.059" end="00:27:45.050" style="s2">Now the periphery of your vision is actually<br />wired in more directly to your - to the lower</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.050" end="00:27:47.340" style="s2">levels of your nervous system.</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.340" end="00:27:52.081" style="s2">So it can trigger off things like startle<br />reflexes which are very rapid, and it can</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.081" end="00:27:56.990" style="s2">also trigger an orienting response which is<br />the movement of your sensory systems in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.990" end="00:28:01.910" style="s2">direction of the stimulus so if something<br />over here moves, then you go like that, and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.910" end="00:28:04.920" style="s2">then what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re nailing it<br />with your central vision.</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.920" end="00:28:09.840" style="s2">Now, out in your peripheral vision, if you<br />follow the optical tract back to your brain,</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.840" end="00:28:17.400" style="s2">you&#39;ll see the peripheral retinal nerves don&#39;t<br />attach to a tremendous number of visual cortex</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.400" end="00:28:23.980" style="s2">neurons, but the central ones do so each of<br />the central neurons in your central vision</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.980" end="00:28:24.980" style="s2">- the fovea.</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.980" end="00:28:30.330" style="s2">Each one of those is connected to ten thousand<br />neurons at the first level of elaboration,</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.330" end="00:28:33.660" style="s2">and then each neuron is connected to about<br />ten thousand other neurons.</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.660" end="00:28:39.250" style="s2">So it’s ten thousand to the ten thousandth<br />two neurons in and so a lot of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.250" end="00:28:44.460" style="s2">is focusing on that tiny little pinpoint that<br />you use that’s foveal vision, and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.460" end="00:28:50.780" style="s2">to be about big enough so that you can bring<br />a face into high resolution in the center</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.780" end="00:28:54.430" style="s2">and you can track the movement of the various<br />elements of the faces.</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.430" end="00:28:58.900" style="s2">If you look at someone and you look about<br />eighteen inches to their left or to their</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.900" end="00:29:02.420" style="s2">right, you&#39;ll see that you can&#39;t see their<br />nose anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.420" end="00:29:05.429" style="s2">You see kind of a vague outline of their face.</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.429" end="00:29:06.860" style="s2">You can still see the color.</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.860" end="00:29:10.980" style="s2">You can detect their eyebrows, and you can<br />detect their mouth especially if their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.980" end="00:29:12.600" style="s2">moves or their eyes move.</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.600" end="00:29:15.370" style="s2">You just zero in on that right away.</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.370" end="00:29:21.120" style="s2">What’s happening is that way out here, your<br />vision is incredibly low resolution and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.120" end="00:29:27.310" style="s2">resolution increases to the center where it’s<br />very very high, and then there&#39;s some tweaks</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.310" end="00:29:31.650" style="s2">like okay you can&#39;t really see out here, but<br />you can see motion, and that&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.650" end="00:29:34.870" style="s2">because as soon as something moves, you can<br />turn your head cause you can turn your head</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.870" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">and your eyes and you can focus that little<br />pinpoint on it and dance around cause that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:41.160" style="s2">what you do with the pinpoint.</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.160" end="00:29:47.570" style="s2">It moves around very rapidly, and you can<br />scan that central area with high resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.570" end="00:29:51.860" style="s2">So it’s an efficient use of limited resources.</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.860" end="00:29:57.150" style="s2">So partly the way that you manage in the world<br />which is very very complicated, is that even</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.150" end="00:29:59.820" style="s2">your senses simplify it for you.</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.820" end="00:30:04.950" style="s2">There&#39;s only - you can&#39;t see the entire spectrum<br />of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.950" end="00:30:06.750" style="s2">You can only see the visual light spectrum.</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.750" end="00:30:07.750" style="s2">It’s very narrow.</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.750" end="00:30:10.450" style="s2">There’s a whole range of sounds you can&#39;t<br />hear.</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.450" end="00:30:11.940" style="s2">There&#39;s things you can&#39;t smell.</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.940" end="00:30:15.960" style="s2">So you&#39;re in a box and some things get through,<br />but not everything.</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.960" end="00:30:20.780" style="s2">So that simplifies things for you right off<br />the bat and hypothetically those things you</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.780" end="00:30:25.059" style="s2">do detect or those things where it was necessary<br />for you to detect for you to be here, over</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.059" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">this vast span of time and no doubt there<br />were variants all the way through that tried</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.210" end="00:30:33.540" style="s2">to parse it up differently - slightly differently<br />- and that didn&#39;t work out as well so they</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.540" end="00:30:34.790" style="s2">aren&#39;t around.</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.790" end="00:30:39.720" style="s2">So you’re around because of death and replication.</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.720" end="00:30:45.700" style="s2">So it’s an interesting take on death, eh,<br />because you&#39;re the product of an unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.700" end="00:30:47.130" style="s2">number of deaths.</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.130" end="00:30:53.750" style="s2">Right, because all of those experiments had<br />to take place in some sense for you to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.750" end="00:30:55.100" style="s2">here at all.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.100" end="00:31:03.160" style="s2">So anyways, okay, then, so you can see with<br />your central vision that you focus in on one</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.160" end="00:31:09.600" style="s2">point and you reduce the others to low resolution<br />representations, maybe even cartoons, and</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.600" end="00:31:13.160" style="s2">then I also think, although I don&#39;t know this<br />for sure and someone has undoubtedly done</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.160" end="00:31:14.160" style="s2">the work.</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.160" end="00:31:20.280" style="s2">My suspicions are that in the periphery, you<br />don&#39;t update - you know how your screen updates.</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.280" end="00:31:23.460" style="s2">It’s sixty cycles a second, something like<br />that.</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.460" end="00:31:28.020" style="s2">You update your vision at about sixty cycles<br />per second, and we know that because if the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.020" end="00:31:32.981" style="s2">screen resolution or if the screen update<br />decreases below sixty cycles a second, people</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.981" end="00:31:34.960" style="s2">can start to see it flicker.</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.960" end="00:31:36.220" style="s2">So we have a refresh rate.</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.220" end="00:31:37.840" style="s2">It’s around sixty hertz.</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.840" end="00:31:45.590" style="s2">Some people can see flicker at higher hertz<br />than that, but most people can&#39;t.</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.590" end="00:31:46.890" style="s2">Sixty is about right.</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.890" end="00:31:52.310" style="s2">So, that&#39;s another way that you deal with<br />the fact that there&#39;s way too much for you</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.310" end="00:31:54.000" style="s2">to deal with.</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.000" end="00:31:58.960" style="s2">Your temporal resolution isn&#39;t very high,<br />you know, so the smallest meaningful event</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.960" end="00:32:01.250" style="s2">for you is about a tenth of a second long.</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.250" end="00:32:05.470" style="s2">Now if you&#39;re in a car accident or you&#39;re<br />in some situation where it’s an emergency</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.470" end="00:32:09.620" style="s2">and you get a massive burst of dopamine, you<br />might be able to speed that processing up</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.620" end="00:32:10.640" style="s2">by a hundredfold.</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.640" end="00:32:11.680" style="s2">Who knows?</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.680" end="00:32:15.010" style="s2">But you&#39;re gonna be absolutely exhausted instantly<br />when you do that.</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.010" end="00:32:18.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever experienced that<br />in a car accident or something like that but</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.370" end="00:32:26.920" style="s2">people often report that time slows down dramatically,<br />but then afterwards they&#39;re just done.</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.920" end="00:32:31.130" style="s2">So the reason you don&#39;t see a thousand times<br />as fast as you do is because you’d have</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.130" end="00:32:32.570" style="s2">to be eating like a hummingbird right.</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.570" end="00:32:37.100" style="s2">You&#39;d need a big vat of nectar attached to<br />you, and you&#39;d just be sipping on it or gulping</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.100" end="00:32:38.830" style="s2">it down nonstop.</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.830" end="00:32:43.240" style="s2">So you&#39;re also restricted in terms of your<br />temporal resolution.</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.240" end="00:32:48.660" style="s2">Okay, well then what else do you do to simplify<br />the world.</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.660" end="00:32:58.429" style="s2">Well this is where the tool concept of concept,<br />the tool concept of concept starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.429" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">useful because you&#39;re actually aiming at things<br />all the time, and I really like the aim metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:10.090" style="s2">because if you understand the metaphor well,<br />it really sheds some light on what human beings</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.090" end="00:33:12.340" style="s2">are like.</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.340" end="00:33:15.960" style="s2">Chimps are hunters, but they&#39;re not hunters<br />like human beings are hunters.</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.960" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">We’re really really good hunters.</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:21.890" style="s2">Chimps, they have to kind of mob an animal<br />and then they’ll tear it apart, and they</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.890" end="00:33:24.090" style="s2">like meat so they’ll definitely do it.</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.090" end="00:33:28.929" style="s2">But human beings have been hunting in an unbelievably<br />sophisticated way for a tremendous amount</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.929" end="00:33:33.740" style="s2">of time, and there&#39;s a bunch of things about<br />us that aren&#39;t like chimps.</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.740" end="00:33:37.960" style="s2">So one is we can throw, and our bodies are<br />built for throwing.</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.960" end="00:33:41.180" style="s2">Now you might think well that&#39;s not that relevant<br />but if something is chasing you through the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.180" end="00:33:45.299" style="s2">bush and you can throw a rock at it, it becomes<br />relevant very quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.299" end="00:33:51.700" style="s2">And so we’re really good at taking projectiles,<br />specifying targets, and hurling the projectiles</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.700" end="00:33:52.830" style="s2">at targets.</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.830" end="00:33:56.420" style="s2">And we can do that with rocks, and we can<br />do it with bows, and we can do it with rifles,</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.420" end="00:33:59.960" style="s2">and we can do it with rifles, and we can do<br />it with nuclear weapons.</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.960" end="00:34:04.190" style="s2">And so there&#39;s something about us that&#39;s obsessed<br />with hitting the middle of the target.</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.190" end="00:34:11.290" style="s2">Now there&#39;s an interesting side note for that<br />which is that the word sin is derived from</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.290" end="00:34:17.070" style="s2">the Greek word “Hamartia,” and hamartia<br />is an archery term to mean to miss the center</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.070" end="00:34:18.790" style="s2">of the target.</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.790" end="00:34:21.300" style="s2">Now that&#39;s something very much worth thinking<br />about.</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.300" end="00:34:23.270" style="s2">It’s a very lovely concordance.</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.270" end="00:34:25.990" style="s2">So we’re built on this hunting platform.</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.990" end="00:34:28.500" style="s2">We can track moving things extraordinarily<br />well.</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.500" end="00:34:30.020" style="s2">We have amazing eyesight.</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.020" end="00:34:34.570" style="s2">Our eyesight’s better than any primate by<br />a huge amount, and better than any other creature</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.570" end="00:34:37.080" style="s2">except for hawks and other birds of prey.</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.080" end="00:34:43.380" style="s2">So, and, we also use - so we have this intense,<br />amazing capacity to zero in and here’s some</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.380" end="00:34:44.680" style="s2">cool things about your eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.680" end="00:34:48.470" style="s2">So, if you look at a gorilla, you’ll see<br />that a gorilla doesn&#39;t really have whites</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.470" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">in their eyes, and you might think well that&#39;s<br />kind of weird because we do, and so what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:54.230" style="s2">the hypothesis?</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.230" end="00:34:59.760" style="s2">Well, if I’m looking at somebody at the<br />back of the room, I can tell if they&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.760" end="00:35:01.550" style="s2">at my eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.550" end="00:35:05.430" style="s2">If they&#39;re looking at my nose, it’s almost<br />as if their face just gets a little bit vaguer</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.430" end="00:35:06.430" style="s2">like we’re not communicating.</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.430" end="00:35:08.990" style="s2">It’s eye to eye contact.</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.990" end="00:35:15.359" style="s2">So our ability to specify the direction in<br />which another person’s eyes are pointing</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.359" end="00:35:17.130" style="s2">is phenomenal.</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.130" end="00:35:18.860" style="s2">And you might say, well why?</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.860" end="00:35:23.000" style="s2">Well first of all, there’s a lot of expression<br />around the eyes right.</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.000" end="00:35:24.950" style="s2">So you can imagine coevolution.</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.950" end="00:35:28.300" style="s2">The coevolution is sharper and sharper vision.</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.300" end="00:35:33.830" style="s2">Vision associated with detecting eyes and<br />then also more and more evolution for emotional</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.830" end="00:35:36.080" style="s2">expression around the eyes.</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.080" end="00:35:37.760" style="s2">So there&#39;s that.</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.760" end="00:35:41.910" style="s2">But then, the other thing that I wanted - the<br />reason that I would be interested in that</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.910" end="00:35:46.340" style="s2">is because I want to know what the hell you’re<br />up to because maybe you&#39;re a friend and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.340" end="00:35:49.991" style="s2">you&#39;re a foe or maybe you&#39;re interested in<br />something that I should be interested in.</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.991" end="00:35:54.021" style="s2">So we know what people are like in that regard,<br />so you go stand out in the corner and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.021" end="00:35:58.400" style="s2">look up, and soon there are ten people you<br />have around you looking up.</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.400" end="00:35:59.400" style="s2">And why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.400" end="00:36:06.500" style="s2">It’s because when they see where your eyes<br />are pointed and embody you, they think well</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.500" end="00:36:08.020" style="s2">that person - they don’t think this.</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.020" end="00:36:09.840" style="s2">It’s the equivalent of thinking.</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.840" end="00:36:13.290" style="s2">They think well that person must be looking<br />at something interesting because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.290" end="00:36:17.260" style="s2">people look at, and if it’s interesting<br />to them then it’s probably going to be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.260" end="00:36:19.120" style="s2">to me especially if it’s in the sky.</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.120" end="00:36:22.010" style="s2">It’s like what the hell, that’s not supposed<br />to be happening.</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.010" end="00:36:25.600" style="s2">So you&#39;re looking at people’s eyes because<br />you want to know what they&#39;re up to in their</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.600" end="00:36:32.050" style="s2">facial display, which is your face is unbelievably<br />innervated and controllable, both by conscious</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.050" end="00:36:33.710" style="s2">and by unconscious means.</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.710" end="00:36:37.290" style="s2">That tells you what they&#39;re up to, which is<br />why you want to see someone’s face.</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.290" end="00:36:38.780" style="s2">You don&#39;t talk to the back of their head.</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.780" end="00:36:42.119" style="s2">You want to talk to their face, and you don&#39;t<br />like it when they&#39;re looking like this or</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.119" end="00:36:45.500" style="s2">looking like that or failing to make eye contact.</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.500" end="00:36:48.440" style="s2">Although too much eye contact is a predatory<br />stare.</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.440" end="00:36:52.120" style="s2">So you know, you’ve got -<br />Well you’ve got to get the balance right.</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.120" end="00:36:55.690" style="s2">So now, what about the whites of the eyes?</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.690" end="00:36:59.190" style="s2">Well the theory is that the reason we’ve<br />developed whites is because it was easier</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.190" end="00:37:03.609" style="s2">to see where someone’s eyes were pointed<br />if there was a dark circle in a white space,</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.609" end="00:37:08.570" style="s2">and what that basically meant was that all<br />your ancestors who were a little less fortunate</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.570" end="00:37:13.000" style="s2">on the eye white side either didn&#39;t mate or<br />got killed.</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.000" end="00:37:14.690" style="s2">Probably in misunderstandings.</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.690" end="00:37:20.359" style="s2">So, our eyes stand out against this bright<br />white background because that helps us - that</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.359" end="00:37:24.380" style="s2">helps other people detect what we’re up<br />to, and that means we can trust each other</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.380" end="00:37:30.180" style="s2">more easily and we can - even as something<br />as simple as like eye contact in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.180" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">where there’s a possibility of finding a<br />sexual partner is a very important component</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:40.350" style="s2">of that because eye contact indicates interest<br />and it also indicates, at least in principle,</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.350" end="00:37:42.510" style="s2">the possibility of approach.</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.510" end="00:37:48.890" style="s2">And so approach is dopaminergically mediated<br />and it’s a positive emotional state.</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.890" end="00:37:56.050" style="s2">And that’s also why, interestingly enough,<br />if you go into a pharmacy, and there&#39;s a rack</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.050" end="00:37:59.720" style="s2">of magazines, and they&#39;re - what&#39;s on the<br />cover?</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.720" end="00:38:00.730" style="s2">Always.</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.730" end="00:38:01.770" style="s2">Almost always.</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.770" end="00:38:03.290" style="s2">Beautiful women.</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.290" end="00:38:07.660" style="s2">Like on fifty percent of the men’s magazines<br />there&#39;s a beautiful woman and on like a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.660" end="00:38:11.740" style="s2">percent of the women’s magazines which is<br />really interesting you know because you might</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.740" end="00:38:13.830" style="s2">think well why is that?</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.830" end="00:38:18.440" style="s2">Women’s eyes are always looking out in a<br />way that they&#39;re looking at you.</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.440" end="00:38:25.060" style="s2">So there was some interest - so it’s an<br />invocation of interest, and so, you know,</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.060" end="00:38:26.060" style="s2">magazines evolve.</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.060" end="00:38:28.030" style="s2">All the ones that don’t get bought fail.</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.030" end="00:38:31.340" style="s2">And so what’s happened is they&#39;ve all converged<br />to the same point, and the same point is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.340" end="00:38:38.010" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s maximally interesting to<br />a magazine purchaser is a beautiful female</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.010" end="00:38:39.010" style="s2">face.</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.010" end="00:38:40.010" style="s2">Whether it’s male or female.</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.010" end="00:38:43.930" style="s2">Now on the male side, there&#39;s also gadgets<br />of all sorts.</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.930" end="00:38:47.200" style="s2">And that may be that men are more gadgets<br />oriented than women.</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.200" end="00:38:54.100" style="s2">So anyways, and we also know that for example<br />with men, if you show them - this is a funny</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.100" end="00:38:55.910" style="s2">little study.</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.910" end="00:39:01.610" style="s2">So you show them a face of a beautiful woman<br />and her eyes are looking that way, or this</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.610" end="00:39:06.400" style="s2">way or they&#39;re looking right at him, you can<br />check the activity in the dopaminergic center</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.400" end="00:39:11.109" style="s2">in a place called the nucleus accumbens which<br />is the same that cocaine hits.</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.109" end="00:39:13.540" style="s2">Face on eye contact, that thing lights up.</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.540" end="00:39:16.619" style="s2">It lights up even more if she’s wearing<br />a red dress.</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.619" end="00:39:21.940" style="s2">Right, and you can get the same kind of lighting<br />up with a red curvy sports car.</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.940" end="00:39:22.940" style="s2">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.940" end="00:39:29.580" style="s2">So it’s the, you know - my thought when<br />I read that was the perfect situation is like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.580" end="00:39:35.810" style="s2">a beautiful girl dressed in red perched on<br />a sports car, with some cocaine.</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.810" end="00:39:39.750" style="s2">Why red?</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.750" end="00:39:40.930" style="s2">Why red?</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.930" end="00:39:42.369" style="s2">That’s a good question.</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.369" end="00:39:44.680" style="s2">I’m not exactly sure why - oh that&#39;s wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.680" end="00:39:47.930" style="s2">I do know why red.</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.930" end="00:39:50.829" style="s2">Ripe fruit.</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.829" end="00:39:53.000" style="s2">Women have coevolved with ripe fruit.</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.000" end="00:39:55.820" style="s2">It’s very sneaky of you by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.820" end="00:39:57.191" style="s2">So that&#39;s why - you know that too.</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.191" end="00:39:59.760" style="s2">You just have to leaf through a women’s<br />magazine.</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.760" end="00:40:04.090" style="s2">Lipstick is always associated with like apples<br />that are glistening in some way, or a peach</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.090" end="00:40:05.700" style="s2">or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.700" end="00:40:11.760" style="s2">And we were primarily fruit eaters, and the<br />reason we have color vision is to detect fruit,</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.760" end="00:40:13.190" style="s2">ripe fruit.</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.190" end="00:40:17.619" style="s2">So part of the reason that - also part of<br />the reason that fruit turns red or colors</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.619" end="00:40:22.150" style="s2">when it ripens is because the fruit that was<br />successfully eaten by creatures that distributed</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.150" end="00:40:26.530" style="s2">the seeds was the fruit that was ripe when<br />it was eaten.</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.530" end="00:40:31.150" style="s2">So as the color vision evolved, maybe there<br />was a red tint for only god knows what reason,</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.150" end="00:40:35.760" style="s2">then a positive feedback loop developed and<br />fruit got redder and redder, and at the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.760" end="00:40:38.220" style="s2">time, women capitalized on that.</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.220" end="00:40:43.340" style="s2">So that’s partly, I think, what explains<br />the association between Eve and the apple</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.340" end="00:40:48.650" style="s2">in Genesis because Genesis is also a story<br />about gaining sight.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.650" end="00:40:50.260" style="s2">So yeah, that’s why red.</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.260" end="00:40:51.790" style="s2">That’s pretty funny.</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.790" end="00:40:53.940" style="s2">I really think that&#39;s pretty funny.</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.940" end="00:41:00.260" style="s2">You know, evolved sensory significance is<br />absolutely everywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.260" end="00:41:05.369" style="s2">It’s so deep inside of us.</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.369" end="00:41:07.030" style="s2">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.030" end="00:41:09.030" style="s2">I have to wonder about blood too, that seems<br />like it also</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.030" end="00:41:10.030" style="s2">Oh yeah, yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.030" end="00:41:13.700" style="s2">Red’s a significant color, but I think - I<br />mean and it’s funny too because say there’s</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.700" end="00:41:17.099" style="s2">a flushed face, well that means it’s infused<br />with blood.</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.099" end="00:41:18.780" style="s2">It’s also a sign of health.</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.780" end="00:41:21.060" style="s2">It’s also a sign of sexual arousal.</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.060" end="00:41:27.060" style="s2">But it is a sign of health, and so you see<br />in old Coke ads from the 1930’s, the girl’s</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.060" end="00:41:30.349" style="s2">cheeks are so red it looks like she has a<br />fever.</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.349" end="00:41:36.340" style="s2">So it’s a form of sexual signalling that<br />indicates health.</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.340" end="00:41:37.340" style="s2">So that&#39;s another part.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.340" end="00:41:41.150" style="s2">I mean these are multiply determined right,<br />as anything as complex as vision.</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.150" end="00:41:45.320" style="s2">Yeah, and blood means “Hey, maybe don’t<br />go there” or maybe it means there’s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.320" end="00:41:46.320" style="s2">to eat.</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.320" end="00:41:47.320" style="s2">Right, right.</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.320" end="00:41:48.320" style="s2">Yup.</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.320" end="00:41:52.859" style="s2">There was another theory with color sight,<br />and it had to do with people’s facial expressions</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.859" end="00:42:00.030" style="s2">- not expressions but depending on whether<br />you&#39;re angry or aroused.</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.030" end="00:42:04.380" style="s2">Oh definitely, you can see that those things<br />would loop together.</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.380" end="00:42:10.410" style="s2">Once the color vision starts to adapt, the<br />color vision for fruit is way older, I would</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.410" end="00:42:14.580" style="s2">suspect, because when we developed it, we<br />had fur.</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.580" end="00:42:19.540" style="s2">But once the ability’s there and we lose<br />our facial fur, it’s possible to capitalize</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.540" end="00:42:21.990" style="s2">on the ability to detect the signalling.</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.990" end="00:42:26.370" style="s2">And you know, we’re talking about a transformation<br />that&#39;s over about - we were living in trees</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.370" end="00:42:28.590" style="s2">about sixty million years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.590" end="00:42:32.500" style="s2">So the transition between us and them is sixty<br />million years.</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.500" end="00:42:36.180" style="s2">The separation between chimps is about seven.</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.180" end="00:42:45.350" style="s2">And you know, chimp skin is so dark, you’re<br />not gonna get a lot of signalling.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.350" end="00:42:48.250" style="s2">Okay so, back to this little diagram.</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.250" end="00:42:51.320" style="s2">Now here’s the idea.</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.320" end="00:42:57.030" style="s2">This is deeply informed, although I didn&#39;t<br />know it when I was working on these ideas,</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.030" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">this is deeply informed by a guy named Norbert<br />Wiener who was one of the twentieth century’s</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:09.990" style="s2">massive geniuses and a force behind the development<br />of computation.</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.990" end="00:43:11.750" style="s2">So this is a cybernetic model.</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.750" end="00:43:13.610" style="s2">He invented cybernetics.</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.610" end="00:43:19.740" style="s2">Now I didn&#39;t learn this from Norbert Wiener<br />because I learned it from Jeffrey Gray, but</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.740" end="00:43:23.520" style="s2">Jeffrey Gray’s source had learned it from<br />Norbert Wiener way back in the 1940’s.</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.520" end="00:43:28.370" style="s2">In fact there was a convention back in the<br />1940’s that Wiener presented many of his</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.370" end="00:43:32.950" style="s2">ideas at that many psychologists attended,<br />including Jean Piaget.</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.950" end="00:43:37.349" style="s2">So Piaget’s theory is very much influenced<br />by cybernetics as well.</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.349" end="00:43:43.050" style="s2">Many many of the standard psychology cognitive<br />models are cybernetic.</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.050" end="00:43:46.990" style="s2">So they&#39;re grounded in thinking that&#39;s grounded<br />in the engineering thinking and not psychological</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.990" end="00:43:48.170" style="s2">thinking at all.</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.170" end="00:43:49.170" style="s2">Yup.</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.170" end="00:43:53.100" style="s2">Isn’t Humberd’s book called Cybernetics?]</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.100" end="00:43:54.750" style="s2">No, Dianetics.</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.750" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:04.030" style="s2">Okay so, how might you conceptualize the fundamental<br />elements of a personality.</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.030" end="00:44:06.890" style="s2">Well, this is what it looks like to me.</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.890" end="00:44:10.190" style="s2">The first thing is you&#39;re a moving creature.</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.190" end="00:44:11.280" style="s2">So here&#39;s a funny story.</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.280" end="00:44:17.540" style="s2">There&#39;s a little animal whose name I forget,<br />and in its - it’s an ocean animal - in its</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.540" end="00:44:20.380" style="s2">juvenile state, it swims around.</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.380" end="00:44:26.060" style="s2">Okay so in its juvenile state, it has to coordinate<br />its movements and interact with the changing</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.060" end="00:44:27.450" style="s2">environment.</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.450" end="00:44:29.020" style="s2">So it has a brain.</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.020" end="00:44:33.500" style="s2">But when it turns into an adult, it attaches<br />itself to a rock and turns into something</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.500" end="00:44:35.120" style="s2">like a piece of coral.</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.120" end="00:44:38.230" style="s2">It promptly digests its own brain.</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.230" end="00:44:42.440" style="s2">So the issue is unless you don&#39;t really need<br />a brain if you&#39;re not gonna go anywhere right.</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.440" end="00:44:47.390" style="s2">So a brain is a going places thing, and we<br />have a very big brain and so it’s like we’re</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.390" end="00:44:51.960" style="s2">always zooming around doing things, and we&#39;ve<br />got these hands that enable us to manipulate</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.960" end="00:44:53.530" style="s2">things and transform things.</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.530" end="00:44:58.030" style="s2">So the brain is for doing things, it’s not<br />just for perceiving.</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.030" end="00:45:03.030" style="s2">Roughly speaking, the back half of your brain<br />is for perception, the cortical part.</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.030" end="00:45:05.700" style="s2">Mostly visual perception, but some auditory<br />and touch.</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.700" end="00:45:09.880" style="s2">A lot of visual, and the front part is for<br />output.</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.880" end="00:45:11.109" style="s2">Motor action.</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.109" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">And as you proceed - imagine the front part<br />starts halfway here.</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:21.420" style="s2">As you proceed from the midline forward, the<br />action becomes more and more abstract until</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.420" end="00:45:26.170" style="s2">when you&#39;re dealing with the dorsolateral<br />prefrontal cortex, you&#39;re thinking abstractly.</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.170" end="00:45:30.180" style="s2">Now people think that when they&#39;re thinking<br />abstractly, they&#39;re thinking about representations</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.180" end="00:45:35.320" style="s2">of the world because we think about objects,<br />but that isn&#39;t what we’re doing.</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.320" end="00:45:40.230" style="s2">What we’re doing is rehearsing potential<br />schemas of action.</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.230" end="00:45:44.790" style="s2">So we have this abstract space, which you<br />might think about as a duplicate world.</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.790" end="00:45:46.220" style="s2">You have an idea.</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.220" end="00:45:51.580" style="s2">You test the idea like you would test it if<br />you were acting in the world, and the consequence</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.580" end="00:45:56.660" style="s2">of the imaginary testing is if you encounter<br />grief, then you don&#39;t implement the idea in</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.660" end="00:45:57.730" style="s2">the world.</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.730" end="00:46:01.270" style="s2">Now you know, that doesn&#39;t always work because<br />there&#39;s trade offs between short term pleasure</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.270" end="00:46:06.250" style="s2">and long term punishment that makes it complicated,<br />but what seems to have happened is that as</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.250" end="00:46:10.810" style="s2">we&#39;ve evolved, we’re very sneaky creatures<br />you know.</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.810" end="00:46:15.050" style="s2">For billions of years, the only way that you<br />could figure out whether you&#39;re right or wrong</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.050" end="00:46:18.760" style="s2">was to go out and do something, and if you<br />died you were wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.760" end="00:46:24.630" style="s2">But now, you can think about doing something<br />and if the consequence of running the simulation</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.630" end="00:46:28.570" style="s2">in your head is that you die, then you don&#39;t<br />do it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.570" end="00:46:34.910" style="s2">So what you&#39;re basically doing is spinning<br />off multiple potential use in multiple potential</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.910" end="00:46:37.480" style="s2">universes and running them as simulations.</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.480" end="00:46:41.369" style="s2">Now we really do that now because we’ve<br />externalized it onto the computer which is</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.369" end="00:46:44.090" style="s2">what we’re doing with really really complex<br />video games.</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.090" end="00:46:45.960" style="s2">So it’s so smart.</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.960" end="00:46:48.710" style="s2">It’s an amazing evolutionary advance.</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.710" end="00:46:54.070" style="s2">Now it doesn&#39;t work that well because sometimes<br />you run the simulation and you think, this</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.070" end="00:46:58.590" style="s2">is a stupid idea, and you promptly have eight<br />beers so that you can go do it.</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.590" end="00:47:04.390" style="s2">But, all things considered, that’s still<br />what this abstract space is for.</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.390" end="00:47:08.850" style="s2">I should tell you something about this too<br />because you&#39;re gonna hear from neuropsychologists</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.850" end="00:47:14.119" style="s2">that a lot of what the dorsolateral prefrontal<br />cortex does is - the cortex in general - is</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.119" end="00:47:16.930" style="s2">impulse control, and that’s wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.930" end="00:47:19.210" style="s2">That is not what it does.</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.210" end="00:47:24.280" style="s2">And part of the reason I know this is because<br />the correlation between prefrontal cortical</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.280" end="00:47:29.180" style="s2">cognitive ability which is very tightly associated<br />with IQ by the way.</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.180" end="00:47:33.490" style="s2">The correlation is like 0.9 so you can even<br />argue it’s the same thing.</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.490" end="00:47:34.950" style="s2">Fluid IQ in particular.</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.950" end="00:47:43.330" style="s2">The correlation between dorsolateral prefrontal<br />cognitive capacity and conscientiousness which</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.330" end="00:47:51.510" style="s2">is like long term goal directed, future oriented,<br />planned activity is zero.</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.510" end="00:47:54.619" style="s2">Okay zero is a very bad correlation.</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.619" end="00:47:59.800" style="s2">You know the old idea, correlation doesn’t<br />imply causality.</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.800" end="00:48:00.980" style="s2">Well, wrong.</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.980" end="00:48:03.099" style="s2">It does strongly imply causality.</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.099" end="00:48:08.180" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t demonstrate it because with every<br />causal relationship, there&#39;s a correlation</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.180" end="00:48:13.340" style="s2">so a hundred percent of causally related items<br />have a correlation right.</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.340" end="00:48:15.530" style="s2">A hundred percent correlation.</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.530" end="00:48:20.330" style="s2">Well not necessarily, but it implies correlation<br />but it does not prove it.</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.330" end="00:48:22.750" style="s2">But zero.</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.750" end="00:48:25.170" style="s2">That’s bad.</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.170" end="00:48:26.760" style="s2">That means those things aren&#39;t related.</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.760" end="00:48:29.790" style="s2">Now, if you think about it, you can understand<br />why.</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.790" end="00:48:37.280" style="s2">They have to be unrelated because if you embodied<br />your abstractions, then you wouldn&#39;t be able</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.280" end="00:48:38.700" style="s2">to experiment with them.</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.700" end="00:48:41.560" style="s2">You’d just act them out and then bang you’d<br />be dead.</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.560" end="00:48:46.820" style="s2">So you have to separate the cognitive activity<br />from the embodiment completely so you can</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.820" end="00:48:51.560" style="s2">choose which of your potential selves to incarnate<br />so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.560" end="00:48:57.750" style="s2">Now, the prefrontal cortex is a complex place,<br />and the lower parts of it seem to be more</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.750" end="00:49:03.500" style="s2">related to the relation between cognitive<br />activity and the control of behavior.</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.500" end="00:49:08.180" style="s2">But we have tried fifty tasks, I bet, trying<br />to get a correlation with conscientiousness</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.180" end="00:49:10.700" style="s2">and we haven&#39;t found one.</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.700" end="00:49:11.710" style="s2">We cannot.</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.710" end="00:49:14.810" style="s2">The reason I’m telling you this is because<br />conscientiousness is a very good predictor</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.810" end="00:49:18.170" style="s2">of long term life success.</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.170" end="00:49:20.089" style="s2">You guys get your grades for two reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.089" end="00:49:25.160" style="s2">One, you&#39;re smart - assuming you are - and<br />two, that you work hard - assuming that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.160" end="00:49:26.160" style="s2">do.</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.160" end="00:49:28.510" style="s2">That eats up almost all the variance in your<br />grades.</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.510" end="00:49:33.609" style="s2">Creativity is zero correlation with grades<br />at U of T, by the way which I think is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.609" end="00:49:37.020" style="s2">comical, and completely unsurprising.</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.020" end="00:49:43.890" style="s2">It’s hard for an institution to grade creativity<br />cause it’s an institution, and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.890" end="00:49:48.859" style="s2">with being creative is that you force people<br />to come up with a new grading scheme.</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.859" end="00:49:51.150" style="s2">It’s like no, they&#39;re not gonna do that.</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.150" end="00:49:54.270" style="s2">Right, because you come up with something<br />creative, it’s different.</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.270" end="00:49:55.270" style="s2">Well what do you do with that?</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.270" end="00:49:56.270" style="s2">You say, don’t do that.</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.270" end="00:49:58.520" style="s2">That’s not what I want, even if it’s a<br />great thing.</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.520" end="00:50:01.580" style="s2">It’s like yeah yeah, take your great thing<br />and go somewhere else with it.</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.580" end="00:50:04.740" style="s2">I’ve got five minutes to mark your damn<br />paper.</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:14.100" style="s2">So anyways, this capacity for abstraction<br />is divorced almost completely from embodiment,</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.100" end="00:50:16.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s a good thing because that allows<br />us to experiment.</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.020" end="00:50:21.480" style="s2">But it’s a bad thing because actually doing<br />the embodiment turns out to be very difficult.</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.480" end="00:50:25.349" style="s2">It’s like your body’s got all these habits<br />built into it that you&#39;ve been working on</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.349" end="00:50:26.740" style="s2">for a long time.</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.740" end="00:50:28.030" style="s2">Here&#39;s another piece of advice.</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.030" end="00:50:34.060" style="s2">Do not practice things that you don&#39;t want<br />to become because one of the things that happens.</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.060" end="00:50:40.900" style="s2">Let’s say you take Danish speakers and you<br />play Danish backwards to them, and you do</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.900" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">a scan of brain activity.</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:45.550" style="s2">It’s like their brain’s lighting up like<br />mad because they don’t know how to say Danish</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.550" end="00:50:50.570" style="s2">backwards, so you get a whole bunch of brain<br />involved in a new task.</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.570" end="00:50:56.869" style="s2">But then as you practice the task, and routinize<br />it, less and less brain is involved.</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.869" end="00:51:01.480" style="s2">So what happens is - this is in your standard,<br />right-hand male and the reason I’m doing</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.480" end="00:51:06.369" style="s2">that as an example is that’s kind of the<br />simplest default brain in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.369" end="00:51:10.690" style="s2">Women are more diffusely organized, and so<br />it’s harder to exactly talk about their</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.690" end="00:51:17.170" style="s2">neurological structure in a simple way, but<br />in a right-handed male, what happens is the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.170" end="00:51:22.070" style="s2">activity starts to shift to the left, and<br />then it shifts backwards, and as it does so,</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.070" end="00:51:25.960" style="s2">the amount of tissue that gets activated gets<br />smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.960" end="00:51:30.360" style="s2">until you&#39;ve built a little machine that takes<br />care of that sort of thing.</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.360" end="00:51:32.770" style="s2">But the thing about that machine is that it’s<br />a machine.</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.770" end="00:51:35.110" style="s2">It’s a habit, and it’s actually there.</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.110" end="00:51:37.340" style="s2">It’s built into you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.340" end="00:51:41.590" style="s2">So be careful what you practise because if<br />you practise it enough, it becomes - it’s</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.590" end="00:51:42.590" style="s2">like it’s you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.590" end="00:51:43.970" style="s2">It’s the default you.</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.970" end="00:51:49.640" style="s2">And then if you want to change it, you can&#39;t<br />just undo that stupid machine.</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.640" end="00:51:50.640" style="s2">It’s there permanently.</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.640" end="00:51:55.670" style="s2">What you have to do is you have to build another<br />little machine that shuts it off, and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.670" end="00:51:59.010" style="s2">another machine that does the other thing,<br />and then if you get stressed the little machine</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.010" end="00:52:04.380" style="s2">that shuts the first machine off will stop<br />working and back your stupid habit will come.</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.380" end="00:52:09.530" style="s2">So, people used to talk about the development<br />of character, and there was something about</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.530" end="00:52:15.580" style="s2">that that was absolutely right because character<br />is how you build yourself across time, and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.580" end="00:52:17.450" style="s2">it really really matters.</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.450" end="00:52:19.790" style="s2">Only practise what you want to become.</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.790" end="00:52:22.920" style="s2">If you practise other things, then well you’ll<br />become them.</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.920" end="00:52:25.230" style="s2">That’s not so good.</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.230" end="00:52:28.820" style="s2">Okay, so back to this.</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.820" end="00:52:31.599" style="s2">Now, Gray and Sokolov and Vinogradova.</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.599" end="00:52:33.359" style="s2">We’re gonna talk about them for a minute.</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.359" end="00:52:36.210" style="s2">Now, they used to talk about animals.</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.210" end="00:52:41.950" style="s2">They&#39;re mostly thinking about animals - rats,<br />mostly - as having an expectancy model.</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.950" end="00:52:43.560" style="s2">So you take a rat.</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.560" end="00:52:46.630" style="s2">You throw him in a new environment.</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.630" end="00:52:47.740" style="s2">What does he do?</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.740" end="00:52:52.260" style="s2">Well the first he does is freeze because god<br />only knows what’s out there.</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.260" end="00:52:55.510" style="s2">So it’s like paralyzed rat; he’s just<br />seen the Medusa.</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.510" end="00:53:01.580" style="s2">He’s paralyzed, and then if nothing attacks<br />him, he starts to calm down a bit and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.580" end="00:53:04.550" style="s2">he’ll start sniffing because rats are all<br />smell.</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.550" end="00:53:08.630" style="s2">And he sniffs around, and he’s trying to<br />detect cats, say.</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.630" end="00:53:11.950" style="s2">Now, rats have such a good sense of smell.</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.950" end="00:53:15.950" style="s2">If a rat eats somethign that makes it sick,<br />it’ll never eat it again.</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.950" end="00:53:20.820" style="s2">But, if a rat smells the breath of a rat that<br />ate something that made it sick, he won’t</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.820" end="00:53:21.820" style="s2">eat that either.</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.820" end="00:53:23.869" style="s2">Right, so rats eh.</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.869" end="00:53:25.869" style="s2">Man, they can smell things.</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.869" end="00:53:29.890" style="s2">And animals are built around a smell brain,<br />so they&#39;re a lot different than us.</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.890" end="00:53:35.070" style="s2">We have - did I tell you about the t-shirt<br />study of symmetrical men?</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.070" end="00:53:38.619" style="s2">Oh that’s a funny one.</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.619" end="00:53:43.839" style="s2">So we know that one of the things that signify<br />physical beauty is symmetry, and the reason</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.839" end="00:53:50.140" style="s2">for that is that all things considered, symmetrical<br />people are more healthy than asymmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.140" end="00:53:51.140" style="s2">people.</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.140" end="00:53:55.320" style="s2">Asymmetry indicates taht somethings gone wrong<br />somewhere in the process of development.</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.320" end="00:54:01.400" style="s2">So, we like symmetry and beauty.</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.400" end="00:54:02.400" style="s2">And that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.400" end="00:54:03.720" style="s2">That’s all the way across the animal kingdom.</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.720" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">So butterflies.</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:08.580" style="s2">There are butterflies that wont mate with<br />another butterfly if it deviates from symmetry</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.580" end="00:54:10.680" style="s2">some absurdly tiny amount.</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.680" end="00:54:14.980" style="s2">Like really, it’s micro measurement deviation.</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.980" end="00:54:20.990" style="s2">I gues they have a butterfly template and<br />if you know, the potential mating butterfly</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.990" end="00:54:23.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t match, it’s like flitter off.</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.560" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">You’re not getting anywhere.</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:28.320" style="s2">So, that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.320" end="00:54:29.320" style="s2">So symmetry.</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.320" end="00:54:33.990" style="s2">This researcher, god only knows what possessed<br />him, took a bunch of men, ranging from symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.990" end="00:54:38.609" style="s2">to asymmetrical - judged by a panel - and<br />then he had them shower and then he had them</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.609" end="00:54:41.210" style="s2">wear a t-shirt for like four hours.</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.210" end="00:54:47.380" style="s2">And then, he gave these t-shirts to women<br />and he said okay rate the scent of the t-shirt</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.380" end="00:54:50.690" style="s2">from positive to negative.</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.690" end="00:54:53.630" style="s2">Well the women overwhelmingly preferred the<br />symmetrical guys.</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.630" end="00:54:55.870" style="s2">Yeah, no kidding eh.</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.870" end="00:55:00.390" style="s2">So you just bloody well never know what’s<br />behind that attraction.</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.390" end="00:55:01.390" style="s2">We know some things.</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.390" end="00:55:03.560" style="s2">Symmetry’s a big one, but there’s a bunch<br />of other ones too.</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.560" end="00:55:04.560" style="s2">I was just wondering how that would correlate<br />with - I know attraction to smells also has</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.560" end="00:55:10.050" style="s2">to do with your optimal mate.</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.050" end="00:55:18.380" style="s2">Oh yeah, there’s a bunch of things.</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.380" end="00:55:21.830" style="s2">Here&#39;s another study - this is a cool one.</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.830" end="00:55:24.500" style="s2">This is one of the few psychological facts.</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.500" end="00:55:26.630" style="s2">We don&#39;t have many psychological facts, you<br />know.</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.630" end="00:55:31.680" style="s2">We have a lot of hypotheses about things but<br />this is as close to a fact as we&#39;ve ever got.</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.680" end="00:55:37.940" style="s2">So, back decades ago, these Israeli children<br />were raised in kibbutzim, and those were basically</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.940" end="00:55:43.780" style="s2">- they were basically daycare for kids.</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.780" end="00:55:44.780" style="s2">Group day care.</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.780" end="00:55:49.119" style="s2">But the kids were more separated from the<br />parents than they might be in a regular day</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.119" end="00:55:50.119" style="s2">care.</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.119" end="00:55:54.930" style="s2">Anyways, all the Israeli kids were in these<br />kibbutzim, and so then we have detailed marriage</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.930" end="00:55:57.130" style="s2">records of the kids.</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.130" end="00:56:02.530" style="s2">You know that people very seldom marry their<br />siblings, and they&#39;re very seldomly in a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.530" end="00:56:05.740" style="s2">relationship with their siblings, and you<br />might say well why is that.</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.740" end="00:56:11.490" style="s2">It’s the case across cultures, with very<br />specific exceptions like often high rank nobility</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.490" end="00:56:14.609" style="s2">- they have an option.</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.609" end="00:56:20.820" style="s2">Generally speaking, there&#39;s a powerful incest<br />taboo, as well as between parents and children.</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.820" end="00:56:27.120" style="s2">So, some researcher decided well how do you<br />know who you&#39;re sibling is, you know roughly</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.120" end="00:56:28.120" style="s2">speaking.</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.120" end="00:56:32.980" style="s2">What exactly is it that’s not turning you<br />on, let’s say.</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.980" end="00:56:37.920" style="s2">Well so they checked out the kibbutzim records<br />and they found that Israeli children who were</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.920" end="00:56:42.359" style="s2">raised in the same kibbutzim never married<br />each other.</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.359" end="00:56:49.800" style="s2">Whatever happened seemed to - it was as if<br />that close, close contact in the very early</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.800" end="00:56:55.750" style="s2">years triggered whatever the sibling anti-response<br />is and that was that.</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.750" end="00:56:57.490" style="s2">It’s probably smell.</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.490" end="00:56:58.740" style="s2">That would be my guess.</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.740" end="00:57:03.320" style="s2">Now, there’s also another study.</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.320" end="00:57:09.529" style="s2">One of the things they found with mice - I<br />hope it’s mice - is that mice will not mate</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.529" end="00:57:10.660" style="s2">- is that right?</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.660" end="00:57:15.530" style="s2">Okay, I’m gonna garble this up but it doesn&#39;t<br />matter because the underlying point is valid</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.530" end="00:57:18.940" style="s2">even though I’m gonna mess up the details.</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.940" end="00:57:24.250" style="s2">Animal studies indicated, if I remembered<br />correctly, that mice will not mate with other</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.250" end="00:57:30.770" style="s2">mice who have an RH factor that would increase<br />the probability of a miscarriage.</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.770" end="00:57:37.829" style="s2">And neither will women, well not with mice<br />obviously, but women do not like the smell</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.829" end="00:57:44.950" style="s2">of men who have RH factors that in combination<br />with theirs will produce suboptimal offspring,</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.950" end="00:57:50.230" style="s2">and when you ask them why they don&#39;t like<br />the smell, they say that it’s like my brother.</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.230" end="00:57:51.440" style="s2">Something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.440" end="00:57:55.480" style="s2">So anyways, that’s quite remarkable.</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.480" end="00:58:00.320" style="s2">Now back to the rats and the expectancy model.</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.320" end="00:58:06.349" style="s2">We already know that you can get an orienting<br />response out of a human being if something</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.349" end="00:58:07.470" style="s2">deviates from expectancy.</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.470" end="00:58:13.520" style="s2">Now people started studying this in rats,<br />and the original conceptualization was expectation.</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.520" end="00:58:17.490" style="s2">So you have an expectation about how the world<br />is gonna lay itself out.</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.490" end="00:58:22.510" style="s2">That’s your model, and then if the world<br />deviates from that, you have an orienting</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.510" end="00:58:27.070" style="s2">reflex and what that does is protect you from<br />predation.</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.070" end="00:58:30.190" style="s2">That’s the first level of the orienting<br />response.</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.190" end="00:58:31.829" style="s2">It’s really, really primitive.</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.829" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">It’s mediated only by a few neuronal connections<br />so it’s unbelievably rapid.</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:41.820" style="s2">Then after that, there’s anxiety and the<br />proclivity to explore.</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.820" end="00:58:42.960" style="s2">That both gets activated.</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.960" end="00:58:50.579" style="s2">So it’s first protective, then you orient<br />towards the - imagine you&#39;re walking down</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.579" end="00:58:52.579" style="s2">the street and hear a really loud noise behind<br />you.</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.579" end="00:58:54.990" style="s2">It’s like really loud, so it startles you.</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.990" end="00:58:59.300" style="s2">Well you go into a crouch so that if a tiger<br />had jumped on your back, it would be hard</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.300" end="00:59:06.250" style="s2">for it to get your neck, and then tenths of<br />a second later, you&#39;ll turn assuming you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.250" end="00:59:11.700" style="s2">get attacked by a tiger, you’ll swivel and<br />turn and orient all your senses towards the</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.700" end="00:59:18.010" style="s2">locale that was specified by the sound because<br />you have a stereo auditory system and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.010" end="00:59:21.640" style="s2">can localize events in space using that.</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.640" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">So you orient towards it - that’s part of<br />the orienting reflex.</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.920" end="00:59:25.230" style="s2">It’s a reflex.</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.230" end="00:59:26.460" style="s2">It’s not voluntary.</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.460" end="00:59:32.170" style="s2">So, and then once you&#39;ve got your eyes trained<br />on it, and your ears, then you start to explore</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.170" end="00:59:36.230" style="s2">it and then you might freeze.</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.230" end="00:59:39.590" style="s2">You might get out of there which is a panic<br />response.</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.590" end="00:59:42.440" style="s2">That’s another thing that could be triggered<br />by the orienting reflex.</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.440" end="00:59:43.440" style="s2">Different circuit.</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.440" end="00:59:45.340" style="s2">Or you might think, “Wow, what’s going<br />on over there?</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.340" end="00:59:46.790" style="s2">It looks interesting.”</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.790" end="00:59:48.470" style="s2">And then you go approach it.</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.470" end="00:59:55.710" style="s2">Now, those two - the exploratory part is mediated<br />in part by the hypothalamus which is a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.710" end="01:00:01.510" style="s2">very old system, and it has a whole section,<br />about half of it is devoted to the circuitry</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.510" end="01:00:05.320" style="s2">that you would use to figure out what was<br />going on if something that you didn&#39;t understood</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.320" end="01:00:06.320" style="s2">happened.</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.320" end="01:00:10.660" style="s2">And then you have a whole other circuit that’s<br />hippocampal and amygdalic that regulates the</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.660" end="01:00:14.960" style="s2">exploratory circuit and says be careful because<br />while you&#39;re gathering information, you might</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.960" end="01:00:21.750" style="s2">get killed and the anxiety circuit takes primacy,<br />generally speaking, over the exploratory circuit.</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.750" end="01:00:26.920" style="s2">And the reason for that is you don&#39;t want<br />to get information and be dead so caution</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.920" end="01:00:28.090" style="s2">is the watchword.</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.090" end="01:00:32.839" style="s2">Now, the other thing you might think about<br />which is an extremely useful thing to think</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.839" end="01:00:33.950" style="s2">about.</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.950" end="01:00:36.820" style="s2">Okay let’s go back to that diagram I showed<br />you with the hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.820" end="01:00:41.360" style="s2">Right, so you’ve got the motor actions at<br />the bottom, and you&#39;ve got the high level</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.360" end="01:00:43.100" style="s2">abstractions at the top.</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.100" end="01:00:48.920" style="s2">So, you&#39;re tickling the baby and somebody<br />comes home and says if you tickle the baby</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.920" end="01:00:51.369" style="s2">this way, the baby has more fun.</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.369" end="01:00:53.660" style="s2">And so how do you respond to that?</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.660" end="01:00:56.610" style="s2">Well maybe you’re a little peeved because<br />you&#39;re doing perfectly fine with this baby</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.610" end="01:01:02.880" style="s2">and someone’s coming and altering your tickling<br />micro personality, and you know, if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.880" end="01:01:06.150" style="s2">irritable you’ll say well why don&#39;t you<br />just go off and find a baby of your own to</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.150" end="01:01:08.450" style="s2">play with.</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.450" end="01:01:13.130" style="s2">And if you&#39;re not that irritable, you might<br />say well okay show me what to do.</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.130" end="01:01:16.910" style="s2">There’ll be a tinge of negative emotion<br />there, generally speaking, depending on how</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.910" end="01:01:23.180" style="s2">the person has approached you but your self<br />concept can probably handle a micro change</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.180" end="01:01:25.290" style="s2">to your tickling routine.</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.290" end="01:01:30.599" style="s2">Okay, so that’s gonna produce only a little<br />bit of anxiety and irritation and the reason</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.599" end="01:01:40.329" style="s2">for that is that the threat to you is proportionate<br />to the magnitude of the system that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.329" end="01:01:43.410" style="s2">modified by the challenge.</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.410" end="01:01:48.060" style="s2">Now this is really useful to know, okay, practically,<br />and this is why.</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.060" end="01:01:54.660" style="s2">Let’s say you’re having an argument with<br />your partner and you say, you’re a stupid</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.660" end="01:02:00.160" style="s2">person and you’ve always been a stupid person<br />and as far as I can tell, as far into the</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.160" end="01:02:04.260" style="s2">future as I can see, you’re going to remain<br />a stupid person.</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.260" end="01:02:05.339" style="s2">So what are they supposed to do?</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.339" end="01:02:07.940" style="s2">What are they gonna do when you say that?</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.940" end="01:02:11.730" style="s2">They’re gonna cry like if you mean it.</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.730" end="01:02:16.971" style="s2">They&#39;re gonna get angry if you mean it, and<br />they’ll not like you very much, and why</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.971" end="01:02:17.971" style="s2">is that?</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.971" end="01:02:21.180" style="s2">Well it’s like, it’s assault basically.</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.180" end="01:02:28.290" style="s2">The only thing you can do in a situation like<br />that is walk away, ignore it, respond in kind,</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.290" end="01:02:30.490" style="s2">or it degenerates into violence.</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.490" end="01:02:33.300" style="s2">That’s it because there&#39;s no discussion.</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.300" end="01:02:34.960" style="s2">You haven&#39;t left the person anywhere to go.</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.960" end="01:02:39.990" style="s2">You’ve gone right to the top of their hierarchy<br />and said everything about you is wrong, and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.990" end="01:02:44.990" style="s2">worse than that, all the mechanisms that we<br />could use to correct it won’t work.</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.990" end="01:02:46.900" style="s2">So, those are fighting words.</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.900" end="01:02:49.030" style="s2">So don’t do that unless you want to have<br />a fight.</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.030" end="01:02:51.320" style="s2">So then you might say, well what would you<br />do instead?</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.320" end="01:02:56.660" style="s2">And the answer is deliver the least amount<br />of information you possibly can, and so let’s</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.660" end="01:03:01.839" style="s2">say you come home and your person is watching<br />TV, and you were kind of hoping they’d greet</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.839" end="01:03:03.650" style="s2">you at the door.</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.650" end="01:03:06.890" style="s2">You shouldn&#39;t break down into tears and say<br />you’re a stupid person, you’ve always</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.890" end="01:03:09.800" style="s2">been a stupid person, and you’re gonna be<br />a stupid person in the future.</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.800" end="01:03:17.020" style="s2">You should say, I have this peculiarity and<br />that is when I come home, I don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.020" end="01:03:19.859" style="s2">confidence to just be happy.</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.859" end="01:03:24.369" style="s2">I would like you to come and say - just shut<br />the TV off for two minutes, come to the front</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.369" end="01:03:28.280" style="s2">door and say “Hello”, and then you can<br />go back and watch your TV.</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.280" end="01:03:30.069" style="s2">Would it be okay if you did that?</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.069" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">And they&#39;ll think, “Okay you’ll have to<br />pay for it somehow,” but then they&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:37.510" style="s2">do it.</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.510" end="01:03:42.130" style="s2">But the thing is you’ve got to specify the<br />routine that you want transformed at the highest</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.130" end="01:03:48.170" style="s2">possible level of resolution, and you want<br />to recommend the minimal necessary change</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.170" end="01:03:50.359" style="s2">that will satisfy you.</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.359" end="01:03:56.050" style="s2">So you can&#39;t say, “If you love me, you&#39;d<br />know how to greet me at the door.”</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.050" end="01:03:57.050" style="s2">Ha.</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.050" end="01:03:58.460" style="s2">Not helpful because they&#39;re stupid.</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.460" end="01:04:01.560" style="s2">Right, and so are you.</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.560" end="01:04:03.089" style="s2">So you have to spell it out.</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.089" end="01:04:04.200" style="s2">It’s like what do you want.</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.200" end="01:04:09.880" style="s2">Exactly, what would make you satisfied, and<br />then you have to have your person grudgingly</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.880" end="01:04:15.300" style="s2">practice that a few times and you have to<br />let them do it very badly and also in a bad</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.300" end="01:04:19.910" style="s2">temper, and then you&#39;d have to reward them<br />for it and then maybe three months later,</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.910" end="01:04:21.829" style="s2">they&#39;ll do it properly.</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.829" end="01:04:24.560" style="s2">So you need to know that because that&#39;s what<br />people are like.</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.560" end="01:04:27.940" style="s2">It’s very hard for them to learn new things,<br />and they&#39;re very resistant to it, but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.940" end="01:04:30.640" style="s2">very responsive to reward.</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.640" end="01:04:35.260" style="s2">So another thing - this is partly what B.F.<br />Skinner figured out so, when he was training</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.260" end="01:04:39.780" style="s2">rats and he wanted a rat to do something,<br />one of the things he would do is put - maybe</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.780" end="01:04:45.810" style="s2">he was gonna train the rat to climb up a little<br />ladder, and I mean he can get rats to climb</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.810" end="01:04:49.530" style="s2">ladders and climb across the little monkey<br />bars and then spin around three times and</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.530" end="01:04:53.890" style="s2">then, you know, whack a ball and then eat<br />something, like he got incredibly complex</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.890" end="01:04:55.430" style="s2">behavior out of rats.</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.430" end="01:04:58.069" style="s2">And the way he did that was patience.</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.069" end="01:05:02.440" style="s2">So he put the ladder in the cage, and the<br />rat would just run around doing rat things,</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.440" end="01:05:10.680" style="s2">and it would put its hand on the first rung,<br />and Skinner would give it a pellet, and so</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.680" end="01:05:16.359" style="s2">after even once, the rat’s gonna be like<br />standing in the immediate vicinity of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.359" end="01:05:20.360" style="s2">ladder and then the frequency with which its<br />gonna go like this has just increased so its</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.360" end="01:05:21.360" style="s2">gonna do it again.</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.360" end="01:05:22.360" style="s2">Bang, pellet.</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.360" end="01:05:25.359" style="s2">Well soon the rat’s just going like this,<br />right?</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.359" end="01:05:28.510" style="s2">So then, you wait until the rat tries the<br />other hand.</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.510" end="01:05:29.869" style="s2">So you give it a pellet then.</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.869" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">Well then it’s going like this and then<br />because it’s going to get bored, it’ll</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:34.200" style="s2">go like this.</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.200" end="01:05:35.200" style="s2">It’ll hit the next stair.</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.200" end="01:05:36.200" style="s2">Bang, you give it a pellet.</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.200" end="01:05:39.580" style="s2">Soon the rat is climbing and doing all the<br />little things he wanted to do.</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.580" end="01:05:42.260" style="s2">Now the problem with that is you have to be<br />patient.</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.260" end="01:05:44.730" style="s2">You have to wait until the rat does what you<br />want.</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.730" end="01:05:46.910" style="s2">Okay that’s more relationship advice.</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.910" end="01:05:53.390" style="s2">Wait till the rat does what you want, and<br />then reward it, and it’s unbelievably useful.</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.390" end="01:05:55.810" style="s2">It’s also extraordinarily positive.</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.810" end="01:06:02.849" style="s2">I mean I’m being, you know, comical, insofar<br />as I can manage that, about the situation,</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.849" end="01:06:07.000" style="s2">but people love reward and they love attention.</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.000" end="01:06:12.420" style="s2">People love attention more than anything else,<br />and so if you watch through the day, and when</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.420" end="01:06:17.420" style="s2">your partner does something that’s good,<br />say “Bam, that was good” or something</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.420" end="01:06:18.420" style="s2">like that.</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.420" end="01:06:22.700" style="s2">You can be inventive, and then they&#39;ll do<br />it more, and if you do that a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.700" end="01:06:27.460" style="s2">like for a year, they&#39;ll be doing things that<br />are good for you just all the time.</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.460" end="01:06:33.260" style="s2">But you have to be patient, which is very<br />annoying and you have to suppress your response</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.260" end="01:06:38.450" style="s2">to only respond to negative things, you know,<br />because what we know about the expectancy</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.450" end="01:06:46.210" style="s2">models is that a deviation from expectation<br />produces a burst of negative emotion.</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.210" end="01:06:52.640" style="s2">So you come home, and the whole house is clean,<br />but there’s like - I don’t know - the</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.640" end="01:06:55.600" style="s2">dog has shed on the rug or something and the<br />person overlooked that.</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.600" end="01:06:58.990" style="s2">It’s like you&#39;re not gonna see the clean<br />house, you’re gonna see the rug with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.990" end="01:07:02.670" style="s2">dog fur on it and you’re gonna say “Why<br />didn&#39;t you clean up the rug with the dog fur?”</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.670" end="01:07:06.500" style="s2">And they&#39;re gonna say, “Good luck getting<br />me to clean the house again.”</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.500" end="01:07:12.670" style="s2">And you know, because the thing is the exception<br />stands out and what’s done doesn’t, and</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.670" end="01:07:15.690" style="s2">the reason for that is you can just ignore<br />what’s done because it’s done.</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.690" end="01:07:16.890" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t get in your way.</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.890" end="01:07:19.170" style="s2">So it just gets invisible really quickly.</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.170" end="01:07:22.510" style="s2">So you really gotta watch that tendency.</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.510" end="01:07:26.340" style="s2">One of the things Nietzsche said was that<br />if you really want to punish someone, you</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.340" end="01:07:30.281" style="s2">don&#39;t punish them when they do something wrong<br />because they expect that.</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.281" end="01:07:32.260" style="s2">That’s not a punishment, they expect that.</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.260" end="01:07:34.810" style="s2">They might even be relieved by it.</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.810" end="01:07:39.490" style="s2">You want to punish them when they do something<br />right because then you&#39;ll really hurt them.</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.490" end="01:07:42.690" style="s2">So that&#39;s something to think about, if you&#39;re<br />in a relationship man.</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.690" end="01:07:46.820" style="s2">If someone’s done something right, do not<br />punish them.</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.820" end="01:07:48.859" style="s2">You do that two or three times and that’s<br />it man.</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.859" end="01:07:51.990" style="s2">You’re not gonna get them to do that anymore.</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.990" end="01:07:54.510" style="s2">So, judiciousness.</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.510" end="01:07:55.510" style="s2">Watch what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.510" end="01:07:59.760" style="s2">If something happens that’s good, notice<br />it, and you know, if they’ve done a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.760" end="01:08:02.690" style="s2">of things don’t concentrate on the things<br />they did wrong.</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.690" end="01:08:04.450" style="s2">That’s not smart.</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.450" end="01:08:06.970" style="s2">It’s really hard on them too.</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.970" end="01:08:11.430" style="s2">In some sense this sounds manipulative and<br />selfish, you know, because I’m teaching</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.430" end="01:08:18.069" style="s2">you how to train your partner, but you should<br />also teach them how to train you because it</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.069" end="01:08:21.020" style="s2">would be really nice if you could come home<br />and the person would say, “Well what did</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.020" end="01:08:24.619" style="s2">you do today?” and you say “Here’s a<br />bunch of things I did.” and they say “Well</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.619" end="01:08:27.690" style="s2">this looks really good, and that was great,<br />and why don&#39;t you do some more of that?”</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.690" end="01:08:31.909" style="s2">And you’re like “Oh boy,” it was a great<br />day.</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.909" end="01:08:37.319" style="s2">So, you can train them to train you properly,<br />and that&#39;s a really helpful thing especially</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.319" end="01:08:40.119" style="s2">when you do it over a few years.</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.119" end="01:08:43.319" style="s2">That&#39;s how you have a good relationship because<br />you&#39;re both clueless as hell to begin with.</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.319" end="01:08:48.189" style="s2">You don’t know even what would make you<br />happy, much less what would make the other</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.189" end="01:08:53.429" style="s2">person happy and so you&#39;ve got to figure these<br />things out bit by bit and you have to inform</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.429" end="01:08:59.189" style="s2">each other, and you have to be patient enough<br />to let your partner do these things really</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.189" end="01:09:00.189" style="s2">badly.</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.189" end="01:09:02.829" style="s2">I’ll give you another example.</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.829" end="01:09:08.179" style="s2">Sometimes I see couples sporadically in my<br />clinical practice.</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.179" end="01:09:15.299" style="s2">I’m not a couples counsellor, but sometimes<br />when I&#39;m working with someone, there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.299" end="01:09:19.639" style="s2">issue that needs to be discussed with both<br />people because otherwise it’s just stupid,</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.639" end="01:09:25.599" style="s2">and one of the things I often recommend to<br />people especially once they have kids is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.599" end="01:09:31.439" style="s2">they set aside - to use an anachronistic phrase<br />- date nights.</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.439" end="01:09:34.009" style="s2">Well, everyone hates that idea.</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.009" end="01:09:38.239" style="s2">They say, well you know, they’ll just say,<br />“I’m not doing that.”</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.239" end="01:09:39.239" style="s2">That’d be one objection.</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.239" end="01:09:40.839" style="s2">“We’re just not doing that.</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.839" end="01:09:45.579" style="s2">That’s what we did before we got married.”</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.579" end="01:09:48.089" style="s2">They&#39;ll say, “Well my partner will never<br />go for that.”</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.089" end="01:09:53.909" style="s2">They&#39;ve got a bunch of excuses why that isn&#39;t<br />going to work, and so I&#39;ve heard all those</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.909" end="01:09:54.909" style="s2">excuses.</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.909" end="01:09:58.550" style="s2">I’ve heard all of them, and then maybe I<br />convince them, “Yeah, yeah, I know this</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.550" end="01:09:59.550" style="s2">is stupid.</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.550" end="01:10:00.550" style="s2">It’s awkward.</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.550" end="01:10:01.550" style="s2">It’s artificial.</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.550" end="01:10:02.550" style="s2">That’s okay.</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.550" end="01:10:04.900" style="s2">Just try it once.”</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.900" end="01:10:08.050" style="s2">So then they&#39;ll go and try it, and then they&#39;ll<br />come back and say, “We had an absolutely</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.050" end="01:10:09.139" style="s2">miserable time.</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.139" end="01:10:10.139" style="s2">Really.</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.139" end="01:10:11.139" style="s2">We had a miserable time.</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.139" end="01:10:15.150" style="s2">We couldn&#39;t agree on what movie to go to,<br />and then she took me to her movie and I really</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.150" end="01:10:16.739" style="s2">didn&#39;t like it and so we fought all the way<br />home.</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.739" end="01:10:19.050" style="s2">We’re never doing that again.”</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.050" end="01:10:23.349" style="s2">And I say, well really, you’ve got thirty<br />years, four hundred days.</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.349" end="01:10:24.639" style="s2">That’s twelve thousand days.</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.639" end="01:10:26.380" style="s2">Okay, so you&#39;re not going to do that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.380" end="01:10:32.619" style="s2">You’re going to spend the next twelve thousand<br />days without having any real romantic evenings</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.619" end="01:10:34.429" style="s2">and interactions with your spouse.</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.429" end="01:10:35.429" style="s2">That&#39;s your plan.</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.429" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">And I like doing arithmetic with my clients.</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:40.519" style="s2">They hate that.</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.519" end="01:10:41.849" style="s2">They hate arithmetic.</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.849" end="01:10:45.460" style="s2">It’s like well no that sounds like a bad<br />idea.</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.460" end="01:10:49.329" style="s2">Okay well would you like some romance in your<br />life or are you just done with that?</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.329" end="01:10:54.219" style="s2">Well really, like people can go for a long<br />time with no romance at all.</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.219" end="01:10:57.150" style="s2">They say, “Well no maybe, we’d like some<br />of that.”</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.150" end="01:10:58.530" style="s2">Well how much?</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.530" end="01:10:59.690" style="s2">Once a year.</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.690" end="01:11:01.120" style="s2">Well, no.</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.120" end="01:11:02.489" style="s2">Once a month.</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.489" end="01:11:04.550" style="s2">Well, no.</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.550" end="01:11:05.690" style="s2">Once every two weeks.</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.690" end="01:11:07.469" style="s2">Well, sometimes people are really busy.</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.469" end="01:11:10.659" style="s2">Okay, that beats the hell out of zero.</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.659" end="01:11:12.190" style="s2">Once a week, twice a week.</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.190" end="01:11:14.979" style="s2">Okay, whatever, we’re gonna start with a<br />range.</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.979" end="01:11:17.280" style="s2">Okay, what would a good evening look like?</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.280" end="01:11:22.289" style="s2">Like if you could both get exactly what you<br />wanted, what would it look like?</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.289" end="01:11:26.949" style="s2">Then they have to think about that because<br />the previous theory was, “My stupid partner</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.949" end="01:11:30.139" style="s2">should know what I like” and that&#39;s what<br />the partner is thinking too.</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.139" end="01:11:33.940" style="s2">It’s like good luck with that, no they don&#39;t<br />have a clue especially if they&#39;re men.</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.940" end="01:11:38.949" style="s2">They don&#39;t have a clue so you have to tell<br />them what you want and how they could deliver</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.949" end="01:11:42.139" style="s2">it, and vice versa which is very awkward and<br />horrible.</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.139" end="01:11:46.539" style="s2">And then you have to practice it for six months<br />because you know, it takes a lot of practice</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.539" end="01:11:51.130" style="s2">to do something sophisticated really well,<br />and then if you do that it’s like poof,</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.130" end="01:11:53.360" style="s2">you got it for the rest of your life.</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.360" end="01:11:58.360" style="s2">So it’s worth the aggravation, and you know<br />the first time the rat puts its paw on the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.360" end="01:12:01.699" style="s2">ladder, its just sort of doing it accidentally.</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.699" end="01:12:07.010" style="s2">You can&#39;t expect it to do it well, and that&#39;s<br />exactly how to view your own progress and</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.010" end="01:12:08.019" style="s2">the progress of your partner.</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.019" end="01:12:10.840" style="s2">It’s like let them do it badly for awhile.</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.840" end="01:12:12.689" style="s2">At least they&#39;re doing it.</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.689" end="01:12:16.530" style="s2">So if you think they should do it faster,<br />well look real hard and see how easy it is</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.530" end="01:12:20.539" style="s2">to change your own behavior because it’s<br />really hard to change your own behavior.</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.539" end="01:12:22.900" style="s2">Everybody says, “I’m going to exercise<br />three times a week.”</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.900" end="01:12:24.699" style="s2">New Years, and its like no one does.</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.699" end="01:12:29.309" style="s2">They buy the membership and then they feel<br />guilty for having them, but they don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.309" end="01:12:34.510" style="s2">go to the gym - and that&#39;s a perfect example<br />of how difficult it is to transform behavior.</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.510" end="01:12:39.920" style="s2">Okay, so back to the diagram here.</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.920" end="01:12:42.239" style="s2">Expectation.</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.239" end="01:12:49.289" style="s2">So, the early models of expectation were cognitive<br />models and the idea was the rat makes a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.289" end="01:12:54.719" style="s2">model of the world, and then he operates in<br />that world according to what he expects.</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.719" end="01:12:56.530" style="s2">Now there&#39;s a problem with that model.</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.530" end="01:12:57.530" style="s2">There&#39;s a bunch of them.</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.530" end="01:13:01.730" style="s2">The first is now we know that animals don&#39;t<br />make comprehensive models of the world, and</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.730" end="01:13:03.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge problem.</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.280" end="01:13:05.900" style="s2">The problem is, well what do they get rid<br />of, and how?</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.900" end="01:13:10.539" style="s2">But the way you get rid of that problem is<br />that you introduce motivation into the equation,</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.539" end="01:13:15.280" style="s2">and it’s interesting because the behaviorists<br />always thought of animals like blank slates</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.280" end="01:13:20.670" style="s2">so they never really took motivation seriously<br />as a contributor to cognitive modeling.</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.670" end="01:13:27.130" style="s2">It’s also the case that probably ever since<br />the Enlightenment, people have thought of</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.130" end="01:13:30.780" style="s2">emotion and motivation as forces opposed to<br />rationality.</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.780" end="01:13:35.460" style="s2">So you know, you&#39;re as rational insofar as<br />you didn&#39;t let your emotions and motivations</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.460" end="01:13:36.670" style="s2">influence you.</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.670" end="01:13:38.670" style="s2">But that&#39;s a foolish theory.</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.670" end="01:13:43.190" style="s2">There are times when it’s inappropriate<br />for certain purposes to let certain motivations</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.190" end="01:13:49.469" style="s2">interfere with your observations, but generally<br />speaking you never think about anything without</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.469" end="01:13:51.580" style="s2">being motivated because why would you?</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.580" end="01:13:55.159" style="s2">Like, there’s a trillion things you can<br />think of and you&#39;re not gonna think of most</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.159" end="01:13:56.159" style="s2">of them.</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.159" end="01:13:59.920" style="s2">You have to have a reason to think of them,<br />and the reason is that, well, all the time</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.920" end="01:14:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;re operating in some sort of motivational<br />structure, and you can sort of model them</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.400" end="01:14:10.050" style="s2">using the same kind of hierarchy that we use<br />to model the personality as such.</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.050" end="01:14:16.420" style="s2">I’ll give you an example.</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.420" end="01:14:21.139" style="s2">So let’s think of some basic motivations<br />and emotions.</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.139" end="01:14:25.590" style="s2">Those aren&#39;t good categories by the way because<br />there&#39;s no such things as motivations and</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.590" end="01:14:27.860" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as emotions.</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.860" end="01:14:33.659" style="s2">The things we loosely categorize into motivations<br />and emotions each have their own brain circuitry,</p>
<p begin="01:14:33.659" end="01:14:37.070" style="s2">and so there are similarities between them<br />and there are differences.</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.070" end="01:14:38.070" style="s2">They&#39;re not clean categories.</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.070" end="01:14:42.619" style="s2">Well, we’re gonna use the terminology anyways<br />because we don&#39;t have a better one.</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.619" end="01:14:50.239" style="s2">For my purposes, you can roughly define a<br />motivation as opposed to an emotion as a motivation</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.239" end="01:14:55.119" style="s2">is really something that establishes, you<br />could say, a goal, but it doesn’t.</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.119" end="01:14:56.530" style="s2">It establishes one of these.</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.530" end="01:15:00.949" style="s2">It doesn&#39;t establish a goal, and it doesn&#39;t<br />drive behavior.</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.949" end="01:15:03.550" style="s2">So what it does is let’s say you&#39;re hungry<br />and it’s nighttime, and you want to have</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.550" end="01:15:04.550" style="s2">a peanut butter sandwich.</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.550" end="01:15:10.659" style="s2">So imagine you&#39;re sitting there typing away,<br />and all of a sudden this little image of having</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.659" end="01:15:12.340" style="s2">something to eat creeps into your head.</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.340" end="01:15:14.050" style="s2">It’s not usually quite specific.</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.050" end="01:15:16.369" style="s2">It’s that there&#39;s something you would like<br />to eat.</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.369" end="01:15:19.389" style="s2">So you think, “Ah, I could really use some<br />popcorn.”</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.389" end="01:15:25.440" style="s2">So you&#39;re typing away and the stupid popcorn<br />thing keeps popping up, and finally your whole</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.440" end="01:15:28.889" style="s2">body is starting to get into the popcorn and<br />you think “Oh to hell with it, I’ll go</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.889" end="01:15:30.229" style="s2">make some popcorn.”</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.229" end="01:15:35.820" style="s2">So what&#39;s happened is that your hypothalamus,<br />roughly speaking, is monitoring your internal</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.820" end="01:15:39.770" style="s2">body state and it thinks that you need some<br />- maybe you need some salt, but maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.770" end="01:15:45.090" style="s2">need some food, and so it’s gonna start<br />popping up, not a drive.</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.090" end="01:15:50.400" style="s2">It’s not like all of a sudden you’re a<br />robot, like a popcorn seeking robot and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.400" end="01:15:57.030" style="s2">laying out your chained together condition<br />popcorn making and eating routines.</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.030" end="01:15:59.389" style="s2">That isn&#39;t what happens.</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.389" end="01:16:04.939" style="s2">What happens instead that you start to envision<br />a new state of being, and that state of being</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.939" end="01:16:09.920" style="s2">has a goal which is you eating some popcorn,<br />and it has you where you are which is in an</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.920" end="01:16:17.699" style="s2">insufficient state of popcorn and then what&#39;s<br />happening as well is that the motor processes</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.699" end="01:16:21.789" style="s2">that you would use to implement that are also<br />disinhibited.</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.789" end="01:16:22.789" style="s2">They&#39;re there.</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.789" end="01:16:24.849" style="s2">You already know how to do it.</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.849" end="01:16:28.469" style="s2">They get disinhibited or you can think of<br />them as getting primed.</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.469" end="01:16:29.469" style="s2">They&#39;re not.</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.469" end="01:16:31.570" style="s2">They&#39;re getting disinhibited, but you can<br />think of them as getting primed.</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.570" end="01:16:37.619" style="s2">And at some point, that becomes overwhelming<br />enough - say, pressure from the hypothalamus</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.619" end="01:16:39.590" style="s2">which is really what&#39;s bloody well in control.</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.590" end="01:16:42.659" style="s2">It says yeah, yeah, enough internet surfing.</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.659" end="01:16:46.249" style="s2">Off to the popcorn, and so you leap up and<br />then what do you do?</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.249" end="01:16:49.219" style="s2">You reorient the way you&#39;re looking at the<br />world.</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.219" end="01:16:54.360" style="s2">Everything in the world becomes low resolution,<br />or even zero except those few things that</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.360" end="01:16:56.739" style="s2">are relevant to your new quest.</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.739" end="01:16:57.949" style="s2">Down the stairs you go.</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.949" end="01:17:02.710" style="s2">You find the right pan; you find the popcorn,<br />getting irritated if you can&#39;t find it, right,</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.710" end="01:17:08.170" style="s2">because - now you see it’s interesting because<br />your emotions align along your goals.</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.170" end="01:17:13.809" style="s2">As long as you&#39;re pursuing a beeline to your<br />goal, and everything&#39;s laying itself out not</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.809" end="01:17:19.900" style="s2">as you’d expect, but as you want, then your<br />emotions stay positive but as soon as something</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.900" end="01:17:24.429" style="s2">deviates then you&#39;re irritated, and the reason<br />for that is like let’s say you can&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.429" end="01:17:25.679" style="s2">a popcorn pan.</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.679" end="01:17:29.449" style="s2">Well your brain is computing, well something<br />like this.</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.449" end="01:17:36.090" style="s2">This is obviously not how it works, but it’s<br />an - x amount of energy and matter from popcorn</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.090" end="01:17:37.989" style="s2">means it has x value.</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.989" end="01:17:45.469" style="s2">If you expend a whole bunch of energy running<br />around in your clueless state trying to acquire</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.469" end="01:17:48.969" style="s2">popcorn, you can easily get to the point where<br />you&#39;ve expended more energy and time than</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.969" end="01:17:50.650" style="s2">the popcorn delivers.</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.650" end="01:17:53.150" style="s2">And if you do that for a month, then you die.</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.150" end="01:17:58.880" style="s2">So it’s perfectly reasonable for you to<br />get irritated when the path length to your</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.880" end="01:18:03.739" style="s2">destination increases radically, and you might<br />get even more irritated if you can’t find</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.739" end="01:18:08.920" style="s2">any popcorn, and it’s like oh no I have<br />to dispense with the popcorn micro personality</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.920" end="01:18:11.860" style="s2">and it’s all irritated because it’s sort<br />of alive.</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.860" end="01:18:15.380" style="s2">It’s irritated you have to squash it, and<br />then you have to come up with well maybe I</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.380" end="01:18:16.829" style="s2">can have a peanut butter sandwich.</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.829" end="01:18:22.820" style="s2">And then pop, up comes a new micro personality<br />that orients itself towards the goal, and</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.820" end="01:18:26.829" style="s2">so all the time you’re doing that, you&#39;re<br />always in a motivated state.</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.829" end="01:18:33.800" style="s2">Now, it’s not a drive because it’s not<br />deterministic, but it does have a behavioral</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.800" end="01:18:34.800" style="s2">element.</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.800" end="01:18:37.540" style="s2">You have all these Piagetian subroutines.</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.540" end="01:18:43.289" style="s2">They&#39;re stored in your body, you know, all<br />your body capacity or your skills.</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.289" end="01:18:48.250" style="s2">And you know which set of those you’re likely<br />to use if you’re going to do x thing.</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.250" end="01:18:53.989" style="s2">So those get prepared, and then your perceptions<br />reorient towards the new goal.</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.989" end="01:18:55.729" style="s2">It’s like a hunting goal.</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.729" end="01:18:59.650" style="s2">You&#39;re fixated on it, and then your emotions<br />orient along that so as long as things are</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.650" end="01:19:01.570" style="s2">going well, you&#39;re happy.</p>
<p begin="01:19:01.570" end="01:19:02.699" style="s2">You’re hopeful.</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.699" end="01:19:03.699" style="s2">Things are proceeding.</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.699" end="01:19:07.769" style="s2">That’s positive emotion; that’s dopaminergically<br />mediated, and if things aren&#39;t going well</p>
<p begin="01:19:07.769" end="01:19:12.040" style="s2">it’s either, well, it’s any amount of<br />negative emotion from mild irritation to full</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.040" end="01:19:13.800" style="s2">blown temper tantrum.</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.800" end="01:19:19.689" style="s2">So that’s - and you’re - okay that’s<br />the simple story.</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.689" end="01:19:25.409" style="s2">The complex story is okay, you’re hungry,<br />you’re thirsty, you’re tired, you’re</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.409" end="01:19:27.079" style="s2">hot, you’re lonely.</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.079" end="01:19:28.079" style="s2">You need to play.</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.079" end="01:19:32.690" style="s2">Okay, so let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got, for the sake<br />of argument, let’s say you have eight fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.690" end="01:19:34.789" style="s2">motivational systems.</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.789" end="01:19:36.699" style="s2">Now, who cares how many.</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.699" end="01:19:37.699" style="s2">It’s a finite set.</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.699" end="01:19:38.869" style="s2">It’s under twenty.</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.869" end="01:19:40.599" style="s2">Depends on whether you include anger.</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.599" end="01:19:42.380" style="s2">Is anger motivation or emotion?</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.380" end="01:19:44.280" style="s2">Is pain motivation or emotion?</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.280" end="01:19:48.530" style="s2">We don’t care because they&#39;re not formal<br />categories.</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.530" end="01:19:57.269" style="s2">So anyways, there&#39;s a set number of them and<br />then so they have to run to satiation.</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.269" end="01:20:02.010" style="s2">So what satiation means is they set up an<br />end state; you perform the routines, you achieve</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.010" end="01:20:04.550" style="s2">the end state, and the system shuts down.</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.550" end="01:20:05.840" style="s2">It’s satiated.</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.840" end="01:20:10.610" style="s2">Now you&#39;ll experience that as satisfaction,<br />not as pleasure.</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.610" end="01:20:12.829" style="s2">And you’ll think well what&#39;s the difference?</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.829" end="01:20:14.579" style="s2">It’s tight.</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.579" end="01:20:18.590" style="s2">It’s complicated, but it’s important.</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.590" end="01:20:24.539" style="s2">The kind of positive emotion that people really<br />like is associated with search and the hope,</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.539" end="01:20:29.159" style="s2">not with the acquiry because what happens<br />when you acquire is well you&#39;re no longer</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.159" end="01:20:36.059" style="s2">in this state which has an impulse to action<br />in it, but that&#39;s exciting.</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.059" end="01:20:37.059" style="s2">That’s fun.</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.059" end="01:20:38.059" style="s2">You&#39;re on the track of something.</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.059" end="01:20:40.550" style="s2">It’s like you’re alive while you&#39;re searching<br />for something.</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.550" end="01:20:41.550" style="s2">Well then you find it.</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.550" end="01:20:44.999" style="s2">It’s like good, you need to find it, but<br />then the whole thing disappears and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.999" end="01:20:48.040" style="s2">sitting there thinking well I’ve just graduated.</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.040" end="01:20:49.040" style="s2">Now what?</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.040" end="01:20:51.090" style="s2">Right, because that’s what’ll happen when<br />you graduate.</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.090" end="01:20:52.669" style="s2">It’s like hey you&#39;re a student.</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.669" end="01:20:54.230" style="s2">You&#39;ve got status.</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.230" end="01:20:57.219" style="s2">You’ve got a hierarchy of values.</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.219" end="01:21:01.860" style="s2">You&#39;ve got a way of orienting yourself in<br />the world, and you have an identity.</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.860" end="01:21:05.130" style="s2">So you&#39;re in there, and everyone&#39;s happy about<br />it and so one day you graduate.</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.130" end="01:21:06.659" style="s2">It’s like success.</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.659" end="01:21:11.249" style="s2">Well really, it’s like poof that’s gone,<br />and the next thing you know, you’re like</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.249" end="01:21:13.800" style="s2">handing out coffee at the local Starbucks.</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.800" end="01:21:16.080" style="s2">Yeah, well you get the point.</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.080" end="01:21:17.369" style="s2">You&#39;ve experienced this all the time in your<br />life.</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.369" end="01:21:18.949" style="s2">You hit a pinnacle.</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.949" end="01:21:24.650" style="s2">You&#39;ve obtained something, but the problem<br />is that now what?</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.650" end="01:21:27.119" style="s2">You have to conjure up a whole new you.</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.119" end="01:21:31.599" style="s2">So some of it is satisfying, you’ve accomplished<br />a goal, but some of it’s just a big pain</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.599" end="01:21:32.599" style="s2">in the neck.</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.599" end="01:21:38.300" style="s2">It’s like uh oh, student me has disappeared<br />and now it’s frantically searching for employment</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.300" end="01:21:44.869" style="s2">me, and that me doesn&#39;t have the status, and<br />is in a space of much more radical uncertainty.</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.869" end="01:21:52.449" style="s2">So don&#39;t be thinking that getting to where<br />you want to go is what you want.</p>
<p begin="01:21:52.449" end="01:21:56.179" style="s2">What you want is to bloody well make sure<br />that the voyage is worth it.</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.179" end="01:22:02.679" style="s2">Now it’s very interesting because people<br />are really wired up this way, and I think</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.679" end="01:22:05.820" style="s2">it’s because we’re so radically exploratory.</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.820" end="01:22:14.269" style="s2">So, when you’re proceeding towards a valued<br />goal, let’s call that a cue that goal attainment</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.269" end="01:22:15.659" style="s2">is about to occur.</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.659" end="01:22:17.510" style="s2">It’s going to occur in some chain.</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.510" end="01:22:21.260" style="s2">A leads to B, B leads to C, C leads to D,<br />and so on.</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.260" end="01:22:23.699" style="s2">You&#39;re like a hound on a trail.</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.699" end="01:22:25.659" style="s2">It’s positive, like yeah this is working.</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.659" end="01:22:26.659" style="s2">Yeah, this is working.</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.659" end="01:22:27.659" style="s2">Yeah, this is working.</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.659" end="01:22:28.659" style="s2">That’s positive.</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.659" end="01:22:32.110" style="s2">It’s moving you ahead, and that&#39;s really<br />where you experience a lot of your positive</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.110" end="01:22:33.110" style="s2">emotion.</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.110" end="01:22:34.110" style="s2">That’s dopaminergically mediated.</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.110" end="01:22:38.989" style="s2">That’s the system you kick with cocaine<br />or any of the other drugs of abuse that people</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.989" end="01:22:42.050" style="s2">use that don&#39;t quell anxiety.</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.050" end="01:22:46.489" style="s2">It’s a very, very desirable motivational<br />state.</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.489" end="01:22:54.039" style="s2">I read awhile back somebody who said you can<br />buy anything but you can&#39;t buy wanting anything,</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.039" end="01:22:59.909" style="s2">and that&#39;s a staggeringly interesting comment<br />because you think well, is wanting a positive</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.909" end="01:23:00.909" style="s2">state?</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.909" end="01:23:05.159" style="s2">Well you don&#39;t have it, so that&#39;s kind of<br />annoying and you think, “No I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.159" end="01:23:06.159" style="s2">to want things.</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.159" end="01:23:07.159" style="s2">I want to have them.”</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.159" end="01:23:10.250" style="s2">It’s like yeah, don’t be so sure about<br />that.</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.250" end="01:23:13.530" style="s2">So one of the things, one of the ways people<br />have figured out how to deal with that is</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.530" end="01:23:18.340" style="s2">they decide they want something that they<br />can&#39;t get and that&#39;s actually extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.340" end="01:23:20.429" style="s2">smart, and it’s a deep archetypal idea.</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.429" end="01:23:21.670" style="s2">Here’s an example.</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.670" end="01:23:24.340" style="s2">You’ve seen Pinocchio, right?</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.340" end="01:23:27.620" style="s2">Okay, so Pinocchio is about a puppet, a marionette.</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.620" end="01:23:30.510" style="s2">So that means someone else is pulling his<br />strings.</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.510" end="01:23:31.510" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.510" end="01:23:32.559" style="s2">We don&#39;t know who.</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.559" end="01:23:34.919" style="s2">Sometimes it’s virtually Satan himself.</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.919" end="01:23:37.659" style="s2">Remember the Stromboli?</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.659" end="01:23:40.989" style="s2">There&#39;s another character just after him is<br />the coachman.</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.989" end="01:23:46.829" style="s2">The coachman, he’s like king of the thieves<br />and he ends up pulling Pinocchio’s strings.</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.829" end="01:23:52.510" style="s2">So there’s one scene in the Disney movie<br />where the coachman reveals himself and he’s</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.510" end="01:23:57.409" style="s2">completely red, he has really big teeth; he’s<br />a satanic figure, and he scares the fox and</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.409" end="01:24:01.719" style="s2">the cat who are like low level criminals who<br />think they&#39;re bad, but you know, have never</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.719" end="01:24:02.719" style="s2">really met bad.</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.719" end="01:24:07.289" style="s2">He just scares them right into the corner,<br />and so it’s all of a sudden this person</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.289" end="01:24:11.840" style="s2">reveals the archetype behind and just closes<br />back down pulling Pinocchio’s strings.</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.840" end="01:24:12.999" style="s2">Okay, now.</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.999" end="01:24:14.550" style="s2">He’s a marionette.</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.550" end="01:24:18.969" style="s2">Well, the first question that arises is who’s<br />pulling your strings?</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.969" end="01:24:20.860" style="s2">And that’s a really good question.</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.860" end="01:24:25.329" style="s2">One of the things Jung said was “People<br />don&#39;t have ideas, ideas have people.”</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.329" end="01:24:30.229" style="s2">You know, you can think about that for about<br />three months and it should make you afraid</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.229" end="01:24:37.019" style="s2">the whole time because as soon as you get<br />that, you think uh oh.</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.019" end="01:24:42.210" style="s2">Let’s say you&#39;re an ideologue of some sort<br />because some of you probably are: socialist,</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.210" end="01:24:45.810" style="s2">fascist, environmentalist, something that<br />has -ist on the end.</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.810" end="01:24:48.679" style="s2">It’s like you think those are your ideas.</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.679" end="01:24:50.519" style="s2">They’re not.</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.519" end="01:24:52.900" style="s2">You&#39;re their tools and that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.900" end="01:24:58.039" style="s2">If you want to be a tool of those ideas, you<br />go right ahead, but you don&#39;t know where those</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.039" end="01:25:01.749" style="s2">ideas are leading and they could well be leading<br />somewhere you do not want to go.</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.749" end="01:25:06.590" style="s2">Now the plus side is you don&#39;t have to take<br />responsibility for it because you’re just</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.590" end="01:25:08.590" style="s2">drifting in an ocean of thought.</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.590" end="01:25:12.650" style="s2">But one of the things that I learned from<br />Jung was you should figure out just exactly</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.650" end="01:25:17.550" style="s2">which ideas are possessing you and then you<br />should decide if those are your ideas, and</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.550" end="01:25:19.460" style="s2">the probability that they are is zero.</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.460" end="01:25:21.480" style="s2">They’re not your ideas.</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.480" end="01:25:23.449" style="s2">It’s hard to have your own ideas.</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.449" end="01:25:29.039" style="s2">You have to derive them from your own experience,<br />and especially when you&#39;re not very old, you</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.039" end="01:25:34.729" style="s2">don&#39;t have that much experience and so you<br />can grab books full of ideas and claim them</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.729" end="01:25:37.619" style="s2">for your own which is not acceptable.</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.619" end="01:25:42.969" style="s2">You can use those ideas to inform your ideas,<br />but they&#39;re not your ideas.</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.969" end="01:25:47.539" style="s2">You&#39;re just a puppet, and you know the Pinocchio<br />movie is very interesting that way because</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.539" end="01:25:51.090" style="s2">he&#39;s a puppet of forces that are really not<br />on his side.</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.090" end="01:25:53.080" style="s2">Seriously not on his side.</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.080" end="01:25:55.739" style="s2">Okay anyways, back to the Pinocchio movie.</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.739" end="01:25:57.059" style="s2">Give me one second.</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.059" end="01:25:58.729" style="s2">So Geppetto doesn&#39;t have a son.</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.729" end="01:26:00.130" style="s2">Now, Geppetto’s a good guy right?</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.130" end="01:26:01.150" style="s2">He’s a toymaker.</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.150" end="01:26:03.179" style="s2">He’s got this little warm cabin.</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.179" end="01:26:04.179" style="s2">It’s cozy.</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.179" end="01:26:05.179" style="s2">He’s a good guy.</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.179" end="01:26:06.179" style="s2">He’s friendly.</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.179" end="01:26:07.179" style="s2">He has a little cat.</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.179" end="01:26:10.139" style="s2">He pays attention to his little fish, he takes<br />care of that.</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.139" end="01:26:13.999" style="s2">So we know Geppetto’s a good guy and he<br />makes this puppet and he thinks, “Man I’ve</p>
<p begin="01:26:13.999" end="01:26:16.959" style="s2">got a puppet but maybe I’d rather have something<br />real.</p>
<p begin="01:26:16.959" end="01:26:18.689" style="s2">That’s a good question for parents.</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.689" end="01:26:21.770" style="s2">You want a puppet, or do you want something<br />real?</p>
<p begin="01:26:21.770" end="01:26:26.250" style="s2">And the answer is, generally often, I’ll<br />just have a puppet as long as it does exactly</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.250" end="01:26:30.489" style="s2">what it - maybe it’ll be a medical school<br />puppet because that&#39;s certainly one good form</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.489" end="01:26:32.030" style="s2">of puppet.</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.030" end="01:26:37.659" style="s2">Okay, so Geppetto decides cause he’s a good<br />guy, he thinks no no I don&#39;t want this thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.659" end="01:26:38.659" style="s2">to have strings.</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.659" end="01:26:39.659" style="s2">I want it to be its own thing.</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.659" end="01:26:41.960" style="s2">I want it to be autonomous, individual, real.</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.960" end="01:26:44.199" style="s2">Okay, so what does he do?</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.199" end="01:26:45.199" style="s2">He wishes.</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.199" end="01:26:46.199" style="s2">Right?</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.199" end="01:26:47.199" style="s2">What’s he wish on?</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.199" end="01:26:48.199" style="s2">A star.</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.199" end="01:26:50.019" style="s2">Why do people wish on stars?</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.019" end="01:26:51.599" style="s2">Of all the crazy things.</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.599" end="01:26:54.829" style="s2">Well it’s a divine thing.</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.829" end="01:26:59.469" style="s2">It’s like there’s heaven, it’s all - it’s<br />at the infinite.</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.469" end="01:27:02.449" style="s2">You go out at night and you see the stars,<br />which you can&#39;t in the city but you go out</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.449" end="01:27:06.940" style="s2">somewhere dark and you see the stars, and<br />it’s like you and the infinite.</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.940" end="01:27:08.159" style="s2">And it really is.</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.159" end="01:27:13.889" style="s2">It’s a perfect representation of your relationship<br />with the infinite because the universe is</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.889" end="01:27:17.949" style="s2">about as infinite as you need, and it’s<br />going to give you a sense of awe and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.949" end="01:27:21.199" style="s2">partly why archaic people partly thought God<br />was in the sky.</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.199" end="01:27:24.809" style="s2">It’s like, they weren&#39;t stupid, these people.</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.809" end="01:27:32.389" style="s2">They thought God is what fills you with awe,<br />so you look at the sky and think wow, that’s</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.389" end="01:27:33.389" style="s2">something.</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.389" end="01:27:35.829" style="s2">It’s an instinct.</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.829" end="01:27:38.800" style="s2">It’s not a cognitive construction.</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.800" end="01:27:42.619" style="s2">So anyways, you aim at a star, and it’s<br />this twinkling thing in the darkness, right.</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.619" end="01:27:49.230" style="s2">It’s the light in the darkness and it’s<br />above the worldly environment.</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.230" end="01:27:51.880" style="s2">It’s something transcendent.</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.880" end="01:27:53.909" style="s2">So that’s what Geppetto wishes on.</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.909" end="01:27:56.110" style="s2">It’s like, I’m gonna aim high.</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.110" end="01:27:57.249" style="s2">That’s what he says.</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.249" end="01:27:58.249" style="s2">Aim high.</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.249" end="01:28:01.349" style="s2">And he thinks well it’s not very likely<br />but I might as well aim high.</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.349" end="01:28:04.329" style="s2">That’s a very good piece of advice.</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.329" end="01:28:08.070" style="s2">You want to aim so high you can&#39;t attain it<br />because then you&#39;ve got something worth - you</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.070" end="01:28:09.650" style="s2">might think that’s such perverse.</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.650" end="01:28:12.429" style="s2">That’s such a perverse piece of advice.</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.429" end="01:28:15.579" style="s2">Why would you chase something you can&#39;t have?</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.579" end="01:28:21.610" style="s2">Well the answer might be cause the chasing<br />is worth it, and then you might think well</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.610" end="01:28:22.610" style="s2">what’s worth it?</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.610" end="01:28:24.280" style="s2">Well I can give you a hint about that too.</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.280" end="01:28:29.070" style="s2">It’s like develop your character because<br />what you&#39;ve got is what you carry with you</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.070" end="01:28:34.269" style="s2">wherever you go, and it’s way better to<br />be able to do things than to be rich cause</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.269" end="01:28:36.729" style="s2">if you&#39;re rich, well then that disappears.</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.729" end="01:28:37.900" style="s2">Poof, you&#39;re poor.</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.900" end="01:28:43.860" style="s2">But if you can do things short of being demolished,<br />and even then people are unbelievable at overcoming</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.860" end="01:28:44.860" style="s2">those things.</p>
<p begin="01:28:44.860" end="01:28:47.769" style="s2">It’s like you&#39;re on the way.</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.769" end="01:28:51.919" style="s2">Here’s an interesting experiment we did<br />with undergraduate women.</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.919" end="01:28:54.849" style="s2">So, there&#39;s this idea in evolutionary psychology.</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.849" end="01:29:00.110" style="s2">It’s called hypergamy, and hypergamy is<br />the tendency of women to choose mates who</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.110" end="01:29:04.179" style="s2">are slightly older than them, it’s about<br />four years on average cross culturally, and</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.179" end="01:29:08.709" style="s2">who are higher in the status hierarchy than<br />they are.</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.709" end="01:29:14.510" style="s2">It’s a very well documented tendency, and<br />people who are cynical about that think women</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.510" end="01:29:18.699" style="s2">want wealth, and I thought well it’s not<br />a bad theory because it kind of evens the</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.699" end="01:29:19.699" style="s2">scales.</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.699" end="01:29:20.750" style="s2">It’s like you&#39;re gonna have a family.</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.750" end="01:29:28.579" style="s2">You’re basically - a chimpanzee baby clings<br />to its mother’s fur for five thousand miles</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.579" end="01:29:30.929" style="s2">in the three or four years its doing its clinging.</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.929" end="01:29:36.150" style="s2">It’s like its a major league impediment,<br />and you know, if you&#39;re a new mother, your</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.150" end="01:29:39.900" style="s2">life is so much more complicated than it is<br />when you were single that it’s not even</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.900" end="01:29:41.380" style="s2">the same conceptual universe.</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.380" end="01:29:46.400" style="s2">It’s a major league responsibility, and<br />it slows you down.</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.400" end="01:29:50.139" style="s2">So you might think the logical thing to do<br />is to balance the scales a little bit and</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.139" end="01:29:53.439" style="s2">that&#39;s perfectly reasonable, but I thought,<br />“Nah, I bet you women are smarter than that.”</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.439" end="01:30:01.119" style="s2">I bet you can fool them, and the pick up artists<br />do that all the time because they mimic status.</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.119" end="01:30:05.360" style="s2">So, you can fool them but they&#39;re smart.</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.360" end="01:30:09.229" style="s2">So what we did - I never published this for<br />a bunch of reasons, but.</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.229" end="01:30:14.429" style="s2">Okay so what we did was we took pictures of<br />the same guy - you know kind of an average</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.429" end="01:30:15.429" style="s2">looking guy.</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.429" end="01:30:21.489" style="s2">He’s alright, and we had four stories about<br />him, and one story was a poor useless guy.</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.489" end="01:30:23.090" style="s2">That’s an easy story right.</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.090" end="01:30:27.419" style="s2">You know, sits on his couch, plays video games,<br />eats Cheetos, covered with dust.</p>
