<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">could try well it&#39;s funny because</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:04.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:07.380" style="s2">one of the groups who might be most</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.670" end="00:02:09.390" style="s2">viscerally familiar with some of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.380" end="00:02:12.260" style="s2">propositions of deep code are in fact</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.390" end="00:02:14.010" style="s2">truck drivers because as we know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.260" end="00:02:16.760" style="s2">self-driving car</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.010" end="00:02:19.409" style="s2">disruption is going to be hitting trucks</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.760" end="00:02:20.459" style="s2">relatively soon and so truck drivers are</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.409" end="00:02:23.610" style="s2">going to find themselves on the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.459" end="00:02:25.049" style="s2">side of a major disruption wave so part</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.610" end="00:02:27.870" style="s2">of the deep code proposition might be</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.049" end="00:02:30.629" style="s2">well a this is happening maybe be why</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.870" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">it&#39;s happening and see what it means for</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.629" end="00:02:34.410" style="s2">you how you might be able to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:36.330" style="s2">it I&#39;ll try to see if I can do it very</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.410" end="00:02:38.190" style="s2">simply I&#39;ll begin with something we</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.330" end="00:02:40.860" style="s2">actually maybe too simple well I&#39;d like</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.190" end="00:02:44.159" style="s2">to first propose is that we can think</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.860" end="00:02:46.530" style="s2">about a particular thing that we humans</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.159" end="00:02:48.870" style="s2">do called civilization as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.530" end="00:02:51.239" style="s2">game in a very strong sense humans are</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.870" end="00:02:53.730" style="s2">very simple at a basic level we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.239" end="00:02:55.769" style="s2">have that many distinct kinds of needs</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.730" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">maybe on the order of like twenty or</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.769" end="00:02:59.220" style="s2">thirty distinct needs that we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:01.260" style="s2">able to eat we need to be able to have</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.220" end="00:03:03.359" style="s2">water we need to have safe shelter we</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.260" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">need to be able to find mates we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.359" end="00:03:07.890" style="s2">more than say dogs because we need also</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:09.599" style="s2">to have access to creative expression</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.890" end="00:03:11.099" style="s2">and a sense of connection to something</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.599" end="00:03:13.290" style="s2">that is greater than ourselves or so the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.099" end="00:03:14.879" style="s2">social psychologists who study these</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.290" end="00:03:17.450" style="s2">things tell us but nonetheless they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.879" end="00:03:22.739" style="s2">actually there&#39;s nothing on the list and</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.450" end="00:03:25.919" style="s2">we can notice that what we try to do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.739" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">we try to go about and build different</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.919" end="00:03:33.030" style="s2">kinds of institutions say like fast-food</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:35.730" style="s2">restaurants and grocery stores or</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.030" end="00:03:38.639" style="s2">collective gatherings where people cook</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.730" end="00:03:40.260" style="s2">for each other pot logs that are ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.639" end="00:03:42.419" style="s2">that we go about getting our needs met</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.260" end="00:03:46.099" style="s2">and then of course are many many so we</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.419" end="00:03:49.709" style="s2">could describe a given culture as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.099" end="00:03:53.329" style="s2">collection of a whole lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.709" end="00:03:55.680" style="s2">kinds of institutions and practices that</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.329" end="00:03:57.540" style="s2">collectively try to get our needs met</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.680" end="00:03:59.250" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna say that we can we could think</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.540" end="00:04:02.669" style="s2">about that as something like a game</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.250" end="00:04:06.480" style="s2">meaning that there are roles that people</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.669" end="00:04:07.769" style="s2">play there are ways of sensing or</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.480" end="00:04:10.049" style="s2">measuring whether or not it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.769" end="00:04:12.840" style="s2">being done well you know if you throw a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.049" end="00:04:15.930" style="s2">dinner party it&#39;s not necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.840" end="00:04:17.760" style="s2">same as say poker or basketball but</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.930" end="00:04:20.970" style="s2">nonetheless there&#39;s a sense of did it</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.760" end="00:04:22.800" style="s2">come together well or not and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.970" end="00:04:25.650" style="s2">if nobody ate food you could say that it</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:27.270" style="s2">was a failure and by contrast if</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.650" end="00:04:27.830" style="s2">everybody decided to come back again you</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.270" end="00:04:29.810" style="s2">could say maybe</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.830" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">success but most importantly it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.810" end="00:04:34.970" style="s2">of invented you know we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">large amount of inheritances from</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.970" end="00:04:39.169" style="s2">evolution that we humans didn&#39;t play any</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:41.840" style="s2">meaningful role in doing ourselves right</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.169" end="00:04:44.720" style="s2">we have our biology is received and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.840" end="00:04:48.680" style="s2">large portion of our developmental path</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.720" end="00:04:51.830" style="s2">is received but the specific cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.680" end="00:04:54.169" style="s2">artifacts within our choices that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.830" end="00:04:56.710" style="s2">made either right now like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.169" end="00:04:58.909" style="s2">choosing to communicate right now or</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.710" end="00:05:01.430" style="s2">somebody in the past made certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.909" end="00:05:03.289" style="s2">choices like somebody at the Xoom</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.430" end="00:05:05.300" style="s2">corporation made the choice to create</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.289" end="00:05:06.770" style="s2">this particular kind of software so now</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.300" end="00:05:10.990" style="s2">this exists as a thing that we can</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.770" end="00:05:13.849" style="s2">access so within the context of culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.990" end="00:05:15.800" style="s2">as being a kind of a game meaning that</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.849" end="00:05:17.569" style="s2">it&#39;s the thing that is constructed by</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.800" end="00:05:20.120" style="s2">humans and is held together by humans</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.569" end="00:05:20.569" style="s2">continuing to choose to interact in that</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.569" end="00:05:28.099" style="s2">what did code has done is take a look at</p>

<p begin="00:06:23.599" end="00:06:27.050" style="s2">works is that it consumes its fuel so</p>

<p begin="00:06:33.560" end="00:06:37.940" style="s2">we can actually take a if you take a</p>

<p begin="00:06:41.689" end="00:06:47.059" style="s2">say ah Sh I see it will always play out</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.779" end="00:06:50.419" style="s2">in a certain way and as a consequence it</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.059" end="00:06:52.879" style="s2">will actually collapse in some time it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:06:55.819" end="00:07:01.879" style="s2">also has there&#39;s an unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.719" end="00:07:05.269" style="s2">characteristic which is that the longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.879" end="00:07:07.399" style="s2">you wait for it to collapse the more</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.399" end="00:07:12.259" style="s2">be there&#39;s a point where you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.079" end="00:07:14.779" style="s2">identify that it&#39;s sort of overripe and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.259" end="00:07:17.449" style="s2">it&#39;s time to begin moving on and</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.779" end="00:07:19.519" style="s2">changing things but often times we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.449" end="00:07:22.300" style="s2">actually choose to elegantly innovate</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.519" end="00:07:26.629" style="s2">new approaches we actually choose to</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.300" end="00:07:28.579" style="s2">stick very strongly to old approaches</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.629" end="00:07:30.079" style="s2">that are failing and when ends up</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.579" end="00:07:34.429" style="s2">happening is the result is that we get a</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.079" end="00:07:37.339" style="s2">short-term burst of what may feel like</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.429" end="00:07:39.229" style="s2">success but what&#39;s actually happening is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.339" end="00:07:41.389" style="s2">they were eating our seed corn to use</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.229" end="00:07:42.469" style="s2">that that idiom and then when it&#39;s up</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.389" end="00:07:43.999" style="s2">happening is that when we hit rock</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.469" end="00:07:45.860" style="s2">bottom we hit rock bottom hard and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.999" end="00:07:47.479" style="s2">that&#39;s why it ends up being a collapsed</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.860" end="00:07:49.279" style="s2">things fall apart so there&#39;s a lot that</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.479" end="00:07:51.829" style="s2">goes into that there&#39;s a whole bunch in</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.279" end="00:07:53.349" style="s2">that level of analysis and he could</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.829" end="00:07:55.429" style="s2">spent a substantial amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.349" end="00:07:57.019" style="s2">looking at those kinds of things and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.429" end="00:07:59.029" style="s2">trying to get deeper and deeper clarity</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.019" end="00:08:01.479" style="s2">to understand well why why would this be</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.029" end="00:08:03.499" style="s2">the case and also where are we on that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.479" end="00:08:05.629" style="s2">trajectory and then of course you can</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.499" end="00:08:07.819" style="s2">use those two ideas to make predictions</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.629" end="00:08:10.429" style="s2">about what might happen over the next 5</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.819" end="00:08:15.019" style="s2">10 15 20 30 years so then the second</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.429" end="00:08:20.059" style="s2">major piece has been trying to use this</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.019" end="00:08:22.159" style="s2">set of frameworks to design a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.059" end="00:08:25.459" style="s2">civilization will has to be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.159" end="00:08:28.969" style="s2">three things it has to be able to deal</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.459" end="00:08:30.559" style="s2">with the kinds of problems that we will</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.969" end="00:08:33.829" style="s2">be facing in the 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.559" end="00:08:36.919" style="s2">it has to be able to do so in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.829" end="00:08:40.699" style="s2">context of being in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.919" end="00:08:45.649" style="s2">the old civilization and it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.699" end="00:08:46.939" style="s2">able to navigate that transition so the</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.649" end="00:08:51.740" style="s2">vet ends up being what you might call</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.939" end="00:08:54.560" style="s2">the design criteria of a viable future</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.740" end="00:08:55.820" style="s2">civilization and then the third piece</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.560" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">deep cut has been doing is then</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.820" end="00:09:01.220" style="s2">endeavoring to activate or actuate on</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.360" end="00:09:04.460" style="s2">those design characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.220" end="00:09:07.550" style="s2">okay well given this map of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.460" end="00:09:10.610" style="s2">happening and of what&#39;s likely to happen</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.550" end="00:09:12.980" style="s2">and given this sense of what things are</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.610" end="00:09:16.790" style="s2">necessary and possibly sufficient for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.980" end="00:09:18.790" style="s2">viable solution what must we do and by</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.790" end="00:09:22.460" style="s2">the way what is urgent that we do now</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.790" end="00:09:24.410" style="s2">and then what are the actual projects</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.460" end="00:09:27.850" style="s2">that we can engage in now that will move</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.410" end="00:09:29.779" style="s2">things with the most leverage forward so</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.850" end="00:09:34.430" style="s2">felt like that was pretty large</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.779" end="00:09:36.430" style="s2">syllables but maybe that&#39;s li 22 where</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.430" end="00:09:39.380" style="s2">does the term deep code come from</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.430" end="00:09:42.610" style="s2">actually the a gentleman named Jim rut I</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.380" end="00:09:46.130" style="s2">was collaborating with seven years ago</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.610" end="00:09:47.420" style="s2">simply coined it he just named it as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.130" end="00:09:50.000" style="s2">turns out it actually accidents of being</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.420" end="00:09:54.680" style="s2">a very apt name because what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.000" end="00:09:56.630" style="s2">looking at is the you know the old if</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.680" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">you give a man a fish eats for a day if</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.630" end="00:10:00.110" style="s2">you teach a man to fish he eats forever</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:03.290" style="s2">or the relationship between giving and</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.110" end="00:10:06.680" style="s2">teaching is a relation of depth that if</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.290" end="00:10:08.990" style="s2">I give you the teaching I&#39;m giving you</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.680" end="00:10:13.220" style="s2">something that is deeper than giving you</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.990" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">the consequence of the practice if I if</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.220" end="00:10:15.800" style="s2">I teach you how to fish I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.260" style="s2">something that is deeper than merely</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.800" end="00:10:20.180" style="s2">giving you a fish well you can go deeper</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.260" end="00:10:22.610" style="s2">still what I could do is I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.180" end="00:10:25.790" style="s2">potentially teach you how to invent</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.610" end="00:10:28.070" style="s2">fishing and I can go deeper still so the</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.790" end="00:10:29.930" style="s2">recognition is that when you&#39;re dealing</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.070" end="00:10:32.210" style="s2">with the kind of problem that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.930" end="00:10:36.470" style="s2">dealing with you have to get very good</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.210" end="00:10:38.120" style="s2">at being able to go deep because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.470" end="00:10:40.670" style="s2">always going to be operating on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.120" end="00:10:43.400" style="s2">basis of something something is going to</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.670" end="00:10:45.260" style="s2">be the basis of how you&#39;re making sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.400" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on and how you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.260" end="00:10:50.900" style="s2">choices in that context so if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:52.580" style="s2">able to be conscious of that basis</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.900" end="00:10:54.470" style="s2">you&#39;re not able to be aware of that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.580" end="00:10:57.920" style="s2">depth and then you&#39;re not able to enter</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.470" end="00:11:00.200" style="s2">into that depth enough skillfulness to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.920" end="00:11:01.880" style="s2">be able to actually modify and operate</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.200" end="00:11:03.890" style="s2">at that depth what you&#39;ll end up doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.880" end="00:11:05.510" style="s2">is you&#39;ll end up operating well frankly</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.890" end="00:11:08.060" style="s2">unconsciously you&#39;ll be operating with</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.510" end="00:11:09.650" style="s2">blind spots you&#39;ll be making assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.060" end="00:11:12.170" style="s2">did you don&#39;t even necessarily know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.650" end="00:11:14.750" style="s2">you&#39;re making and in this case we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.170" end="00:11:17.110" style="s2">actually talking about civilization</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.750" end="00:11:20.210" style="s2">itself and what I mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.110" end="00:11:23.330" style="s2">effectively everything that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.210" end="00:11:26.270" style="s2">have been doing as well as humans as</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.330" end="00:11:28.430" style="s2">opposed to as primates since pre</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.270" end="00:11:30.920" style="s2">agriculture for fifteen thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.430" end="00:11:34.580" style="s2">possibly even farther back has to</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.920" end="00:11:37.070" style="s2">actually be examined deeply and a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.580" end="00:11:39.100" style="s2">the details about particular things that</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.070" end="00:11:40.310" style="s2">were laid down choices that were made</p>

<p begin="00:11:40.310" end="00:11:44.330" style="s2">seventy-five thousand years ago have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.470" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">actually be made brought to light</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.330" end="00:11:49.910" style="s2">examines closely as to what those</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:53.270" style="s2">choices actually imply and then you may</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.910" end="00:11:54.590" style="s2">be unwound maybe you things designed to</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.270" end="00:11:56.450" style="s2">be laid down at that level of death</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.590" end="00:11:59.210" style="s2">or possibly kind of brushed off and</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.450" end="00:12:01.340" style="s2">clarified and put back into a fabric</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.210" end="00:12:03.170" style="s2">that then becomes the basis of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.340" end="00:12:05.120" style="s2">of culture and civilization that we need</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.170" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">can you give us an example let&#39;s take</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.120" end="00:12:12.340" style="s2">physics so what we typically do when</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:15.800" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do something useful is</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.340" end="00:12:18.350" style="s2">we go deep enough to have created a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.800" end="00:12:20.000" style="s2">foundation upon which we can do the</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.350" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">thing that we&#39;re trying to do and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.000" end="00:12:24.680" style="s2">we kind of try to leave that foundation</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:27.650" style="s2">untouched unless it&#39;s not working and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.680" end="00:12:29.600" style="s2">this is the entire essence of what</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.650" end="00:12:30.980" style="s2">Thomas Kuhn was exploring when he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.600" end="00:12:33.290" style="s2">looking at the structure of scientific</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.980" end="00:12:34.910" style="s2">revolutions this is the guy who coined</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.290" end="00:12:38.360" style="s2">the concepts of scientific paradigms is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.910" end="00:12:41.330" style="s2">that a scientific paradigm is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.360" end="00:12:43.820" style="s2">bunch of different kinds of fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.330" end="00:12:45.650" style="s2">assumptions and many of which ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.820" end="00:12:47.780" style="s2">become unconscious meaning that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.650" end="00:12:50.870" style="s2">even know that we&#39;ve made them and are</p>

<p begin="00:13:02.050" end="00:13:09.260" style="s2">objective independent of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.130" end="00:13:11.270" style="s2">are in them and this is the Newtonian</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.260" end="00:13:13.250" style="s2">model the Newtonian model has an</p>

<p begin="00:13:13.250" end="00:13:17.000" style="s2">something called space and you could</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:18.170" style="s2">talk about something called time even if</p>

<p begin="00:13:18.170" end="00:13:21.800" style="s2">there is still space and time and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.930" end="00:13:23.240" style="s2">what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.800" end="00:13:25.430" style="s2">that when you put something in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.240" end="00:13:27.589" style="s2">universe you know the classic thing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.430" end="00:13:29.029" style="s2">you imagine a sphere like a billiard</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.589" end="00:13:31.220" style="s2">ball you imagine the sphere sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.029" end="00:13:34.700" style="s2">appearing and it appears in a space that</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.220" end="00:13:36.170" style="s2">is somehow already pre-existing and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.700" end="00:13:38.209" style="s2">appears at a time that is already</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.170" end="00:13:40.750" style="s2">pre-existing and then this billiard ball</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.209" end="00:13:42.890" style="s2">operates in that environment and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.750" end="00:13:44.810" style="s2">Newtonian physics had that as an</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.890" end="00:13:47.240" style="s2">assumption and when we take a look at</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.810" end="00:13:49.519" style="s2">what general relativity did it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.240" end="00:13:51.350" style="s2">operate in the context of those set of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.519" end="00:13:53.720" style="s2">assumptions what it did that examined</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.350" end="00:13:55.940" style="s2">those assumptions themselves and so an</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.720" end="00:14:00.519" style="s2">Einstein thought hmm what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.940" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">actually is time what actually is space</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.519" end="00:14:04.820" style="s2">he brought into consciousness he brought</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.959" end="00:14:06.890" style="s2">into conscious contemplation the nature</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.820" end="00:14:09.970" style="s2">of the assumptions of the foundations of</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.890" end="00:14:12.380" style="s2">the physics he was operating in he then</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.970" end="00:14:14.329" style="s2">redesigned he reconsidered those</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.380" end="00:14:16.790" style="s2">assumptions into a new concept which is</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.329" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">now the space-time manifold and where</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.790" end="00:14:24.019" style="s2">you can&#39;t actually say space and time</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:26.029" style="s2">without also already including mass now</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.019" end="00:14:28.010" style="s2">again this is way outside the context of</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.029" end="00:14:30.620" style="s2">five-year-olds but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.010" end="00:14:32.180" style="s2">we&#39;re always operating on the basis of a</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.620" end="00:14:34.730" style="s2">whole set of unconscious assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.180" end="00:14:37.100" style="s2">that give us the tools that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.730" end="00:14:39.529" style="s2">have to then think and do at the higher</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.100" end="00:14:40.910" style="s2">level well what deep coat is done is</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.529" end="00:14:42.740" style="s2">deep could have said ok what&#39;s notice</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.910" end="00:14:44.540" style="s2">that quite often a lot of things that</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.740" end="00:14:47.410" style="s2">are challenging now are challenging</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.540" end="00:14:50.089" style="s2">because of the assumptions of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.410" end="00:14:51.980" style="s2">frameworks and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.089" end="00:14:54.350" style="s2">expectations that we&#39;re operating under</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.980" end="00:14:57.500" style="s2">let&#39;s go deeper and this just keep going</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.350" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">deeper until we get to something that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.500" end="00:15:04.279" style="s2">in fact deep enough for constructing an</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:08.630" style="s2">actual comprehensive civilization it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.279" end="00:15:12.949" style="s2">like there are layers on let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.630" end="00:15:15.560" style="s2">sphere and as the sphere rolls down it</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.949" end="00:15:17.480" style="s2">collects more layers you know as the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.560" end="00:15:19.399" style="s2">civilization progresses as evolution</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.480" end="00:15:22.370" style="s2">progresses it collects more stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.399" end="00:15:24.350" style="s2">then whatever is on the surface is what</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.370" end="00:15:27.079" style="s2">we&#39;re aware of is the layer that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.350" end="00:15:29.800" style="s2">function in but then there are all these</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.079" end="00:15:32.630" style="s2">other foundational layers before it that</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.800" end="00:15:35.699" style="s2">we don&#39;t understand that we take for</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:37.980" style="s2">granted or that we assume that you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.699" end="00:15:39.689" style="s2">top layers all there is and what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.980" end="00:15:42.779" style="s2">saying is that we have to dig down</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.689" end="00:15:46.529" style="s2">deeper to understand what all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.779" end="00:15:49.889" style="s2">rests on because the stuff that is on</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.529" end="00:15:51.869" style="s2">the outside right now is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.889" end="00:15:53.609" style="s2">sustainable for itself it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.869" end="00:15:54.839" style="s2">collapse onto itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.609" end="00:15:56.519" style="s2">you&#39;ve got me thinking about a few</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.839" end="00:15:57.959" style="s2">things here that are really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.519" end="00:16:00.689" style="s2">I&#39;ve never thought of the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.959" end="00:16:03.600" style="s2">what is space and time without matter in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.689" end="00:16:05.549" style="s2">it like what is an empty grid I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.600" end="00:16:09.119" style="s2">thought of that and the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.549" end="00:16:10.889" style="s2">really was interesting is the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.119" end="00:16:12.629" style="s2">that you started with teach a man to</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.889" end="00:16:14.579" style="s2">fish or give a man a fish teach a man to</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.629" end="00:16:16.709" style="s2">fish teach a man to invent fishing and</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.579" end="00:16:17.999" style="s2">you said it goes deeper than that using</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.709" end="00:16:19.679" style="s2">that same analogy it&#39;d be really</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.999" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">interesting to figure out what the next</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.679" end="00:16:24.629" style="s2">layer is that you&#39;re talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.660" end="00:16:26.309" style="s2">fits into that analogy well as it turns</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.629" end="00:16:28.410" style="s2">out there&#39;s an answer to that this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.309" end="00:16:30.059" style="s2">not well I thought I&#39;d because when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.410" end="00:16:32.100" style="s2">get down to these lowest levels it</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.059" end="00:16:35.699" style="s2">actually gets very simple by definition</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.100" end="00:16:37.679" style="s2">because most of complicatedness is all</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.699" end="00:16:40.139" style="s2">the stuff where you get very low it gets</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.679" end="00:16:41.609" style="s2">very simple so almost at the bottom not</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.139" end="00:16:43.829" style="s2">quite at the bottom it when you get to</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.609" end="00:16:44.910" style="s2">the very bottom it actually isn&#39;t it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.829" end="00:16:47.489" style="s2">not the extremely simple but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.910" end="00:16:49.169" style="s2">difficult to communicate but almost at</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.489" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">the bottom we actually can identify a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.169" end="00:16:53.129" style="s2">handful of basic capacities I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:57.089" style="s2">see if I can walk you through these</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.129" end="00:17:00.119" style="s2">basic capacities one is what I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.089" end="00:17:04.079" style="s2">to call discernment and do I believe you</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.119" end="00:17:06.059" style="s2">recall the effort as a kid of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.079" end="00:17:09.299" style="s2">learn how to raise one eyebrow without</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.059" end="00:17:11.760" style="s2">raising the other eyebrow or I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.299" end="00:17:16.159" style="s2">even do that now anything okay well</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.760" end="00:17:16.159" style="s2">now&#39;s a good time Kenny can you maybe</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.220" end="00:17:24.089" style="s2">yeah yeah good or you&#39;re not doing it oh</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.120" end="00:17:25.319" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re doing it so this is a very</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.089" end="00:17:26.850" style="s2">simple thing you can also do it by the</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.319" end="00:17:28.350" style="s2">way with state juggling when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.850" end="00:17:30.899" style="s2">trying to learn how to juggle you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:17:30.899" end="00:17:36.990" style="s2">have any idea what it would mean to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.919" end="00:17:38.580" style="s2">doing the right thing when you&#39;re first</p>

<p begin="00:17:38.580" end="00:17:43.019" style="s2">and not another eyebrow you&#39;ll find it</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.860" end="00:17:44.879" style="s2">like you&#39;ll do all kinds of weird stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.019" end="00:17:46.169" style="s2">your face will be screwed up you&#39;ll be</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.470" end="00:17:53.970" style="s2">you don&#39;t actually have a path that</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.970" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">what it is you want to do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.140" end="00:17:58.770" style="s2">raise one eyebrow which is nice but you</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:00.299" style="s2">don&#39;t actually know how at all you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.770" end="00:18:02.610" style="s2">enter into a complete space of</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.299" end="00:18:05.480" style="s2">uncertainty and discernment is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.610" end="00:18:09.419" style="s2">particular capacity of being able to</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.090" end="00:18:20.400" style="s2">go any deeper than that it&#39;s the ability</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.070" end="00:18:23.580" style="s2">to sense very subtly at first very very</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.400" end="00:18:25.830" style="s2">suddenly that which is more in the</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.830" end="00:18:28.140" style="s2">you use juggling as the example if</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.210" end="00:18:30.570" style="s2">you&#39;ve ever tried to learn how to juggle</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.140" end="00:18:31.950" style="s2">there&#39;s a notion where you&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.950" end="00:18:37.020" style="s2">throwing the ball and then maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.289" end="00:18:39.000" style="s2">begin to get ah oh there it is and like</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.020" end="00:18:40.890" style="s2">a little tiny bit it&#39;s very vague it</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.000" end="00:18:42.780" style="s2">can&#39;t be named or described it&#39;s more in</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.890" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">the sense of building of feeling and</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.780" end="00:18:47.400" style="s2">constructing a whole set of deep</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:51.350" style="s2">feelings that have a way of orienting so</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.760" end="00:19:01.049" style="s2">do the third which is coherence so</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:05.490" style="s2">coherence is the degree to which you</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.990" end="00:19:26.250" style="s2">beginning to be able to grasp them as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.909" end="00:19:30.330" style="s2">whole beginning to able to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.250" end="00:19:32.220" style="s2">relate to them as a single coherent</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:34.289" style="s2">phenomenon and to bring them into</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.220" end="00:19:37.320" style="s2">relationship with each other where they</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.289" end="00:19:40.380" style="s2">begin to actually operate as a smooth</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.320" end="00:19:43.320" style="s2">whole can imagine that if you were to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.380" end="00:19:45.390" style="s2">imagine say for example a fishbowl that</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.320" end="00:19:46.830" style="s2">has a whole bunch of floating around in</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.390" end="00:19:48.390" style="s2">it and you&#39;re trying to get light to</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.830" end="00:19:51.210" style="s2">shine through it to a degree which you</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.390" end="00:19:53.690" style="s2">can go in and just very precisely move</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.210" end="00:19:56.130" style="s2">all of the dirt out of the water at once</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.690" end="00:19:58.409" style="s2">that actually being able to separate</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.130" end="00:20:01.470" style="s2">dirt from water is a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.409" end="00:20:02.809" style="s2">discernment that which is more than that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.470" end="00:20:03.980" style="s2">which is not and</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.809" end="00:20:06.049" style="s2">degree to which you&#39;re actually being</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.980" end="00:20:07.840" style="s2">able to pull all of it out and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.049" end="00:20:10.999" style="s2">bringing the fishbowl in to coherence</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.840" end="00:20:13.340" style="s2">your per having present precisely all</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.999" end="00:20:15.409" style="s2">that is necessary and precisely none</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.340" end="00:20:16.580" style="s2">that is not necessary and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.409" end="00:20:18.499" style="s2">bringing it all into a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.580" end="00:20:20.749" style="s2">relationship that causes it to come</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.499" end="00:20:22.700" style="s2">together as a whole so now think about</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.749" end="00:20:24.049" style="s2">like the fluidity of juggling where</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.700" end="00:20:26.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole bunch of distinct</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.049" end="00:20:27.830" style="s2">motions you have to be able to grab a</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.120" end="00:20:29.690" style="s2">ball you have to be able to throw a ball</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.830" end="00:20:30.950" style="s2">you have to be able to see it and have</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.690" end="00:20:32.840" style="s2">the hand-eye coordination to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.950" end="00:20:34.999" style="s2">move and catch it but you can&#39;t do these</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.840" end="00:20:36.440" style="s2">discrete steps you have to actually move</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.999" end="00:20:40.490" style="s2">into a stage where they&#39;re all happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.440" end="00:20:41.840" style="s2">as a single unit that is all the very</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.490" end="00:20:44.029" style="s2">tight relationship to each other</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.840" end="00:20:46.309" style="s2">attunement now then is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.029" end="00:20:48.769" style="s2">between discernment and coherence where</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.309" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">you&#39;re able to increasingly become</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.769" end="00:20:53.809" style="s2">capable of using discernment in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">context of a given coherence to be able</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.809" end="00:20:58.039" style="s2">to achieve coherence an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:20:59.749" style="s2">metaphor that a lot of people are</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.039" end="00:21:02.899" style="s2">familiar with if they&#39;re old enough is</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.749" end="00:21:05.929" style="s2">when you&#39;re tuning a radio if you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.899" end="00:21:07.999" style="s2">an old like an FM er or AM ready you</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.929" end="00:21:11.600" style="s2">notice where let&#39;s say the signal is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.999" end="00:21:15.049" style="s2">being broadcast at 90 FM and your</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.600" end="00:21:18.669" style="s2">radiators right now at 80 8.5 you just</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.049" end="00:21:22.639" style="s2">get noise it&#39;s just static and then 88.7</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.669" end="00:21:24.049" style="s2">88.9 somewhere around 88.9 something you</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.639" end="00:21:26.299" style="s2">can start hearing music but it&#39;s still a</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.049" end="00:21:27.529" style="s2">lot of noise and then when you get to 90</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.299" end="00:21:29.869" style="s2">when in this case it would be 90 point</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.529" end="00:21:31.970" style="s2">one because I&#39;m going up by twos it just</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.869" end="00:21:33.529" style="s2">snaps into clarity and you can hear the</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.970" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">music and almost all the noise drops</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.529" end="00:21:38.360" style="s2">away you&#39;re tuning you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.480" end="00:21:40.580" style="s2">making the the antenna more discerning</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.360" end="00:21:43.610" style="s2">in the context of the electromagnetic</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.580" end="00:21:45.409" style="s2">frequency where it&#39;s now coherent the</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.610" end="00:21:47.990" style="s2">antenna is coherent the antenna is tuned</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.409" end="00:21:50.149" style="s2">to their frequency of 90.1 the signal is</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.990" end="00:21:52.279" style="s2">being broadcast at the frequency of 90.1</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.149" end="00:21:53.809" style="s2">the whole now is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.279" end="00:21:57.289" style="s2">between these two things and suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.809" end="00:21:59.869" style="s2">the music jumps out so think about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.289" end="00:22:02.210" style="s2">way that a child learns how to stand and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.869" end="00:22:05.119" style="s2">so it has just begun the process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.210" end="00:22:07.309" style="s2">being able to move its legs it can crawl</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.119" end="00:22:09.590" style="s2">but it can&#39;t quite stand well standing</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.309" end="00:22:11.419" style="s2">requires things like being able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.590" end="00:22:13.759" style="s2">control your leg muscles but also</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.419" end="00:22:16.670" style="s2">requires things like being able to have</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.759" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">really sensitive awareness of</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.670" end="00:22:20.750" style="s2">which direction your body is falling not</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:22.040" style="s2">easy to be standing up on two feet</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.750" end="00:22:23.510" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of complexities I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.040" end="00:22:25.460" style="s2">about how hard it&#39;s been to build a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.510" end="00:22:27.290" style="s2">robot that can stand on two feet it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.460" end="00:22:29.630" style="s2">lot of sensing that needs to be done and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.290" end="00:22:30.560" style="s2">then micro adjustments of those muscles</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.630" end="00:22:33.650" style="s2">so you have to have a certain capacity</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.560" end="00:22:35.900" style="s2">in having the muscles respond not too</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.650" end="00:22:38.030" style="s2">much not too strong like lurching back</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.900" end="00:22:40.250" style="s2">and forth but also a sensitive feedback</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.030" end="00:22:41.900" style="s2">loop between your sensors of where</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.250" end="00:22:42.950" style="s2">you&#39;re falling and your actuators of</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.900" end="00:22:45.140" style="s2">controlling your balance so that</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.950" end="00:22:47.060" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;re now standing up all</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.140" end="00:22:48.980" style="s2">right so that&#39;s an example of moving</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.060" end="00:22:50.600" style="s2">into a coherent motion of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.980" end="00:22:52.670" style="s2">actually stand up is the process of</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.600" end="00:22:55.040" style="s2">having these sensitive relationships</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.670" end="00:22:56.540" style="s2">between sensing and acting that become</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.040" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">entrained with each other until they</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.540" end="00:23:01.610" style="s2">have the space of coherence that now has</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.690" end="00:23:03.230" style="s2">an enormous amount of clarity so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.610" end="00:23:04.670" style="s2">the next step which is clarity remember</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.230" end="00:23:06.650" style="s2">we talked about how the radio signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.670" end="00:23:08.900" style="s2">goes from static to suddenly you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.650" end="00:23:11.390" style="s2">hear the music very easily when a system</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.900" end="00:23:12.980" style="s2">enters into coherence it also enters</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.390" end="00:23:14.750" style="s2">into the state of clarity which means</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.980" end="00:23:17.030" style="s2">that whatever signal is trying to come</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.750" end="00:23:20.870" style="s2">through can come through with a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.030" end="00:23:23.990" style="s2">large amount of signal with a very small</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.870" end="00:23:26.390" style="s2">amount of noise even if it has not much</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.990" end="00:23:28.640" style="s2">energy that&#39;s a sort of a formal</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.390" end="00:23:30.380" style="s2">definition back to our radio station you</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.640" end="00:23:32.810" style="s2">know the radio antenna was broadcasting</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.380" end="00:23:34.520" style="s2">at the same level of energy the amount</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.810" end="00:23:36.290" style="s2">of electricity driving the radio signal</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.520" end="00:23:37.640" style="s2">has been the same all along you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.290" end="00:23:39.650" style="s2">hear you can&#39;t hear you can&#39;t hear it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.640" end="00:23:41.690" style="s2">you enter into clarity and bam you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.650" end="00:23:43.190" style="s2">hear perfectly the same thing happens in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.690" end="00:23:45.680" style="s2">literally any kind of learning</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.190" end="00:23:47.840" style="s2">environment once you achieve coherence</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.680" end="00:23:50.390" style="s2">then what happens is as you move into</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.840" end="00:23:52.820" style="s2">clarity the thing that is endeavoring to</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.390" end="00:23:55.790" style="s2">be learned the skill of raising your</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.820" end="00:23:59.270" style="s2">eyebrow the skill of juggling the skill</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.790" end="00:24:01.970" style="s2">of fishing suddenly becomes capable of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.270" end="00:24:04.310" style="s2">being received without a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.970" end="00:24:05.720" style="s2">effort the signal of what is going on in</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.310" end="00:24:07.640" style="s2">the world is suddenly you&#39;ve become an</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.720" end="00:24:09.470" style="s2">instrument they can receive that signal</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.640" end="00:24:12.140" style="s2">it&#39;s all of its nuance and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.470" end="00:24:15.410" style="s2">and be able to bring in it and perceive</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.140" end="00:24:17.270" style="s2">it so then the last is embodiment which</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.410" end="00:24:20.320" style="s2">is now that you can actually receive</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.270" end="00:24:22.580" style="s2">that signal you now begin the process of</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.320" end="00:24:25.730" style="s2">turning it into something that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.580" end="00:24:28.520" style="s2">easily access over and over again with</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.730" end="00:24:30.380" style="s2">little less and less effort so you begin</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.520" end="00:24:33.260" style="s2">to sort of hardwired</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.380" end="00:24:35.000" style="s2">or construct a set of habits around the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.260" end="00:24:37.670" style="s2">set of skills that you&#39;ve now carefully</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.000" end="00:24:39.460" style="s2">turned into a coherent whole so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.670" end="00:24:42.890" style="s2">able to achieve a level of coherence</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.460" end="00:24:44.540" style="s2">quickly so now you can&#39;t juggle and to</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.890" end="00:24:46.130" style="s2">juggle is no longer a struggle to juggle</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.540" end="00:24:49.010" style="s2">is now a capacity that you have</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.130" end="00:24:49.430" style="s2">developed you&#39;ve now learned to fish so</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.010" end="00:24:51.470" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.430" end="00:24:53.930" style="s2">fishing is something that you can do and</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:56.540" style="s2">by the way you can do it with less and</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.930" end="00:24:58.130" style="s2">less and less energy and then in</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.540" end="00:25:00.290" style="s2">relationship to other kinds of things it</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.130" end="00:25:02.600" style="s2">becomes the basis for doing a whole new</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.290" end="00:25:04.490" style="s2">set of things now it becomes a skill or</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.600" end="00:25:05.780" style="s2">capacity and you can plug into another</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.490" end="00:25:08.420" style="s2">cycle up so if you imagine the</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.780" end="00:25:11.090" style="s2">development of a child a child first has</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.420" end="00:25:12.650" style="s2">to be able to differentiate in its</p>

<p begin="00:25:17.180" end="00:25:20.570" style="s2"> that happens to be in the world</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.350" end="00:25:22.790" style="s2">that as a newborn infant literally</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.570" end="00:25:24.890" style="s2">there&#39;s no way of knowing then it has to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.790" end="00:25:28.280" style="s2">be able to separate say a pea a small</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.890" end="00:25:30.440" style="s2">round sphere from a the background of a</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.280" end="00:25:32.420" style="s2">plate well separately at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.440" end="00:25:34.190" style="s2">it&#39;s learning how to be able to notice</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.420" end="00:25:36.020" style="s2">that it has hands and then it&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:37.490" style="s2">able to notice how to actually do things</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.020" end="00:25:40.190" style="s2">with its fingers to get his fingers to</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.490" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">close with enough control that it can</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.190" end="00:25:42.950" style="s2">actually grasp something with those</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:44.390" style="s2">little fingers so now it&#39;s got two</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.950" end="00:25:46.100" style="s2">separate capacity that just builds his</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.390" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">habits it&#39;s got the ability to see</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.100" end="00:25:49.400" style="s2">something judge its distance from where</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">it is it&#39;s got ability to grasp</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.400" end="00:25:53.810" style="s2">something so now it&#39;s gonna struggle and</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.730" style="s2">work on the deeper skill set of being</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.810" end="00:25:57.890" style="s2">able to see something and reach out and</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.730" end="00:25:59.120" style="s2">grab it I know if you&#39;ve ever raised a</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.890" end="00:26:01.340" style="s2">child but that&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.120" end="00:26:02.900" style="s2">thing to watch so then of course once it</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.340" end="00:26:04.430" style="s2">has the ability to see something and</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.900" end="00:26:06.560" style="s2">reach out and grab it then it&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.430" end="00:26:08.810" style="s2">work on doing something with it bring it</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.560" end="00:26:11.540" style="s2">to its mouth so you see the cycle and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.810" end="00:26:14.480" style="s2">each cycle participates in exactly the</p>

<p begin="00:26:14.480" end="00:26:19.280" style="s2">coherence clarity insight inside is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.810" end="00:26:20.960" style="s2">process of being able to actually have</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.280" end="00:26:23.180" style="s2">that signal come all the way through and</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.960" end="00:26:24.950" style="s2">then layering it into embodiment and</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.180" end="00:26:27.800" style="s2">then that becomes available for the next</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.950" end="00:26:31.700" style="s2">layer up so that cycle is the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.800" end="00:26:33.980" style="s2">basis of any kind of capacity building</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.700" end="00:26:37.070" style="s2">in any possible domain so whether you</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.070" end="00:26:40.250" style="s2">or you&#39;re trying to learn how to do</p>

<p begin="00:26:48.710" end="00:26:53.899" style="s2">to go from where you are to a higher</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.590" end="00:26:55.970" style="s2">level of capacity that was the one that</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.899" end="00:26:59.809" style="s2">takes you from giving a man giving a</p>

<p begin="00:27:04.759" end="00:27:10.210" style="s2">possible domain right can you repeat the</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.249" end="00:27:16.749" style="s2">cycle again not sure it&#39;s discernment</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.210" end="00:27:19.009" style="s2">attunement coherence clarity insight</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.749" end="00:27:20.690" style="s2">embodiment I&#39;d imagine this has been</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.009" end="00:27:22.460" style="s2">written about extensively in the there</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.690" end="00:27:24.379" style="s2">are books people could pick up to learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.460" end="00:27:26.899" style="s2">so what is the subject that this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.379" end="00:27:28.879" style="s2">encapsulated in side of how to learn</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.899" end="00:27:30.740" style="s2">philosophy of Education and</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.879" end="00:27:33.230" style="s2">developmental psychology so coming back</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.740" end="00:27:34.999" style="s2">to round this off and bring it back to</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.230" end="00:27:37.580" style="s2">what&#39;s practical for the truck driver</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.999" end="00:27:39.499" style="s2">again what problems does this solve for</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.580" end="00:27:41.480" style="s2">the truck driver how does this apply for</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.499" end="00:27:43.999" style="s2">someone in their day-to-day lives</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.480" end="00:27:46.129" style="s2">okay so there&#39;s going to be a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.999" end="00:27:49.700" style="s2">distinct things the first is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.129" end="00:27:51.980" style="s2">because this is so deep it turns out to</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.700" end="00:27:54.649" style="s2">be relevant regardless of what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.980" end="00:27:57.019" style="s2">on so to the degree to which you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.649" end="00:28:02.090" style="s2">actually developed a significant degree</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.019" end="00:28:04.100" style="s2">of embodied capacity in these raw</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.090" end="00:28:06.019" style="s2">capacities remember this is the deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.100" end="00:28:08.269" style="s2">basis of learning itself you now</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.019" end="00:28:12.889" style="s2">actually have the ability to learn in</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.269" end="00:28:14.600" style="s2">any context so for example in a world</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.889" end="00:28:18.320" style="s2">where things are moving and changing</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.600" end="00:28:20.090" style="s2">rapidly where maybe the path of learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:22.070" style="s2">how to be a plumber suddenly just</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.090" end="00:28:23.869" style="s2">evaporates because we&#39;ve made those into</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.070" end="00:28:25.850" style="s2">robots and the path of learning how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.869" end="00:28:28.129" style="s2">be a physicist evaporates because AI is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.850" end="00:28:30.169" style="s2">doing that well you know as things are</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.129" end="00:28:32.149" style="s2">changing rapidly you actually need to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.169" end="00:28:33.559" style="s2">able to have a deeper basis for</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.149" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">relationship with the environment that</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.559" end="00:28:39.249" style="s2">you&#39;re operating it because that basis</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:42.200" style="s2">is less subject to the sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.249" end="00:28:43.759" style="s2">vicissitudes of superficial change these</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.200" end="00:28:45.379" style="s2">particular characteristics because they</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.759" end="00:28:48.769" style="s2">are in fact the deepest basis of</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.379" end="00:28:52.730" style="s2">learning are invariant meaning that if</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.769" end="00:28:54.590" style="s2">you build masterful skillfulness in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.730" end="00:28:56.509" style="s2">cycle meaning you build mastery of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.590" end="00:28:58.100" style="s2">discern mastery of attunement mastery of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.509" end="00:28:59.750" style="s2">coherence mastery of clarity</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.100" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">mastery of insight mastery of embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.750" end="00:29:07.100" style="s2">then you are fully prepared to respond</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:09.470" style="s2">to any possible set of circumstances in</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.100" end="00:29:11.480" style="s2">your environment meaning that if you</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.470" end="00:29:13.340" style="s2">find yourself suddenly on Mars and</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.480" end="00:29:15.500" style="s2">everybody&#39;s gone and you have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.340" end="00:29:18.380" style="s2">what to do when you&#39;re by yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.500" end="00:29:21.380" style="s2">have the raw toolkit from which to build</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.380" end="00:29:24.590" style="s2">the tools to respond to what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.380" end="00:29:26.900" style="s2">happening so it&#39;s the strongest basis</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.590" end="00:29:29.990" style="s2">the strongest you can be the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.900" end="00:29:32.270" style="s2">adaptive you can possibly be now as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.990" end="00:29:34.039" style="s2">truck driver you&#39;re gonna find yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.270" end="00:29:37.390" style="s2">very soon in a circumstance with a set</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.039" end="00:29:39.980" style="s2">of skills that you&#39;ve built are</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.390" end="00:29:41.330" style="s2">increasingly obsolete and this is true</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.980" end="00:29:43.580" style="s2">by the way of course of almost everybody</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.330" end="00:29:45.080" style="s2">that for a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.580" end="00:29:48.080" style="s2">several centuries at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.080" end="00:29:51.890" style="s2">we&#39;ve operated on a educational</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.080" end="00:29:55.070" style="s2">structure where we give people knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.890" end="00:29:57.260" style="s2">and we give them very specific skills</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.070" end="00:29:59.210" style="s2">but we do not give them the basis of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.260" end="00:30:01.580" style="s2">learning so that they can be robots</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.210" end="00:30:03.770" style="s2">ultimately you can add two plus two in</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.770" end="00:30:09.080" style="s2">what it means to have actually invented</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.600" end="00:30:11.630" style="s2">arithmetic you can&#39;t actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.080" end="00:30:15.049" style="s2">why two plus two equals four you could</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.630" end="00:30:17.630" style="s2">just do it rook and that was a phase of</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.049" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">human civilization we&#39;re creating a very</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.630" end="00:30:21.770" style="s2">large number of robots was useful and</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:23.330" style="s2">important and I don&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.770" end="00:30:25.429" style="s2">disparagingly I mean it in the very</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.330" end="00:30:27.260" style="s2">specific sense that people would have</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.429" end="00:30:30.169" style="s2">been trained to have certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.260" end="00:30:32.510" style="s2">knowledge in certain rote skills that</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.169" end="00:30:36.470" style="s2">are hard to do and require a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.840" end="00:30:42.440" style="s2">would allow them to self teach anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.909" end="00:30:45.530" style="s2">now of course we&#39;re entering into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.440" end="00:30:47.630" style="s2">phase where those kinds of abilities</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.530" end="00:30:49.370" style="s2">your skills and in particular your</p>

<p begin="00:30:49.370" end="00:30:54.470" style="s2">interesting anymore you can imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.650" end="00:30:56.000" style="s2">being able to add large the added</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.470" end="00:30:57.590" style="s2">multiply large numbers remember the idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.000" end="00:31:00.020" style="s2">of a calculator literally used to be a</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.590" end="00:31:03.380" style="s2">person an actual human being who was</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.020" end="00:31:05.030" style="s2">trained in doing calculation quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.380" end="00:31:07.100" style="s2">with precision and then we invented a</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.030" end="00:31:08.659" style="s2">tool that could do that more quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.100" end="00:31:11.330" style="s2">with more precision and so to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.659" end="00:31:12.110" style="s2">calculator no longer was a valuable way</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.330" end="00:31:14.780" style="s2">of control</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.110" end="00:31:16.670" style="s2">to the culture well this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.780" end="00:31:19.330" style="s2">everywhere and it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.670" end="00:31:21.380" style="s2">happening at an accelerating pace and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.330" end="00:31:23.390" style="s2">what you think you&#39;re going to do to</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.380" end="00:31:25.820" style="s2">respond to that is you&#39;re going to leap</p>

<p begin="00:31:25.820" end="00:31:30.160" style="s2">sinking island oh well I&#39;ll stop being a</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.650" end="00:31:33.200" style="s2">truck driver and now I&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.160" end="00:31:36.290" style="s2">software programmer you may have bought</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.200" end="00:31:37.610" style="s2">yourself a little bit of time but well</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.290" end="00:31:40.880" style="s2">guess what software programming is going</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.610" end="00:31:43.280" style="s2">to go underwater too so as dr. and so is</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.880" end="00:31:45.290" style="s2">fill in the blank I picked out for a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.280" end="00:31:46.790" style="s2">programmer on purpose because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.290" end="00:31:48.890" style="s2">obviously going to be one of the taller</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.790" end="00:31:51.440" style="s2">islands but unless you happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.890" end="00:31:52.820" style="s2">really really good at it the portion</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.440" end="00:31:54.290" style="s2">that you&#39;re doing is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.820" end="00:31:55.669" style="s2">automated by the people who are above</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.290" end="00:31:57.679" style="s2">you on that stack because that&#39;s where a</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.669" end="00:31:59.690" style="s2">lot of the automation is happening so</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.679" end="00:32:02.720" style="s2">interestingly if I can just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.690" end="00:32:04.460" style="s2">interject here we&#39;ve been playing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.720" end="00:32:05.809" style="s2">of music lately and I&#39;ve downloaded a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.460" end="00:32:07.910" style="s2">few new applications I&#39;ve been outside</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.809" end="00:32:09.980" style="s2">of the music production scene for a long</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.910" end="00:32:11.929" style="s2">time and suddenly I&#39;m back into it and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.980" end="00:32:15.590" style="s2">see all these new software applications</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.929" end="00:32:18.679" style="s2">that allow for automatic arpeggiation of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.590" end="00:32:22.460" style="s2">scales and chords and very complicated</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.679" end="00:32:24.470" style="s2">very advanced chord structures that can</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.460" end="00:32:26.870" style="s2">be arranged for you automatically</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.470" end="00:32:29.000" style="s2">so even these very high level artistic</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.870" end="00:32:31.160" style="s2">creative structures are now just being</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.000" end="00:32:33.799" style="s2">you know like you can have an improvised</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.160" end="00:32:36.620" style="s2">the lead that is automatically beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.799" end="00:32:37.940" style="s2">and in some sort of very complex jazz</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.620" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">structure and you can have that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.940" end="00:32:40.940" style="s2">generated for you with the push of a</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:42.169" style="s2">button I mean that&#39;s one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.940" end="00:32:43.790" style="s2">I would have thought would be kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.169" end="00:32:46.370" style="s2">last to go is the artistic expression</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.790" end="00:32:48.740" style="s2">but it&#39;s actually easier to make that go</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.370" end="00:32:51.559" style="s2">then I would imagine like you say</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.740" end="00:32:53.179" style="s2">software programming right well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.559" end="00:32:55.700" style="s2">it so what is up happening is is that</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.179" end="00:32:58.790" style="s2">things that are the deepest are the</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.700" end="00:33:00.679" style="s2">things that are going to last and so if</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.790" end="00:33:02.900" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to figure out where to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.679" end="00:33:04.220" style="s2">go there so I can invert it the things</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.900" end="00:33:06.049" style="s2">that are the deepest are also the things</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.220" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">that are the highest so if the flood is</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.049" end="00:33:10.280" style="s2">coming and you&#39;re seeking high ground</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:12.559" style="s2">this is the highest ground and so what I</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.280" end="00:33:14.630" style="s2">can say also is that it is not just the</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.559" end="00:33:16.100" style="s2">highest ground that we&#39;ve found it</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.630" end="00:33:17.960" style="s2">actually is the highest ground there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.100" end="00:33:21.110" style="s2">nothing there is no way to go any higher</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.960" end="00:33:23.360" style="s2">to be more safe it is the actual basis</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.110" end="00:33:25.130" style="s2">upon which everything else derives so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.360" end="00:33:26.070" style="s2">that&#39;s one piece now another piece which</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.130" end="00:33:29.160" style="s2">is very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.070" end="00:33:31.670" style="s2">is because it is so foundational it also</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.160" end="00:33:34.080" style="s2">is related to more kinds of things so</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.670" end="00:33:37.410" style="s2">I&#39;ve just been talking about it in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.080" end="00:33:40.260" style="s2">context is call it useful skills or ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.410" end="00:33:41.490" style="s2">of providing value so moving from being</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.260" end="00:33:45.090" style="s2">a truck driver to being a software</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.490" end="00:33:48.480" style="s2">programmer or a chef but these things</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.090" end="00:33:50.130" style="s2">are at the bottom of everything so how</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.480" end="00:33:52.440" style="s2">to be able to be in relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.130" end="00:33:54.090" style="s2">yourself how to be able to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.440" end="00:33:56.430" style="s2">friend how to be able to be a good</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.090" end="00:33:59.700" style="s2">parent how to make choices around what</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.430" end="00:34:03.060" style="s2">to eat all possible choice making in all</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.700" end="00:34:06.390" style="s2">possible context are founded on these</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.060" end="00:34:09.150" style="s2">kinds of capacities and so that only are</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.390" end="00:34:12.930" style="s2">these kinds of capacities primeur really</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.150" end="00:34:14.400" style="s2">useful in the context of how to do stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.930" end="00:34:16.320" style="s2">in caught that may be the economic</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.400" end="00:34:19.770" style="s2">domain they are actually primarily</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.320" end="00:34:22.040" style="s2">useful in all domains and so they are</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.770" end="00:34:25.080" style="s2">the most useful things to have at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.040" end="00:34:26.820" style="s2">basis of your fundamental portfolio of</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.080" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">things that you&#39;re good at and they just</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.820" end="00:34:30.750" style="s2">address the last just to make sure we</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:34.470" style="s2">have the right kind of context a deep</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.750" end="00:34:40.230" style="s2">insight that is not very well shared is</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.470" end="00:34:43.860" style="s2">that pace of change matters that if</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.230" end="00:34:48.770" style="s2">things are changing slowly it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.860" end="00:34:52.170" style="s2">okay to just have the surface level</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.770" end="00:34:54.030" style="s2">adaptive skills or capacities associated</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.170" end="00:34:56.640" style="s2">with the place that you&#39;re at if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.030" end="00:35:02.150" style="s2">know being able to think of a simple</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.640" end="00:35:05.180" style="s2">example if being able to grow yams is</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.150" end="00:35:07.590" style="s2">adequate to feed you and your family and</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.180" end="00:35:10.080" style="s2">the place that you&#39;re at is going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.590" end="00:35:13.880" style="s2">have the same essential characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.080" end="00:35:16.200" style="s2">for yam growing for a million years then</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.880" end="00:35:19.140" style="s2">it&#39;s actually kind of okay to just sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.200" end="00:35:21.120" style="s2">of have the rituals of yam growing</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.140" end="00:35:23.550" style="s2">passed down from hand from person to</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.120" end="00:35:25.260" style="s2">person without having to build a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.550" end="00:35:27.590" style="s2">basis that would allow you to also be</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.260" end="00:35:30.420" style="s2">able to grow wheat or to be able to fish</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.590" end="00:35:31.800" style="s2">but if things are changing you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.420" end="00:35:33.690" style="s2">go deeper and the faster they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.800" end="00:35:36.600" style="s2">changing the deeper you have to go and</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.690" end="00:35:38.850" style="s2">so because we&#39;re in a space where</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.600" end="00:35:39.890" style="s2">accelerating change is a primary</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.850" end="00:35:43.039" style="s2">characteristic</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.890" end="00:35:45.950" style="s2">we&#39;re also in a space where depth is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.039" end="00:35:49.400" style="s2">primary characteristic right and like</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.950" end="00:35:51.499" style="s2">you said this relates to all domains for</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.400" end="00:35:53.690" style="s2">example both of us have done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.499" end="00:35:56.839" style="s2">meditation and it&#39;s the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.690" end="00:35:59.150" style="s2">process and a certain point you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.839" end="00:36:03.460" style="s2">really be taught you just have to figure</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.150" end="00:36:06.170" style="s2">out how to deconstruct your own mind and</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.460" end="00:36:09.559" style="s2">to keep deconstructing it until there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.170" end="00:36:10.700" style="s2">nothing left to deconstruct and so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.559" end="00:36:12.710" style="s2">know the whole process that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.700" end="00:36:15.829" style="s2">talking about relates to to everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.710" end="00:36:18.440" style="s2">including things that are very</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.829" end="00:36:21.410" style="s2">experienced and kind of very subjective</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.440" end="00:36:21.950" style="s2">yes and now you just brought into my</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.410" end="00:36:23.960" style="s2">mind</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.950" end="00:36:26.269" style="s2">not sure how maybe the next major move</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.960" end="00:36:27.619" style="s2">which is we&#39;ve now been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.269" end="00:36:30.349" style="s2">all of this from the point of view of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.619" end="00:36:33.829" style="s2">single person but everything that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.349" end="00:36:37.099" style="s2">been talking about is perfectly exactly</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.829" end="00:36:40.190" style="s2">relevant in the context of groups of</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.099" end="00:36:41.930" style="s2">people and in fact going down also your</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.190" end="00:36:43.730" style="s2">cells and organs relate to each other in</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.930" end="00:36:47.509" style="s2">this way to make you so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.730" end="00:36:49.609" style="s2">continuity going from quantum phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.509" end="00:36:51.890" style="s2">all the way up to the universe but in</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.609" end="00:36:55.400" style="s2">the particular case you as an individual</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.890" end="00:36:57.529" style="s2">have relations of coherence with regard</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.400" end="00:36:59.210" style="s2">to certain capacities to render them</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.529" end="00:37:01.869" style="s2">into embodiment but say for example the</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.210" end="00:37:06.680" style="s2">two of you as a group as a couple as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.869" end="00:37:08.390" style="s2">partnership also have this this loop but</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.680" end="00:37:11.239" style="s2">it&#39;s at the level of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.390" end="00:37:13.519" style="s2">the relationship itself has a certain</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.239" end="00:37:16.160" style="s2">kind of agency has a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.519" end="00:37:18.319" style="s2">discernment that neither of you holds</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.160" end="00:37:20.539" style="s2">completely there&#39;s a wholeness to it</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.319" end="00:37:22.999" style="s2">that is equivalent to the wholeness of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.539" end="00:37:24.589" style="s2">for example the relationships of your</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.999" end="00:37:27.499" style="s2">muscles that&#39;ll able and maybe you to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.589" end="00:37:28.999" style="s2">juggle there&#39;s something about the way</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.499" end="00:37:30.920" style="s2">the relationship builds its own</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.999" end="00:37:34.069" style="s2">capacities to do things as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.920" end="00:37:35.660" style="s2">relationship and a jazz band is the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.069" end="00:37:37.369" style="s2">classic example that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.660" end="00:37:40.099" style="s2">about the jazz band that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.369" end="00:37:41.960" style="s2">synergistic it is a merge that is more</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.099" end="00:37:43.970" style="s2">than just the actual players there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.960" end="00:37:46.640" style="s2">something about becoming togetherness in</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.970" end="00:37:49.700" style="s2">a form of coherence that allows the jazz</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.640" end="00:37:52.910" style="s2">band as a band to do something that is</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.700" end="00:37:53.720" style="s2">not available in any of the distinct</p>

<p begin="00:37:53.720" end="00:37:58.250" style="s2">and you have to play together right you</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.000" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">have to actually build discernment as a</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.250" end="00:38:02.060" style="s2">whole you have to build a tune mint as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:03.830" style="s2">whole you have to build coherence as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.060" end="00:38:05.870" style="s2">whole and then of course you have built</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.830" end="00:38:07.190" style="s2">embodiment as a whole which the layers</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.870" end="00:38:10.550" style="s2">did you go out and do something white</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.190" end="00:38:12.770" style="s2">played jazz well that&#39;s another deep</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.550" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">important thing because these plug</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.770" end="00:38:19.100" style="s2">together in order for me to most fully</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:21.370" style="s2">entrance relationship with you to the</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.100" end="00:38:24.320" style="s2">degree to which I&#39;ve built mastery of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.370" end="00:38:27.340" style="s2">discernment in myself I can then use</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.320" end="00:38:31.280" style="s2">that master of discernment in myself in</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.340" end="00:38:35.660" style="s2">the process of building skillfulness in</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.280" end="00:38:39.020" style="s2">discernment as us this relates to what</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.660" end="00:38:40.490" style="s2">you were talking about when we spoke the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.020" end="00:38:43.850" style="s2">first time I think where you talked</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.490" end="00:38:46.730" style="s2">about how sovereignties fractal in a way</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.850" end="00:38:48.890" style="s2">that you can have sovereignty as an</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.730" end="00:38:51.170" style="s2">individual and then there&#39;s also a level</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.890" end="00:38:53.060" style="s2">of sovereignty in a small group and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.170" end="00:38:56.360" style="s2">in a larger group and then the society</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.060" end="00:38:56.600" style="s2">in the nation its realization yep that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.360" end="00:38:58.970" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.600" end="00:39:01.970" style="s2">so what we&#39;re describing can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.970" end="00:39:03.890" style="s2">described as the the characteristics of</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.970" end="00:39:08.180" style="s2">sovereignty so would you describe</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.890" end="00:39:11.620" style="s2">sovereignty as a mastery of all these</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.180" end="00:39:15.380" style="s2">different levels of discernment</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.620" end="00:39:18.470" style="s2">achievements etc or is this kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.380" end="00:39:20.180" style="s2">separate aspect of it it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.470" end="00:39:22.640" style="s2">little bit oblique so what I would say</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.180" end="00:39:25.880" style="s2">is that in order to achieve sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.640" end="00:39:28.640" style="s2">one must use these particular capacities</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.880" end="00:39:30.260" style="s2">in the domain that you&#39;re considering</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.640" end="00:39:31.970" style="s2">suffrage is a measure of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.260" end="00:39:35.480" style="s2">relationship between one&#39;s capacity and</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.970" end="00:39:37.130" style="s2">the conditions that one is in so for</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.480" end="00:39:39.110" style="s2">example when I have learned how to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.130" end="00:39:42.020" style="s2">juggle you might say that I have</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.110" end="00:39:43.910" style="s2">sovereignty within a particular context</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.020" end="00:39:45.590" style="s2">of juggling let&#39;s say for example I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.910" end="00:39:48.740" style="s2">trying to juggle wall riding a unicycle</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.590" end="00:39:50.630" style="s2">I may not yet have sovereignty in that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.740" end="00:39:54.560" style="s2">domain sovereignty has to do with they</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.630" end="00:39:57.230" style="s2">have a longitudinal ability of your</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.560" end="00:39:59.900" style="s2">current state to respond to a set of</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.230" end="00:40:01.700" style="s2">challenges such that you&#39;re continuing</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.900" end="00:40:05.270" style="s2">ability to respond to those challenges</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.700" end="00:40:07.579" style="s2">is on some level of steady state or up</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.270" end="00:40:09.829" style="s2">gradient at which is to say that I can</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.579" end="00:40:13.279" style="s2">doing it without losing my ability to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.829" end="00:40:15.109" style="s2">keep doing it so these two pieces fit</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.279" end="00:40:17.269" style="s2">together they&#39;re not reducible to each</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.109" end="00:40:20.239" style="s2">other so would you say that sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.269" end="00:40:22.099" style="s2">and mastery are kind of the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.239" end="00:40:23.450" style="s2">or not really feel like they&#39;re so now</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.099" end="00:40:25.640" style="s2">we&#39;re in a subtle state of discernment</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.450" end="00:40:27.289" style="s2">so I&#39;ll actually apply it I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.640" end="00:40:28.969" style="s2">there&#39;s a distinction but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.289" end="00:40:32.029" style="s2">the distinction is subtle so they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.969" end="00:40:33.969" style="s2">close which is to say that for most</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.029" end="00:40:36.829" style="s2">purposes you can probably use them</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.969" end="00:40:39.519" style="s2">interchangeably but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.829" end="00:40:41.839" style="s2">distinction and so it&#39;s important not to</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.519" end="00:40:44.269" style="s2">think that they are in fact actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.839" end="00:40:45.739" style="s2">interchangeable you think if I can get</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.269" end="00:40:48.289" style="s2">up a little bit of better hint as to</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.739" end="00:40:50.089" style="s2">where that distinction lies well I said</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.289" end="00:40:52.819" style="s2">that these two these two stories are</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.089" end="00:40:55.219" style="s2">oblique meaning that they&#39;re related to</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.819" end="00:40:58.219" style="s2">a different set of things mastery</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.219" end="00:40:59.749" style="s2">relates to an arc of skillfulness so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.219" end="00:41:02.479" style="s2">going to give that in more detail when</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.749" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">you enter into a particular practice a</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.479" end="00:41:07.430" style="s2">particular relationship to to reality</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:09.650" style="s2">jugglin in the beginning you have no</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.430" end="00:41:12.199" style="s2">skillfulness is you&#39;re really just at</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.650" end="00:41:16.009" style="s2">the basis of raw uncertain discernment</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.199" end="00:41:17.749" style="s2">as your discernment increases in your</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.009" end="00:41:19.640" style="s2">Tumen increases you begin to enter into</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.749" end="00:41:22.190" style="s2">coherence what happens is your</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.640" end="00:41:24.979" style="s2">skillfulness increases your ability to</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.190" end="00:41:27.619" style="s2">move energy through your instrument to</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.979" end="00:41:29.599" style="s2">get signal is higher as your</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.619" end="00:41:31.819" style="s2">skillfulness increases I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.599" end="00:41:34.400" style="s2">describe a particular transformation I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.819" end="00:41:36.589" style="s2">gonna call it artfulness the movement</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.400" end="00:41:38.420" style="s2">from skillfulness to artfulness has to</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.589" end="00:41:40.729" style="s2">do with that transition into embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.420" end="00:41:43.099" style="s2">meaning that you&#39;ve reached an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.729" end="00:41:46.369" style="s2">level of discernment attunement and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.099" end="00:41:48.140" style="s2">coherence and clarity that it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.369" end="00:41:50.690" style="s2">becoming your ability to access this</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.140" end="00:41:53.749" style="s2">level of insight has moved into a space</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.690" end="00:41:56.930" style="s2">of kind of being easy and being enduring</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.749" end="00:41:57.979" style="s2">under larger and larger challenges so</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.930" end="00:42:00.440" style="s2">what I can say now is that your</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.979" end="00:42:03.140" style="s2">sovereignty at artfulness your</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.440" end="00:42:07.309" style="s2">sovereignty in this particular domain</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.140" end="00:42:11.479" style="s2">has actually expanded your ability to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.309" end="00:42:13.279" style="s2">is expand it and then mastery is when</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.479" end="00:42:17.469" style="s2">you&#39;re actually now able to use this</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.279" end="00:42:18.650" style="s2">capacity to build further capacity under</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.469" end="00:42:21.200" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.650" end="00:42:22.880" style="s2">under higher harder domains so the art</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.200" end="00:42:24.920" style="s2">for skillfulness to artfulness to</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.880" end="00:42:27.049" style="s2">mastery really very much lives on this</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.920" end="00:42:29.119" style="s2">learning loop sovereignty comes at it</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.049" end="00:42:32.509" style="s2">obliquely it comes at it from the point</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.119" end="00:42:36.230" style="s2">of view of in a given circumstance in a</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.509" end="00:42:38.569" style="s2">given moment what is the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.230" end="00:42:41.150" style="s2">between your capacity and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.569" end="00:42:43.880" style="s2">environment that you&#39;re in so if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.150" end="00:42:46.940" style="s2">have achieved mastery then also you will</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.880" end="00:42:50.089" style="s2">be sovereign at the level of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.940" end="00:42:51.980" style="s2">mastery so let&#39;s go back to juggling if</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.089" end="00:42:54.049" style="s2">I&#39;ve had chief mastery of juggling and</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.980" end="00:42:56.599" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing is juggling then I have</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.049" end="00:42:58.249" style="s2">sovereignty in the domain of juggler if</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.599" end="00:43:00.140" style="s2">I&#39;ve achieved mastery of juggling but</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.249" end="00:43:03.049" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing now is trying to use to</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.140" end="00:43:05.630" style="s2">juggle while riding a unicycle my</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.049" end="00:43:08.329" style="s2">sovereignty in this moment is actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.630" end="00:43:10.099" style="s2">quite low but so I have not achieved</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.329" end="00:43:12.009" style="s2">mastery of the new domain I&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.099" end="00:43:14.150" style="s2">achieved mastery of the sub domain of</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.009" end="00:43:16.519" style="s2">juggling maybe juggling and riding a</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.150" end="00:43:18.049" style="s2">unicycle so there&#39;s a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.519" end="00:43:21.440" style="s2">between the two the sovereignty has to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.049" end="00:43:23.660" style="s2">do with the ability to maintain my</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.440" end="00:43:25.759" style="s2">ability to respond to my environment in</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.660" end="00:43:29.119" style="s2">the context that I&#39;m in on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.759" end="00:43:30.829" style="s2">basis and it will use my mastery my</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.119" end="00:43:33.289" style="s2">skillfulness of which there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.829" end="00:43:36.319" style="s2">dimensions in that process right so to</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.289" end="00:43:38.420" style="s2">simplify it it seems like mastery is</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.319" end="00:43:41.239" style="s2">more about skillfulness and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.420" end="00:43:43.519" style="s2">understanding of domain whereas</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.239" end="00:43:45.710" style="s2">sovereignty is more about your ability</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.519" end="00:43:47.089" style="s2">to make choices in response to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.710" end="00:43:48.030" style="s2">is happening yes</p>
