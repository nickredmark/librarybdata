<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:24.500" style="s2">to meet yet through that so Johannes is</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.570" end="00:01:29.070" style="s2">a Haida garyun philosopher scholar and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.500" end="00:01:32.070" style="s2">teacher who in my view is the real deal</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.070" end="00:01:34.409" style="s2">when it comes to being a philosopher and</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.070" end="00:01:38.479" style="s2">you can you can really tell it in his</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.409" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">how animated he becomes and also in an</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.479" end="00:01:48.740" style="s2">openness to being we&#39;d say insulted but</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:48.740" style="s2">by the times that were in</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.320" end="00:01:54.170" style="s2">that there&#39;s a way in which I think you</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.270" end="00:01:56.700" style="s2">hon is really like embodies in the lives</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.170" end="00:02:00.470" style="s2">thought and the deepest sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.700" end="00:02:05.610" style="s2">word and I wanted to talk with him today</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.470" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">about his experience and his perception</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.610" end="00:02:11.250" style="s2">of the particular time that we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:14.280" style="s2">right now um philosophically speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.250" end="00:02:16.830" style="s2">with time time and temporalities in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.280" end="00:02:19.650" style="s2">sense of the Heidegger HIDA garyun sense</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.830" end="00:02:22.459" style="s2">of history meaning that there are epochs</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.650" end="00:02:26.220" style="s2">of understanding of intelligibility and</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.459" end="00:02:28.739" style="s2">that for johannes suspects that the time</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.220" end="00:02:31.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re in in the corona virus and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.739" end="00:02:35.520" style="s2">what we&#39;re witnessing may just be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.560" end="00:02:37.470" style="s2">crack into modernity into this</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.520" end="00:02:39.959" style="s2">particular time of been framing and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.470" end="00:02:44.700" style="s2">technology that we go deep into what</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.959" end="00:02:47.580" style="s2">that means in the conversation and just</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.700" end="00:02:49.620" style="s2">like a crack can be something the</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.580" end="00:02:53.370" style="s2">damages but it could also be an opening</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.620" end="00:02:56.160" style="s2">so we we also address what what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.370" end="00:02:59.600" style="s2">possible in this time you know what</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.160" end="00:03:04.320" style="s2">could be those optically speaking and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.600" end="00:03:07.549" style="s2">culturally speaking so I really</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.320" end="00:03:11.070" style="s2">encourage you just to tune in and enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.549" end="00:03:13.260" style="s2">this conversation because we go we</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.070" end="00:03:16.920" style="s2">circumambulate around a number of very</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.260" end="00:03:19.310" style="s2">very deep things and um if you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.920" end="00:03:23.190" style="s2">not that familiar with some of the terms</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.310" end="00:03:26.400" style="s2">like I would just say just just tune</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.190" end="00:03:28.620" style="s2">into the things that that strike you and</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">you may not understand everything but</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.620" end="00:03:36.299" style="s2">kind of like oh the necessity to UM</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:39.810" style="s2">there&#39;s multiple levels of meaning I</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.299" end="00:03:42.480" style="s2">think you can you can crock out of what</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.810" end="00:03:43.860" style="s2">we talked about I know that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.480" end="00:03:46.380" style="s2">necessarily understand everything that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.860" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">was was being spoken I&#39;m sure as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.380" end="00:03:50.910" style="s2">listened to this conversation as I</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:54.540" style="s2">always do with after conversations with</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.910" end="00:03:56.010" style="s2">Johannes I will hear things that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:03:57.239" style="s2">didn&#39;t initially understand that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.010" end="00:04:00.010" style="s2">didn&#39;t even know that I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.239" end="00:04:03.650" style="s2">understand at the time so</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.010" end="00:04:19.760" style="s2">enjoy and a lot I&#39;ll have a link to his</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.650" end="00:04:22.280" style="s2">channel below hello you Hadas guy and</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.760" end="00:04:23.500" style="s2">right now huh sorry interesting time</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.280" end="00:04:26.930" style="s2">we&#39;re in right now huh</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.500" end="00:04:29.090" style="s2">yes sir indeed so you&#39;ve been putting</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:34.160" style="s2">out some videos on your channel and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.090" end="00:04:37.810" style="s2">put a link below go and watch them but I</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.160" end="00:04:40.490" style="s2">get the sense that from your videos and</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.810" end="00:04:43.490" style="s2">your you know your deep grounding in</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.490" end="00:04:45.230" style="s2">philosophy and and Heidegger and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.490" end="00:04:50.530" style="s2">history of philosophy which I think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.230" end="00:04:53.060" style="s2">took to me you have a very there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.530" end="00:04:55.010" style="s2">what got me into Heidegger reading</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.060" end="00:04:59.780" style="s2">Heidegger without knowing anything about</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.010" end="00:05:01.580" style="s2">him was a certain kind of something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.780" end="00:05:05.630" style="s2">was very difficult to describe that</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.580" end="00:05:09.169" style="s2">would open up for me and it wouldn&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.630" end="00:05:11.360" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t get more conclusions or answers</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.169" end="00:05:13.340" style="s2">in fact I&#39;d be more confused in some</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.360" end="00:05:15.950" style="s2">level after reading him however</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.340" end="00:05:17.960" style="s2">something would just open up like Mike I</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.950" end="00:05:20.690" style="s2">could hear things differently I can look</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.960" end="00:05:22.790" style="s2">listen to things differently and so when</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.690" end="00:05:24.740" style="s2">I came across your videos I noticed a</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.790" end="00:05:27.470" style="s2">very similar feeling there&#39;s that sense</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.740" end="00:05:29.330" style="s2">of where you know but listen to you and</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.470" end="00:05:33.140" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t like I got a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.330" end="00:05:35.360" style="s2">information although I did but it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.140" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">more like what happened through getting</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.360" end="00:05:39.940" style="s2">at mm-hmm the certain kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.090" end="00:05:45.260" style="s2">revealing of something kind of uncanny</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.360" end="00:05:49.449" style="s2">something that&#39;s like really really</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.260" end="00:05:51.699" style="s2">close and near but difficult</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.449" end="00:05:54.330" style="s2">and concealed in its nearness whatever</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.699" end="00:05:58.559" style="s2">that that realm that breaks open where</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.330" end="00:06:00.939" style="s2">since it wonder comes even a dread abhor</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.559" end="00:06:04.360" style="s2">all the things that let you know like</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.939" end="00:06:07.960" style="s2">well you you&#39;re a being then that really</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:11.050" style="s2">enough make us both laugh yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.960" end="00:06:14.199" style="s2">and so there&#39;s there&#39;s a sense in which</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.050" end="00:06:18.699" style="s2">these videos on one level have a really</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.199" end="00:06:23.229" style="s2">dark but on the level on another level</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.699" end="00:06:25.839" style="s2">are also intimating a possibility like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.229" end="00:06:29.259" style="s2">crack in I think what you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.839" end="00:06:32.169" style="s2">calling modernity and so I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.259" end="00:06:34.719" style="s2">have this have a conversation about what</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.169" end="00:06:37.499" style="s2">is what is the time that we&#39;re in what</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.719" end="00:06:43.120" style="s2">what does it mean that were in a time</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.499" end="00:06:45.909" style="s2">yes yeah about that what is what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.120" end="00:06:47.770" style="s2">tighter grab to say about it what what</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.909" end="00:06:50.199" style="s2">do you have to say about it what what is</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.770" end="00:06:57.969" style="s2">the possibility of the crack in this</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.199" end="00:07:03.159" style="s2">time yeah so you know briefly on on</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.969" end="00:07:06.189" style="s2">Heidegger so there&#39;s a sense of urgency</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.159" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">in heidegger&#39;s texts that&#39;s what draws</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.189" end="00:07:10.120" style="s2">you into Heidegger in that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:12.759" style="s2">urgency by the way you also happen you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.120" end="00:07:14.860" style="s2">read someone like Paul Nate work I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.759" end="00:07:17.050" style="s2">it was basically forgotten these days he</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.860" end="00:07:19.539" style="s2">was a he was actually the gentleman who</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.050" end="00:07:22.870" style="s2">brought hiding it to Marburg he saw in</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.539" end="00:07:24.849" style="s2">Heidegger someone who was very different</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.870" end="00:07:28.289" style="s2">from the new canteens like Ernst kashira</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.849" end="00:07:31.509" style="s2">and himself and in Hemet Herman Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.289" end="00:07:33.490" style="s2">who was also a new Kantian brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.509" end="00:07:36.669" style="s2">thinker by the way just like casera</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.490" end="00:07:38.469" style="s2">and like Nate were dead but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.669" end="00:07:41.319" style="s2">sense of berserk when you read Cohen</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.469" end="00:07:43.120" style="s2">Cohen for all of his you know</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.319" end="00:07:46.029" style="s2">limitations in terms of being a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.120" end="00:07:48.099" style="s2">canteen thinker you you read him and you</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.029" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">understand that it was still what was</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.099" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">breathing through these lectures while</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:57.639" style="s2">still just as extended memory of thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:08:00.610" style="s2">itself and of course it finds different</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.639" end="00:08:02.529" style="s2">ways of the titillating itself well but</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.610" end="00:08:03.349" style="s2">you have to you after didn&#39;t hardly get</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.869" end="00:08:33.310" style="s2">it was how it was passed on to future</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.889" end="00:08:35.620" style="s2">generations because this is what</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.310" end="00:08:38.029" style="s2">philosophy about philosophy isn&#39;t about</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.029" end="00:08:45.139" style="s2">we can arbitrarily come up with no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.630" end="00:08:47.180" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that which is old right</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.139" end="00:08:52.009" style="s2">as Aristotle says and this is a quote</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.180" end="00:08:57.319" style="s2">from from Network taught en a night that</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.009" end="00:09:00.500" style="s2">that which it was being being ni is a</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.220" end="00:09:27.769" style="s2">weird to know philosophy is where truth</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.100" end="00:09:31.430" style="s2">articulates itself and it dick you lates</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.769" end="00:09:34.579" style="s2">itself for an epoch so what I&#39;ve seen in</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.430" end="00:09:38.089" style="s2">so I have this channel which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.579" end="00:09:40.069" style="s2">called classical philosophy their reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.089" end="00:09:41.750" style="s2">for why I call it is I don&#39;t consider I</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.069" end="00:09:43.430" style="s2">don&#39;t concern myself only with what</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.750" end="00:09:44.930" style="s2">people would think of as classical</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.430" end="00:09:47.389" style="s2">philosophy you know I think of classical</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.930" end="00:09:50.029" style="s2">as a way of being again right the way of</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.389" end="00:09:52.519" style="s2">a way of existing he has a quote from</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.029" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">Heidegger the classical is a longing for</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.519" end="00:09:58.639" style="s2">being that flows from the fullness of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:10:00.620" style="s2">gift-giving and yes saying it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.639" end="00:10:02.569" style="s2">exact opposite of being a romantic who</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.620" end="00:10:06.889" style="s2">begin over a position of lack the</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.569" end="00:10:09.589" style="s2">longing clap to be classical is a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.889" end="00:10:12.439" style="s2">the classical itself the classical human</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.589" end="00:10:16.279" style="s2">being you could say it simplifies a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.439" end="00:10:17.120" style="s2">longing for being longing for being that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.279" end="00:10:20.899" style="s2">flows</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.120" end="00:10:25.279" style="s2">from the fullness of gift-giving and yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.899" end="00:10:28.129" style="s2">say so there&#39;s a fullness you think of</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.279" end="00:10:32.689" style="s2">it you begin from a stance of fullness</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.129" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">or full flow and a yes saying in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.689" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">face by the way of course of course of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:38.120" style="s2">hora yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:39.949" style="s2">also not only but also at this is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.120" end="00:10:41.629" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s a more fatty for example the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.949" end="00:10:44.149" style="s2">romantics are different the romantics</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.629" end="00:10:46.370" style="s2">are already divided from nature and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.149" end="00:10:49.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a lack this there&#39;s disturbance</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.370" end="00:10:51.230" style="s2">and then because every dreamy and you</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.220" end="00:10:55.129" style="s2">know the most famous painting of course</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.230" end="00:10:59.149" style="s2">is Caspar David Friedrich Hika I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.129" end="00:11:00.740" style="s2">it would be in English the the man who</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.149" end="00:11:03.709" style="s2">stands on the mountain and looks down</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.740" end="00:11:05.809" style="s2">upon the fog the valley but there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.709" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">distance to nature there&#39;s a an</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.809" end="00:11:10.389" style="s2">alienation from nature are really</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:14.319" style="s2">present in romanticism in the certain</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.389" end="00:11:17.389" style="s2">exemplification of lack - but these are</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.319" end="00:11:19.639" style="s2">so what philosophy does philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.389" end="00:11:21.589" style="s2">articulates an epoch and the weird thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.639" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">that philosophy does we&#39;re thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.589" end="00:11:27.319" style="s2">that on some level that responds to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:29.509" style="s2">something that already is but by</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.319" end="00:11:33.319" style="s2">responding to this it corresponds</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.509" end="00:11:36.860" style="s2">thinking corresponds to what is and what</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.319" end="00:11:38.449" style="s2">then begins to show itself right so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.860" end="00:11:40.550" style="s2">not that we make history that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.449" end="00:11:44.179" style="s2">humanist understanding so a humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.550" end="00:11:48.470" style="s2">understanding of history is Descartes</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.179" end="00:11:50.929" style="s2">says I think therefore I am and this</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.470" end="00:11:52.970" style="s2">sets off a course of history so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.929" end="00:11:56.269" style="s2">the human will that makes this</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.970" end="00:11:58.939" style="s2">trajectory no day God Himself is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.269" end="00:12:01.069" style="s2">response to something that&#39;s already if</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.939" end="00:12:03.050" style="s2">you like on the horizon right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.069" end="00:12:05.540" style="s2">already beginning to could have bubble</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.050" end="00:12:09.170" style="s2">up it&#39;s bubbling up it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.540" end="00:12:12.290" style="s2">it&#39;s a dimension of bubbly dimension in</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.170" end="00:12:14.149" style="s2">within being yeah which then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.290" end="00:12:17.209" style="s2">sudden comes fully to the fore when he</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.149" end="00:12:20.769" style="s2">does what when he grounds the beingness</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.209" end="00:12:24.350" style="s2">of beings in the subjectivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.769" end="00:12:27.470" style="s2">subject that means in a self referential</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.350" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">ego that circles around itself basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.470" end="00:12:30.830" style="s2">and and that&#39;s if you like that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">the catalyst</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.830" end="00:12:38.150" style="s2">of what we call modernity the the epoch</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:40.730" style="s2">of the human being where the human being</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.150" end="00:12:43.160" style="s2">begins really to think terms of epochs</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.730" end="00:12:45.740" style="s2">first of all that are clear-cut writers</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.160" end="00:12:46.790" style="s2">the Middle Ages the Roman period that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.740" end="00:12:48.920" style="s2">the ancient times</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.790" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">there&#39;s pre historical times very</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.920" end="00:12:54.290" style="s2">interesting way of thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:57.380" style="s2">too and what modern means present so we</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.290" end="00:13:00.350" style="s2">think of this as a full sheer presence</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.380" end="00:13:02.360" style="s2">perhaps I&#39;m just explaining this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.350" end="00:13:05.300" style="s2">etymologically I might be wrong of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.360" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">course but I think that what we&#39;re done</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.300" end="00:13:09.080" style="s2">is said what modernity is what people</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:12.050" style="s2">have called it&#39;s an explosion of in</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.080" end="00:13:15.650" style="s2">abstract intelligence it&#39;s an explosion</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.050" end="00:13:20.450" style="s2">of intellect it&#39;s an explosion of power</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.650" end="00:13:22.040" style="s2">as well and that set off by something</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.450" end="00:13:24.290" style="s2">that&#39;s been brewing and then made</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.040" end="00:13:28.040" style="s2">possible by what heilige actually calls</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.290" end="00:13:30.440" style="s2">the rebellion against feeding and the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.040" end="00:13:33.980" style="s2">rebelling against being is what they cut</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.440" end="00:13:36.350" style="s2">and Francis Bacon literally do they they</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.980" end="00:13:39.170" style="s2">do rebel if you read from from Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.350" end="00:13:41.810" style="s2">you can see it because they begins bacon</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.170" end="00:13:44.870" style="s2">for example says we need to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.810" end="00:13:47.750" style="s2">the Telos right of the of the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.870" end="00:13:51.530" style="s2">nature of its of its goal its inherent</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.750" end="00:13:53.690" style="s2">meaning Descartes says something similar</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.530" end="00:13:56.900" style="s2">because then we can kind of mash up</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.690" end="00:13:59.500" style="s2">everything and set poss it literally</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.900" end="00:14:03.620" style="s2">posit what it means for something to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.500" end="00:14:05.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.620" end="00:14:07.400" style="s2">what kicks modernity officer gives</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.240" end="00:14:10.700" style="s2">tremendous powers to the Hugh being</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.400" end="00:14:13.220" style="s2">right but at the same time it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.700" end="00:14:15.770" style="s2">perhaps also something else at work not</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.220" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">not just us as Heidegger often says</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.770" end="00:14:19.850" style="s2">which is functionaries of Technology</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.600" end="00:14:23.570" style="s2">we&#39;re actually just executing something</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.850" end="00:14:27.320" style="s2">that&#39;s working through us and and we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:15:13.879" end="00:15:18.289" style="s2">pushing against nature it will fight</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.249" end="00:15:20.659" style="s2">back one way or another it&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.009" end="00:15:38.659" style="s2">will soon all be immortal but by</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.409" end="00:15:41.059" style="s2">uploading ourselves to the clouds or we</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.659" end="00:15:43.429" style="s2">will have flying cars we will we will</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.059" end="00:15:46.729" style="s2">have a perfectly streamlined existence</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.429" end="00:15:49.549" style="s2">from you know birth not even birth but</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.729" end="00:15:51.169" style="s2">this making myself and then not really</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.549" end="00:15:55.339" style="s2">dying right I&#39;m not good it&#39;s just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.169" end="00:15:57.109" style="s2">be a streamlined extended line on which</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.339" end="00:16:00.049" style="s2">I can make experience after experience</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.109" end="00:16:04.189" style="s2">after experience to get a thrill to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.049" end="00:16:06.439" style="s2">a kick out of it but I&#39;m not but I&#39;m but</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.189" end="00:16:09.499" style="s2">so I&#39;m kind of you know we&#39;re all that</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.439" end="00:16:13.309" style="s2">shot Rian&#39;s right to be pissed facetious</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.499" end="00:16:16.279" style="s2">we make ourselves and then there comes</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.309" end="00:16:17.869" style="s2">along this stupid piece of machinery</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.279" end="00:16:20.389" style="s2">that&#39;s not even I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.869" end="00:16:24.709" style="s2">virus of life it isn&#39;t probably right v</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.389" end="00:16:29.119" style="s2">by definition and says no and it just</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.709" end="00:16:32.029" style="s2">shuts down and what what I saw even</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.119" end="00:16:35.419" style="s2">before this extreme outbreak now of</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.029" end="00:16:37.009" style="s2">these cracks is that the self certainty</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.419" end="00:16:39.169" style="s2">of subjectivity</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.009" end="00:16:42.199" style="s2">let&#39;s Cartesian self certainty that had</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.169" end="00:16:45.079" style="s2">already I think had begun to crack over</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.199" end="00:16:47.720" style="s2">the past years and many maybe decades</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.079" end="00:16:49.880" style="s2">even but it&#39;s now accelerating so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.720" end="00:16:52.790" style="s2">certainty is gone the model</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.880" end="00:16:54.440" style="s2">of that many that we you know many have</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.790" end="00:16:56.600" style="s2">in their heads off this is how the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.440" end="00:16:58.390" style="s2">works and we just make everything fit</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.600" end="00:17:00.800" style="s2">into that model whatever that may be</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.390" end="00:17:02.660" style="s2">like a Procrustes bed you know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.800" end="00:17:05.360" style="s2">expression when you have a bed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.660" end="00:17:07.190" style="s2">too small for a patient you just put the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.360" end="00:17:08.810" style="s2">patient in understood this has got to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.190" end="00:17:11.209" style="s2">fit and this is how we interact with</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.810" end="00:17:11.780" style="s2">nature right it has to fit our model our</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.209" end="00:17:14.300" style="s2">so called</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.780" end="00:17:17.540" style="s2">worldview and whatever doesn&#39;t fit is</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.300" end="00:17:20.000" style="s2">cut off again by this and framing and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.540" end="00:17:23.060" style="s2">see literally now I mean now is becoming</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.000" end="00:17:26.569" style="s2">visible that there are cracks in gifted</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.060" end="00:17:29.030" style="s2">but then at the same time so so I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.569" end="00:17:31.930" style="s2">claiming to know what&#39;s coming right I</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.030" end="00:17:35.630" style="s2">can&#39;t see the future I&#39;m not calm arcs</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.930" end="00:17:38.690" style="s2">but I what I what I what I think a</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.630" end="00:17:40.100" style="s2">thinker can do is to see that all of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.690" end="00:17:42.500" style="s2">sudden there&#39;s something else that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.100" end="00:17:44.420" style="s2">possible again that others have been</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.500" end="00:17:48.290" style="s2">shouting about for decades anyways as</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.420" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">for example memento mori remember that</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.290" end="00:17:52.550" style="s2">you are mortal that you were a finite</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:56.060" style="s2">being and that anything you touch and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.550" end="00:17:59.450" style="s2">create yourself will be finite and</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.060" end="00:18:02.210" style="s2">fragile and you cannot generate this one</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.450" end="00:18:07.790" style="s2">perfect system that&#39;ll be a one size</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.210" end="00:18:11.720" style="s2">fits all for all eternity yeah great so</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.790" end="00:18:13.220" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which so basically what</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.720" end="00:18:18.290" style="s2">you&#39;re saying is is what I&#39;m hearing you</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.220" end="00:18:20.950" style="s2">say is so thought right for philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.290" end="00:18:23.780" style="s2">isn&#39;t the thing going on beginner inner</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.950" end="00:18:26.840" style="s2">the wiggly electrical things going on in</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.780" end="00:18:30.320" style="s2">our brain it&#39;s more like I&#39;m getting the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.840" end="00:18:36.500" style="s2">sense of like a philosopher in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.320" end="00:18:40.780" style="s2">sense tunes into what the intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.500" end="00:18:43.550" style="s2">eligibility of of the time and begins to</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.780" end="00:18:46.070" style="s2">begins to almost perceive it and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.550" end="00:18:49.000" style="s2">bring voice to it so it&#39;s not like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.070" end="00:18:51.980" style="s2">thought it&#39;s not like the philosopher um</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.000" end="00:18:54.950" style="s2">thinks modernity in its head it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.980" end="00:18:58.550" style="s2">like the philosopher emerges out of its</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.950" end="00:19:00.140" style="s2">time and then begins to speak what has</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.550" end="00:19:03.710" style="s2">already been emerging in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.140" end="00:19:08.450" style="s2">yeah so we don&#39;t dream up some</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.710" end="00:19:12.529" style="s2">thing that&#39;s not there yeah and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.450" end="00:19:16.250" style="s2">exactly so we can&#39;t I mean what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.529" end="00:19:18.890" style="s2">envision in that sense is is but but in</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.250" end="00:19:20.450" style="s2">terms of philosophy it&#39;s it&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.890" end="00:19:23.570" style="s2">profound because if it must if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.450" end="00:19:26.659" style="s2">genuine philosophy it must respond to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.570" end="00:19:29.230" style="s2">what thought always had to respond to</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.659" end="00:19:32.029" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s truth and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.230" end="00:19:34.669" style="s2">some of the principles that thought</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.029" end="00:19:37.820" style="s2">simply has for example the identity</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.669" end="00:19:39.740" style="s2">between being in thought which you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.820" end="00:19:43.669" style="s2">doubt but you still have to presuppose</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.740" end="00:19:46.760" style="s2">it okay but but we&#39;re we&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.669" end="00:19:50.840" style="s2">actually I think in a time off off sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.760" end="00:19:53.870" style="s2">or fantasy where for example take the</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.840" end="00:19:57.140" style="s2">example of transhumanism transhumanism I</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.870" end="00:19:59.990" style="s2">so I&#39;ve been ever since I came across</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.140" end="00:20:02.779" style="s2">them I found him a bit of fun just we it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.990" end="00:20:06.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t wicked but I just recently</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.779" end="00:20:08.179" style="s2">realized the why I find it so why I find</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.919" end="00:20:09.620" style="s2">it so appalling you know why I find it</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.179" end="00:20:11.539" style="s2">so even because what it does is</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.620" end="00:20:15.049" style="s2">interactionism comes in many forms but</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.539" end="00:20:17.750" style="s2">the crudest one is where they would with</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.049" end="00:20:22.250" style="s2">the promise of salvation so you will be</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.750" end="00:20:24.049" style="s2">digital digitally immortal yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.250" end="00:20:27.919" style="s2">new Christianity right they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.049" end="00:20:30.710" style="s2">good Christianity and then because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.919" end="00:20:33.169" style="s2">because all because all it&#39;ll be like it</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.710" end="00:20:36.640" style="s2">won&#39;t be oneness with the Creator it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.169" end="00:20:38.450" style="s2">just be me online in the cloud</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.640" end="00:20:40.190" style="s2">fulfilling my desires</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.450" end="00:20:42.679" style="s2">that&#39;s literally that&#39;s the promise of</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.190" end="00:20:44.419" style="s2">records well what I find wicked about</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.679" end="00:20:47.899" style="s2">all of these promises about the future</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.419" end="00:20:50.570" style="s2">is that they&#39;re their fantasies right</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.899" end="00:20:53.179" style="s2">this is kind of this hope for a utopia</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.570" end="00:20:56.720" style="s2">to come whatever that looks like traps</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.179" end="00:20:57.529" style="s2">us in a fancy of a future that cannot be</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.720" end="00:20:59.510" style="s2">fulfilled</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.529" end="00:21:02.630" style="s2">I mean psychologically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.510" end="00:21:08.059" style="s2">devastating and historically I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.630" end="00:21:11.779" style="s2">that this has tremendous just effects on</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.059" end="00:21:15.950" style="s2">on on on us to but it also cuts us off</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.779" end="00:21:16.909" style="s2">from that which has been right so people</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.950" end="00:21:18.619" style="s2">talk about a meaning</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.909" end="00:21:20.809" style="s2">crisis or nihilism or a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.619" end="00:21:22.789" style="s2">meaninglessness what is that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.809" end="00:21:25.609" style="s2">literally if you want to speak just</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.789" end="00:21:28.849" style="s2">cause a listicle ii which i that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.609" end="00:21:32.090" style="s2">effect of being cut off from being being</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.849" end="00:21:34.970" style="s2">cut off from a sense of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.090" end="00:21:37.099" style="s2">something extended way beyond me right</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.970" end="00:21:39.529" style="s2">as Heidegger puts it which is thrown</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.099" end="00:21:42.529" style="s2">into das and we&#39;re thrown into existence</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.529" end="00:21:44.960" style="s2">we don&#39;t make ourselves we get like we</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.529" end="00:21:48.229" style="s2">we have to take on this burden of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.960" end="00:21:51.559" style="s2">existence and find our path but this</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.229" end="00:21:54.440" style="s2">path cannot be made yeah from from</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.559" end="00:21:56.960" style="s2">nothing yes it must be sorry yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.440" end="00:22:00.379" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like is it that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.960" end="00:22:02.629" style="s2">in the language of being in time it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.379" end="00:22:04.519" style="s2">called coping rights what he&#39;s talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.629" end="00:22:07.129" style="s2">about that that we&#39;re not a we&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.519" end="00:22:12.019" style="s2">being that shows up and creates its</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.129" end="00:22:17.179" style="s2">destiny we&#39;re already thrown into a time</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.019" end="00:22:20.450" style="s2">and that what the human being is is a is</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.179" end="00:22:22.369" style="s2">is a coping right through a particular</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.450" end="00:22:24.649" style="s2">kind of caring and I know he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.369" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">it there&#39;s like the authentic mode and</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.649" end="00:22:28.669" style="s2">the inauthentic modem being in time but</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:31.940" style="s2">that sense of that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.669" end="00:22:33.889" style="s2">I&#39;ve really noticed about art in just my</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.940" end="00:22:35.539" style="s2">lifetime I&#39;ve watched I&#39;ve seen this</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.889" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">kind of change happen which is just</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.539" end="00:22:42.109" style="s2">trippy to watch dramatic changes in</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:45.799" style="s2">understanding what existence is in one</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.109" end="00:22:52.609" style="s2">lifetime right no but there is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.799" end="00:22:54.369" style="s2">sense in which it this this this even</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.609" end="00:22:59.210" style="s2">the way that a lot of people talk about</p>

<p begin="00:23:08.389" end="00:23:13.340" style="s2">of life is problem-solving I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.549" end="00:23:15.919" style="s2">that&#39;s one of his books mm-hmm and so no</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.340" end="00:23:17.929" style="s2">I mean but but we can talk about what</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.919" end="00:23:20.359" style="s2">the world what the word problem means</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.929" end="00:23:23.210" style="s2">yeah yeah but the way that they</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.359" end="00:23:26.239" style="s2">understand it is of course it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.210" end="00:23:30.380" style="s2">formal logical problem yeah so well it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:24:06.140" end="00:24:12.440" style="s2">with the elements of the one element</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:15.980" style="s2">fire pool is one as as Heraclitus is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.440" end="00:24:18.080" style="s2">everliving fire the fire is not nothing</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.980" end="00:24:21.730" style="s2">but physicists claim it to be something</p>

<p begin="00:24:29.720" end="00:24:34.309" style="s2">right they don&#39;t underestimate the power</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.090" end="00:24:40.580" style="s2">of fire and what it is and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.309" end="00:24:42.919" style="s2">fire is the fact that we can have kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.580" end="00:24:47.000" style="s2">of cultivated a relationship with fire</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.919" end="00:24:48.770" style="s2">is tremendous but so you look at a</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.000" end="00:24:52.220" style="s2">painting like this and then you move on</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.770" end="00:24:55.809" style="s2">to a truth value table like like dead</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.220" end="00:24:58.669" style="s2">Wittgensteinian nonsense or pop Aryan or</p>

<p begin="00:25:13.520" end="00:25:18.950" style="s2">trap you in these kind of an autism um</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.059" end="00:25:22.280" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t that takes you away from</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.950" end="00:25:26.419" style="s2">any kind of genuine problems but and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.280" end="00:25:29.299" style="s2">and yeah so what I mean which we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.419" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">literally trapped in the weirdest and</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.299" end="00:25:36.980" style="s2">framing that you can imagine where all</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:38.780" style="s2">of it as you say is you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.980" end="00:25:40.940" style="s2">linear it&#39;s a line it&#39;s a straight line</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.780" end="00:25:43.159" style="s2">and on that straight line there will</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.940" end="00:25:44.600" style="s2">just be some problems waiting to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.159" end="00:25:49.399" style="s2">solved</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.600" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">right but they won&#39;t but they won&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.399" end="00:25:54.230" style="s2">can solve them without contradiction you</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:57.350" style="s2">can this is why Hegel brings back</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.230" end="00:25:59.269" style="s2">contradiction hmm he brings he brings</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.350" end="00:26:01.429" style="s2">back contradiction because he sees that</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.269" end="00:26:03.139" style="s2">with cop R then with Fixodent their</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.429" end="00:26:05.779" style="s2">crackling with something that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.139" end="00:26:07.610" style="s2">struggling with with with thought right</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.779" end="00:26:10.130" style="s2">there dad struggling with the truth of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.610" end="00:26:11.659" style="s2">the question what it means that being is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.130" end="00:26:15.259" style="s2">identical with with thought and there</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.659" end="00:26:17.029" style="s2">must be one Ness and 450 there can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.259" end="00:26:18.950" style="s2">any contradiction there mustn&#39;t be any</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.029" end="00:26:22.190" style="s2">antinomies of reason but but fitted and</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.950" end="00:26:24.950" style="s2">us in so doing is he completely turns</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.190" end="00:26:27.710" style="s2">nature into a fiction yeah he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.950" end="00:26:29.049" style="s2">want this I&#39;m not saying this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.710" end="00:26:30.889" style="s2">intentional it&#39;s just this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.049" end="00:26:32.929" style="s2">unfortunately that&#39;s the results and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.889" end="00:26:36.080" style="s2">then shelling in Hegel each in their own</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.929" end="00:26:37.879" style="s2">way want to get back to what they people</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.080" end="00:26:40.820" style="s2">call objective ideas they won&#39;t get want</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.879" end="00:26:43.399" style="s2">to get back into nature but for Hegel is</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.820" end="00:26:45.529" style="s2">we need to have the cop objects aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.399" end="00:26:48.529" style="s2">you cannot construct an object without</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.529" end="00:26:50.389" style="s2">contradiction if because if like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.529" end="00:26:53.710" style="s2">world we live in now is basically a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.389" end="00:26:57.379" style="s2">Content transcendental world in which</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.710" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">objects really are without contradiction</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.379" end="00:27:01.009" style="s2">but that also means without resistance</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:02.929" style="s2">so what we do what we&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.009" end="00:27:05.330" style="s2">our appearances and representations</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.929" end="00:27:08.240" style="s2">nothing that&#39;s real hence this thirst</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.330" end="00:27:10.940" style="s2">for you know real food I mean can you</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.240" end="00:27:13.730" style="s2">imagine living living in an epoch but</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.940" end="00:27:18.679" style="s2">you walk around a city is it Oh they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.730" end="00:27:20.539" style="s2">got real coffee here honey you know not</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.679" end="00:27:24.710" style="s2">just the idea of coffee it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.539" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">walking through Plato&#39;s cave so and yet</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.710" end="00:27:31.399" style="s2">yeah yeah totally completely completely</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:35.149" style="s2">there&#39;s a so there&#39;s a thing that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.399" end="00:27:37.639" style="s2">said in one of your videos I think he</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.149" end="00:27:40.370" style="s2">started off where which I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.639" end="00:27:45.340" style="s2">thinking about since and it struck me he</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.370" end="00:27:49.700" style="s2">said rarely is philosophy philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.340" end="00:27:53.590" style="s2">timely right yeah and you were referring</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.700" end="00:27:55.070" style="s2">to now that now may be the time that</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.590" end="00:27:58.160" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.070" end="00:27:59.840" style="s2">lastly maybe timely yeah in</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.160" end="00:28:01.640" style="s2">sense of and I think I wrote you about</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.840" end="00:28:04.880" style="s2">something about the like the crack and</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.640" end="00:28:07.340" style="s2">modernity or the crack and castel yep um</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.880" end="00:28:08.090" style="s2">as and I&#39;m imagining those two are</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.340" end="00:28:10.730" style="s2">connected</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.090" end="00:28:11.960" style="s2">oh yeah what is it about philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.730" end="00:28:15.500" style="s2">first of all what is it about philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.960" end="00:28:18.890" style="s2">that often makes it untimely right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.500" end="00:28:24.140" style="s2">what is it about philosophy now in this</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.890" end="00:28:27.290" style="s2">time that makes it timely so I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.140" end="00:28:32.180" style="s2">not sure what exactly is happening right</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.290" end="00:28:34.190" style="s2">now and this is honor this is so this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.180" end="00:28:36.950" style="s2">really just in the speculation I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.190" end="00:28:40.400" style="s2">speaking as a philosopher perhaps now I</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.950" end="00:28:42.200" style="s2">think what makes what makes thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.400" end="00:28:45.410" style="s2">itself untimely is that when you look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.200" end="00:28:50.330" style="s2">say okay I&#39;ll give you an example when</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.410" end="00:28:52.040" style="s2">physicists talk about dark matter what</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.330" end="00:28:53.900" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about actually is that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.040" end="00:28:55.550" style="s2">they have no clue what&#39;s going on all</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.900" end="00:28:57.560" style="s2">right what they&#39;re saying is that there</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.550" end="00:28:59.960" style="s2">is something concealed something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.560" end="00:29:02.690" style="s2">self concealing mm-hmm and look at</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.960" end="00:29:04.670" style="s2">Heidegger and say oh by the way his</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.690" end="00:29:08.450" style="s2">entire philosophy his way of thinking is</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.670" end="00:29:11.150" style="s2">ignited when he realizes that the Greeks</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:13.850" style="s2">thought truth in terms of ilithyia</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.150" end="00:29:16.670" style="s2">which means unconsumed and where</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.850" end="00:29:19.550" style="s2">concealment is respected so in every</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.670" end="00:29:22.100" style="s2">disclosure there is consuming Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.550" end="00:29:24.560" style="s2">says for example in the Latin humanism</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.100" end="00:29:30.200" style="s2">it might just be that nature does not</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.560" end="00:29:35.060" style="s2">show herself to us in our findings of</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.200" end="00:29:37.460" style="s2">her right whatever we find in our models</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.060" end="00:29:39.290" style="s2">nature might just turn away from us with</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.460" end="00:29:41.990" style="s2">Hegel you get the image that we might</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.290" end="00:29:45.430" style="s2">just be riding on nature as if when a</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.990" end="00:29:47.810" style="s2">horse is back looking for the horse</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.430" end="00:29:50.390" style="s2">because we&#39;re not--we&#39;re not considering</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.810" end="00:29:52.820" style="s2">nature we&#39;re considering our models of</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.419" end="00:30:24.460" style="s2">critique it&#39;s basically all out there</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.250" end="00:30:27.520" style="s2">and if you want to understand our epoch</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.460" end="00:30:29.350" style="s2">you have to understand Plato&#39;s cave in</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.520" end="00:30:31.929" style="s2">the cave what&#39;s being described I mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.350" end="00:30:33.309" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be more untimely oh man what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.929" end="00:30:37.150" style="s2">being described is people looking at</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.309" end="00:30:39.190" style="s2">shadows as if you know staring at</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.150" end="00:30:41.860" style="s2">screens those but those shadows are real</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.190" end="00:30:43.929" style="s2">they make up their world for philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.860" end="00:30:46.750" style="s2">philosophy articulates that which has</p>

<p begin="00:30:46.750" end="00:30:51.760" style="s2">old it take you lates an old truth</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.360" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">written right and it&#39;s therefore it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.760" end="00:30:57.520" style="s2">it&#39;s by by that definition it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:31:01.690" style="s2">untimely and always most timely right</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.520" end="00:31:04.659" style="s2">it&#39;s always urgent but but who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.690" end="00:31:11.140" style="s2">know anything that&#39;s urgent right is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.659" end="00:31:13.090" style="s2">urgent itself if this is frightening</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.140" end="00:31:15.549" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s there&#39;s a certain I&#39;m can eNOS</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.090" end="00:31:18.760" style="s2">so in that sense I think I&#39;m that</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.549" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">philosophy will always be untimely</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.760" end="00:31:25.570" style="s2">enough of course when you look get to</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:30.150" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s occurring now is something</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.570" end="00:31:32.350" style="s2">that feels on some level extremely real</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.150" end="00:31:35.799" style="s2">there&#39;s something that&#39;s intensifying</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.350" end="00:31:39.700" style="s2">and has been for four months now right</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.799" end="00:31:43.210" style="s2">this is and time has also changed this</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.700" end="00:31:45.940" style="s2">is 2020 usually you get to march in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.210" end="00:31:47.740" style="s2">year that much has occurred you know but</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.940" end="00:31:52.450" style="s2">this feels like a decade old already</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.740" end="00:31:58.600" style="s2">this year and a lot this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.450" end="00:32:00.900" style="s2">when it&#39;s just italy is standing still</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.600" end="00:32:07.030" style="s2">basically in Italy is a country that</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.900" end="00:32:08.590" style="s2">lives outside right it&#39;s it&#39;s so that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.030" end="00:32:10.630" style="s2">there&#39;s a weird moment where for the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.590" end="00:32:12.820" style="s2">first time that the planet right that</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.630" end="00:32:14.590" style="s2">all this talk about there is no planet</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.820" end="00:32:17.860" style="s2">be so with the way we think of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.590" end="00:32:20.950" style="s2">is is the earth entirely objectified as</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.860" end="00:32:24.010" style="s2">a planet an on this planetary scale we</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.950" end="00:32:26.300" style="s2">now have a crisis against an invisible</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.010" end="00:32:27.950" style="s2">enemy where if we follow</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.300" end="00:32:30.410" style="s2">Heraclitus war is the father of</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.950" end="00:32:35.030" style="s2">everything then what&#39;s happening in such</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.410" end="00:32:38.090" style="s2">a war is a rearrangement of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.030" end="00:32:40.220" style="s2">anyways so there will be a natural this</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.090" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">is what war does and war comes in many</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.220" end="00:32:44.210" style="s2">forms right</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:47.530" style="s2">war for Heraclitus if you like is a</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.210" end="00:32:51.020" style="s2">primordial force and something it&#39;s war</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.530" end="00:32:54.740" style="s2">for Heraklion it&#39;s just war war is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.020" end="00:32:59.750" style="s2">king of all war makes slaves and makes</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.740" end="00:33:02.000" style="s2">freemen and war makes gods and mortals</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.750" end="00:33:03.740" style="s2">that&#39;s what war is this process dust</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.000" end="00:33:04.730" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t need two states fighting</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.740" end="00:33:10.490" style="s2">each other right where is this</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.730" end="00:33:14.630" style="s2">primordial force of rearranging in us in</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.490" end="00:33:18.530" style="s2">a proper strife what is what the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.630" end="00:33:20.450" style="s2">is like if i&#39;m in and didn&#39;t this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.530" end="00:33:23.510" style="s2">speaking of time we didn&#39;t right before</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.450" end="00:33:27.290" style="s2">he came on I think Trump tweeted us we</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.510" end="00:33:29.780" style="s2">are at war invisible enemy yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:33.830" style="s2">and that invisible enemy is if you like</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.780" end="00:33:36.650" style="s2">is is this primordial war itself I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.830" end="00:33:38.990" style="s2">we did this is this is now erupting but</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.650" end="00:33:42.380" style="s2">they did is it&#39;s now fully showing</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.990" end="00:33:45.170" style="s2">itself and so when you are a philosopher</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.380" end="00:33:48.260" style="s2">your your and I&#39;m not sure if I am but</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.170" end="00:33:49.790" style="s2">if you are it&#39;s weird to call themselves</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.260" end="00:33:51.740" style="s2">and philosophers right because at this</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.790" end="00:33:53.630" style="s2">point it&#39;s also just an academic title</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.740" end="00:33:57.380" style="s2">and it means nothing but if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.630" end="00:34:00.680" style="s2">thinker maybe I&#39;m a thinker in you you</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.380" end="00:34:02.710" style="s2">owe it I&#39;m kind of sends a bit where</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.680" end="00:34:04.760" style="s2">things are going right you did that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.710" end="00:34:07.880" style="s2">because if you don&#39;t then you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.760" end="00:34:12.110" style="s2">really maybe you should go and do</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.880" end="00:34:13.910" style="s2">something else but so and then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.110" end="00:34:16.190" style="s2">philosophy is dangerous but philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.910" end="00:34:17.810" style="s2">is real this is what I&#39;m thought if he</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.190" end="00:34:20.150" style="s2">isn&#39;t real when it just talks about I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:34:51.820" end="00:34:57.040" style="s2">is so completely pointless</p>

<p begin="00:38:42.250" end="00:38:45.160" style="s2">is why death is a taboo literally</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.930" end="00:38:47.980" style="s2">because double means something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.160" end="00:38:50.920" style="s2">very intense this is why the French</p>

<p begin="00:38:50.920" end="00:38:56.710" style="s2">little death because it&#39;s it&#39;s almost on</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.710" end="00:39:02.440" style="s2">of death and and and right now though</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.760" end="00:39:05.530" style="s2">everyone can feel this intensity of</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.440" end="00:39:07.540" style="s2">existence because all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.530" end="00:39:09.700" style="s2">is a very very very real possibility</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.540" end="00:39:11.470" style="s2">even you know even if some people will</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:13.390" style="s2">still say all the numbers on that band</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.470" end="00:39:14.260" style="s2">people will still say this but too many</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.390" end="00:39:16.510" style="s2">right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.260" end="00:39:18.610" style="s2">something is cracking and that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.510" end="00:39:20.500" style="s2">with death with an intensity of being</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.610" end="00:39:23.620" style="s2">itself that&#39;s showing itself that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.500" end="00:39:27.820" style="s2">existence isn&#39;t just you know nice and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.620" end="00:39:29.260" style="s2">cute but maybe there&#39;s an intense danger</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.820" end="00:39:31.210" style="s2">and everything it is you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.260" end="00:39:33.550" style="s2">you know this that Heidegger calls her</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.210" end="00:39:36.430" style="s2">Denis saying you know where there is</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.550" end="00:39:38.560" style="s2">danger there the saving grace grows also</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.430" end="00:39:40.330" style="s2">now if you if you&#39;re a dreamy</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.560" end="00:39:42.490" style="s2">romanticist and that&#39;s all that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.330" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">you know when it&#39;s dangerous I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.490" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">saved no this is to say that when there</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:48.520" style="s2">is danger they&#39;re saving grace only then</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.960" end="00:39:50.830" style="s2">in the other way around to whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.520" end="00:39:53.800" style="s2">a saving grace that&#39;s where it gets also</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.830" end="00:39:56.650" style="s2">really dangerous so this this intensity</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.800" end="00:40:00.220" style="s2">is is now I think revealing itself and</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.650" end="00:40:01.750" style="s2">all of a sudden people are turning to</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.220" end="00:40:03.940" style="s2">the philosophy I can see it on my</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.750" end="00:40:06.880" style="s2">channel which has you know really gone</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.940" end="00:40:10.120" style="s2">up in just in pure numbers and people</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.880" end="00:40:12.250" style="s2">commenting and sending emails and and</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.120" end="00:40:16.060" style="s2">asking about you know I had one guy</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.250" end="00:40:19.840" style="s2">whose ink say he&#39;s just said something</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.060" end="00:40:22.900" style="s2">like the model I had in my head all my</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.840" end="00:40:24.720" style="s2">life was I want self certainty I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.900" end="00:40:27.610" style="s2">don&#39;t want but where is this coming from</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.720" end="00:40:29.650" style="s2">right and I would have to say look</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.610" end="00:40:34.810" style="s2">you&#39;re an articulation like everybody</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:38.590" style="s2">else like I - like my I am myself as</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.810" end="00:40:41.080" style="s2">well of Cartesian subjectivity that</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.590" end="00:40:43.120" style="s2">one&#39;s absolute self certainty we want</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.080" end="00:40:45.100" style="s2">that but we don&#39;t want to know some</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.120" end="00:40:48.070" style="s2">psychological need or anything no we</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.100" end="00:40:50.620" style="s2">want that because we are living in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.070" end="00:40:53.770" style="s2">paradigm yeah and we don&#39;t have within</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.620" end="00:40:57.610" style="s2">this paradigm what&#39;s not allowed for is</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.770" end="00:41:00.520" style="s2">tragedy now who is the thinker who gets</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.610" end="00:41:03.040" style="s2">into tragedy is Nietzsche the birth of</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.520" end="00:41:08.320" style="s2">tragedy is his first proper book yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.040" end="00:41:10.930" style="s2">and Nietzsche also says in in Sara</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.320" end="00:41:13.300" style="s2">through straw and in the gay science</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.930" end="00:41:15.640" style="s2">right after the passage on the eternal</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.300" end="00:41:17.770" style="s2">returns of the same and people will know</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.640" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">that in the gay science he also speaks</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.770" end="00:41:22.630" style="s2">of the death of God</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:26.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a passage which is entitled</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.630" end="00:41:30.890" style="s2">insipid Gregoria which means this is a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.240" end="00:41:34.490" style="s2">Latin may tragedy begin this is what he</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.890" end="00:41:36.770" style="s2">wants for for you know modern man to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.490" end="00:41:40.460" style="s2">appreciate again is that we need this</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.770" end="00:41:42.350" style="s2">sense of tragedy because if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.460" end="00:41:45.260" style="s2">then what we&#39;re trying to do it this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.350" end="00:41:47.390" style="s2">get back gets back to your point is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.260" end="00:41:50.570" style="s2">then what we&#39;re trying to do is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.390" end="00:41:52.340" style="s2">trying to we&#39;re trying to everything is</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.570" end="00:41:55.490" style="s2">just a problem waiting to be solved</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.340" end="00:41:59.120" style="s2">yeah but death is this unresolvable</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.490" end="00:42:01.160" style="s2">tragedy or problem mystery at the heart</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.120" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">of existence and that&#39;s what&#39;s tragic</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.160" end="00:42:06.710" style="s2">about existence you cannot resolve death</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:09.770" style="s2">this is why transhumanism of course must</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.710" end="00:42:13.400" style="s2">this is why gifted in framing must work</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.770" end="00:42:15.950" style="s2">against death and what I see now is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.400" end="00:42:17.750" style="s2">are cracks and these cracks are in</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.950" end="00:42:21.020" style="s2">absolute I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.750" end="00:42:26.030" style="s2">world to come but what I am saying I</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.020" end="00:42:32.300" style="s2">said we can now almost like almost like</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.030" end="00:42:37.820" style="s2">I wants like drawing from the ether</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.300" end="00:42:40.100" style="s2">drawing from something that could be and</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.820" end="00:42:41.540" style="s2">then you know pushing towards that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.100" end="00:42:44.900" style="s2">almost always like a leaning into and</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.540" end="00:42:46.700" style="s2">pushing in that direction now I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.900" end="00:42:48.710" style="s2">know I&#39;m not gonna say it like this</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.700" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">because I don&#39;t because it sounds very</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.710" end="00:42:54.860" style="s2">like a cliche no there&#39;ll be a shift in</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:57.080" style="s2">consciousness and okay yeah but you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.860" end="00:42:59.630" style="s2">consciousness is again just cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.080" end="00:43:03.070" style="s2">yeah yeah what we want is this</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.630" end="00:43:07.430" style="s2">existential ontological yeah fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.070" end="00:43:12.290" style="s2">just total shift towards a community of</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.430" end="00:43:15.350" style="s2">mortals an appreciation of of beauty and</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.290" end="00:43:17.090" style="s2">life etc and of all of the things we</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.350" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">usually talk about right but this is now</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.090" end="00:43:21.470" style="s2">I mean speaking of the meaning crisis on</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:24.740" style="s2">the conversations we&#39;ve had before we</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.470" end="00:43:27.920" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t wanna I&#39;ve no more shards</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.740" end="00:43:30.860" style="s2">being built yeah yeah there are the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.920" end="00:43:32.090" style="s2">first things we talked about yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.860" end="00:43:33.980" style="s2">absolute</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.090" end="00:43:39.710" style="s2">and I just you know so you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.980" end="00:43:40.730" style="s2">about being mortal and that that attempt</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.710" end="00:43:43.790" style="s2">to erase it</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.730" end="00:43:46.280" style="s2">oh yeah it&#39;s is the the sense I get</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.790" end="00:43:49.730" style="s2">about the way that that you and in</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.280" end="00:43:52.790" style="s2">Heidegger talk about this technological</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.730" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">era where our understanding of being is</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.790" end="00:44:02.000" style="s2">is Hypertech may constantly my</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:04.520" style="s2">understanding is you know Nietzsche was</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.000" end="00:44:08.840" style="s2">the one that named the onto a theology</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.520" end="00:44:12.380" style="s2">of more time the the the Anto the</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.840" end="00:44:14.180" style="s2">innermost being something like the the</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.380" end="00:44:17.630" style="s2">will to power right this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.180" end="00:44:21.140" style="s2">meaningless absurd Inc a otic becoming</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.630" end="00:44:24.590" style="s2">and then the Theo&#39;s the God&#39;s eye view</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.140" end="00:44:27.290" style="s2">being the eternal return of the same so</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.590" end="00:44:29.450" style="s2">this endless just this the surging up in</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.290" end="00:44:37.130" style="s2">this order ability and positioning for</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.450" end="00:44:38.390" style="s2">almost for its own sake where and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.130" end="00:44:40.100" style="s2">we can talk a little bit about this</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.390" end="00:44:42.410" style="s2">about this transition from where my</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.100" end="00:44:45.170" style="s2">understanding is that that that that</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.410" end="00:44:47.980" style="s2">shift in understanding being as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.170" end="00:44:50.630" style="s2">standing reserve to be optimized that</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.980" end="00:44:52.970" style="s2">like actually we&#39;re not even we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.630" end="00:44:57.170" style="s2">even view ourselves as the subject</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.970" end="00:44:59.930" style="s2">anymore we view ourselves as a standing</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.170" end="00:45:01.100" style="s2">reserve right so so this whole notion of</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.930" end="00:45:05.840" style="s2">like biohacking</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.100" end="00:45:07.970" style="s2">alright like quantum like the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.840" end="00:45:10.820" style="s2">self and measuring everything and</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.970" end="00:45:14.690" style="s2">looking all your in the way that we even</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.820" end="00:45:18.410" style="s2">do education now ray is yeah like</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.690" end="00:45:22.940" style="s2">homework and in grades and papers have</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.410" end="00:45:25.820" style="s2">less and less hold and education now</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.940" end="00:45:27.710" style="s2">it&#39;s these tests that yeah like measure</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.820" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2">your kind of IQ and these different</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.710" end="00:45:32.270" style="s2">things and that is the thing that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:36.280" style="s2">most focused on is like even our kids</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.270" end="00:45:38.990" style="s2">are like a resource to optimize so</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.280" end="00:45:41.590" style="s2">minors ending is what the optimization</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.990" end="00:45:44.920" style="s2">does in the in the senses it removes</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.590" end="00:45:46.930" style="s2">friction right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.920" end="00:45:48.339" style="s2">I often do get at this is this way you</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.930" end="00:45:52.119" style="s2">can really get at this is sometimes what</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.339" end="00:45:56.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll do is all on my iPad as if this is</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.119" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">on technological but I&#39;ll handwrite a an</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.200" end="00:46:02.019" style="s2">email to somebody and it&#39;s so funny the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:05.529" style="s2">responses I get they&#39;re like what are</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.019" end="00:46:08.410" style="s2">you doing to our communication write it</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.529" end="00:46:13.210" style="s2">what I did is I introduced a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.410" end="00:46:14.710" style="s2">friction right so and and they can&#39;t in</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.210" end="00:46:17.619" style="s2">other words they can just lift like</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.710" end="00:46:20.470" style="s2">optimize and collapse distances they</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.619" end="00:46:24.130" style="s2">actually have to deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.470" end="00:46:25.900" style="s2">originality and the the the Cork&#39;s of my</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.130" end="00:46:28.749" style="s2">handwriting and go through something</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.900" end="00:46:32.019" style="s2">right but you can kind of get the sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.749" end="00:46:34.269" style="s2">of like if if you if I had to if I had</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.019" end="00:46:36.970" style="s2">to struggle with your handwriting at the</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.269" end="00:46:39.400" style="s2">end of what you wrote I&#39;m gonna end up</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.970" end="00:46:42.930" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna end up in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.400" end="00:46:45.999" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be more more disclosed</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.930" end="00:46:48.369" style="s2">right through that experience you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.999" end="00:46:52.150" style="s2">gonna be more present because I actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.369" end="00:46:53.410" style="s2">had to encounter resistance and what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.150" end="00:46:57.210" style="s2">hearing you say is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.410" end="00:47:00.400" style="s2">something about this this this</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.210" end="00:47:03.910" style="s2">realization of tragedy right yeah right</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.400" end="00:47:07.420" style="s2">is is is the is the resistance that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.910" end="00:47:09.369" style="s2">can&#39;t ever get over right yeah we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.420" end="00:47:13.630" style="s2">try to cover it up which is what this</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.369" end="00:47:20.769" style="s2">time is but it&#39;s actually the key to our</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.630" end="00:47:22.930" style="s2">ecstatic &#39;no sits the key to yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.769" end="00:47:25.809" style="s2">what we actually are here to contribute</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.930" end="00:47:28.869" style="s2">in some way is in some ways i think is</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.809" end="00:47:32.140" style="s2">our death is this our finitude on a</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.869" end="00:47:34.029" style="s2">sunset right it&#39;s like we bring even</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.140" end="00:47:36.730" style="s2">just the the the the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.029" end="00:47:38.230" style="s2">experience of looking at a sunset i was</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.730" end="00:47:41.529" style="s2">thinking about this the other day we</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.230" end="00:47:43.660" style="s2">because we just moved to Alameda and we</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.529" end="00:47:46.239" style="s2">have a little bit of a view and there</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.660" end="00:47:48.549" style="s2">were a spectacular sunset and Briana&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.239" end="00:47:51.509" style="s2">like hey let&#39;s go watch when we we stood</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.549" end="00:47:55.120" style="s2">outside and we&#39;re just mesmerised and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.509" end="00:48:01.120" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting because I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.120" end="00:48:04.780" style="s2">it&#39;s precisely it&#39;s precisely my like</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.120" end="00:48:07.660" style="s2">what like my finitude on that sunset is</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.780" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">what allowed it to shine forth right</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.660" end="00:48:14.020" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s actually my my limitation</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:16.120" style="s2">it&#39;s my mortality it&#39;s my death it</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.020" end="00:48:19.590" style="s2">allows things to kind of come forward</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.120" end="00:48:19.590" style="s2">and stand for a moment</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.869" end="00:48:21.930" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.080" end="00:48:29.450" style="s2">so there&#39;s a there&#39;s a there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.910" end="00:48:30.770" style="s2">there&#39;s a way where I&#39;m kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.450" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">the sense of like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.770" end="00:48:37.070" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on right now where</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.000" end="00:48:39.170" style="s2">what I&#39;m hearing you say is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.070" end="00:48:41.840" style="s2">something that can actually disrupt all</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.170" end="00:48:44.630" style="s2">of our in framing all of our collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.840" end="00:48:48.560" style="s2">distances yeah encountering something</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.630" end="00:48:50.930" style="s2">that actually has could have more power</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.560" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">over us than us on it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.930" end="00:48:57.560" style="s2">and that the opportunity is something in</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:49:02.680" style="s2">there about the recognition or the</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.560" end="00:49:09.020" style="s2">realization of is it is it our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.680" end="00:49:12.170" style="s2">yeah and so a couple of things his on</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.020" end="00:49:16.250" style="s2">the on the quantum cell fried the</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.170" end="00:49:23.180" style="s2">measuring oneself yeah when you when you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.250" end="00:49:27.020" style="s2">look at a painting so you look at look</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.180" end="00:49:29.090" style="s2">at envision any painting you&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.020" end="00:49:33.830" style="s2">look at I&#39;m thinking of turner of</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.090" end="00:49:35.450" style="s2">lakebottom yeah well no I can cuz it</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.830" end="00:49:38.090" style="s2">there at the Tate which is now closed</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.450" end="00:49:40.400" style="s2">for the first time in 120 years of</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.090" end="00:49:45.200" style="s2">history so that&#39;s that&#39;s how severe the</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.400" end="00:49:47.030" style="s2">situations and so I mean an admission</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.200" end="00:49:51.500" style="s2">make butter me and this master of light</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.030" end="00:49:53.630" style="s2">and darkness now I can see this and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.500" end="00:49:57.020" style="s2">lake begins to shine forth and in this</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.630" end="00:50:02.060" style="s2">proper sense of theoria I begin to see</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.020" end="00:50:04.010" style="s2">nature and nature looks at me in her in</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.060" end="00:50:05.870" style="s2">her arrays and in her reason this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.010" end="00:50:07.610" style="s2">what art does friend how do you put the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.870" end="00:50:10.940" style="s2">different he would say that earth and</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.610" end="00:50:13.430" style="s2">world strife in the painting then that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.940" end="00:50:16.910" style="s2">what a hey Gillian would say is that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.430" end="00:50:21.740" style="s2">reason itself comes towards us in nature</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.910" end="00:50:23.780" style="s2">if we let it occur um now the quantum</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.740" end="00:50:26.420" style="s2">like but what I can do of course I can</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.780" end="00:50:29.960" style="s2">look at this painting and be very</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.420" end="00:50:34.400" style="s2">analytical about it and say and just</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.960" end="00:50:35.450" style="s2">analyze the colours used or an allure I</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.400" end="00:50:37.820" style="s2">don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.450" end="00:50:41.420" style="s2">listicles what does it mean leo Greek</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.820" end="00:50:43.910" style="s2">means I destroy and Annalee we get the</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.420" end="00:50:45.530" style="s2">radical from means to I dissolve so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.910" end="00:50:48.380" style="s2">dissolve you pull everything apart and</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.530" end="00:50:49.790" style="s2">until nothing&#39;s left okay so you can</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.380" end="00:50:52.130" style="s2">analyze the painting and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.790" end="00:50:54.110" style="s2">paint again oh so what color would and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.130" end="00:50:56.930" style="s2">then you can Suman you can use any kind</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.110" end="00:50:59.210" style="s2">of machinery to zoom in and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.930" end="00:51:02.210" style="s2">quantum structure of the painting you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.210" end="00:51:05.270" style="s2">destroyed it it&#39;s gone yeah so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.210" end="00:51:08.870" style="s2">find yourself right you don&#39;t find self</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.270" end="00:51:12.680" style="s2">certainty by measuring every heartbeat</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.870" end="00:51:16.270" style="s2">that&#39;s not you I mean if this is what do</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.680" end="00:51:19.400" style="s2">you think you are then you&#39;re gone</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.270" end="00:51:21.740" style="s2">you&#39;ve disappeared yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.400" end="00:51:23.660" style="s2">machine and this is nothing to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.740" end="00:51:25.970" style="s2">celebrated this is literally becoming</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.660" end="00:51:27.890" style="s2">even even more than just a functionary</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.970" end="00:51:30.350" style="s2">of technologists is becoming properly</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.890" end="00:51:31.900" style="s2">enslaved by technology all right and</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.350" end="00:51:34.580" style="s2">this is because you know you&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.900" end="00:51:38.390" style="s2">executing some of its demands you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.580" end="00:51:40.070" style="s2">succumbing yourself to it whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.390" end="00:51:43.930" style="s2">really is this is also something quite</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.070" end="00:51:47.450" style="s2">uncanny because technology isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.930" end="00:51:49.850" style="s2">human reason coming to absolute full</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.450" end="00:51:51.680" style="s2">fruition and awe all of our knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.850" end="00:51:53.300" style="s2">entrapped in all of these machines so</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.680" end="00:51:55.580" style="s2">that&#39;s something I thought about then</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.300" end="00:51:58.460" style="s2">when you were speaking and then of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.580" end="00:52:05.800" style="s2">course the other question is what what</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.460" end="00:52:10.820" style="s2">is it to experience or see beauty and I</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.800" end="00:52:12.160" style="s2">think that beauty and tragedy are so</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.820" end="00:52:15.500" style="s2">close to each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.160" end="00:52:20.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not they just seem so close to each</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.500" end="00:52:24.140" style="s2">other to me yeah the this I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.870" end="00:52:31.580" style="s2">thinking also of dr. Faustus of Goethe&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.140" end="00:52:32.690" style="s2">Faust and Goethe is one of the keys to</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.580" end="00:52:36.380" style="s2">understanding modernity</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.690" end="00:52:41.210" style="s2">and we&#39;ll have master for example that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.380" end="00:52:46.400" style="s2">about the machinations of shall we say</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.210" end="00:52:48.350" style="s2">of certain concealed groups then that</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.400" end="00:52:49.019" style="s2">this so there&#39;s consumer in history good</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.350" end="00:52:54.689" style="s2">he tells us</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.019" end="00:52:57.299" style="s2">very very openly then you have dr.</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.689" end="00:53:02.009" style="s2">Faustus who makes a pact with the devil</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.299" end="00:53:06.089" style="s2">with mephistopheles and you know it</p>

<p begin="01:07:57.699" end="01:08:07.329" style="s2">a sense of wholeness that&#39;s how this</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.910" end="01:08:10.150" style="s2">emerges is when when when there&#39;s no</p>

<p begin="01:08:17.159" end="01:08:25.630" style="s2">way yeah um I but I also have to just</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.429" end="01:08:28.119" style="s2">thought of something when you use the</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.630" end="01:08:31.349" style="s2">word ecstatic and also you know this way</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.119" end="01:08:33.369" style="s2">of is there&#39;s something exciting about</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.349" end="01:08:35.829" style="s2">conversations to which very often</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.369" end="01:08:38.380" style="s2">happens when we talk um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.829" end="01:08:40.150" style="s2">something I have to credit you for which</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.380" end="01:08:41.889" style="s2">I don&#39;t I&#39;m not sure if you have gotten</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.150" end="01:08:45.839" style="s2">credit for it yet is that you have taken</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.889" end="01:08:49.079" style="s2">academics well and and have ecstatically</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.839" end="01:08:52.599" style="s2">taken them into some different way of</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.079" end="01:08:54.810" style="s2">conversing mmm right because it is I</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.599" end="01:08:57.639" style="s2">mean it is difficult to do this because</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.810" end="01:08:59.799" style="s2">but then again there&#39;s just so much</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.639" end="01:09:02.889" style="s2">content anyway so no one will probably</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.799" end="01:09:04.540" style="s2">say oh but here you say this right um</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.889" end="01:09:06.130" style="s2">because this is obviously on the go so</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.540" end="01:09:07.750" style="s2">there might be when I actually read what</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:09.280" style="s2">I said I might actually say I would have</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.750" end="01:09:11.290" style="s2">put the surf</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.280" end="01:09:14.490" style="s2">but it&#39;s that there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.290" end="01:09:18.070" style="s2">this very contrived way of giving talks</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.490" end="01:09:20.200" style="s2">or writing I was just actually reading</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.070" end="01:09:25.090" style="s2">today my book on on Heidegger and death</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.200" end="01:09:26.770" style="s2">and being oh this is so dull if I if I</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.090" end="01:09:28.480" style="s2">were to publish this independently I</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.770" end="01:09:33.490" style="s2">would have to completely rewrite this</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.480" end="01:09:36.460" style="s2">and so yeah but this it needs more of</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.490" end="01:09:39.400" style="s2">this exposes yeah or if the standing out</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.460" end="01:09:42.450" style="s2">and don&#39;t forget as you know so I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.400" end="01:09:44.620" style="s2">just mention this for listeners is that</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.450" end="01:09:46.210" style="s2">extensions for Heidegger isn&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.620" end="01:09:48.580" style="s2">isn&#39;t being on ecstasy and running</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.210" end="01:09:51.070" style="s2">around wild no it takes you out of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.580" end="01:09:52.840" style="s2">ordinary and you you know for Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.070" end="01:09:54.850" style="s2">would be the most ordinary thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.840" end="01:09:57.550" style="s2">with being to be in a nightclub and like</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.850" end="01:10:00.970" style="s2">bouncing away on on techno music and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.550" end="01:10:03.070" style="s2">just being just reduced to your body but</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.970" end="01:10:05.260" style="s2">now they&#39;re so ecstatic has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.070" end="01:10:08.440" style="s2">what with temporality it has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.260" end="01:10:10.660" style="s2">with time so for a sense of time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.440" end="01:10:14.620" style="s2">all of a sudden that&#39;s ecstatic in what</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.660" end="01:10:16.020" style="s2">sense in the sense that it takes first</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.620" end="01:10:18.610" style="s2">of all it takes you out of the linear</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.020" end="01:10:21.670" style="s2">understanding of time right do you so I</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.610" end="01:10:24.940" style="s2">this is now I&#39;m gonna do this tomorrow</p>

<p begin="01:18:14.860" end="01:18:19.960" style="s2">started noticing about every third</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.960" end="01:18:21.820" style="s2">sentence he would you know eat the</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.960" end="01:18:23.889" style="s2">sentence with on and up but it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:18:28.659" end="01:18:33.040" style="s2">and like the 45th time I started I</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.389" end="01:18:36.639" style="s2">started counting at some point like like</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.040" end="01:18:37.810" style="s2">at number 45 I paused him and I said</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.639" end="01:18:41.830" style="s2">pause one second</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.810" end="01:18:43.360" style="s2">and I said who are you talking to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.830" end="01:18:44.620" style="s2">like what do you mean who am I talking</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.360" end="01:18:46.480" style="s2">to I&#39;m talking to you</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.620" end="01:18:50.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like I don&#39;t think so because</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.480" end="01:18:53.599" style="s2">you&#39;ve reassured me that it&#39;s okay forty</p>
<p begin="01:18:50.350" end="01:18:57.559" style="s2">five times and I never</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.599" end="01:18:59.269" style="s2">I never assumed it wasn&#39;t okay and he</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.559" end="01:19:04.309" style="s2">was like so I&#39;m like who are you talking</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.269" end="01:19:06.889" style="s2">to and there was this moment this who</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.309" end="01:19:09.969" style="s2">was I talking to and what was really</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.889" end="01:19:13.519" style="s2">interesting is that was an example of of</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.969" end="01:19:17.949" style="s2">a moment where he he hadn&#39;t realized</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.519" end="01:19:22.550" style="s2">that he had been taking his origin right</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.949" end="01:19:25.939" style="s2">his history and basically projecting it</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.550" end="01:19:27.829" style="s2">out right and having it index and having</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.939" end="01:19:31.429" style="s2">his life come forward in a particular</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.829" end="01:19:33.340" style="s2">way in which he was reassuring like</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.429" end="01:19:35.869" style="s2">basically his mother and his father</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.340" end="01:19:37.909" style="s2">because when we unpack that thing he</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.869" end="01:19:41.659" style="s2">just didn&#39;t real it he had no idea that</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.909" end="01:19:43.969" style="s2">his mom was insane and his dad was this</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.659" end="01:19:45.800" style="s2">it was just this and that he was the one</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.969" end="01:19:46.280" style="s2">that was responsible to hold it all</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.800" end="01:19:50.059" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.280" end="01:19:53.059" style="s2">and he had no idea so but there is that</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.059" end="01:19:58.309" style="s2">sense of which those things which those</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.059" end="01:20:00.949" style="s2">that level of understanding is not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.309" end="01:20:03.829" style="s2">not a function of like like trying to</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.949" end="01:20:05.869" style="s2">figure out what&#39;s like beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.829" end="01:20:09.590" style="s2">horizon it&#39;s actually it&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.869" end="01:20:12.050" style="s2">concealed and its nearness right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.590" end="01:20:16.329" style="s2">where concealment is is in its nearness</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.050" end="01:20:16.329" style="s2">and I&#39;ve noticed that sense of</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.380" end="01:20:21.550" style="s2">there&#39;s a like that there&#39;s that other</p>

<p begin="01:22:45.699" end="01:22:51.699" style="s2">because there&#39;s a there&#39;s a genuine</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.360" end="01:22:54.790" style="s2">openness to being appalled by our times</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.699" end="01:22:55.540" style="s2">right that I think that you feel and so</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.790" end="01:22:57.969" style="s2">you go on</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.540" end="01:22:59.650" style="s2">so you still you get very animated but I</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.969" end="01:23:03.489" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually really telling</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.650" end="01:23:07.540" style="s2">about how on one level how personal this</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.489" end="01:23:10.150" style="s2">is for you right like in not in a sense</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.540" end="01:23:13.090" style="s2">of that it&#39;s about you but that that</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.150" end="01:23:16.420" style="s2">you&#39;re about this conversation</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.090" end="01:23:19.889" style="s2">that it&#39;s set to open yourself up into</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.420" end="01:23:23.500" style="s2">to an attune yourself to time</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.889" end="01:23:27.400" style="s2">temporalities philosophy is not is not</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.500" end="01:23:30.550" style="s2">in essence abstract it&#39;s very concrete</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.400" end="01:23:34.750" style="s2">and so your openness to be a like</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.550" end="01:23:36.310" style="s2">assaulted and appalled by thanks is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.750" end="01:23:41.230" style="s2">very it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.310" end="01:23:44.770" style="s2">I think realizes is is is very much the</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.230" end="01:23:47.590" style="s2">philosopher right it&#39;s very much the</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.770" end="01:23:49.360" style="s2">philosopher I think I mean it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.590" end="01:23:51.460" style="s2">get a polled when you walk around London</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.360" end="01:23:54.520" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.460" end="01:24:00.099" style="s2">no it&#39;s a beautiful city really much</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.520" end="01:24:04.530" style="s2">much if it is and there are you know to</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.099" end="01:24:08.560" style="s2">make this literary reference I&#39;m I take</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.530" end="01:24:11.320" style="s2">night walks just like Dickens did in</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.560" end="01:24:13.770" style="s2">Dickensian nights and you find that kids</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.320" end="01:24:19.510" style="s2">pockets off the city that are</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.770" end="01:24:23.260" style="s2">significantly beautiful and where you</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.510" end="01:24:27.489" style="s2">just see this the spirit of this island</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.260" end="01:24:31.599" style="s2">so I&#39;m not appalled all the time not at</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.489" end="01:24:33.639" style="s2">all there&#39;s just and I know that</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.599" end="01:24:36.070" style="s2">appalled by by human beings either</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.639" end="01:24:39.190" style="s2">really I what I think what is appalling</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.070" end="01:24:40.989" style="s2">though is when people don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.190" end="01:24:42.920" style="s2">responsibility and in this moment for</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.989" end="01:24:46.880" style="s2">example the</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.920" end="01:24:49.489" style="s2">the egoism you see with some is you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.880" end="01:24:51.860" style="s2">I but I have to do my meetings I have to</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.489" end="01:24:54.380" style="s2">go out I need to know know you right now</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.860" end="01:24:57.110" style="s2">you don&#39;t because right now you we need</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.380" end="01:24:59.960" style="s2">to make sure that we stop the spread of</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.110" end="01:25:03.050" style="s2">this virus that&#39;s one of the things we</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.960" end="01:25:05.000" style="s2">now have to we have to do this is not</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.050" end="01:25:07.400" style="s2">even speaking as a philosopher but</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.000" end="01:25:10.190" style="s2">there&#39;s something you I mean obviously</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.400" end="01:25:12.830" style="s2">there is something fundamentally weird</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.190" end="01:25:15.140" style="s2">about someone who becomes a genuine</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.830" end="01:25:19.640" style="s2">philosopher thinking you you you are</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.140" end="01:25:21.710" style="s2">always kind of seeing something that is</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.640" end="01:25:24.530" style="s2">already on the horizon and you say it if</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.710" end="01:25:26.540" style="s2">you say and you get custody for that you</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.530" end="01:25:29.030" style="s2">get kind of chased out the time but</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.540" end="01:25:31.790" style="s2">that&#39;s what it&#39;s always been like think</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.030" end="01:25:34.790" style="s2">of Socrates that&#39;s the best example yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.790" end="01:25:39.590" style="s2">but in Socrates you know you know how he</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.790" end="01:25:42.500" style="s2">dies or why he dies and Socrates of</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.590" end="01:25:48.949" style="s2">course walks around the Market Square</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.500" end="01:25:50.660" style="s2">and and and bothers people but also but</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.949" end="01:25:54.199" style="s2">he&#39;s also greatly loved I mean he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.660" end="01:26:00.530" style="s2">just he&#39;s not just he&#39;s not just he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.199" end="01:26:02.840" style="s2">adored by yeah i by the the children of</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.530" end="01:26:05.330" style="s2">the elite actually of the city which is</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.840" end="01:26:07.540" style="s2">why then the older he lead lashes out</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.330" end="01:26:11.239" style="s2">against him because they listen to him</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.540" end="01:26:12.860" style="s2">so but the philosophy is I think nobody</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.239" end="01:26:17.179" style="s2">was talking about me the philosopher is</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.860" end="01:26:20.750" style="s2">must be must be in the what we now call</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.179" end="01:26:25.640" style="s2">the public right um but one must also be</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.750" end="01:26:29.420" style="s2">very one must not become a sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.640" end="01:26:30.980" style="s2">puppet off of the of the public you need</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.420" end="01:26:33.770" style="s2">you need to have some distance you need</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.980" end="01:26:35.810" style="s2">to have some concealment and self</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.770" end="01:26:39.440" style="s2">concealment also and what&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.810" end="01:26:42.469" style="s2">important I think one video I recently</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.440" end="01:26:44.150" style="s2">put out is on the machine stops so one</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.469" end="01:26:46.190" style="s2">of the things that we&#39;re doing is kind</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.150" end="01:26:48.320" style="s2">of a bit like in this short story where</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.190" end="01:26:50.300" style="s2">we sit in front of avatars and talk</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.320" end="01:26:52.489" style="s2">about ideas right they get excited about</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.300" end="01:26:55.510" style="s2">ideas wow this is and I&#39;m thinking like</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.489" end="01:26:58.150" style="s2">are you really being transformed by this</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.510" end="01:27:00.159" style="s2">just nothing you say because something</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.150" end="01:27:01.719" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard you want to be feel or</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.159" end="01:27:04.300" style="s2">something this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t about</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.719" end="01:27:06.369" style="s2">your feels right this is about this</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.300" end="01:27:08.260" style="s2">isn&#39;t about feeling this is an actual</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.369" end="01:27:10.539" style="s2">transformation is earth-shattering and</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.260" end="01:27:12.849" style="s2">it is terrifying also or if that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.539" end="01:27:15.309" style="s2">set in or fine if that doesn&#39;t set in</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.849" end="01:27:17.320" style="s2">then it&#39;s not really happening and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.309" end="01:27:20.230" style="s2">it shouldn&#39;t happen or something but but</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.320" end="01:27:23.050" style="s2">so there&#39;s also a danger to confuse so</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.230" end="01:27:25.960" style="s2">if the public avatars of the people you</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.050" end="01:27:27.579" style="s2">see on YouTube with so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.960" end="01:27:30.909" style="s2">something by the way there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.579" end="01:27:33.579" style="s2">I&#39;m Kennie about this too when you then</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.909" end="01:27:35.530" style="s2">actually meet someone yeah we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.579" end="01:27:38.019" style="s2">met yet in person we fully won&#39;t at</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.530" end="01:27:42.280" style="s2">least not this year because you know the</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.019" end="01:27:44.110" style="s2">virus but yeah so I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.280" end="01:27:46.929" style="s2">philosophy is to some degree always</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.110" end="01:27:49.510" style="s2">displaced but at the same time much more</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.929" end="01:27:53.289" style="s2">in the heart of things than everybody</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.510" end="01:27:54.880" style="s2">else much more there where it&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.289" end="01:27:58.019" style="s2">it&#39;s at this is where the thinker is</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.880" end="01:28:00.369" style="s2">then tries to by the way you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.019" end="01:28:03.099" style="s2">there&#39;s this coming because this could</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.369" end="01:28:06.219" style="s2">be but right now I think there is a</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.099" end="01:28:11.260" style="s2">crack and and in this crack crack I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.219" end="01:28:14.230" style="s2">like to push and I have been given the</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.260" end="01:28:16.059" style="s2">talent to I&#39;m German obviously but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.230" end="01:28:22.119" style="s2">been given the talent to speak English</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.059" end="01:28:25.030" style="s2">on a level that I think is almost</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.119" end="01:28:27.880" style="s2">perhaps than you know native speaker and</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.030" end="01:28:30.969" style="s2">I can work with the language poetically</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.880" end="01:28:35.320" style="s2">to and which might come because I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.969" end="01:28:37.750" style="s2">musician also so I I write now I do see</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.320" end="01:28:46.690" style="s2">myself as one of the many voices who</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.750" end="01:28:49.630" style="s2">will try and and see this as a opening</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.690" end="01:28:52.869" style="s2">and opening to to allow for something</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.630" end="01:28:55.630" style="s2">else to arrive not that we make it but</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.869" end="01:28:58.230" style="s2">that is already brewing and that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.630" end="01:29:01.930" style="s2">know a world for humans that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.230" end="01:29:03.460" style="s2">what it is I think is</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.930" end="01:29:06.880" style="s2">supposed to come not the world for</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.460" end="01:29:09.790" style="s2">quantum selves and functionaries of</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.880" end="01:29:12.040" style="s2">technics no I want I&#39;d like to see a</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.790" end="01:29:13.750" style="s2">world for humans of odium come Dignitas</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.040" end="01:29:16.200" style="s2">see where we you know where professors</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.750" end="01:29:20.110" style="s2">of philosophy aren&#39;t I&#39;m kind of I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.200" end="01:29:21.730" style="s2">producing publish or perish right aren&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:29:21.730" end="01:29:28.030" style="s2">but know where they actually contemplate</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.980" end="01:29:30.010" style="s2">the meaning of being that&#39;s what why why</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.030" end="01:29:32.020" style="s2">half an academia if that&#39;s not what I</p>

<p begin="01:34:38.820" end="01:34:50.400" style="s2">was this book here it&#39;s it&#39;s a dialogue</p>
<p begin="01:34:45.150" end="01:34:56.100" style="s2">where Heidegger is talking to a student</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.400" end="01:35:02.270" style="s2">of one of this of of somebody who</p>

<p begin="01:35:28.349" end="01:35:37.820" style="s2">I think so I can I can edit this part</p>

<p begin="01:35:48.300" end="01:36:00.360" style="s2">if a dialogue leaves undefined what is</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.510" end="01:36:03.809" style="s2">really intended or even restores it back</p>
<p begin="01:36:00.360" end="01:36:07.219" style="s2">to the keeping of the undefinable and</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.809" end="01:36:11.159" style="s2">Heidegger responds yeah his part I</p>
<p begin="01:36:07.219" end="01:36:14.550" style="s2">believe of every dialogue that has</p>
<p begin="01:36:11.159" end="01:36:18.719" style="s2">turned out well between thinking beings</p>

<p begin="01:37:04.020" end="01:37:09.060" style="s2">the course of the dialogue and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:07.560" end="01:37:11.640" style="s2">quality of like when it&#39;s one of the</p>

<p begin="01:37:11.640" end="01:37:16.260" style="s2">you about is there is this quality where</p>
<p begin="01:37:14.310" end="01:37:19.170" style="s2">we haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t really defined</p>
<p begin="01:37:16.260" end="01:37:21.720" style="s2">anything like we haven&#39;t gotten clear on</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.170" end="01:37:23.580" style="s2">something or figured anything out but</p>
<p begin="01:37:21.720" end="01:37:27.510" style="s2">there is a sense of which what we</p>
<p begin="01:37:23.580" end="01:37:32.220" style="s2">haven&#39;t defined I feel is somehow gather</p>
<p begin="01:37:27.510" end="01:37:34.320" style="s2">its gathering in is gathering and me and</p>
<p begin="01:37:32.220" end="01:37:37.980" style="s2">you and between us right and hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.320" end="01:37:41.940" style="s2">in the listeners who watch this of this</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.980" end="01:37:43.620" style="s2">undefinable something yeah it slips away</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.940" end="01:37:46.739" style="s2">right and that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.620" end="01:37:50.370" style="s2">that&#39;s the midi taught co the meditation</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.739" end="01:37:56.280" style="s2">that&#39;s required is that being is always</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.370" end="01:37:58.800" style="s2">ready that which withdraws and and and</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.280" end="01:38:01.520" style="s2">then but when that&#39;s the stance you take</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.800" end="01:38:04.380" style="s2">this isn&#39;t Milan listen or some sort of</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.520" end="01:38:06.600" style="s2">crypto Buddhism know then all of a</p>
<p begin="01:38:04.380" end="01:38:10.470" style="s2">sudden the world lights up it&#39;s in it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:38:10.470" end="01:38:15.180" style="s2">beauty yes and that&#39;s what Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.900" end="01:38:16.770" style="s2">means with the augenblick right so this</p>
<p begin="01:38:15.180" end="01:38:18.300" style="s2">is why also I think when Heidegger says</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.770" end="01:38:20.730" style="s2">for example it this way of thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.300" end="01:38:24.780" style="s2">very difficult because you don&#39;t say oh</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.730" end="01:38:26.390" style="s2">so proposition one bomb okay so what is</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.780" end="01:38:28.380" style="s2">technology I defined ecology as</p>
