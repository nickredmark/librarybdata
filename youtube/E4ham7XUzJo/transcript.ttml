<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">missionary in the dominican republic</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.319" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">i for the most part have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:32.239" style="s2">done my job quietly in my little corner</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:35.519" style="s2">of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.239" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">and about three years ago i</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.519" end="00:02:38.879" style="s2">became acquainted with jordan peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:43.760" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.879" end="00:02:46.879" style="s2">and i was i was fascinated by his work</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.760" end="00:02:50.239" style="s2">and i was equally fascinated by</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.879" end="00:02:52.239" style="s2">the following that he was developing</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.239" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">and when he started the biblical series</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.239" end="00:02:55.519" style="s2">i thought this is something worth</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">jumping into</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.519" end="00:02:59.519" style="s2">but by that point he had about 300 000</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">subscribers and it was already</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.519" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">kind of a big thing to jump into so i</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">thought well i&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.080" style="s2">add my two bits to the conversation on</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.480" style="s2">youtube</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.080" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">and i hadn&#39;t really done much on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.480" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">but thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:12.879" style="s2">i&#39;ll play with it and probably find some</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:15.120" style="s2">conversation partners</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.879" end="00:03:17.120" style="s2">like many who were excited about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.120" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">work of jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.120" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">i was having difficulty finding other</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">people who were watching</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">dozens of hours of him then i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:27.519" style="s2">talk about it with someone so i thought</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">well if i do a youtube channel</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.519" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">i&#39;ll probably be able to talk with five</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">or 10 other people who are interested</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:34.799" style="s2">who somehow find my</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.560" style="s2">channel but i was unprepared for what</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.799" end="00:03:38.159" style="s2">would happen which was a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.560" end="00:03:40.400" style="s2">people found my channel</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.159" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">and i had way more conversation partners</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.400" end="00:03:46.480" style="s2">than i ever had before</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">and so i started making i started doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.480" end="00:03:51.040" style="s2">uh conversations with people i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:53.360" style="s2">talk with who were</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.040" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">talking about this and these were just</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.360" end="00:03:56.400" style="s2">random people who would</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.080" style="s2">contact me and want to have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.400" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">conversation so i started posting them</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.080" end="00:04:01.680" style="s2">on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:02.799" style="s2">because i found the conversations were</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.680" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">starting to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.400" style="s2">and then discovered that there was an</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:08.799" style="s2">appetite for those as well so</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.400" end="00:04:10.959" style="s2">i did some commentary videos what i</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.799" end="00:04:14.720" style="s2">pretty much today call monologue videos</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.959" end="00:04:16.639" style="s2">it&#39;s basically my processing</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.720" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">what john verviki calls the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.639" end="00:04:19.759" style="s2">crisis</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.120" style="s2">i just finished this afternoon a</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.759" end="00:04:23.600" style="s2">conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.120" end="00:04:24.320" style="s2">cal zeldin who was raised roman catholic</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.600" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">and just</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.320" end="00:04:27.360" style="s2">recently wrote a penetrating article</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:30.160" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.360" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">sense making he&#39;s been listening to idw</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.160" end="00:04:35.360" style="s2">characters</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:36.320" style="s2">and so i&#39;ve found this a good way to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.360" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">to process</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.320" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">what i think is the end of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">now modernity has been dying for</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">a hundred years already but these things</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.520" end="00:04:49.520" style="s2">die</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:50.080" style="s2">slowly and perhaps where i fit into this</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.520" end="00:04:53.280" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.080" end="00:04:55.440" style="s2">is uh jonathan pajot is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.280" end="00:04:56.400" style="s2">eastern orthodox icon carver i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.440" end="00:04:59.759" style="s2">protestant</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.400" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">and john vervicky is a non-theist and i</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.759" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">continue to believe that christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:05.759" style="s2">a viable option</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:07.039" style="s2">for people who are looking to escape</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.759" end="00:05:10.639" style="s2">from the meaning crisis</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.039" end="00:05:13.280" style="s2">and find sense-making yet</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.639" end="00:05:16.160" style="s2">i think the church has continued to</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.280" end="00:05:18.320" style="s2">change throughout its 2000 years</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.160" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">and will continue to do so the scary</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.320" end="00:05:23.600" style="s2">thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:25.759" style="s2">sometimes the church goes down dead ends</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.600" end="00:05:27.120" style="s2">and you never quite know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.759" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">pursuing a dead end</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.120" end="00:05:31.120" style="s2">until 50 or 100 or 200 years after</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:34.560" style="s2">you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.120" end="00:05:36.400" style="s2">so so i talk out loud on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.560" end="00:05:39.120" style="s2">and some people listen and talk back and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">that&#39;s what i do besides being a pastor</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.120" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">of a church</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:44.320" style="s2">very right uh and i said beforehand that</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.560" end="00:06:20.639" style="s2">change traditions but i have no plans on</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.440" end="00:06:24.000" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.639" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">i the protestant angle i i</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.000" end="00:06:28.800" style="s2">brought that up in my conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.360" end="00:06:31.520" style="s2">recently with with jonathan and john</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.800" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">i&#39;m not promoting protestant in it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.520" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">the protestant reformation i think in</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.280" end="00:06:37.440" style="s2">many ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:38.800" style="s2">is both at the root of the dawning of</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.440" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.800" end="00:06:42.160" style="s2">and unresolved issues in the protestant</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:46.479" style="s2">reformation</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.160" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">i think are driving some of the causes</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.479" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">of its demise and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.160" end="00:06:58.960" style="s2">everyone in this current crisis have</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.599" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">things that they need to work through</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.960" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">usually because of their own tradition</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:05.199" style="s2">if it&#39;s a very ancient</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:07.039" style="s2">tradition like the orthodox well there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.199" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">the roman catholics have a lot to work</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.039" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">through right now and</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:12.479" style="s2">protestants do as well in many ways the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:15.440" style="s2">different traditions work at different</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.479" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">speeds the orthodox a very slow speed</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.440" end="00:07:18.560" style="s2">very ancient</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">roman catholic a little bit faster</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.560" end="00:07:21.440" style="s2">they&#39;re a little bit newer protestants</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.479" style="s2">are like</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.440" end="00:07:26.160" style="s2">squirrels all over the place um stowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.479" end="00:07:30.880" style="s2">nuts and different trees and often</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.160" end="00:07:33.120" style="s2">forgetting where they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.880" end="00:07:34.000" style="s2">and so uh for the title of the today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.120" end="00:07:37.440" style="s2">talk was uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.000" end="00:07:40.800" style="s2">um being a christian in culture war</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.440" end="00:07:42.560" style="s2">2.0 um that&#39;s something i&#39;ve written</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.800" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">about peter precaution had a different</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.560" end="00:07:46.960" style="s2">take on it um</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious if you have like any</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.960" end="00:07:51.039" style="s2">general thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">and um yeah maybe just any general</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.039" end="00:07:53.199" style="s2">thoughts and i&#39;ll kind of have some</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:55.520" style="s2">follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.199" end="00:07:56.319" style="s2">i think culture wars are good places for</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.520" end="00:07:59.319" style="s2">christians</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.319" end="00:08:00.560" style="s2">and the reason i say that is because</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.319" end="00:08:02.720" style="s2">christianity&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.560" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">birth narrative happened in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.720" end="00:08:08.960" style="s2">a very fierce culture war</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:11.680" style="s2">uh the um the jewish people</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.960" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">are an amazing group of people who have</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.680" end="00:08:17.039" style="s2">resisted fiercely resisted assimilation</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:18.400" style="s2">and were doing so in the midst of heavy</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.039" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">pressure from rome and</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.400" end="00:08:22.080" style="s2">and hellenistic culture and into that</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:26.160" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.080" end="00:08:28.080" style="s2">war where just about everybody hated</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.160" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">each other</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.080" end="00:08:32.320" style="s2">they could all romans and anti-romans</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:34.640" style="s2">could agree</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.320" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">that the world was better without jesus</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.640" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">and so they killed him</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.399" style="s2">and in some ways the rise of jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:43.599" style="s2">peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.399" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">was directly a result of the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.599" end="00:08:47.440" style="s2">because jordan had been making the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.279" style="s2">kind of arguments for many years and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.440" end="00:08:51.680" style="s2">can find them on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.279" end="00:08:53.680" style="s2">but the man in the moment found each</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.680" end="00:08:57.360" style="s2">other with jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.680" end="00:08:59.920" style="s2">and i think jesus</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.360" end="00:09:00.880" style="s2">is well he&#39;s the master and he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.920" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.880" end="00:09:04.480" style="s2">because of how he lived in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:07.760" style="s2">a culture war</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.480" end="00:09:09.600" style="s2">the the the romans just didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.760" end="00:09:13.040" style="s2">understand him</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.600" end="00:09:14.800" style="s2">the the zealots were probably deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.040" end="00:09:16.800" style="s2">frustrated with him</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.800" end="00:09:20.000" style="s2">and the pharisees who should have been</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.800" end="00:09:21.920" style="s2">closest to him in that culture war</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.000" end="00:09:23.920" style="s2">eventually had a hand in putting him to</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.920" end="00:09:27.279" style="s2">death but after his</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.920" end="00:09:29.600" style="s2">uh death resurrection and ascension</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.279" end="00:09:30.320" style="s2">many of those pharisees became</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.600" end="00:09:34.240" style="s2">christians</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.320" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">of a sort so i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.240" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">even though christians will complain</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:40.080" style="s2">about culture wars because they&#39;re hard</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:41.360" style="s2">on us and they&#39;re tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.080" end="00:09:44.640" style="s2">uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.360" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">i think christianity is uniquely suited</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.640" end="00:09:50.160" style="s2">to a culture war environment because</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:52.160" style="s2">it does the one thing that culture war</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.160" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">can&#39;t make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.160" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">it loves its enemies and</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.279" end="00:09:59.839" style="s2">whenever you have a war that&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:02.560" style="s2">thing to go</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.839" end="00:10:03.360" style="s2">because both your allies and your</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.560" end="00:10:06.160" style="s2">enemies</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.360" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">will say uh this is the one rule that</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.160" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">must not be violated you must maintain</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.560" end="00:10:11.200" style="s2">your tribe</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:19.120" style="s2">and so how do you do that in the heat of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.720" end="00:10:20.640" style="s2">the culture war battle and maybe how do</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.120" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">you do that generally and how do you do</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.640" end="00:10:23.360" style="s2">that personally</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:26.480" style="s2">well jesus the the the heart of jesus</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.760" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">command is</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.480" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">love the lord your god with all your</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:32.399" style="s2">hearts all mind and strength and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.920" style="s2">love your neighbor as yourself now the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.399" end="00:10:35.519" style="s2">neighbor goes all the way up to and</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.920" end="00:10:38.959" style="s2">includes your enemies and</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.519" end="00:10:42.240" style="s2">in the sermon on the mount which</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.959" end="00:10:46.160" style="s2">is supposed to be jesus quintessential</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.240" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">uh distillation of his message people to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.160" end="00:10:49.519" style="s2">this day cannot agree on</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">what the theme of that message is but</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.519" end="00:10:52.000" style="s2">right in the middle of it jesus makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">the observation</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.000" end="00:10:58.079" style="s2">that god the father brings rain</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:58.880" style="s2">and sun upon the righteous and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.079" end="00:11:02.160" style="s2">unrighteous</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.880" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">and then jesus says be perfect do like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.160" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:07.839" style="s2">and so you if you if in the midst of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:10.959" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.839" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">you simply display weakness which means</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.959" end="00:11:14.240" style="s2">you&#39;re just you&#39;re just the embodiment</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:17.279" style="s2">of niceness and</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.240" end="00:11:17.920" style="s2">all shucks can&#39;t we all get along that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.279" end="00:11:21.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.920" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">really work it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.120" end="00:11:26.640" style="s2">loving someone you disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:28.560" style="s2">and sometimes someone you disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.640" end="00:11:30.399" style="s2">greatly now in this context we</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.560" end="00:11:32.480" style="s2">immediately think of some political</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.399" end="00:11:36.079" style="s2">rival in the culture war</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.480" end="00:11:38.399" style="s2">but for many of us the people that we</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.079" end="00:11:40.320" style="s2">uh love are also the people that</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.399" end="00:11:43.839" style="s2">potentially we might hate</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.320" end="00:11:46.000" style="s2">they might have been a a bad parent</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.839" end="00:11:46.880" style="s2">they might have been an unfaithful</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.000" end="00:11:49.839" style="s2">spouse</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.880" end="00:11:52.240" style="s2">they might be a rebellious child they</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.839" end="00:11:55.440" style="s2">might be a traitor to some</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.240" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">ideological tribe that you</p>

<p begin="00:13:43.360" end="00:13:47.360" style="s2">really for the first time for myself and</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.760" end="00:13:47.920" style="s2">i was immediately frustrated by all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.360" end="00:13:52.320" style="s2">stories</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:55.120" style="s2">about oh why are they why are they so</p>

<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:05.360" style="s2">well if you take a look at that culture</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.120" end="00:14:09.040" style="s2">war all of these were the kinds</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.360" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">of the kinds of symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.040" end="00:14:14.160" style="s2">virtue signals that one did to</p>

<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:20.079" style="s2">and you find jesus you know in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.519" end="00:14:23.440" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:24.959" style="s2">intentionally doing the impure thing you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.440" end="00:14:28.079" style="s2">read a story where he</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.959" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">he heals somebody on the sabbath and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.079" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">well you couldn&#39;t have seen the guy the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">day before or the day</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">after or you couldn&#39;t have done it</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:37.920" style="s2">quietly in a corner you had to do it</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:38.480" style="s2">right there in the synagogue with</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.920" end="00:14:40.720" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.480" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">watching just to tick them off and you</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.720" end="00:14:43.680" style="s2">know the one story where the friends of</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">a paralytic drop</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.680" end="00:14:48.240" style="s2">him down into the middle of a a a crowd</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">in a home</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.240" end="00:14:51.519" style="s2">and he says your sins are forgiven he</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:53.199" style="s2">could have said</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.519" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">take up your mat and walk and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.199" end="00:14:56.720" style="s2">would have said well that&#39;s the script</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">he immediately goes for the sins and</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.720" end="00:15:01.920" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:05.360" style="s2">he he he knows exactly how to poke them</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.920" end="00:15:08.639" style="s2">but he doesn&#39;t do it in a culture war</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.360" end="00:15:11.519" style="s2">way and he</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.639" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">he is an enigma to everyone including</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.519" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">his disciples</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">but yet for two thousand years we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">seem to look away</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">so if you want to know how to live in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">culture war look at jesus</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">the only caution i&#39;ll give you is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">if you do what he did you&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">get what he got</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:35.519" style="s2">which is dead so</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">if you don&#39;t believe in the second part</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.519" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">of the story which is resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">the first part might not make a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:42.560" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.440" end="00:15:47.199" style="s2">getting hung on the cross is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.040" end="00:15:50.800" style="s2">ultimate christian practice</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.199" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">um so i have a few more questions but we</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.720" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">of the enemy by right-wing evangelicals</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.880" end="00:16:38.160" style="s2">and the politically conservative</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:41.839" style="s2">christian</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.160" end="00:16:43.440" style="s2">nationalists i know i&#39;m throwing a lot</p>

<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:56.480" style="s2">do i explain that</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">uh christians aren&#39;t always very good</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.480" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">at being christian and</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:04.559" style="s2">they&#39;re just not that&#39;s been the story</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">right from the start</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.559" end="00:17:12.559" style="s2">you know one-sixth of his disciples</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">betray him only one of those two was</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.559" end="00:17:16.559" style="s2">restored</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">and when if you cl if you read the new</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.559" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">testament closely</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">you know there is a fierce debate about</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:26.240" style="s2">what it meant to be a christian</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">and if you look at you know you look at</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.240" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">the story of the apostle paul</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:32.400" style="s2">you look at stephen you know if you if</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.760" style="s2">you thought that the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.400" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">the the adversity against</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.760" end="00:17:39.919" style="s2">christians were bad well amongst</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:42.880" style="s2">christians it was terrible too</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.919" end="00:17:45.120" style="s2">uh we i&#39;m a protestant and so i believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.880" end="00:17:47.280" style="s2">that christians are saved by grace</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.120" end="00:17:49.200" style="s2">now i know that is often read as somehow</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.280" end="00:17:52.400" style="s2">a dodge</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.200" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">but i being a christian</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:59.440" style="s2">know that i&#39;m often bad at it</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:18:00.720" style="s2">and so i&#39;m i&#39;m thankful for a doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.440" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">that says</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.720" end="00:18:04.000" style="s2">that my lord is patient with me and</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:07.280" style="s2">whatever i</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.000" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">do whatever good i do in his name on</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.280" end="00:18:12.000" style="s2">his behalf is done out of gratitude so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:16.080" style="s2">and and i think not to not to pick on</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:18.960" style="s2">people let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.080" end="00:18:19.760" style="s2">to the to the right of me politically</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.960" end="00:18:21.440" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.760" end="00:18:23.520" style="s2">you know what we&#39;ve seen over the last</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.440" end="00:18:25.440" style="s2">few years is those on the left um</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.520" end="00:18:28.720" style="s2">know how to treat their outgroup poorly</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.440" end="00:18:32.880" style="s2">too so i think that&#39;s a human thing</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">and ideally uh following jesus will</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.880" end="00:18:42.559" style="s2">an increasing measure lead us to extend</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:47.440" style="s2">grace to an ungracious world</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.559" end="00:18:50.480" style="s2">cool uh dan feldman you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.440" end="00:18:53.600" style="s2">yes i had a question um doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.480" end="00:18:56.000" style="s2">the dualism inherent to</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.600" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">patriarchal monotheistic religions such</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.000" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">as christianity</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.679" style="s2">fuel the meaning crisis itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">if you accept the terms patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.880" style="s2">depending on how you define it</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.960" end="00:19:18.400" style="s2">i would argue that at least the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.880" end="00:19:20.400" style="s2">crisis as</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.400" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">presented by let&#39;s say john verveiki and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.400" end="00:19:25.440" style="s2">even if we take it</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">as far back as we can let&#39;s say to the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.440" end="00:19:30.320" style="s2">11th century</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">uh christianity was still around 1100</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.320" end="00:19:34.400" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:36.960" style="s2">before then i think a lot of the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.400" end="00:19:42.240" style="s2">crisis that we&#39;re dealing with now</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.960" end="00:19:45.440" style="s2">is a product of of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.240" end="00:19:49.360" style="s2">and a product of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.440" end="00:19:52.799" style="s2">a lot of systems that suggest</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.360" end="00:19:53.679" style="s2">that i have hours and hours of video on</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.799" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.679" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">um that suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:04.880" style="s2">we are not what we think we are whether</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">that is in a psychological frame that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.880" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">there are things underneath us that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">pulling the strings that</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:12.000" style="s2">our conscious self and this manifest</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">image are unaware of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.000" end="00:20:17.200" style="s2">or if we look at that in an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">biological frame</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.200" end="00:20:21.039" style="s2">where i think i&#39;m acting this way but it</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">is all the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.039" end="00:20:25.280" style="s2">tribalism of my ape ancestors that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.280" end="00:20:29.200" style="s2">manifesting itself out in these other</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.799" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.200" end="00:20:36.000" style="s2">so i wouldn&#39;t i wouldn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.799" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">you can place the meaning crisis as</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.000" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">we&#39;ve been talking about at least in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.480" style="s2">verveiki channels</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">on the to the feet of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.480" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">unless</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">you also place that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">unless you also place the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:53.880" style="s2">revolution at its feet</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">and i would also argue that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.880" end="00:21:00.840" style="s2">deconstruction</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:21:03.919" style="s2">of the patriarchy and almost all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.840" end="00:21:07.039" style="s2">progressive ideas that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.919" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">in the last few hundred years also find</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.039" end="00:21:13.440" style="s2">their genesis and christianity</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:15.360" style="s2">because in much of human history</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.440" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">out groups were simply enslaved and</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.360" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">killed</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">why does the victim</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">of the victim of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">societal oppression gain status in our</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:31.919" style="s2">narratives</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.880" end="00:21:33.679" style="s2">and i would think that nietzsche spoke</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.919" end="00:21:36.640" style="s2">presciently about it by saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.679" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">well it&#39;s that christianity that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.640" end="00:21:41.200" style="s2">made everyone equal</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">and you have this jesus that dies for</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.200" end="00:21:46.799" style="s2">people who think wrong</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:49.760" style="s2">so that would be my answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.799" end="00:21:50.240" style="s2">can i ask a follow-up to that question</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.760" end="00:21:53.520" style="s2">peter</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.240" end="00:21:56.880" style="s2">just one thing okay just one it i</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.520" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">i think the issue is is</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.880" end="00:22:00.000" style="s2">i think you focused on the patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:03.120" style="s2">part of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.000" end="00:22:04.000" style="s2">of my uh comment and for me the more</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.120" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">prescient</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.000" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">uh uh word there is dualism</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:14.640" style="s2">and i from my perspective is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">having some having a god be somehow</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.640" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">separate</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:20.240" style="s2">or and also from my understanding i i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:23.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.240" end="00:22:24.840" style="s2">a christian or</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.360" end="00:22:27.280" style="s2">anything for that matter i&#39;m probably a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:30.640" style="s2">non-theist uh perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.280" end="00:22:33.760" style="s2">um that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.640" end="00:22:35.120" style="s2">the the disconnection from nature that i</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.760" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">think is inherent in</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.120" end="00:22:38.559" style="s2">in christianity is is kind of the that</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:41.760" style="s2">core</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.559" end="00:22:44.720" style="s2">of that of that dualistic uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.760" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">division that&#39;s a that&#39;s a great that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.720" end="00:22:50.720" style="s2">a great point and a great question</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:54.720" style="s2">if you listen to brett weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.720" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">uh david sloane wilson</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.720" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">i think they make the compelling</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:01.919" style="s2">argument that</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:05.840" style="s2">human beings are not simply</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.919" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">biological creatures but fairly early on</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.840" end="00:23:13.440" style="s2">a culture strain developed in us</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:14.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s simply you simply can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.440" end="00:23:17.760" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.240" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">a human being without those two tracks</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.760" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">both let&#39;s say the material genetic</p>

<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">and the culture track i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.799" end="00:23:28.240" style="s2">humanity is going to get away from</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:31.360" style="s2">dualisms</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.240" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">because of our two-track nature because</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:36.240" style="s2">is so has become so deeply embedded and</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.000" end="00:24:02.640" style="s2">divorced from it but i don&#39;t think what</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.520" end="00:24:05.279" style="s2">you would arrive at</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.640" end="00:24:06.480" style="s2">is what we would call a human being and</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.279" end="00:24:09.919" style="s2">i think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.480" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">that culture track is by virtue</p>

<p begin="00:24:43.039" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">yeah and i don&#39;t want to yeah i guess my</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.679" end="00:24:49.840" style="s2">point is that like for example with</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">taoism for example there&#39;s the yin yang</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.840" end="00:24:56.480" style="s2">there the taoists can clearly saw poles</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">but they spoke of them as in dynamic a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.480" end="00:25:01.120" style="s2">mutual dependency</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:25:03.039" style="s2">between them and i think that in much of</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.120" end="00:25:04.880" style="s2">western civilization</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.039" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">and i think christianity played a big</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.880" end="00:25:09.520" style="s2">role in this</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:11.919" style="s2">um that the mutual dependence was not</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.520" end="00:25:14.799" style="s2">emphasized</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.919" end="00:25:16.000" style="s2">that that&#39;s uh i&#39;ll kind of i agree that</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.799" end="00:25:17.679" style="s2">there&#39;s always going to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.000" end="00:25:19.120" style="s2">an up and a down and this sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.679" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">just like the taoists do but they</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.120" end="00:25:24.080" style="s2">emphasize this dynamic balance</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">and interplay between the two that can</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.080" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">never be escaped</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.440" end="00:25:28.799" style="s2">and i think in western culture we tend</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.919" style="s2">to you know with</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.799" end="00:25:35.279" style="s2">descartes we we decapitate uh</p>

<p begin="00:25:35.279" end="00:25:38.960" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s something that makes</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:41.840" style="s2">us a bit different</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.960" end="00:25:43.200" style="s2">uh in that sense and and what you&#39;re i</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">think what you&#39;re pointing to</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.200" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">is a lot of the conversation that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">been having with john vervicky and</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:53.200" style="s2">jonathan pajot</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:54.159" style="s2">because and i actually think so one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.200" end="00:25:57.919" style="s2">the things that i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.159" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">i&#39;ve after watching jordan peterson and</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.919" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">sam adams debate i think part of what</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">to the implicit definition of god</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">was that god got bifurcated and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:13.440" style="s2">our assumptions about christianity have</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:15.600" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.440" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">and i think again the protestant um</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.600" end="00:26:19.919" style="s2">reformation has a lot to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">do with this because with the move away</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.919" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">sacraments with luther</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:29.440" style="s2">faith became a very psychological thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:32.720" style="s2">and god became a very other thing</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.440" end="00:26:33.520" style="s2">whereas if you say look at the angels</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.720" end="00:26:36.720" style="s2">cry</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.520" end="00:26:38.320" style="s2">in isaiah 6 holy holy holy is the lord</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.720" end="00:26:40.480" style="s2">god almighty that&#39;s you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.320" end="00:26:43.120" style="s2">about as that&#39;s as high as you can go</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.480" end="00:26:43.840" style="s2">the whole earth is full of his glory and</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.120" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">so i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.840" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">part of what we see in the hebrew</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:51.279" style="s2">scriptures is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">ironically christianity develops</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.279" end="00:26:54.400" style="s2">as many have said somewhere between</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:58.240" style="s2">jerus jerusalem</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.400" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">and athens but the jerusalem side</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.240" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">is the side that says of earth this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:06.159" style="s2">our home</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:09.440" style="s2">and so these issues these issues</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">have been debated broadly</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.440" end="00:27:12.480" style="s2">throughout christianity for a very long</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.480" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">and you can still find them today i</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">think in fact</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">many conservative christians in the west</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">are functional gnostics</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:25.039" style="s2">when you hear them say things like well</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">to be a christian means</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.039" end="00:27:30.960" style="s2">going to heaven when you die well</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">christians in terms of the idea about</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.960" end="00:27:34.799" style="s2">the intermediate state do believe</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:38.720" style="s2">they&#39;ll be with the lord when they die</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.799" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">but in christianity our final status</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.720" end="00:27:45.760" style="s2">is resurrected as bodily resurrection</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:47.760" style="s2">so it&#39;s also ironic that with</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.760" end="00:27:49.440" style="s2">a modern skepticism about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.760" end="00:27:50.960" style="s2">resurrection of the body</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.440" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">i think that sort of distorts</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.960" end="00:27:56.559" style="s2">christianity away</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:28:00.480" style="s2">from the cry in genesis 1</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.559" end="00:28:01.679" style="s2">of god saying of our embodied creation</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.480" end="00:28:04.640" style="s2">in the flesh</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.679" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">it is good it is very good so but you</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.640" end="00:28:07.360" style="s2">make a great point</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.440" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">i withdraw all right thank you very much</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.760" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">um limited to two follow-ups uh for this</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">session</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:20.080" style="s2">uh okay we got laura laura&#39;s next</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.600" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">hi uh let&#39;s see if i can pull up my</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.720" end="00:28:30.080" style="s2">question again</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:32.480" style="s2">um so um in loving your enemies how do</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.080" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">you balance holding firm to your beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.480" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">and remaining open to the possibility</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">that your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:39.840" style="s2">might have a truth to offer you and how</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:42.399" style="s2">does a christian move past a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.840" end="00:28:45.279" style="s2">righteousness of belief when necessary</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.399" end="00:28:48.480" style="s2">it seems like many tribes in the culture</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.279" end="00:28:50.720" style="s2">wars seem to struggle with this</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.480" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">i think it&#39;s i think there&#39;s a reason we</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.720" end="00:28:53.039" style="s2">all struggle with it because it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.720" style="s2">hard</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.039" end="00:28:58.240" style="s2">i first of all i think with jesus we see</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.720" end="00:29:00.640" style="s2">he manages to do this</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.240" end="00:29:01.679" style="s2">but one of the amazing things that we</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.640" end="00:29:04.000" style="s2">see about</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.679" end="00:29:05.760" style="s2">jesus and you can you can see it in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.000" end="00:29:09.440" style="s2">old testament as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.760" end="00:29:11.679" style="s2">in genesis 18 where</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.440" end="00:29:13.600" style="s2">jesus seems open to the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.679" end="00:29:15.279" style="s2">others and you would say well if the son</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.600" end="00:29:17.120" style="s2">of god incarnate comes down</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.279" end="00:29:19.360" style="s2">surely he should be talking all the time</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.120" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">and he wouldn&#39;t need ears</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.360" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">but that&#39;s clearly not the portrait we</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:26.640" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">with jesus so</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.640" end="00:29:33.520" style="s2">i think it takes the development</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:36.720" style="s2">of wisdom and this is one of the real</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.520" end="00:29:38.559" style="s2">contributions i see john verveigh making</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:41.679" style="s2">to the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.559" end="00:29:43.200" style="s2">in and and and peter with the stow as</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.679" end="00:29:45.520" style="s2">well because i&#39;ve heard these themes</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.200" end="00:29:48.720" style="s2">coming out of this conversation as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.520" end="00:29:51.039" style="s2">that we must cultivate wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.720" end="00:29:52.080" style="s2">and christians don&#39;t have a corner on</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.039" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.080" end="00:29:56.399" style="s2">if you read the book of proverbs</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:58.799" style="s2">carefully in the writings in the old</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.399" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">testament you&#39;ll notice that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.799" end="00:30:03.120" style="s2">many of the proverbs come from</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">non-hebrew sources</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.120" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">the book of job which may very well be</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">the oldest book</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:12.159" style="s2">in the bible many people believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:13.679" style="s2">many scholars believe that the book of</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.159" end="00:30:15.840" style="s2">job as we currently have it is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.679" end="00:30:17.600" style="s2">adaptation of other wisdom literature</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.840" end="00:30:20.720" style="s2">prior to that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.600" end="00:30:23.919" style="s2">even the stories such as genesis 1</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.720" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">and 2 i think are are</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.919" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">in conversation with egyptian and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:31.520" style="s2">babylonian</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">creation stories as well so if the bible</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.520" end="00:30:35.039" style="s2">can listen to others and if jesus can</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:38.799" style="s2">listen to others</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.039" end="00:30:41.600" style="s2">and if god the father stands before</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.799" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">abraham which is the older of the two</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.600" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">you know very pious people said no</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:48.960" style="s2">abraham will stand before god</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:52.640" style="s2">but if god can stand before abraham and</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.960" end="00:30:56.080" style="s2">abraham can plead the cause for sodom</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.640" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">and god will listen and negotiate with</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.080" end="00:31:00.000" style="s2">him</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:31:01.120" style="s2">well it should we shouldn&#39;t be so full</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.000" end="00:31:04.080" style="s2">of ourselves to as</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.120" end="00:31:05.120" style="s2">to be above god so no christians have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.080" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">hard time with this</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">because human beings have a hard time</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:13.200" style="s2">with this because especially</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:14.559" style="s2">when we get angry and culture wars tend</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.200" end="00:31:17.840" style="s2">to do that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.559" end="00:31:18.880" style="s2">that anger fills us with a feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.840" end="00:31:20.480" style="s2">righteousness</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.880" end="00:31:24.159" style="s2">and then we tend to do most of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.480" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">damage so it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.159" end="00:31:27.600" style="s2">any uh follow-up laura</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.880" end="00:31:34.880" style="s2">you&#39;re a mute no that was great thank</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.679" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.880" end="00:31:39.519" style="s2">awesome uh aaron you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:44.320" style="s2">hey paul uh great great to talk to you</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.559" end="00:31:45.279" style="s2">i&#39;m friends with mark hoffman down in</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.320" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">alameda and we were</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.279" end="00:31:48.720" style="s2">all wonderful we&#39;re looking forward to</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:49.039" style="s2">having you back in march i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.720" end="00:31:50.799" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.039" end="00:31:52.480" style="s2">it&#39;s great to finally have a chance to</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.799" end="00:31:54.799" style="s2">ask you a question um</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.480" end="00:31:56.320" style="s2">i think of platforms like the stoa as</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.799" end="00:31:58.000" style="s2">being a kind of church</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.320" end="00:31:59.279" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a weird decentralized place</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.000" end="00:32:00.320" style="s2">where people meet up to sort of build</p>

<p begin="00:32:00.320" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">engage in rituals and sense making and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.519" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">uh you&#39;re engaging in this too with your</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:10.559" style="s2">online platform on youtube</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">do you see christianity as moving more</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.559" end="00:32:14.559" style="s2">into this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:17.600" style="s2">strange online decentralized space</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.559" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">having kind of online churches uh where</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.600" end="00:32:21.200" style="s2">people come together from all over into</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:23.440" style="s2">little clusters like we&#39;re in right now</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.200" end="00:32:24.880" style="s2">and do you see yourself as kind of being</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.440" end="00:32:26.480" style="s2">a pastor</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.880" end="00:32:28.000" style="s2">in this world right now do you have like</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.480" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">an online church do you think of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.000" end="00:32:32.159" style="s2">platform as being</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:34.880" style="s2">sort of an online christian church</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.159" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">i&#39;ve recently started two new efforts in</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.880" end="00:32:37.919" style="s2">my channel and i&#39;m calling them living</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">stones online</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.919" end="00:32:41.440" style="s2">because so many people can&#39;t go to</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">church physically and so we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.440" end="00:32:45.679" style="s2">try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:47.600" style="s2">do what we can to continue our community</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.679" end="00:32:48.559" style="s2">online but the second effort i call</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">estuary</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.559" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">which i think when i listen to peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:55.120" style="s2">introduction to the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:56.640" style="s2">uh this is a very estuary-like space and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.120" end="00:33:00.320" style="s2">what i mean by estuary</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.640" end="00:33:01.919" style="s2">is that um if you have a walled garden</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.320" end="00:33:04.960" style="s2">which in some sense the church</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.919" end="00:33:07.279" style="s2">is and it rains in your walled garden if</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.960" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">you don&#39;t uh bless the rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.279" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">with your water</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:12.880" style="s2">no um you&#39;re going to establish a</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.279" style="s2">reservoir</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.880" end="00:33:16.080" style="s2">and so sacramento is right at the edge</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.279" end="00:33:18.559" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.080" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">the great california delta and you&#39;re at</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.559" end="00:33:23.919" style="s2">the other end of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:26.000" style="s2">and so i think christianity has always</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.919" end="00:33:29.919" style="s2">been in this space</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.000" end="00:33:33.360" style="s2">it just hasn&#39;t done it well all the time</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.919" end="00:33:36.000" style="s2">in in the in the book of acts</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.360" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">in ephesus paul rented a hall the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.000" end="00:33:40.480" style="s2">apostle paul rented a call</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:43.600" style="s2">hall called the hall of tyrannus and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.480" end="00:33:46.880" style="s2">the book of acts describes him as</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.600" end="00:33:49.279" style="s2">regularly meeting there and discussing</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.880" end="00:33:50.240" style="s2">the philosophies and the ideas of his</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.279" end="00:33:53.519" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.240" end="00:33:56.080" style="s2">he also did this on mars hill in athens</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.519" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">um i think medieval monasteries did a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.080" end="00:34:01.360" style="s2">similar thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:04.720" style="s2">by you know why do we have</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.360" end="00:34:08.159" style="s2">the the monastic movement preserved the</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.720" end="00:34:10.240" style="s2">pagan writings of the ancient world</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.159" end="00:34:11.440" style="s2">why would monasteries do such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.240" end="00:34:14.240" style="s2">why didn&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.440" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">not only not burn the books but copy</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.240" end="00:34:17.280" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:19.119" style="s2">you know so the church has the church</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.280" end="00:34:21.040" style="s2">has done this i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.119" end="00:34:23.119" style="s2">throughout its time but the church</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.040" end="00:34:25.839" style="s2">always has two things to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.119" end="00:34:27.520" style="s2">and in my tradition we call them common</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.839" end="00:34:29.520" style="s2">grace on one hand which says</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.520" end="00:34:30.720" style="s2">god speaks through creation and he</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.520" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">speaks through others</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.720" end="00:34:34.879" style="s2">but also you know special revelation and</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">so the church has to</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.879" end="00:34:38.320" style="s2">somehow maintain both the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">of an</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.320" end="00:34:41.679" style="s2">of an antithesis but also the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:46.240" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.679" end="00:34:49.200" style="s2">of common grace so i&#39;m hoping that</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.240" end="00:34:49.919" style="s2">my whatever efforts i can contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.200" end="00:34:53.119" style="s2">creating an</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.919" end="00:34:56.639" style="s2">estuary-like space will</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.119" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">con i think it makes churches better</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.639" end="00:35:02.880" style="s2">to to talk and to listen</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:05.200" style="s2">we the old as the old adage says we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.880" end="00:35:07.440" style="s2">given one mouth and two ears</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.200" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">and churches sometimes major on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.440" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">mouth</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:12.000" style="s2">uh and forget they have ears</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.280" end="00:35:21.359" style="s2">thank you andrew you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.599" end="00:35:24.560" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;ve copied and pasted it uh for you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.359" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">if you can admit yourself yeah g&#39;day</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.560" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">paul</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">and peter how you going um yeah my my</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.680" style="s2">question was really just</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:33.359" style="s2">your thoughts on the shift if you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.680" end="00:35:35.599" style="s2">there has been one in the new atheism in</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.359" end="00:35:37.280" style="s2">the last decade or so this is a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.599" end="00:35:39.040" style="s2">smaller focus question than the ones</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.280" end="00:35:41.280" style="s2">we&#39;ve had but um</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.040" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">somebody like a sam harris and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.280" end="00:35:44.000" style="s2">know peterborough and people like that</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:47.119" style="s2">you mentioned from time to</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.000" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">time on your channel um if i think back</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.119" end="00:35:52.960" style="s2">10 years they probably were</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:53.839" style="s2">more of an opponent someone to contend</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.960" end="00:35:57.040" style="s2">with but</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.839" end="00:35:59.680" style="s2">um in recent times um</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.040" end="00:36:00.240" style="s2">they&#39;ve sort of been on the same side i</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.680" end="00:36:02.560" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.240" end="00:36:03.920" style="s2">um so i&#39;m just wondering what your</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.560" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">thoughts on you know what happened there</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.920" end="00:36:08.000" style="s2">you know what what what took place</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:10.160" style="s2">and uh just interested in what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.000" end="00:36:12.480" style="s2">got to say there</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.160" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">a very astute listener of my channel</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.480" end="00:36:17.440" style="s2">that i&#39;ve had a number of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:20.880" style="s2">with he&#39;s a cardiologist up in idaho</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.440" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">uh noted to me that you begin to hear</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.880" end="00:36:25.599" style="s2">from people often when</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">their assumed power in society is</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.599" end="00:36:28.079" style="s2">slipping</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:29.920" style="s2">and we&#39;ve seen that from christians for</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.079" end="00:36:32.800" style="s2">a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.920" end="00:36:34.480" style="s2">all throughout modernity but his</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.800" end="00:36:38.079" style="s2">observation was that</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.480" end="00:36:40.000" style="s2">in some ways new atheism reached its</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.079" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">peak as they began to feel the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.000" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">pinch of modernity receding</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">the irony of that recession is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">new atheists are increasingly finding</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:54.640" style="s2">allied with christians who are making</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">assertions</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.640" end="00:37:00.000" style="s2">about some fixed aspects such as human</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:03.520" style="s2">nature</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.000" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">i think new atheists in some ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.520" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">have a more difficult time because</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:14.320" style="s2">this losing this type of losing feels</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:16.480" style="s2">new to them i mean for for many years</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.320" end="00:37:18.480" style="s2">sam harris would go on stage and he</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.480" end="00:37:19.680" style="s2">developed quite a following because as</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.480" end="00:37:22.720" style="s2">some of the people who listened to me</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.680" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">have said every time sam harris would</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.720" end="00:37:27.760" style="s2">sort of mock and expose christians</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:29.440" style="s2">you know christians didn&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.760" end="00:37:32.000" style="s2">answer well</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.440" end="00:37:33.599" style="s2">i had a conversation with james lindsey</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.000" end="00:37:37.359" style="s2">on my channel</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.599" end="00:37:40.160" style="s2">a year or so ago and i wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.359" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">really aware of sort of the split of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.160" end="00:37:44.400" style="s2">church of atheism</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:45.280" style="s2">between i would say classical liberal</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.400" end="00:37:48.320" style="s2">atheism</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.280" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">and atheism plus and so that has</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.320" end="00:37:51.599" style="s2">happened</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:52.480" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s produced some surprising</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.599" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.480" end="00:37:59.280" style="s2">one day on twitter i saw peter bogosian</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">um tweet recommend</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.280" end="00:38:05.520" style="s2">my podcast to his following and</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:07.680" style="s2">i thought this is a strange turn of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.520" end="00:38:08.560" style="s2">events where a man who writes a manual</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.680" end="00:38:12.160" style="s2">for creating</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.560" end="00:38:14.960" style="s2">atheists starts recommending my podcast</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.160" end="00:38:16.480" style="s2">either i&#39;ve somehow lost my way as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.960" end="00:38:19.760" style="s2">christian minister</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.480" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">or the world is changing and so</p>

<p begin="00:39:43.680" end="00:39:46.720" style="s2">i i think it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:40:06.319" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">the people of god have not always lived</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.240" end="00:40:12.720" style="s2">that way</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.000" end="00:40:14.000" style="s2">but it is i think anthropology has borne</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.720" end="00:40:17.200" style="s2">this out</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.000" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">i was reading um i was reading a book</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.200" end="00:40:21.920" style="s2">about the navajo</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:23.359" style="s2">noting how navajo language just like</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.920" end="00:40:24.000" style="s2">just about every other language of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.359" end="00:40:27.839" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.000" end="00:40:30.960" style="s2">they had two categories the people and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.839" end="00:40:32.000" style="s2">everyone else jew and gentile citizen</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.960" end="00:40:35.359" style="s2">and barbarian</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.000" end="00:40:38.079" style="s2">this is completely common to humanity</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.359" end="00:40:38.720" style="s2">and now suddenly and you can you can see</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.079" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">it in</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.720" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">jesus and you see the apostle paul</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:46.960" style="s2">bringing it out completely that here</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">you have a god over all the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.440" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">all the peoples of the earth</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:55.280" style="s2">belong to him not just a particular</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">ethnic group</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.280" end="00:40:59.920" style="s2">so yeah i think human rights is directly</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:02.960" style="s2">downstream from christianity</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.920" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">i think because of how secularity</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.960" end="00:41:10.240" style="s2">unfolded there was a need</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:13.359" style="s2">to to place it in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.240" end="00:41:16.560" style="s2">um imagined religion free zone</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.359" end="00:41:18.640" style="s2">but i think those distinctions and</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.560" end="00:41:20.319" style="s2">definitions are also breaking down as</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.640" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">modernity recedes so</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.319" end="00:41:23.280" style="s2">yeah i agree</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:31.359" style="s2">um so i think this is</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:32.480" style="s2">manus uh i copied and pasted your</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.359" end="00:41:34.480" style="s2">question in the chat if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.480" end="00:41:37.599" style="s2">meet yourself</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.480" end="00:41:39.839" style="s2">yeah um paul what is the most prevalent</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.599" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">criticism against christianity in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.839" end="00:41:42.880" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">from your understanding and what is your</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.880" end="00:41:45.920" style="s2">response to it in light of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">having a</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.920" end="00:41:50.560" style="s2">you know legitimacy in helping to</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">alleviate the cultural war</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.560" end="00:41:54.640" style="s2">i i think the dominant modernist</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.800" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">strongest dominant modernist argument</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.240" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">against christianity has been the</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:04.720" style="s2">problem with suffering</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.760" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">after and and this the formulation of</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.119" end="00:42:13.839" style="s2">the problem of suffering</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:16.560" style="s2">or the problem of evil arose</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.839" end="00:42:17.440" style="s2">interestingly enough after the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.560" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">destruction</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.440" end="00:42:21.119" style="s2">of lisbon because that sort of that was</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:22.079" style="s2">right at the beginning of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.119" end="00:42:25.200" style="s2">period it really</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.079" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">shook the world before that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.200" end="00:42:28.000" style="s2">calamities happened you can read it in</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:30.000" style="s2">the book of job there&#39;s an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.000" end="00:42:33.680" style="s2">version of the problem of evil</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.000" end="00:42:34.640" style="s2">but after human beings began to have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.680" end="00:42:38.240" style="s2">vision</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.640" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">of our capacity</p>

<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:48.640" style="s2">than nature did</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.520" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">once we had the kind of technology that</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.640" end="00:42:52.720" style="s2">began to have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:56.880" style="s2">impact on plague on</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.720" end="00:43:00.160" style="s2">famine human beings began to say</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.880" end="00:43:03.040" style="s2">hey if we can run the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.160" end="00:43:04.400" style="s2">minimizing plague and famine war we</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.040" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">struggle with</p>

<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:13.119" style="s2">why do we imagine that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.160" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">benevolent god up there</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.119" end="00:43:18.640" style="s2">managing the world aren&#39;t we better</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:22.079" style="s2">managers of the world than god</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.640" end="00:43:25.599" style="s2">nature is read in tooth and claw</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.079" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">we seem to understand how to save a</p>

<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:30.800" style="s2">life how to buffer our existence from</p>

<p begin="00:43:30.800" end="00:43:36.720" style="s2">famine and would have said plague but</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">this gets into the postmodern complaint</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.720" end="00:43:40.079" style="s2">which is well maybe we&#39;re not quite as</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:41.760" style="s2">good at this as we thought we</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.079" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">were but i think that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.760" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">powerful argument and</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">and i very much understand when people</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:50.720" style="s2">say i have difficulty believing in a god</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.400" style="s2">because there&#39;s just too much chaos and</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.720" end="00:43:54.880" style="s2">suffering in the world</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.400" end="00:43:57.040" style="s2">and i don&#39;t imagine a good god would</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.880" end="00:43:59.599" style="s2">allow all of this to happen</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.040" end="00:44:00.800" style="s2">i think uh philosophers like alvin</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.599" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">plantinga</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:08.000" style="s2">have answered the question well</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:10.880" style="s2">but pastorally emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.000" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">if you&#39;re suffering it&#39;s a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.880" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.839" end="00:44:21.520" style="s2">all right any thought on us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:23.359" style="s2">just in terms of the the response i mean</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.520" end="00:44:24.319" style="s2">um i feel like you touch on the first</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:26.000" style="s2">part of that but i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.319" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">sure i connected with the second part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.000" end="00:44:31.119" style="s2">the question which is</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:33.520" style="s2">um you know what would your response to</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.119" end="00:44:35.040" style="s2">be to it in in in the culture war so if</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.520" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">someone would say all right this is the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.040" end="00:44:37.440" style="s2">problem we have with the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">christianity this good god like</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.440" end="00:44:40.480" style="s2">look at all the suffering um you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:42.319" style="s2">why</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.480" end="00:44:43.760" style="s2">why should we listen to christians like</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.319" end="00:44:45.440" style="s2">what christians have to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.760" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">in this in the context of the culture</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.440" end="00:44:51.040" style="s2">war like what would our response be</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:52.400" style="s2">i think i think the the dominant</p>

<p begin="00:45:05.119" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">as we know now in the in the 1930s</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.960" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">starved the ukraine and belarus and the</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:15.359" style="s2">name</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">of the utopian vision he was pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.359" end="00:45:18.880" style="s2">and well if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">make an omelette you have to break some</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.880" end="00:45:23.440" style="s2">eggs and george orwell</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:27.599" style="s2">said show me the omelet</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.440" end="00:45:32.480" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.599" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">because the the power that we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.480" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">the power that we have</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.160" end="00:45:42.160" style="s2">assigned to ourselves has filled us with</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.680" end="00:45:45.200" style="s2">ambition and enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.160" end="00:45:48.560" style="s2">but it seems we often over reach</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.200" end="00:45:50.240" style="s2">and so i think the reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.560" end="00:45:52.319" style="s2">i think the best answer that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.240" end="00:45:55.680" style="s2">christian church can give</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.319" end="00:45:56.480" style="s2">are the lives of its people and again if</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.680" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">you go back to</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.480" end="00:46:00.000" style="s2">my first answer to david questions uh</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:03.280" style="s2">christians</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.000" end="00:46:04.960" style="s2">often fail and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.280" end="00:46:07.119" style="s2">the real the real command that</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.960" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">christianity marches under is jesus</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.119" end="00:46:10.880" style="s2">command</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">at the beginning of the book of acts um</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.880" end="00:46:14.240" style="s2">you will receive power from the holy</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:16.640" style="s2">spirit and you will be my witnesses</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.240" end="00:46:18.480" style="s2">so the degree to which christians bear</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.640" end="00:46:20.720" style="s2">witness to jesus</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.480" end="00:46:21.760" style="s2">is usually the degree to which others</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.720" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">find</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.760" end="00:46:25.119" style="s2">his answers compelling</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.839" end="00:46:31.280" style="s2">cool uh paul you just</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:33.680" style="s2">uh had a question have you got to meet</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.280" end="00:46:36.880" style="s2">yourself uh okay let me get on the right</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">camera here um yeah so um hi paul um</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.880" end="00:46:40.800" style="s2">i was raised as a pastor&#39;s kid in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">conservative baptist church in a small</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.800" end="00:46:45.040" style="s2">town</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">in oregon so in that context hard right</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.040" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">politics and religion were very</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:50.079" style="s2">intertwined</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">um it&#39;s very hard to separate them um i</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.079" end="00:46:53.920" style="s2">was a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">self-aware kid but as i&#39;ve become you</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.920" end="00:46:57.599" style="s2">know 25 years</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:58.480" style="s2">since leaving that that context um</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.599" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">become a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.480" end="00:47:04.880" style="s2">you know scientifically socially um</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:06.640" style="s2">globally conscious um and have left the</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.880" end="00:47:09.119" style="s2">faith in that process and for me it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.640" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to separate those</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.119" end="00:47:13.599" style="s2">two progressions</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:15.599" style="s2">um does that make sense so far oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.599" end="00:47:16.640" style="s2">yeah um so what are some other</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.599" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">frameworks that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.640" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">uh and i assume i&#39;m not the only one</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:21.520" style="s2">what are the frameworks</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:22.800" style="s2">of ways to think about that that</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.520" end="00:47:24.960" style="s2">progression of</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.800" end="00:47:26.800" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve gone from this place of</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.960" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">being certain of everything i know</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:30.640" style="s2">to this place of not knowing agnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:34.400" style="s2">if you will but</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.640" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">um but in all other areas of my life um</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.400" end="00:47:38.400" style="s2">and it&#39;s again it&#39;s very hard for me to</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">psychologically separate those i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.400" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">curious your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.760" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">yeah i i there are a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:47.119" style="s2">that i talk to who have stories like</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:49.040" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.119" end="00:47:50.960" style="s2">it was interesting to me that jordan</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.040" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">peterson</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.960" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">seemed to uh trigger and a lot of folks</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:59.680" style="s2">with stories like yours a</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:02.800" style="s2">reconsideration of christianity</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.680" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">i grew up in a home which was</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.800" end="00:48:08.640" style="s2">you know conservative in terms</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">of christian belief you know the</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.640" end="00:48:13.520" style="s2">resurrection the virgin birth</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:15.680" style="s2">the resurrection of jesus uh the second</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.520" end="00:48:20.640" style="s2">coming all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.680" end="00:48:23.839" style="s2">but wasn&#39;t politically conservative</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.640" end="00:48:25.839" style="s2">so i think a lot of people because these</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.839" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2">things were together</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.839" end="00:48:30.640" style="s2">they kind of associated it and it become</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">it had become a whole</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.640" end="00:48:34.240" style="s2">and so a lot of people have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">deconstructed that</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.240" end="00:48:38.880" style="s2">and and left other parts of it so</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.520" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">you know yesterday i did uh today</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">actually i posted a conversation with a</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:48.319" style="s2">guy named jesse whose story</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:48.880" style="s2">was very similar he deconstructed he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.319" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">since</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.880" end="00:48:57.359" style="s2">found his way back i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:49:00.640" style="s2">traditions every tradition needs</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.359" end="00:49:04.480" style="s2">walls but traditions that rely too much</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.640" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">on the impenetrability of their walls</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.480" end="00:49:07.520" style="s2">and i&#39;m speaking about walls</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.760" end="00:49:11.119" style="s2">metaphorically here in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.520" end="00:49:13.599" style="s2">mental structures tend to be weak</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.119" end="00:49:14.400" style="s2">when encountering other strong</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.599" end="00:49:16.000" style="s2">traditions</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.400" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">and i think this has happened to a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.000" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.359" end="00:49:26.559" style="s2">i think as adults we have to exercise</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.400" style="s2">stewardship over our beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.559" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">and look for the truth and work through</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.400" end="00:49:33.520" style="s2">those issues and</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:36.640" style="s2">probably be equally</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.520" end="00:49:37.839" style="s2">serious about deconstructing new beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.640" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">as old</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.839" end="00:49:42.240" style="s2">and so well there&#39;s a lot of folks with</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:43.839" style="s2">stories like yours</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.240" end="00:49:46.480" style="s2">and that&#39;s happening in the christian</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.839" end="00:49:49.200" style="s2">church all over the place</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.480" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">and so i would just encourage i&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.200" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">you&#39;re here in the stoa</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:54.160" style="s2">and encourage you to continue to pursue</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">conversations</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.160" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2">with people who are wrestling with</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:50:01.760" style="s2">similar things</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:05.119" style="s2">so if peter if i could have one call up</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.760" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">yeah um yeah i think you hit on all the</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.119" end="00:50:08.960" style="s2">all the the right issues and the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:11.760" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m dealing with and</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:13.119" style="s2">it&#39;s really only been in the last six to</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.760" end="00:50:14.480" style="s2">12 months i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.119" end="00:50:16.319" style="s2">within the last 12 months that my dad</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.480" end="00:50:18.240" style="s2">and i have even had</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.319" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">you know transparent conversations about</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.240" end="00:50:20.160" style="s2">this it&#39;s mostly just been the elephant</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:22.000" style="s2">in the room</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:23.680" style="s2">which again i know i&#39;m not unique there</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.000" end="00:50:26.960" style="s2">um what are</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.680" end="00:50:28.319" style="s2">what are some you know again</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.960" end="00:50:30.240" style="s2">practical ways to open up that</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">conversation space with him when you</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.240" end="00:50:33.040" style="s2">know it&#39;s clear it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:35.119" style="s2">major source of pain for him and i</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.040" end="00:50:40.400" style="s2">understand that and care about that</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.119" end="00:50:45.040" style="s2">yeah i think kindness is important</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.400" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">patience work hard on</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.040" end="00:50:51.599" style="s2">work hard on not being easily triggered</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:53.200" style="s2">and in all likelihood your father has to</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.599" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">work on that too</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.200" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">in my experience both of you probably</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.920" end="00:51:01.839" style="s2">want a restoration of your relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:04.319" style="s2">it won&#39;t that might not be easy because</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.839" end="00:51:07.440" style="s2">he&#39;s going to have to work through</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.319" end="00:51:09.680" style="s2">some of his own beliefs and i i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.440" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">people sometimes try to short-circuit</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.680" end="00:51:14.000" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">ironically by pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.000" end="00:51:19.280" style="s2">sort of a propositional approach</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:21.280" style="s2">which is what they&#39;ve deconstructed from</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.280" end="00:51:22.480" style="s2">say dad if you&#39;d only give up these</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.280" end="00:51:24.319" style="s2">beliefs</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.480" end="00:51:25.599" style="s2">well i don&#39;t think that&#39;s necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.319" end="00:51:27.839" style="s2">true again</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.599" end="00:51:28.960" style="s2">right at the heart of christianity is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.839" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">man</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.960" end="00:51:35.119" style="s2">loving and dying for his enemies</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">if jesus can do that for his enemies</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.119" end="00:51:39.119" style="s2">surely</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:41.119" style="s2">it&#39;s a christian goal to do that for our</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.119" end="00:51:43.680" style="s2">children with whom we have disagreements</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.119" end="00:51:44.880" style="s2">and with our parents so i&#39;d say keep</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.680" end="00:51:48.559" style="s2">working at it</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.880" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">um and and you can&#39;t work you can&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.559" end="00:51:53.359" style="s2">his work for him</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:56.640" style="s2">so just work on your triggers</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.359" end="00:51:57.440" style="s2">um you know when he inevitably says</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.640" end="00:52:01.200" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.440" end="00:52:03.680" style="s2">that triggers you learn to forgive</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.200" end="00:52:05.040" style="s2">and at that point as a christian pastor</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.680" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.040" end="00:52:08.079" style="s2">well if you&#39;re learning to forgive well</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:10.000" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.079" end="00:52:11.119" style="s2">you&#39;re listening to jesus because it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.000" end="00:52:12.960" style="s2">jesus who said</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.119" end="00:52:14.800" style="s2">you know jesus put such a high value on</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.960" end="00:52:18.319" style="s2">forgiveness so</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.800" end="00:52:20.000" style="s2">i have you know my best wishes are for</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.319" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">you and your father that that you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.000" end="00:52:25.920" style="s2">restore the relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:29.680" style="s2">and potentially have some</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.920" end="00:52:33.920" style="s2">productive meaningful conversations</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.680" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">about why you&#39;ve made the decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.920" end="00:52:38.640" style="s2">you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">and he&#39;s also made decisions to stay</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.640" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">with his faith</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:47.280" style="s2">and so odds are both of you can learn</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:50.800" style="s2">from each other</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.280" end="00:52:53.280" style="s2">all right uh let&#39;s bring</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.800" end="00:52:54.559" style="s2">uh us home with joe&#39;s question joe if</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.280" end="00:52:58.839" style="s2">you can ask your question and</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.559" end="00:53:00.000" style="s2">meet yourself oh uh this is uh joe</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.839" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">pickens</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.000" end="00:53:03.599" style="s2">hi paul good to see you</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.640" end="00:53:09.119" style="s2">so i was listening to uh actually i</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.520" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">wasn&#39;t listening to the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.119" end="00:53:13.440" style="s2">paul&#39;s question just now because i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:16.160" style="s2">too busy formulating my own question but</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.440" end="00:53:18.240" style="s2">i caught the tail end of it and it seems</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.160" end="00:53:20.000" style="s2">somewhat relevant to my question which</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.240" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">is um</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.000" end="00:53:23.520" style="s2">i see a necessity for christians many of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">whom are very</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.520" end="00:53:27.040" style="s2">close to me and who i care for deeply</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:28.800" style="s2">because that was the</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.040" end="00:53:31.359" style="s2">the protestant tradition that i was</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.800" end="00:53:32.319" style="s2">brought up in um i see a necessity for</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.359" end="00:53:35.520" style="s2">them to</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.319" end="00:53:38.160" style="s2">take the plunge so to speak into</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.520" end="00:53:39.040" style="s2">post-modernity and to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.160" end="00:53:42.800" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.040" end="00:53:46.319" style="s2">with postmodernity and into a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.800" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">christianity if that&#39;s what they want um</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.319" end="00:53:49.520" style="s2">but there seems to be this huge dividing</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:52.800" style="s2">line within my</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.520" end="00:53:54.880" style="s2">own family and my community between</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.800" end="00:53:56.800" style="s2">those who have taken that plunge and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.880" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">those who have not</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.800" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">um and i feel like i&#39;m in this</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:05.920" style="s2">unique position and feel called in a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.480" end="00:54:10.160" style="s2">to reconcile those</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.920" end="00:54:12.960" style="s2">two tribes um</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.160" end="00:54:13.680" style="s2">just if nothing else just within my own</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.960" end="00:54:16.319" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.680" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">and my community and i was wondering if</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.319" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">you can speak at all to that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">dynamic between those two tribes and if</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:25.839" style="s2">you have any experience with that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.720" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">it&#39;s never easy and</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.440" end="00:54:39.359" style="s2">how whatever good you wish for the other</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">side</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.359" end="00:54:44.799" style="s2">human beings usually aren&#39;t capable of</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">necessarily delivering on those things</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.799" end="00:54:51.200" style="s2">so i find again the central admonition</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">of christianity to love</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.200" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">to usually be the best pathway forward</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:59.359" style="s2">figure out the best way to love both</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:01.599" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.359" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">love has an amazing power to afford</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.599" end="00:55:05.599" style="s2">credibility</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:07.680" style="s2">to the person who is giving themself for</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.599" end="00:55:11.280" style="s2">the other</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.680" end="00:55:14.960" style="s2">these things take a long time and so</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.280" end="00:55:18.240" style="s2">be patient i also believe</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.960" end="00:55:22.240" style="s2">this work is difficult if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">a vivid faith</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.240" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2">in the sovereignty of god to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:32.319" style="s2">to accomplish difficult and hard things</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:33.520" style="s2">in our midst in response to our needs</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.319" end="00:55:38.319" style="s2">and requests</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.520" end="00:55:41.520" style="s2">and so i recommend that as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.319" end="00:55:43.520" style="s2">it sounds um and</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.520" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">there are so there are some ironies in</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.520" end="00:55:49.520" style="s2">this generally speaking not always</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:50.640" style="s2">many traditionalists have a theology</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.520" end="00:55:53.520" style="s2">that affords</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.640" end="00:55:54.960" style="s2">this type of sovereignty and power given</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.520" end="00:55:58.240" style="s2">to god</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.960" end="00:56:00.240" style="s2">uh people who are more progressive and</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.240" end="00:56:03.520" style="s2">contemporary</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.240" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">often more skeptical um don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.520" end="00:56:10.319" style="s2">have that resource to fall back</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">on to give them encouragement</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.319" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">so much of life is learning to suffer it</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:18.240" style="s2">really is</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:21.599" style="s2">and i find a</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.240" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">a a strong vivid belief</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.599" end="00:56:26.400" style="s2">in god&#39;s goodness and sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:29.520" style="s2">presence when we ask him</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.400" end="00:56:33.200" style="s2">to be a tremendous help to</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.520" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">bearing under heavy loads and so</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.200" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to if you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:43.440" style="s2">endeavor to do a difficult thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">figure out the kinds of resources you</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.440" end="00:56:47.359" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">to endure the kinds of suffering that</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.359" end="00:56:51.599" style="s2">that difficult thing will require of you</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.920" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that makes any sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.599" end="00:57:02.799" style="s2">oh that is helpful thank you i i</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.480" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">especially liked the</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:14.000" style="s2">side as best that i possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.640" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">and that giving a credibility to</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.000" end="00:57:17.520" style="s2">uh i mean it&#39;s just you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.760" end="00:57:24.559" style="s2">being the person that&#39;s at the center of</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">christianity sort of turns out to be the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.559" end="00:57:27.839" style="s2">solution to a lot of answers</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.920" end="00:57:33.920" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s really the</p>
