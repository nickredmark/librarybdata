<p begin="00:00:25.130" end="00:00:30.140" style="s2">reform of government the usual way this</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.279" end="00:00:32.960" style="s2">is discussed is very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.140" end="00:00:35.839" style="s2">it&#39;s very policy focused sometimes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.960" end="00:00:37.430" style="s2">focused on concrete changes to</p>

<p begin="00:00:43.910" end="00:00:48.290" style="s2">think both of these approaches are</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.100" end="00:00:50.059" style="s2">deeply flawed and not how the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.290" end="00:00:52.580" style="s2">meaningful change happens in government</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.059" end="00:00:55.129" style="s2">I think that it&#39;s much less useful to</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.580" end="00:00:57.589" style="s2">think of government as a unitary object</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.129" end="00:01:00.110" style="s2">as a unitary system and more is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.589" end="00:01:02.150" style="s2">collection of interdependent systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.110" end="00:01:03.260" style="s2">right if we think of government is</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.150" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">strictly unitary</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.260" end="00:01:07.549" style="s2">then something like modern Britain makes</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:10.189" style="s2">no sense at all it&#39;s a parliamentary</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.549" end="00:01:14.180" style="s2">democracy yet it doesn&#39;t have a written</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.189" end="00:01:16.610" style="s2">constitution it&#39;s clearly forming some</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.180" end="00:01:19.910" style="s2">sort of Republican representative system</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.610" end="00:01:22.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a crown monarchy it&#39;s a system</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.910" end="00:01:24.320" style="s2">where the elected officials though can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.460" end="00:01:27.110" style="s2">really fire anyone that&#39;s sufficiently</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.320" end="00:01:29.420" style="s2">senior in the civil service so instead</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.110" end="00:01:31.820" style="s2">of thinking of modern Britain as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.420" end="00:01:34.130" style="s2">republic a monarchy a democracy or a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.820" end="00:01:36.020" style="s2">bureaucracy it&#39;s best to think of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.130" end="00:01:38.750" style="s2">government as a bunch of layered systems</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.020" end="00:01:40.820" style="s2">all on top of each other with different</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.750" end="00:01:43.400" style="s2">bases of legitimacy and different modes</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.820" end="00:01:47.030" style="s2">of operation stuff that&#39;s only very</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.400" end="00:01:50.510" style="s2">lightly touched by political theory but</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.030" end="00:01:53.330" style="s2">mostly encoded in practice mostly coded</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.510" end="00:01:55.550" style="s2">coded in precedent and sometimes a</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.330" end="00:01:58.820" style="s2">little bit coded by the particular</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.550" end="00:02:00.860" style="s2">convenience of key politicians if you</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.820" end="00:02:04.280" style="s2">think that it&#39;s all discourse you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.860" end="00:02:06.530" style="s2">waste your time with policy papers and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.280" end="00:02:08.479" style="s2">if you think it&#39;s all politics you might</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.530" end="00:02:10.039" style="s2">waste all your time boosting a</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.479" end="00:02:13.489" style="s2">particular politician and then being</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.039" end="00:02:15.650" style="s2">surprised when they necessarily don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.489" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">what they promised to do because often</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.650" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">what they promise to do is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:22.190" style="s2">either personally politically impossible</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:23.719" style="s2">impossible for their wider coalition or</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.190" end="00:02:26.239" style="s2">just impossible for the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.719" end="00:02:28.910" style="s2">organization that they&#39;ve inherited so</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.239" end="00:02:31.250" style="s2">thinking of government as several</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.910" end="00:02:34.580" style="s2">different institutions as layers of</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.250" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">social technology clarifies how Britain</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.580" end="00:02:38.410" style="s2">can both have you know a functioning</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:41.060" style="s2">dynasty in a way with Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.410" end="00:02:44.060" style="s2">being the representative of that dynasty</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.060" end="00:02:45.770" style="s2">yet having democratic elements yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.060" end="00:02:48.220" style="s2">fundamentally still being mostly</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.770" end="00:02:50.840" style="s2">dominated by the civil service as such</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.220" end="00:02:53.840" style="s2">with the civil service itself not being</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.840" end="00:02:55.370" style="s2">necessarily even you know overbearing or</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.840" end="00:02:57.860" style="s2">tyrannical as some narratives might</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.370" end="00:02:59.990" style="s2">propose which is doing a very narrow job</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:04.310" style="s2">like a narrow artificial intelligence or</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.990" end="00:03:06.320" style="s2">a piece of software so this layering of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.310" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">social technologies proposes then that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.320" end="00:03:11.360" style="s2">the best way to reform government is to</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:14.450" style="s2">produce a new government institution or</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.360" end="00:03:16.640" style="s2">several that operate on different</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.450" end="00:03:18.710" style="s2">principles than the existing</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.640" end="00:03:21.380" style="s2">institutions in government yet are</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.710" end="00:03:24.650" style="s2">endorsed by the other institutions of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.380" end="00:03:27.440" style="s2">government so when you mix in multiple</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.650" end="00:03:30.610" style="s2">agencies into the same interacting</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.440" end="00:03:33.740" style="s2">system different agencies come up on top</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.610" end="00:03:35.900" style="s2">for example it&#39;s an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.740" end="00:03:37.490" style="s2">and now and maybe look at a historical</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.900" end="00:03:39.350" style="s2">example at like you know a more</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.490" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2">authoritarian system than what modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.350" end="00:03:44.000" style="s2">Britain is or what modern the modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:45.980" style="s2">u.s. is in the Soviet Union the key</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.000" end="00:03:48.770" style="s2">political power struggle was between the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.980" end="00:03:50.660" style="s2">Communist Party in the KGB it was not</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.770" end="00:03:52.970" style="s2">between the Communist Party and the</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.660" end="00:03:54.470" style="s2">people or even the Communist Party and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:56.480" style="s2">the kulaks right the kulaks were</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.470" end="00:03:58.459" style="s2">scapegoats there were wealthy farmers</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.480" end="00:04:00.110" style="s2">but they obviously like you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.459" end="00:04:02.120" style="s2">couldn&#39;t engage in industrial warfare</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.110" end="00:04:05.750" style="s2">even if they didn&#39;t like communism as</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.120" end="00:04:09.410" style="s2">such so this key struggle happened</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.750" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">because the KGB as such had the ability</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.410" end="00:04:14.270" style="s2">to keep secrets from the Communist Party</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:17.510" style="s2">as such and in fact kept some secret</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.270" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">successfully the KGB had an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.510" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">with the East German Stasi to in case of</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:27.860" style="s2">change in civilian government in East</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:29.540" style="s2">Germany have the Stasi overthrow the</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.860" end="00:04:30.860" style="s2">East German government note the East</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.540" end="00:04:32.630" style="s2">German civilian government was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.860" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">communist government right Communist</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.630" end="00:04:37.580" style="s2">Party officials but the party was</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.880" end="00:04:40.100" style="s2">organized along different lines than the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.580" end="00:04:42.650" style="s2">KGB itself even when the party used the</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.100" end="00:04:44.870" style="s2">KGB as their own instrument right</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.650" end="00:04:47.389" style="s2">one of the keynotes here to consider is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.870" end="00:04:49.790" style="s2">that you know Stalin most of Stalin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.389" end="00:04:51.919" style="s2">foes were other Communist Party</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.790" end="00:04:54.320" style="s2">officials so Stalin perhaps his best</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.919" end="00:04:57.830" style="s2">modeled as someone that is a tyrannical</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:05:00.380" style="s2">leader using an intelligence agency to</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.830" end="00:05:01.850" style="s2">subdue what otherwise would be be a sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.380" end="00:05:04.280" style="s2">of like committee based party</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.850" end="00:05:04.699" style="s2">bureaucracy and if you look at China</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.280" end="00:05:07.639" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.699" end="00:05:08.930" style="s2">China&#39;s you know greatest threat the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.639" end="00:05:11.270" style="s2">greatest threat that the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.930" end="00:05:13.789" style="s2">Communist Party is not some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.270" end="00:05:16.250" style="s2">western-style liberal democratic</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.789" end="00:05:19.520" style="s2">revolution it will be a military coup</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.250" end="00:05:21.350" style="s2">from the People&#39;s Liberation Army which</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.520" end="00:05:23.389" style="s2">means that they&#39;re incentivized in</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.350" end="00:05:25.520" style="s2">important ways to disrupt the People&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.389" end="00:05:27.199" style="s2">Liberation Army even while on the other</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.520" end="00:05:29.630" style="s2">hand they&#39;re incentivized to make it</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.199" end="00:05:31.729" style="s2">very formidable and powerful in order to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.630" end="00:05:35.599" style="s2">say challenge the US on the world stage</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.729" end="00:05:37.130" style="s2">or more generously provide for Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.599" end="00:05:40.310" style="s2">security and Intel you know and</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.130" end="00:05:41.710" style="s2">territorial integrity so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.310" end="00:05:44.449" style="s2">sketching out here is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.710" end="00:05:46.430" style="s2">interleave different systems they will</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.449" end="00:05:49.550" style="s2">come into conflict with each other and</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.430" end="00:05:51.740" style="s2">sometimes route past each other so when</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.550" end="00:05:53.990" style="s2">I say that you produce a new government</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.740" end="00:05:56.150" style="s2">institution that is accepted by current</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.990" end="00:05:58.070" style="s2">government institutions and has to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.150" end="00:06:00.169" style="s2">endorsed by them I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.070" end="00:06:01.760" style="s2">compromise with them it&#39;s possible to</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.169" end="00:06:03.800" style="s2">produce the government institution that</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.760" end="00:06:05.930" style="s2">in terms of power or authority or</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.800" end="00:06:08.120" style="s2">influence completely displaces the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.930" end="00:06:10.820" style="s2">previous ones either for the better or</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.120" end="00:06:14.510" style="s2">for the worse and the key distinction</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.820" end="00:06:17.000" style="s2">between this and a revolution is that a</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.510" end="00:06:17.570" style="s2">revolution asserts that there is a new</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.000" end="00:06:19.580" style="s2">government</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.570" end="00:06:21.949" style="s2">it makes the legal case that we are a</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.580" end="00:06:24.710" style="s2">distinct entity a distinct system from</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.949" end="00:06:27.080" style="s2">the previous one you can have what is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.710" end="00:06:29.840" style="s2">revolution in substance without ever</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.270" end="00:06:38.090" style="s2">while I feel that say you know political</p>

<p begin="00:06:58.530" end="00:07:03.360" style="s2">massively when the ministry you know the</p>

<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:13.050" style="s2">because if you have then the Pentagon</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.250" end="00:07:15.060" style="s2">and the State Department is too massive</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.050" end="00:07:17.039" style="s2">bureaucracies where people don&#39;t run</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.060" end="00:07:18.389" style="s2">into each other because they live in the</p>

<p begin="00:07:22.110" end="00:07:25.440" style="s2">basically each one of these institutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.699" end="00:07:28.770" style="s2">is carrying out a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.440" end="00:07:30.810" style="s2">international agenda right so something</p>

<p begin="00:07:30.810" end="00:07:34.500" style="s2">change as much might still cause a</p>

<p begin="00:07:38.699" end="00:07:43.770" style="s2">based okay so this is very theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:45.900" style="s2">it&#39;s a very broad-based but I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.770" end="00:07:48.150" style="s2">share some of this basic theory and</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.900" end="00:07:50.120" style="s2">basic approach here where it proposes</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.150" end="00:07:52.530" style="s2">that creating new institutions</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.120" end="00:07:55.349" style="s2">completely new ones is the best way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.530" end="00:07:57.539" style="s2">reform existing systems and it&#39;s best to</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.349" end="00:08:00.090" style="s2">not propose a strong break with the old</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.539" end="00:08:02.039" style="s2">system but still have the firm</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.090" end="00:08:05.130" style="s2">expectation of completely altering the</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.039" end="00:08:10.169" style="s2">old system cool so would like to hear</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.130" end="00:08:11.699" style="s2">questions now so most of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.169" end="00:08:13.860" style="s2">drill here so if you want to ask a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.699" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">question go ahead and put it in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.860" end="00:08:19.319" style="s2">and then I will call your name and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:22.110" style="s2">can Ameet yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.319" end="00:08:26.219" style="s2">and just initially here I&#39;ll start us</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.110" end="00:08:29.190" style="s2">off so Sam oh I&#39;m wondering in recent</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.219" end="00:08:33.870" style="s2">history in the United States do you see</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.190" end="00:08:37.349" style="s2">that this kind of hidden revolution or</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.870" end="00:08:39.810" style="s2">shift of the guard has happened in any</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.349" end="00:08:45.360" style="s2">particular way that may be coming to</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.810" end="00:08:47.070" style="s2">light in in this current crisis hmm well</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.360" end="00:08:49.260" style="s2">I think in the 20th century the u.s. had</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.070" end="00:08:51.570" style="s2">several shifts and changes in what the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.260" end="00:08:53.790" style="s2">system is right I think that obviously</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.570" end="00:08:56.790" style="s2">the New Deal is the most well-known one</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.790" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">right where FDR you know FDR was</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.790" end="00:08:59.670" style="s2">president for life</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:01.560" style="s2">though we didn&#39;t think of him as</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.670" end="00:09:03.510" style="s2">president for life right but when</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.560" end="00:09:06.329" style="s2">someone has four terms in office</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.510" end="00:09:08.730" style="s2">it&#39;s the structural advantages to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.329" end="00:09:12.839" style="s2">re-election just become overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.730" end="00:09:14.339" style="s2">so it&#39;s his health rather than any sort</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.839" end="00:09:17.519" style="s2">of failure during an election that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.339" end="00:09:20.970" style="s2">secures that position I think that there</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.519" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">was a massive shift in power towards US</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.970" end="00:09:26.040" style="s2">intelligence post-world War two so I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">think that you know this was stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.040" end="00:09:31.019" style="s2">was shown in the church committee papers</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">in the 1970s where say the role of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.019" end="00:09:37.019" style="s2">FBI I got went far into the domain of</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:40.079" style="s2">regulating political and social life you</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.019" end="00:09:43.410" style="s2">know wiretapping MLK you know you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.079" end="00:09:44.910" style="s2">wiretap MLK and you wiretap the KKK it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:46.380" style="s2">not because you&#39;re picking a side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.910" end="00:09:49.649" style="s2">because your objective is a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.380" end="00:09:51.449" style="s2">amoral your objective is continuing</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.649" end="00:09:54.269" style="s2">preservation of the system and stability</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.449" end="00:09:56.760" style="s2">right and then you you wiretap them and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.269" end="00:09:59.100" style="s2">you sometimes try to blackmail them and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.760" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">you actively interfere in things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.100" end="00:10:03.630" style="s2">are relevant to shaping domestic</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:06.360" style="s2">politics other stuff like this is say</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.630" end="00:10:08.370" style="s2">operation Mockingbird and so on I do</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.360" end="00:10:10.050" style="s2">think the sense making of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.370" end="00:10:13.110" style="s2">Intelligence Agency&#39;s broke down over</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.050" end="00:10:15.480" style="s2">time where you know the intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.110" end="00:10:17.910" style="s2">world of the early 2000s is in a way far</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.480" end="00:10:20.610" style="s2">less potent politically than the</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.910" end="00:10:22.079" style="s2">intelligence world of the 1960s in fact</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.610" end="00:10:25.170" style="s2">makes mistakes that it really shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:28.139" style="s2">have made I think another big change has</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.170" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">been the empowerment of the presidency</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.139" end="00:10:32.519" style="s2">and the weakening of the President</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:34.410" style="s2">himself now I&#39;m not going to comment on</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.519" end="00:10:36.990" style="s2">Trump because he&#39;s a strange phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.410" end="00:10:39.870" style="s2">is difficult to understand but if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.990" end="00:10:41.610" style="s2">compared the power of the presidency all</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.870" end="00:10:44.029" style="s2">of these extended bureaucracies around</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.610" end="00:10:48.269" style="s2">the White House in 2000</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.029" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">in 1950 in 2000 it&#39;s actually I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.269" end="00:10:53.610" style="s2">more powerful but if we could compare</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:55.649" style="s2">President Eisenhower to you know Bill</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.610" end="00:10:58.860" style="s2">Clinton I think Eisenhower is more</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.649" end="00:11:01.319" style="s2">personally powerful right so there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.860" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">unacknowledged Rauf of a growth of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.319" end="00:11:06.630" style="s2">permanent executive in a way another</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:08.819" style="s2">thing is the weakening of Congress</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.630" end="00:11:11.250" style="s2">Congress has over the past 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.819" end="00:11:13.889" style="s2">basically lost the ability to produce</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.250" end="00:11:15.750" style="s2">constitutional amendments it&#39;s lost the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.889" end="00:11:18.029" style="s2">ability to make committees or</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.750" end="00:11:19.980" style="s2">commissions that are more than just for</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.029" end="00:11:22.380" style="s2">show but genuine oversight over other</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.980" end="00:11:24.660" style="s2">branches of government</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.380" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">there&#39;s finally also been a change in</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.660" end="00:11:27.839" style="s2">the Supreme Court where the Supreme</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.339" end="00:11:30.690" style="s2">Court seems to have evolved into a</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.839" end="00:11:32.970" style="s2">legislative Oregon so in a way Supreme</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.690" end="00:11:35.100" style="s2">Court influences the substance of laws</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.970" end="00:11:37.040" style="s2">far more than Congress does at this</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.100" end="00:11:40.350" style="s2">point Congress at this point is</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.040" end="00:11:42.180" style="s2">formalizing and putting in motion</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.350" end="00:11:44.360" style="s2">suggestions that were worked out outside</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.180" end="00:11:47.490" style="s2">of Congress right it&#39;s no longer a</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.360" end="00:11:49.290" style="s2">deliberative body so in a way it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.490" end="00:11:52.050" style="s2">ceremonial and I think we&#39;re starting to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.290" end="00:11:54.180" style="s2">treat it as very ceremonial this is why</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.050" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">people get you know so much more excited</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.180" end="00:11:58.130" style="s2">over presidential elections than they do</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.160" end="00:12:02.130" style="s2">over you know congressional</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.130" end="00:12:03.750" style="s2">congressional races I this was that sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.130" end="00:12:04.949" style="s2">of the question that I managed to answer</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.750" end="00:12:17.399" style="s2">the question and the way you are</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.949" end="00:12:20.699" style="s2">interested foreign institutions to kind</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.399" end="00:12:24.480" style="s2">of like interweave and shift things over</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.699" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">time do you see maybe have you seen the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.480" end="00:12:29.250" style="s2">activity on Twitter and other social</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:32.730" style="s2">media talking about States a lying to</p>

<p begin="00:12:35.670" end="00:12:43.110" style="s2">economy is that a potential move in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.630" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">direction we&#39;re like states coordinating</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.110" end="00:12:48.600" style="s2">and starting to create their own</p>

<p begin="00:12:56.660" end="00:13:03.420" style="s2">influence I think it&#39;s plausible that</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.540" end="00:13:05.250" style="s2">will be a move in that direction the key</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.420" end="00:13:07.920" style="s2">thing to note here is that the United</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.250" end="00:13:10.620" style="s2">States if you look at you know the 50 or</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.920" end="00:13:12.810" style="s2">so states that it has not counting</p>

<p begin="00:13:35.430" end="00:13:43.980" style="s2">then against unilateral secession so if</p>

<p begin="00:13:52.230" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">really independent is it right as long</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.149" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">as the military doesn&#39;t leave and if the</p>

<p begin="00:14:03.270" end="00:14:07.290" style="s2">is an extreme state you might think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.149" end="00:14:09.180" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t have consequences</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.290" end="00:14:11.310" style="s2">downstream for more normal political</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.180" end="00:14:12.890" style="s2">States lower energy political states</p>

<p begin="00:14:15.390" end="00:14:20.490" style="s2">this kind of capacity for political</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.089" end="00:14:22.500" style="s2">violence is unfortunately one of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.490" end="00:14:24.540" style="s2">main factors in shaping everyday</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.500" end="00:14:26.550" style="s2">politics right there is contrary</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.540" end="00:14:28.649" style="s2">consequences that translate from that</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.550" end="00:14:31.500" style="s2">extreme hypothetical all the way to more</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.649" end="00:14:33.450" style="s2">mundane circumstances and one of them is</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.500" end="00:14:35.940" style="s2">that if the federal government wants to</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.450" end="00:14:37.320" style="s2">enforce a law in your territory it will</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.940" end="00:14:38.940" style="s2">be able to enforce a law in your</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.320" end="00:14:41.730" style="s2">territory and as a stage you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.940" end="00:14:43.740" style="s2">really opt out of laws that the federal</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.730" end="00:14:47.510" style="s2">government has decided it will not allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.740" end="00:14:50.370" style="s2">you topped out of so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.510" end="00:14:53.790" style="s2">federal the federal the supremacy of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.370" end="00:14:55.650" style="s2">federal structure won&#39;t go away I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.790" end="00:14:58.860" style="s2">there is the possibility though that</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.650" end="00:15:01.560" style="s2">compacts of states could start</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.860" end="00:15:03.690" style="s2">functioning as bigger blocks so if you</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.560" end="00:15:05.339" style="s2">have California plus a few more states</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.690" end="00:15:08.160" style="s2">you know that&#39;s a few percentage points</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.339" end="00:15:10.740" style="s2">of the economy or if you have New York</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.160" end="00:15:12.830" style="s2">plus some neighboring states that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.740" end="00:15:15.630" style="s2">several percentage points of the economy</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.830" end="00:15:18.990" style="s2">and they can coordinate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.630" end="00:15:21.990" style="s2">honest a federal level to push</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.990" end="00:15:24.270" style="s2">acceptance to push the federal</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.990" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">government to accept and stamp things in</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.270" end="00:15:29.010" style="s2">various ways you know in a sense more</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.870" style="s2">closer to what the original idea was</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.010" end="00:15:32.700" style="s2">between states and the federal structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.870" end="00:15:34.740" style="s2">but over time the federal structure</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.700" end="00:15:37.560" style="s2">became very strong the states became</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.740" end="00:15:40.520" style="s2">very weak the key flaw here is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.560" end="00:15:43.140" style="s2">these state compacts they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.520" end="00:15:46.100" style="s2">informed on anything like the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.140" end="00:15:48.630" style="s2">popular sovereignty or popular mandate</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.100" end="00:15:49.350" style="s2">so right now if you told people that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.630" end="00:15:50.970" style="s2">California</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.350" end="00:15:52.820" style="s2">gonna do things the californian way and</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.970" end="00:15:55.860" style="s2">Texas is gonna do things the Texas Way</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.820" end="00:15:57.540" style="s2">that has some weight but if you said the</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.860" end="00:16:00.270" style="s2">West Coast is gonna do things its its</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.540" end="00:16:02.820" style="s2">own way that&#39;s already weaker and if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.270" end="00:16:04.860" style="s2">say the 12 state compact is gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.820" end="00:16:06.150" style="s2">things its way that&#39;s just half carries</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.860" end="00:16:08.190" style="s2">no weight at all no weight and</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.150" end="00:16:10.170" style="s2">legitimacy right so the governor has</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.190" end="00:16:12.630" style="s2">done very quickly overstep and start</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.170" end="00:16:14.280" style="s2">singing illegitimate there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.630" end="00:16:18.450" style="s2">interesting dance here where I think</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.280" end="00:16:20.340" style="s2">that there is deferral of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.450" end="00:16:23.280" style="s2">with regard to opening up the economy</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.340" end="00:16:24.900" style="s2">happening so I wonder whether the</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.280" end="00:16:27.270" style="s2">governors are just being asked to be the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.900" end="00:16:29.970" style="s2">bag holders right the people who you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.270" end="00:16:31.890" style="s2">know tails tails they lose heads they</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.970" end="00:16:33.660" style="s2">lose right if they reopen the economy</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.890" end="00:16:36.150" style="s2">too late economic damage to the state is</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.660" end="00:16:37.710" style="s2">significant if they reopen too soon and</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.150" end="00:16:40.380" style="s2">they&#39;re loved that a lot of people die</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.710" end="00:16:42.810" style="s2">and is then seen as the problem of these</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.380" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">governors rather than the problem of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.810" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">federal government as a whole so I</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:49.200" style="s2">suspect this as a it&#39;s it&#39;s convenient</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:53.250" style="s2">for the federal government to have the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.200" end="00:16:55.830" style="s2">states take the fall on this one so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.250" end="00:16:58.230" style="s2">I would expect a limited consequence I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.830" end="00:17:00.540" style="s2">could see say the West Coast states in</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.230" end="00:17:04.680" style="s2">particular having shared economic</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.540" end="00:17:07.170" style="s2">interests and persisting in</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.680" end="00:17:11.010" style="s2">collaboration past this window of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.170" end="00:17:15.140" style="s2">next year or two when the kovat crisis</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.010" end="00:17:15.140" style="s2">readjusts to a new and different normal</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.710" end="00:17:26.430" style="s2">sure sure</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.640" end="00:17:30.180" style="s2">thank you for speaking with us today Sam</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.430" end="00:17:32.700" style="s2">well I&#39;m curious whether you see any</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.180" end="00:17:33.860" style="s2">possibilities in in the near term in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.700" end="00:17:36.570" style="s2">next couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.860" end="00:17:40.740" style="s2">anywhere in the world where an alliance</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.570" end="00:17:43.830" style="s2">between sympathetic forces in in state</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.740" end="00:17:46.560" style="s2">institutions or the bureaucracy and a</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.830" end="00:17:49.260" style="s2">movement of grassroot participatory</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.560" end="00:17:52.710" style="s2">democracy movements could form new</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.260" end="00:17:56.070" style="s2">institutions which shift the political</p>

<p begin="00:18:03.120" end="00:18:13.500" style="s2">analogs of any yeah I think that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.130" end="00:18:15.660" style="s2">always the potential for this right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.500" end="00:18:18.600" style="s2">key potential here is there is a massive</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.660" end="00:18:22.310" style="s2">amount of legitimacy that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.600" end="00:18:25.680" style="s2">genuine widespread consciousness or</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.680" end="00:18:30.660" style="s2">just doesn&#39;t build that much so it</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:33.030" style="s2">legitimizes a lot but it in itself does</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.660" end="00:18:34.680" style="s2">not build that much because the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.030" end="00:18:36.240" style="s2">like machinery of a new structure is</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.680" end="00:18:38.790" style="s2">very intricate and it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.240" end="00:18:42.810" style="s2">to translate into you know slogan</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.790" end="00:18:45.720" style="s2">shouted in the streets I think that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.810" end="00:18:47.460" style="s2">know the Yellow Jackets and France were</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:50.400" style="s2">an interesting example of that fizzling</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.430" end="00:18:56.310" style="s2">protests were quite serious quite well</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:18:58.770" style="s2">organized and the French government</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.310" end="00:19:03.720" style="s2">essentially ignored it or dispersed the</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.770" end="00:19:08.340" style="s2">protests as such they have no strong</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.720" end="00:19:10.440" style="s2">support in the French state itself so</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.340" end="00:19:12.210" style="s2">the result is that it&#39;s mostly fizzling</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.440" end="00:19:14.160" style="s2">now and their complaints they&#39;re very</p>

<p begin="00:20:28.000" end="00:20:32.620" style="s2">dysfunctional compromise and today you</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.210" end="00:20:34.600" style="s2">know Bosnia is less economically</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.620" end="00:20:37.450" style="s2">developed in either Serbia or Croatia</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.600" end="00:20:42.750" style="s2">and has higher rates of corruption and</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.450" end="00:20:45.460" style="s2">shorter lifespans and so on if Spain</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.750" end="00:20:47.830" style="s2">acquires a federalist structure of some</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.460" end="00:20:49.930" style="s2">kind where there&#39;s autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.830" end="00:20:52.950" style="s2">self-governance along these religious</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.930" end="00:20:55.090" style="s2">communities as are these uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.950" end="00:20:56.650" style="s2">national communities they&#39;re all you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.090" end="00:20:58.420" style="s2">know they&#39;re mostly Catholic right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.650" end="00:21:00.580" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same situation as in Bosnia</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.420" end="00:21:04.060" style="s2">where people the nationalities match up</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.580" end="00:21:05.740" style="s2">with the religion right where you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.060" end="00:21:07.750" style="s2">in Bosnia if you&#39;re if you&#39;re Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.740" end="00:21:09.100" style="s2">you ended up identifying a Serbian if</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.750" end="00:21:10.990" style="s2">you were Catholic or from Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.100" end="00:21:13.210" style="s2">family ended up identifying an equation</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.990" end="00:21:14.950" style="s2">and if you were must them while you</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.210" end="00:21:16.840" style="s2">identified as Muslim even though that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.950" end="00:21:18.790" style="s2">not you know proper nationality in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.840" end="00:21:20.740" style="s2">classical sense and you still were</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.790" end="00:21:22.210" style="s2">speaking in fact a Slavic language and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.740" end="00:21:23.560" style="s2">basically the same Slavic language is</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.210" end="00:21:26.230" style="s2">the Croatian of them the Serbians for</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.560" end="00:21:28.750" style="s2">speaking that&#39;s a stronger analogue to</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.230" end="00:21:32.530" style="s2">say perhaps northern island Ireland and</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.750" end="00:21:34.240" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in Spain is these</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.530" end="00:21:36.040" style="s2">languages are legitimately different</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.240" end="00:21:41.560" style="s2">especially say the Basque language is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.040" end="00:21:43.450" style="s2">not even a Romance language but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.560" end="00:21:45.190" style="s2">reason why I expect that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.450" end="00:21:46.990" style="s2">positive potential there is because</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.190" end="00:21:49.000" style="s2">there are multiple important cities</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.990" end="00:21:51.400" style="s2">there&#39;s not just Madrid there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.000" end="00:21:55.600" style="s2">Barcelona there multiple different</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.400" end="00:21:57.880" style="s2">economies there right and once you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.600" end="00:22:00.010" style="s2">have a political economy that&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.880" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">suited to the natural conditions of an</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.010" end="00:22:06.820" style="s2">area and if security is not compromised</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:10.060" style="s2">that might result in notably better</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.820" end="00:22:12.550" style="s2">government locally so again Spain has</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.060" end="00:22:14.830" style="s2">positive potential I think Britain has</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.550" end="00:22:17.380" style="s2">positive potential it&#39;s not actualizing</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.830" end="00:22:19.060" style="s2">it but because Britain will be now</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.380" end="00:22:20.800" style="s2">forced to do something that&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.060" end="00:22:22.930" style="s2">than what the rest of the European Union</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.800" end="00:22:25.210" style="s2">is doing I&#39;m hoping it becomes more</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.930" end="00:22:26.730" style="s2">creative rather than less so instead of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.210" end="00:22:28.830" style="s2">converging with the US</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.730" end="00:22:30.299" style="s2">instead of converging with Europe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.830" end="00:22:32.610" style="s2">going to look at Europe and be like</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.299" end="00:22:35.040" style="s2">while we&#39;re distinct we haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.610" end="00:22:36.620" style="s2">decided what it means to be distinct but</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.040" end="00:22:39.570" style="s2">let&#39;s try to do a few things differently</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.620" end="00:22:42.419" style="s2">the key reason I&#39;m less optimistic about</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.570" end="00:22:44.520" style="s2">Britain than about Spain is that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.419" end="00:22:46.410" style="s2">urban centers where elites live and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.520" end="00:22:49.049" style="s2">institutions live are more concentrated</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.410" end="00:22:51.179" style="s2">in Britain than they are in Spain in</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.049" end="00:22:54.299" style="s2">Britain it&#39;s basically just London its</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.179" end="00:22:57.000" style="s2">London and the rest well whenever it&#39;s X</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.299" end="00:22:59.370" style="s2">and the rest it means the rest are an</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.000" end="00:23:02.480" style="s2">amalgamation and don&#39;t necessarily have</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.370" end="00:23:05.130" style="s2">common interests or common resources or</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.480" end="00:23:07.410" style="s2">common organization or common social</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.130" end="00:23:07.740" style="s2">circles to be able to pull their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.410" end="00:23:11.280" style="s2">weight</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.740" end="00:23:13.049" style="s2">now I know let&#39;s say pull their own side</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.280" end="00:23:14.580" style="s2">of the tug of war that&#39;s better because</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.049" end="00:23:17.070" style="s2">pull their own weight already implies</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.580" end="00:23:18.540" style="s2">this strange sort of economic</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.070" end="00:23:21.660" style="s2">self-sufficiency that&#39;s not clear that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.540" end="00:23:24.570" style="s2">exists anywhere today I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.660" end="00:23:28.500" style="s2">optimistic about the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.570" end="00:23:29.880" style="s2">trajectory of Poland I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.500" end="00:23:31.410" style="s2">whether that&#39;s I think that&#39;s a state</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.880" end="00:23:34.110" style="s2">that&#39;s becoming a highly functional</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.410" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">centralized state so again it has some</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.110" end="00:23:38.460" style="s2">possibility of multiple large cities so</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:40.740" style="s2">if I were to look around the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.460" end="00:23:43.350" style="s2">beyond Europe I think in the u.s. I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.740" end="00:23:45.090" style="s2">not seeing that much evidence of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.350" end="00:23:47.880" style="s2">governmental reform in the near future</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.090" end="00:23:50.520" style="s2">or even populist movements that could</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.880" end="00:23:53.820" style="s2">have any sort of things sort of impact</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.520" end="00:23:57.480" style="s2">for popular movements I think there is</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.820" end="00:24:00.030" style="s2">some possibility for positive change in</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.480" end="00:24:04.020" style="s2">South Asia in particular in Southeast</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.030" end="00:24:07.200" style="s2">Asia I suspect that there is positive</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.020" end="00:24:10.740" style="s2">change possibly open even in a place</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.200" end="00:24:15.059" style="s2">like Hong Kong despite everything I do</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.740" end="00:24:17.700" style="s2">think that in the aftermath of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.059" end="00:24:20.100" style="s2">Kovach crisis the status quo is</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.700" end="00:24:22.799" style="s2">preserved and the status quo allows for</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.100" end="00:24:25.049" style="s2">some local government and as the rest of</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.799" end="00:24:27.419" style="s2">China becomes wealthier if Hong Kong</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.049" end="00:24:30.450" style="s2">wishes to remain distinct but still part</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.419" end="00:24:32.130" style="s2">of China it has to find something</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.450" end="00:24:34.559" style="s2">structurally different from what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.130" end="00:24:36.720" style="s2">offering now and there was a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.559" end="00:24:39.270" style="s2">energy there but very little</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.720" end="00:24:40.650" style="s2">institutional support right but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.270" end="00:24:43.980" style="s2">energy was definitely there</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.650" end="00:24:46.680" style="s2">for something different now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.980" end="00:24:48.270" style="s2">condoning or condemning anything that</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.680" end="00:24:50.460" style="s2">happened in the protest I&#39;m just noting</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.270" end="00:24:51.630" style="s2">the raw energy level where the energy</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.460" end="00:24:54.630" style="s2">level is best thought of as a function</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.630" end="00:24:57.240" style="s2">of a politically engaged populace Plus</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.630" end="00:24:59.130" style="s2">grassroots organizing plus the resources</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.240" end="00:25:01.290" style="s2">to enable grassroots organizing so</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.130" end="00:25:04.260" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of what generated this list</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.290" end="00:25:06.510" style="s2">so Spain Britain maybe Hong Kong</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.260" end="00:25:08.160" style="s2">maybe Poland the Poland seems more</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.510" end="00:25:15.450" style="s2">functional centralized rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.160" end="00:25:20.130" style="s2">functional decentralized I think that if</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.450" end="00:25:22.380" style="s2">I if I if there were more of a civil</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.130" end="00:25:23.790" style="s2">society in Saudi Arabia that could</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.380" end="00:25:26.850" style="s2">actually become a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.790" end="00:25:29.460" style="s2">society post-oil but I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.850" end="00:25:33.150" style="s2">will be so all these interesting</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.460" end="00:25:34.920" style="s2">governance experiments where possibly</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.150" end="00:25:35.340" style="s2">could see a different political economy</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.920" end="00:25:37.710" style="s2">emerge</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.340" end="00:25:39.420" style="s2">I&#39;m already presuming they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.710" end="00:25:42.780" style="s2">rich and I&#39;m presuming they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.420" end="00:25:44.790" style="s2">rich or at least be large if not rich in</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.780" end="00:25:47.070" style="s2">order to not be immediately integrated</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.790" end="00:25:49.080" style="s2">into whatever new system exists locally</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.070" end="00:25:51.929" style="s2">right if you&#39;re experimenting with a</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.080" end="00:25:53.929" style="s2">different socio-economic stack it has to</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.929" end="00:25:56.790" style="s2">be it has to have the economies of scale</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.929" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">to at least be capable of being a viable</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.790" end="00:26:00.270" style="s2">alternative to whatever the prevailing</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:02.160" style="s2">paradigm is now whether it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.270" end="00:26:04.700" style="s2">know Chinese capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.160" end="00:26:07.710" style="s2">european-style welfare market stuff or</p>

<p begin="00:26:41.580" end="00:26:45.179" style="s2">great job and I guess what just to carry</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.710" end="00:26:46.980" style="s2">on with what you were saying you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.179" end="00:26:48.810" style="s2">be large enough I guess one of the one</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.980" end="00:26:51.150" style="s2">of the models that was quite unusual is</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.810" end="00:26:52.950" style="s2">the role hava through a java movement I</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.150" end="00:26:54.240" style="s2">guess and the Kurds that they were</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.240" end="00:27:00.180" style="s2">libertarian socialist sort of democratic</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.330" end="00:27:01.590" style="s2">confederalism with citizen assemblies</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.180" end="00:27:02.940" style="s2">and people&#39;s assemblies and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.590" end="00:27:04.680" style="s2">that and they&#39;ve been kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.940" end="00:27:07.290" style="s2">inspiration for a lot of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.680" end="00:27:09.030" style="s2">igni mottos and in Spain and many of its</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.290" end="00:27:12.060" style="s2">movements around the world and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.030" end="00:27:13.410" style="s2">guessing they&#39;re they don&#39;t have a lot</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.060" end="00:27:16.110" style="s2">of potential because they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.410" end="00:27:18.320" style="s2">that they don&#39;t have that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.110" end="00:27:21.390" style="s2">have that much weight so they&#39;re there</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.320" end="00:27:23.400" style="s2">they they get influenced too much by the</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.390" end="00:27:26.550" style="s2">forces around them is that is that your</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.400" end="00:27:28.560" style="s2">analysis there oh yeah and note that for</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.550" end="00:27:31.110" style="s2">the Kurds themselves well you know they</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.560" end="00:27:35.010" style="s2">have impressive organization impressive</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.110" end="00:27:37.350" style="s2">military capacity a very good method of</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.010" end="00:27:41.310" style="s2">using the oil money to Jenner to</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.350" end="00:27:43.800" style="s2">generate some prosperity they managed to</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.310" end="00:27:46.020" style="s2">go as far as they could because of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.800" end="00:27:48.630" style="s2">geopolitical circumstance right of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.020" end="00:27:50.670" style="s2">collapsing Iraq of a failing Syria of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.630" end="00:27:53.130" style="s2">failing Syria that was pushed by the US</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.670" end="00:27:55.110" style="s2">as well and they have very potent</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.130" end="00:27:56.460" style="s2">enemies right they haven&#39;t made much</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.110" end="00:27:59.040" style="s2">progress in say Turkey</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.460" end="00:28:02.490" style="s2">even though arguably Kurds are the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.040" end="00:28:05.460" style="s2">oppressed in Turkey right Isis was worse</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.490" end="00:28:06.960" style="s2">than than that but Turkey is definitely</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.460" end="00:28:10.110" style="s2">worse than say the secular Syrian</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.960" end="00:28:13.490" style="s2">government or the current set up in Iraq</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.110" end="00:28:15.660" style="s2">or even their situation in Iran honestly</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.490" end="00:28:17.610" style="s2">you know the work for the Kurdish</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.660" end="00:28:21.720" style="s2">Workers Party and so on and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.610" end="00:28:23.730" style="s2">that so there are geopolitical</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.720" end="00:28:26.160" style="s2">circumstances where you can exist on the</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.730" end="00:28:28.410" style="s2">border of multiple systems arguably</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.160" end="00:28:31.170" style="s2">Singapore&#39;s initial prosperity and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.410" end="00:28:34.470" style="s2">viability as a city state a city state</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.170" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">in an era of industrial Titans only</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.470" end="00:28:37.890" style="s2">happened you know this was the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:39.960" style="s2">century right like the Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.890" end="00:28:41.820" style="s2">China the United States these are</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.960" end="00:28:45.150" style="s2">industrial behemoth these are like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.820" end="00:28:47.040" style="s2">kind of you know leviathans that won</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.150" end="00:28:49.380" style="s2">World War two or lost World War two</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.040" end="00:28:52.080" style="s2">right some of them lost some of them won</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.380" end="00:28:55.170" style="s2">these are not city-states and Singapore</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.080" end="00:28:56.580" style="s2">could exist because of the Cold War I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.170" end="00:28:57.720" style="s2">just gonna propose that it would not</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.580" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">have developed as an independent</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.720" end="00:29:03.300" style="s2">fragment and even then Singapore is</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:05.100" style="s2">deeply is both deeply so to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.300" end="00:29:07.410" style="s2">compatible with the Anglosphere and</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.100" end="00:29:08.070" style="s2">angles for commercial and cultural norms</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.410" end="00:29:09.900" style="s2">he</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.070" end="00:29:14.010" style="s2">if it takes its own political approach</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.900" end="00:29:16.710" style="s2">that&#39;s again like this kind of very</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.010" end="00:29:20.670" style="s2">civil service very executive branch</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.710" end="00:29:22.530" style="s2">oriented city government so yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.670" end="00:29:25.470" style="s2">that&#39;s what I say you can actually have</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.530" end="00:29:27.180" style="s2">a smaller or poorer country succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.470" end="00:29:29.580" style="s2">this but they have to have very</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.180" end="00:29:31.290" style="s2">favorable geopolitical conditions where</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.580" end="00:29:34.140" style="s2">the great powers are balanced against</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.290" end="00:29:35.730" style="s2">each other in some way so in a way you</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.140" end="00:29:38.580" style="s2">know what we&#39;re returning to a</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.730" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2">multipolar world with China and the u.s.</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:42.720" style="s2">like China in the US will remain the</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:45.110" style="s2">world&#39;s number one and number two</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.720" end="00:29:47.340" style="s2">economy probably for the rest of my life</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.110" end="00:29:49.140" style="s2">so this actually means that on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.340" end="00:29:50.730" style="s2">border between the two and their spheres</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.140" end="00:29:53.220" style="s2">of influence that&#39;s where I would also</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.730" end="00:29:55.620" style="s2">look for interesting experiments and new</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.220" end="00:29:56.760" style="s2">political economies and governments not</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.620" end="00:29:59.310" style="s2">because they&#39;re strong enough to</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.760" end="00:30:01.380" style="s2">challenge either China or the US or to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.310" end="00:30:02.820" style="s2">rip off all their influence but because</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.380" end="00:30:05.490" style="s2">they can balance them in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.820" end="00:30:08.010" style="s2">local uniqueness persists and can be</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.490" end="00:30:11.370" style="s2">even further developed to new prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.010" end="00:30:14.370" style="s2">or better ecological balance or more</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.370" end="00:30:15.030" style="s2">social cohesion or higher higher</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.370" end="00:30:18.480" style="s2">happiness</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.030" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">honestly like these are goals beyond</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.480" end="00:30:22.440" style="s2">just economic ones adjusted some size of</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:24.810" style="s2">economy isn&#39;t an industrial era</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.440" end="00:30:26.520" style="s2">necessary to maintain independence I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.810" end="00:30:31.020" style="s2">not saying that the economic growth is</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.520" end="00:30:35.940" style="s2">in itself a name to itself thank you</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.020" end="00:30:42.210" style="s2">very much I&#39;m very happy to take more</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.940" end="00:30:43.380" style="s2">questions and I think something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.210" end="00:30:45.810" style="s2">showing up in what you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.380" end="00:30:48.390" style="s2">and it seems to be a theme with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.810" end="00:30:53.340" style="s2">your work is how different institutions</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.390" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">operate at different scales and if so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.340" end="00:30:59.280" style="s2">mean I think my question is like what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.760" end="00:31:01.710" style="s2">the rule of scale in the ability for</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.280" end="00:31:04.850" style="s2">institutions to change over time and</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.710" end="00:31:11.950" style="s2">become more regionally effective</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.850" end="00:31:13.910" style="s2">I think scale is always a matter of well</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.950" end="00:31:15.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a very serious</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.910" end="00:31:18.260" style="s2">principle that&#39;s also a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.740" end="00:31:20.840" style="s2">joke that people are always promoted to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.260" end="00:31:23.390" style="s2">the level of their incompetence I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.840" end="00:31:26.690" style="s2">institutions always scale beyond where</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.390" end="00:31:29.480" style="s2">they work best they overshoot right so</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.690" end="00:31:31.310" style="s2">the largest extent of the Roman Empire</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.480" end="00:31:33.380" style="s2">isn&#39;t when the Roman Empire is working</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.310" end="00:31:35.810" style="s2">best it&#39;s when all of the investments</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.380" end="00:31:37.970" style="s2">from when it was working best come in</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.810" end="00:31:41.000" style="s2">when that harvest is in of that seed</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.970" end="00:31:42.680" style="s2">corn that was planted long ago and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.000" end="00:31:44.360" style="s2">think the same happened with the u.s. I</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.680" end="00:31:47.990" style="s2">don&#39;t think the u.s. worked the best</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.360" end="00:31:51.620" style="s2">ever in 1991 but 1991 was probably the</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.990" end="00:31:54.350" style="s2">zenith of its global influence and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.620" end="00:31:55.850" style="s2">similarly I think for non-state</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.350" end="00:31:57.020" style="s2">organizations such as the Catholic</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.850" end="00:31:58.820" style="s2">Church of we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.020" end="00:32:01.540" style="s2">large-scale stuff it&#39;s like you know 1</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.820" end="00:32:04.100" style="s2">billion believers at least in theory and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.540" end="00:32:06.740" style="s2">representatives everywhere and almost</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.100" end="00:32:08.540" style="s2">Peres States status right observers in</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.740" end="00:32:10.700" style="s2">the United Nations with embassies around</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.540" end="00:32:14.000" style="s2">the world the ability to set their own</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.700" end="00:32:16.400" style="s2">laws and all of that arguably</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.000" end="00:32:18.800" style="s2">overshooting what is optimally needed</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.400" end="00:32:23.420" style="s2">for the preservation of a particular</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.800" end="00:32:26.570" style="s2">religious teaching so I think it&#39;s often</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.420" end="00:32:30.260" style="s2">the case that as you scale from</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.570" end="00:32:33.070" style="s2">individual to small group to distributed</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.260" end="00:32:35.690" style="s2">group to hierarchical group to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.070" end="00:32:37.820" style="s2">coalition&#39;s of hierarchical and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.690" end="00:32:41.120" style="s2">distributed groups to coalition&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.820" end="00:32:43.700" style="s2">those two systems and coordination</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.120" end="00:32:45.350" style="s2">protocols at the final level when</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.700" end="00:32:47.560" style="s2">there&#39;s not even any organizational</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.350" end="00:32:50.060" style="s2">connection it&#39;s just an alliance of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.560" end="00:32:52.340" style="s2">organizations individuals that do things</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.060" end="00:32:55.730" style="s2">the same way the right way and ourself</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.340" end="00:32:57.890" style="s2">reflectively you know collaborating on</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.730" end="00:33:03.260" style="s2">extending that terraforming process on</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.890" end="00:33:05.890" style="s2">the world there is a way in which the</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.260" end="00:33:08.390" style="s2">later stages harness the previous stages</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.890" end="00:33:10.910" style="s2">right so the resources are accumulated</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.390" end="00:33:14.300" style="s2">by a previous stage might then be used</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.910" end="00:33:17.180" style="s2">by a different or new stage of social</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.300" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">technology so the kind of accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.180" end="00:33:21.080" style="s2">you might see</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:23.480" style="s2">arising out of a priestly class in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.080" end="00:33:26.330" style="s2">ancient agricultural world may then be</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.480" end="00:33:28.820" style="s2">used to fund an army or build walls</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.820" end="00:33:32.990" style="s2">residential areas and then suddenly what</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.399" end="00:33:35.630" style="s2">used to be this kind of religious</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.990" end="00:33:36.890" style="s2">ceremonial site has acquired the capital</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.630" end="00:33:39.950" style="s2">that is used by a different social</p>

<p begin="00:41:13.460" end="00:41:19.160" style="s2">somewhat you know people might focus on</p>

<p begin="00:42:31.600" end="00:42:35.920" style="s2">it&#39;s that enough people check into the</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.870" end="00:43:02.500" style="s2">to fake right and I think that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.460" end="00:43:05.020" style="s2">direct casual culture of citizen</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.500" end="00:43:07.930" style="s2">interest in the true fundamentals of</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.020" end="00:43:10.030" style="s2">government and governance is very tricky</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.930" end="00:43:12.520" style="s2">and difficult to maintain I think we</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.030" end="00:43:14.080" style="s2">don&#39;t have it because it very naturally</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.520" end="00:43:16.570" style="s2">gets displaced by debates about</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.080" end="00:43:19.390" style="s2">personality and debates about the new</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.570" end="00:43:21.130" style="s2">cycle and the new cycle chains you to a</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.390" end="00:43:22.870" style="s2">memory that from a historical</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.130" end="00:43:24.910" style="s2">perspective might as well be goldfish</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.870" end="00:43:27.460" style="s2">memory you don&#39;t remember what happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.910" end="00:43:28.870" style="s2">three months ago like to the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.460" end="00:43:30.970" style="s2">approximation I think people do not</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.870" end="00:43:31.990" style="s2">remember what was politically relevant</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.970" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">three months ago</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.990" end="00:43:38.650" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s really it&#39;s terrible</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:41.130" style="s2">right so to try to restate everything</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.650" end="00:43:43.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve said in like a neat concise part</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.130" end="00:43:46.570" style="s2">government has to be relatively simple</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.230" end="00:43:48.610" style="s2">it has to be incentivized towards</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.570" end="00:43:50.110" style="s2">honesty and the personal social</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.610" end="00:43:51.460" style="s2">incentives of the people in government</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.110" end="00:43:53.490" style="s2">have to be aligned with this</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.460" end="00:43:56.530" style="s2">institutional incentive honesty and</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.490" end="00:43:58.990" style="s2">finally there has to be enough of a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.530" end="00:44:01.690" style="s2">leisure class that people just as a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.990" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">hobby go and think about institutions</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.690" end="00:44:06.520" style="s2">and then talk about it relatively freely</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.910" end="00:44:14.170" style="s2">and then this can be implemented in many</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.520" end="00:44:17.890" style="s2">different ways do you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.170" end="00:44:19.930" style="s2">something like that Jubilee or ubi might</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.890" end="00:44:22.860" style="s2">create the possibility for a leisure</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.930" end="00:44:25.300" style="s2">class to emerge within like a complex</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.860" end="00:44:27.670" style="s2">society like the United States that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.300" end="00:44:31.900" style="s2">would maybe create the possibility for a</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.670" end="00:44:33.880" style="s2">citizen on kind of interest in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.900" end="00:44:39.610" style="s2">functioning of governance that might</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.880" end="00:44:42.250" style="s2">create a new incentive structure yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.610" end="00:44:44.350" style="s2">think that a debt Jubilee is the better</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.250" end="00:44:47.170" style="s2">approach because I think ubi is</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.350" end="00:44:51.190" style="s2">something that it&#39;s it&#39;s very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.170" end="00:44:52.720" style="s2">to be poor so if you gave the poor more</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.190" end="00:44:54.610" style="s2">money on their bank account it helps</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.720" end="00:44:56.350" style="s2">them as individuals but over time it</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.610" end="00:44:59.050" style="s2">just incentivizes everyone to make it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.350" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">even more expensive to be poor so in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.050" end="00:45:06.490" style="s2">weird way if say you are living in San</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:08.320" style="s2">Francisco and you know there&#39;s massive</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.490" end="00:45:12.490" style="s2">demand to live in San Francisco and</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.320" end="00:45:16.300" style="s2">you&#39;ve added to everyone&#39;s bank accounts</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.490" end="00:45:17.980" style="s2">$1,000 a month for example it just means</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.300" end="00:45:19.720" style="s2">the rents go up in San Francisco</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.980" end="00:45:21.580" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t actually help anyone live in</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.720" end="00:45:24.520" style="s2">San Francisco and access the economic</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.580" end="00:45:26.530" style="s2">activities of San Francisco now on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.520" end="00:45:29.290" style="s2">margin this might not be true of like</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.530" end="00:45:30.910" style="s2">you know a city where the supply of</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.290" end="00:45:36.370" style="s2">housing and the demand for housing are</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.910" end="00:45:39.280" style="s2">more balanced and I also think that the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.370" end="00:45:42.040" style="s2">health costs would rise to take</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:44.620" style="s2">advantage of this because currently I</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.040" end="00:45:47.010" style="s2">think the I&#39;m grossly simplifying so</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.620" end="00:45:50.740" style="s2">please forgive this gross simplification</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.010" end="00:45:54.070" style="s2">the the health care system in the US</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.740" end="00:45:55.990" style="s2">legally obliges various private entities</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.070" end="00:45:59.410" style="s2">to take care of the poor so if you give</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.990" end="00:46:00.970" style="s2">the poor more money well they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.410" end="00:46:02.620" style="s2">gonna charge them more they&#39;re legally</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.970" end="00:46:04.110" style="s2">obliged to provide them service whether</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.620" end="00:46:06.640" style="s2">or not they&#39;re charging them more and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.110" end="00:46:10.000" style="s2">that can eat up a significant chunk of</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.640" end="00:46:12.340" style="s2">the ubi as well meanwhile debt debt on</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.000" end="00:46:13.330" style="s2">the other hand is much better because in</p>

<p begin="00:47:20.730" end="00:47:25.980" style="s2">are primarily held down by rent I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.369" end="00:47:28.859" style="s2">that&#39;s what UVI achieves but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.980" end="00:47:30.300" style="s2">alleviate the plight of the old very</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.300" end="00:47:36.660" style="s2">people with medical conditions people</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.000" end="00:47:39.540" style="s2">with frankly also addictions mental</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.660" end="00:47:42.570" style="s2">health issues right like the social</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.540" end="00:47:45.060" style="s2">disaster related to the opioid crisis</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.570" end="00:47:47.190" style="s2">and basically casual use of uppers and</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.060" end="00:47:50.220" style="s2">downers in all parts of American society</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.190" end="00:47:52.170" style="s2">to manage mood you know either legal or</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.220" end="00:47:54.900" style="s2">illegal so here I&#39;m not actually making</p>

<p begin="00:47:54.900" end="00:48:00.869" style="s2">or wheat and heroine or alcohol or</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.589" end="00:48:03.930" style="s2">tobacco and all of this it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.869" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">fact that people are using a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.930" end="00:48:08.760" style="s2">their discretionary spending to regulate</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.680" style="s2">their own move and this sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.760" end="00:48:12.599" style="s2">produces addictions which are complex</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.680" end="00:48:15.109" style="s2">social and biological phenomena so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.599" end="00:48:17.339" style="s2">not really that straightforward and</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.109" end="00:48:19.170" style="s2">these addictions then produce health</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.339" end="00:48:21.150" style="s2">side effects with needs which need to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.170" end="00:48:26.900" style="s2">treated which are super expensive to</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.150" end="00:48:30.089" style="s2">treat so I think there it produces then</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.900" end="00:48:32.910" style="s2">a class of people who are young</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.089" end="00:48:34.920" style="s2">relatively healthy not depressed who</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.910" end="00:48:36.710" style="s2">couldn&#39;t afford rent in a third-tier</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.710" end="00:48:41.190" style="s2">third-tier City I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.000" end="00:48:43.560" style="s2">insufficient to be a leisure class at a</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.190" end="00:48:45.720" style="s2">high enough level of education on the</p>

<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:51.660" style="s2">can prevent people from being downwardly</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.670" end="00:48:55.320" style="s2">mobile and can also help people at least</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.660" end="00:48:59.340" style="s2">have more shot more shots at something</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.320" end="00:49:01.680" style="s2">like a good life in particular I would</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.340" end="00:49:06.330" style="s2">be bullish for the following proposal a</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.680" end="00:49:08.640" style="s2">full Jubilee on student debt just full</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.330" end="00:49:10.560" style="s2">cancellation of student debt and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.640" end="00:49:12.600" style="s2">know if you have to if you have to</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.560" end="00:49:14.280" style="s2">confiscate some endowments just to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.600" end="00:49:16.530" style="s2">it sure that the universities don&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.280" end="00:49:18.630" style="s2">double down and continue gobbling up all</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.530" end="00:49:20.370" style="s2">the money that seems fine to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.630" end="00:49:23.010" style="s2">and this is in a class of people that</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.370" end="00:49:24.480" style="s2">has tried to educate themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.010" end="00:49:26.280" style="s2">were either helped or not helped by the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.480" end="00:49:27.420" style="s2">universities and they suddenly find</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.280" end="00:49:29.700" style="s2">themselves free again</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.420" end="00:49:31.530" style="s2">so that that I would think is the best</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.700" end="00:49:34.620" style="s2">single intervention I can think of in</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.530" end="00:49:43.830" style="s2">that space for having there be a leisure</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.620" end="00:49:46.170" style="s2">class that can reflect on society yeah</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.830" end="00:49:49.710" style="s2">yeah sure some of it was I guess</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.170" end="00:49:53.280" style="s2">answered there so I guess in addition to</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.710" end="00:49:54.840" style="s2">a depth Jubilee and and it and I and I I</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.280" end="00:49:56.520" style="s2">think there&#39;s some issues with the ubi</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.840" end="00:49:58.680" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s just insufficient i I</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.520" end="00:50:00.570" style="s2">agree with you it&#39;s really only deep not</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.680" end="00:50:02.520" style="s2">by the other systems is my point right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.570" end="00:50:08.580" style="s2">yeah it needs other things and it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.520" end="00:50:11.580" style="s2">perhaps needs more stuff let&#39;s see my</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.580" end="00:50:14.820" style="s2">question up there ok there is yes so</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.580" end="00:50:17.670" style="s2">what about as far as increasing the size</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.820" end="00:50:19.410" style="s2">of this leisure class I mean I have some</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.670" end="00:50:21.030" style="s2">issues with the with the term leisure</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.410" end="00:50:22.730" style="s2">because there was I forget who wrote it</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.030" end="00:50:26.490" style="s2">there was a book written in the late</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.730" end="00:50:28.740" style="s2">19th century about the leisure class and</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.490" end="00:50:30.180" style="s2">it&#39;s oh yeah that has it in a different</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.740" end="00:50:32.700" style="s2">term I kind of used it more in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.180" end="00:50:33.900" style="s2">Aristotelian sense of leisure ok yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.700" end="00:50:36.060" style="s2">because he&#39;s using it more in this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.900" end="00:50:38.670" style="s2">elitist you know like the leisure class</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.060" end="00:50:41.040" style="s2">was is the elitist class and that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.670" end="00:50:44.820" style="s2">power elite I&#39;m just proposing you have</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.040" end="00:50:47.010" style="s2">unstructured time to pursue on your own</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.820" end="00:50:49.050" style="s2">initiative and interest intellectual and</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.010" end="00:50:52.140" style="s2">physical self perfection and improvement</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.050" end="00:50:54.630" style="s2">right let&#39;s say they&#39;re Sicilian yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.140" end="00:50:58.410" style="s2">yeah which I&#39;m far more Greek than I am</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.630" end="00:51:03.750" style="s2">you know in philosophy than I am</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.410" end="00:51:05.640" style="s2">in that other sense so I guess that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.750" end="00:51:07.260" style="s2">whole funding you know how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.640" end="00:51:09.210" style="s2">you financially support people as we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.260" end="00:51:11.400" style="s2">moving into this audit automated work</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.210" end="00:51:12.960" style="s2">this automated workplace where the whole</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.400" end="00:51:14.790" style="s2">goal of automation is to get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.960" end="00:51:16.890" style="s2">people right so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.790" end="00:51:20.310" style="s2">problem we have to you have to face but</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.890" end="00:51:23.550" style="s2">citizens assemblies based on sortition I</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.310" end="00:51:26.460" style="s2">think is a very key a key part I think</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.550" end="00:51:28.560" style="s2">in building up this this Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.460" end="00:51:32.430" style="s2">leisure class because people would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.560" end="00:51:34.230" style="s2">motivated to educate themselves and and</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.430" end="00:51:38.610" style="s2">they would have power people would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.230" end="00:51:43.830" style="s2">chosen by jury from the populace to</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.610" end="00:51:46.200" style="s2">actually debate and discuss over-over</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.830" end="00:51:48.990" style="s2">issues and and actually pass real</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.200" end="00:51:51.300" style="s2">legislation I think that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.990" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">creating this leisure class I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.300" end="00:51:56.160" style="s2">know your point of view on that and I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:52:01.020" style="s2">also like to know what other ideas</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.160" end="00:52:03.630" style="s2">policies or practices or institutions</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.020" end="00:52:07.140" style="s2">you think would help to strengthen and</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.630" end="00:52:12.780" style="s2">broaden this this leisure class that</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.140" end="00:52:14.640" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking up yeah I think that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.780" end="00:52:16.370" style="s2">assuming that for the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.640" end="00:52:19.680" style="s2">government oversight was the initial</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.370" end="00:52:22.230" style="s2">notion where it&#39;s enough to only have</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.680" end="00:52:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s enough to have many many people</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.230" end="00:52:25.320" style="s2">looking at different aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.760" end="00:52:27.000" style="s2">government and actually understanding</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.320" end="00:52:29.370" style="s2">them ideally participating in them</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.000" end="00:52:31.110" style="s2">doesn&#39;t require absolutely everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.370" end="00:52:33.930" style="s2">do this it&#39;s of course positive if</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.110" end="00:52:35.610" style="s2">absolutely everyone can have leisure but</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.930" end="00:52:37.740" style="s2">just from a structural perspective it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.610" end="00:52:40.140" style="s2">not actually it&#39;s not a necessity for</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.740" end="00:52:41.640" style="s2">that goal so the previous one discovered</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.140" end="00:52:45.450" style="s2">and describing like institutional</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.640" end="00:52:48.210" style="s2">excellence I do think that the positive</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.450" end="00:52:51.210" style="s2">role of time of play or time of</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.210" end="00:52:54.060" style="s2">education and so on interspersed with</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.210" end="00:52:56.610" style="s2">civic activity is very close to say the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.060" end="00:52:58.080" style="s2">ideal of otm which was a term that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.610" end="00:52:59.820" style="s2">know the Romans used for this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.080" end="00:53:01.350" style="s2">leisure which was the idea that you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.820" end="00:53:03.990" style="s2">the opportunity to both retreat from</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.350" end="00:53:05.850" style="s2">society and then return to participating</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.990" end="00:53:07.830" style="s2">in society because by retreating from</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.850" end="00:53:09.720" style="s2">society you have time to reflect on your</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.830" end="00:53:11.100" style="s2">own social environment you have time to</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.720" end="00:53:13.320" style="s2">like read books and so</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.100" end="00:53:16.980" style="s2">so it&#39;s not just that I&#39;m not obliged to</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.320" end="00:53:18.600" style="s2">go to work its I can in fact to take a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.980" end="00:53:22.470" style="s2">break from my normal social</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.600" end="00:53:24.450" style="s2">responsibilities but also I can return</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.470" end="00:53:26.340" style="s2">to my previous social responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.450" end="00:53:30.210" style="s2">at the bout the level of authority that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.340" end="00:53:32.940" style="s2">I had previously you&#39;ll be very there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.210" end="00:53:36.150" style="s2">a small element of this preserve in the</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.940" end="00:53:38.310" style="s2">academic sabbatical right imagine if you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.150" end="00:53:40.140" style="s2">could take economic or social</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.310" end="00:53:42.240" style="s2">sabbaticals in any position in society</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.140" end="00:53:43.920" style="s2">that would be very interesting there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.240" end="00:53:45.270" style="s2">certainly dysfunctional bearings of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.920" end="00:53:47.610" style="s2">one could implement but I also suspect</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.270" end="00:53:49.470" style="s2">you know very functional ones that would</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.610" end="00:53:51.870" style="s2">be difficult to abuse or would be abused</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.470" end="00:53:53.310" style="s2">in economically irrelevant ways a ways</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.870" end="00:53:56.340" style="s2">that like on the margin it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.310" end="00:54:01.230" style="s2">really matter if we you know are armed</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.340" end="00:54:04.110" style="s2">and really indulging them directly now I</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.230" end="00:54:06.030" style="s2">think here here&#39;s my contrarian position</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.110" end="00:54:08.520" style="s2">you know a lot of people imagine that in</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.030" end="00:54:11.160" style="s2">the future the robots do all the work</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.520" end="00:54:13.800" style="s2">and automation has fully replaced people</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.160" end="00:54:15.660" style="s2">I think we are farther away from that</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.800" end="00:54:18.750" style="s2">than we would like to imagine here I</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.660" end="00:54:20.480" style="s2">would cite a paper by Robin Hanson and</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.750" end="00:54:23.640" style="s2">unfortunately forget his co-author on</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.480" end="00:54:25.740" style="s2">the spread of automation where behave is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.640" end="00:54:28.170" style="s2">much more like a colonization wave in</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.740" end="00:54:30.030" style="s2">the sense that the areas that are best</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.170" end="00:54:31.980" style="s2">automated are the areas that are</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.030" end="00:54:34.290" style="s2">economically right adjacent to an</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.980" end="00:54:35.820" style="s2">already automated system so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.290" end="00:54:37.740" style="s2">like automation goes into areas that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.820" end="00:54:39.330" style="s2">were not automated at all and wipes out</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.740" end="00:54:42.030" style="s2">everyone it&#39;s more like automation like</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.330" end="00:54:45.300" style="s2">incrementally spreads like say like</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.030" end="00:54:47.010" style="s2">angle growth or like plant growth right</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.300" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">next to areas that are already automated</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.010" end="00:54:51.870" style="s2">the reason is it&#39;s much easier to teach</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.440" end="00:54:53.670" style="s2">which means how to work with machines</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.870" end="00:54:55.050" style="s2">than it is to teach machines how to work</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.670" end="00:54:57.180" style="s2">with people or teach people how to work</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.050" end="00:54:59.640" style="s2">with machines right so I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.180" end="00:55:02.700" style="s2">the underlying really basic reason and</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.640" end="00:55:04.980" style="s2">why I say you know a lot of people who</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.700" end="00:55:06.360" style="s2">liked Andrew yang they thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.980" end="00:55:08.630" style="s2">living in a totally different world</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.360" end="00:55:11.610" style="s2">where robots are popping up in fields</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.630" end="00:55:13.410" style="s2">that had never received any automation</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.610" end="00:55:15.960" style="s2">rather than there&#39;s an incremental</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.410" end="00:55:17.460" style="s2">advance of that frontier we have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.960" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">actually figure out what are people</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.460" end="00:55:23.160" style="s2">extremely good at because I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:24.300" style="s2">think there is a social structure or</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.160" end="00:55:28.920" style="s2">social technology</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.300" end="00:55:32.430" style="s2">that would allow us to reliably protect</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.920" end="00:55:36.680" style="s2">the rights and reliably keep decision</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.430" end="00:55:39.390" style="s2">relevant humans if humans have no</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.680" end="00:55:41.670" style="s2">irreplaceable function in so as soon as</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.390" end="00:55:44.850" style="s2">you can replace a human the political</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.670" end="00:55:46.890" style="s2">temptation exists to remove the human so</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.850" end="00:55:50.010" style="s2">if we find what people in particular</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.890" end="00:55:53.340" style="s2">with humans are very good at we then the</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.010" end="00:55:55.530" style="s2">leisure time to perfect that becomes an</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.340" end="00:55:58.170" style="s2">investment rather than a drain in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.530" end="00:56:01.080" style="s2">system and then it becomes politically</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.170" end="00:56:03.720" style="s2">harmful not because you&#39;re like so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.080" end="00:56:05.400" style="s2">know not you&#39;re not keeping you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.720" end="00:56:07.500" style="s2">keeping them leisured because you&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.400" end="00:56:09.000" style="s2">idealistic you&#39;re keeping them leisured</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.500" end="00:56:12.660" style="s2">because you have no choice but to keep</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.000" end="00:56:16.110" style="s2">them leisure or spending odium right</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.660" end="00:56:17.850" style="s2">odium in this way because they actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.110" end="00:56:20.460" style="s2">are just formidable enough to deny you</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.850" end="00:56:23.010" style="s2">this structurally important role in</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.460" end="00:56:25.260" style="s2">society and here&#39;s another one here&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.010" end="00:56:28.800" style="s2">interesting one I would propose we are</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.260" end="00:56:31.590" style="s2">nowhere near the optimal economic use of</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.800" end="00:56:33.900" style="s2">human beings and that we have in fact in</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.590" end="00:56:36.810" style="s2">many ways intentionally made them less</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.900" end="00:56:40.590" style="s2">useful and are relying on less efficient</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.810" end="00:56:42.330" style="s2">systems right so you know I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.590" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">examine the physical capabilities of</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.330" end="00:56:47.130" style="s2">humans or mental capabilities of humans</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:49.050" style="s2">in particular here there are many things</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.130" end="00:56:50.520" style="s2">we could be doing with a different</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.050" end="00:56:53.100" style="s2">social structure that would generate</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.520" end="00:56:56.040" style="s2">vast wealth or vast like you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.100" end="00:56:58.290" style="s2">knowledge value that we are not no one</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.040" end="00:57:01.500" style="s2">is going to convince me that the debt</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.290" end="00:57:03.390" style="s2">system is the correct way for us to deal</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.500" end="00:57:05.760" style="s2">with our most educated class of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.390" end="00:57:07.980" style="s2">where I actually view it as a control</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.760" end="00:57:10.080" style="s2">mechanism you know at first we don&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.980" end="00:57:11.940" style="s2">the masses into the universities now we</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.080" end="00:57:14.100" style="s2">let the masses into the universities ah</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.940" end="00:57:16.680" style="s2">but there&#39;s a trick you&#39;re now indebted</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.100" end="00:57:18.450" style="s2">so you&#39;re still not free right so I</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.680" end="00:57:21.230" style="s2">think that actually was an adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.450" end="00:57:23.580" style="s2">cybernetic response from the system</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.230" end="00:57:25.380" style="s2">shutting out this larger crowd of people</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.580" end="00:57:27.000" style="s2">from being necessary because if you make</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.380" end="00:57:30.390" style="s2">them necessary than their decision</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.000" end="00:57:33.540" style="s2">relevant right so I hope I hope this was</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.390" end="00:57:36.360" style="s2">not too they I actually speaking fairly</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.540" end="00:57:37.400" style="s2">precisely here so whenever I hear people</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.360" end="00:57:39.620" style="s2">propose</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.400" end="00:57:40.850" style="s2">with advancements in technology people</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.620" end="00:57:42.470" style="s2">won&#39;t be needed for the economy</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.850" end="00:57:45.710" style="s2">therefore we might as well treat them</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.470" end="00:57:47.330" style="s2">nicely I think we won&#39;t treat them</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.710" end="00:57:48.680" style="s2">nicely if they&#39;re not necessary for the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.330" end="00:57:51.260" style="s2">economy I think if you look at our</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.680" end="00:57:53.540" style="s2">economy we only treat nicely the people</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.260" end="00:57:55.970" style="s2">who are absolutely irreplaceable it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.540" end="00:57:59.120" style="s2">not like you know it&#39;s not like people</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.970" end="00:58:02.450" style="s2">really adore programmers as people right</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.120" end="00:58:03.980" style="s2">now or admire them that deeply it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.450" end="00:58:07.490" style="s2">that they happen to be economically</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.980" end="00:58:09.530" style="s2">replaceable so they are paid well those</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.490" end="00:58:12.740" style="s2">really the cities they live in are still</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.530" end="00:58:15.650" style="s2">kind of like not great true but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.740" end="00:58:17.120" style="s2">making a certain certain assumption in</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.650" end="00:58:19.550" style="s2">your analysis that we&#39;re sticking with</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.120" end="00:58:22.010" style="s2">the same ye&#39;ll neoclassical neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.550" end="00:58:24.020" style="s2">ideology oh I&#39;m gonna say it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.010" end="00:58:26.510" style="s2">beyond neoclassical neoliberal you do</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.020" end="00:58:28.190" style="s2">have equivalents things to this and say</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.510" end="00:58:29.540" style="s2">the feudal system right so like what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.190" end="00:58:31.670" style="s2">saying here it&#39;s more like it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.540" end="00:58:33.560" style="s2">like realpolitik rather than assuming</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.670" end="00:58:35.690" style="s2">that the competition is baked in it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.560" end="00:58:37.250" style="s2">more that if you want a non-competitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.690" end="00:58:39.110" style="s2">or a different system it just has to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.250" end="00:58:40.730" style="s2">politically more robust than the current</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.110" end="00:58:42.770" style="s2">model is that the current one that has</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.730" end="00:58:46.880" style="s2">to crumble away and yours is like</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.770" end="00:58:48.830" style="s2">winning on its own strengths right and I</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.880" end="00:58:50.690" style="s2">hope the point I&#39;m making about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.830" end="00:58:52.190" style="s2">feudal system is like not that the fuel</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.690" end="00:58:54.230" style="s2">system is amazing or even better than</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.190" end="00:58:55.970" style="s2">the current one in that regard I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.230" end="00:58:58.040" style="s2">saying that that system would also the</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.970" end="00:59:00.530" style="s2">logic also applies to that system not</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.040" end="00:59:02.660" style="s2">just this one so I&#39;m proposing this is</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.530" end="00:59:05.000" style="s2">like there&#39;s like a selection mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.660" end="00:59:06.170" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of happening on the metal</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.000" end="00:59:08.780" style="s2">level with the different social</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.170" end="00:59:09.920" style="s2">technologies at play in the world and if</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.780" end="00:59:12.500" style="s2">you actually need something that&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.920" end="00:59:15.710" style="s2">better not necessarily at strict</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.500" end="00:59:24.440" style="s2">material accumulation but at least rapid</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.710" end="00:59:26.600" style="s2">institutional adjustment okay now that</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.440" end="00:59:28.550" style="s2">really went into it but I don&#39;t get many</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.600" end="00:59:34.850" style="s2">opportunities to answer that question so</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.550" end="00:59:37.550" style="s2">I&#39;m very grateful for it and so I want</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.850" end="00:59:39.410" style="s2">to take note of the time but we do have</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.550" end="00:59:41.720" style="s2">an excellent question in the chat so I</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.410" end="00:59:43.280" style="s2">wanted to invite you to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.720" end="00:59:47.180" style="s2">question if you have the time if not</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.280" end="00:59:50.960" style="s2">that&#39;s totally fine we can wrap up to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.180" end="00:59:52.610" style="s2">happy to answer one more excellent Oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.960" end="00:59:58.280" style="s2">would you like to unmute yourself and</p>

<p begin="00:59:58.280" end="01:00:02.650" style="s2">much taking my question</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.330" end="01:00:05.720" style="s2">so the increasing role of the judiciary</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.650" end="01:00:08.630" style="s2">which you mentioned in creasing law</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.720" end="01:00:11.030" style="s2">isn&#39;t them since us equally Strasbourg</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.630" end="01:00:13.010" style="s2">Court or the ECHR which has had</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.030" end="01:00:15.080" style="s2">significant influence in law even in</p>

<p begin="01:00:15.080" end="01:00:20.210" style="s2">Russia and similarly Israel had a</p>

<p begin="01:00:20.210" end="01:00:25.370" style="s2">nineties which led to the High Court</p>

<p begin="01:00:34.280" end="01:00:38.030" style="s2">these developments as endogenous to the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.380" end="01:00:40.360" style="s2">territories in question do they</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.030" end="01:00:42.980" style="s2">originate from the American influence or</p>

<p begin="01:01:05.600" end="01:01:13.070" style="s2">a it&#39;s it&#39;s the answer is mixed some of</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.310" end="01:01:15.830" style="s2">these are in fact straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.070" end="01:01:17.720" style="s2">things that are a reflection of current</p>

<p begin="01:01:19.790" end="01:01:23.960" style="s2">think the growth of judiciary which has</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.920" end="01:01:26.690" style="s2">now been I think significantly curtailed</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.960" end="01:01:28.730" style="s2">recently was mostly an externally driven</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.690" end="01:01:30.830" style="s2">phenomena in Israel I think is mostly an</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.730" end="01:01:33.320" style="s2">internally griffon phenomena if you have</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.830" end="01:01:35.210" style="s2">a society that&#39;s very high in law where</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.320" end="01:01:37.790" style="s2">people have a lot of trust in law but</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.210" end="01:01:39.440" style="s2">little trust in politicians then judges</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.790" end="01:01:42.470" style="s2">will over time slowly morph into</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.440" end="01:01:45.860" style="s2">politicians because they will be</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.470" end="01:01:47.840" style="s2">executing political stuff under under</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.860" end="01:01:50.180" style="s2">the rubric of neutral impartial</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.840" end="01:01:52.280" style="s2">interpretation of the law in America I</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.180" end="01:01:54.350" style="s2">think we&#39;ve gone very far in the</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.280" end="01:01:56.120" style="s2">direction of the Supreme Court positions</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.350" end="01:01:59.150" style="s2">are just considered political positions</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.120" end="01:02:00.700" style="s2">like the party affiliation of the judges</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.150" end="01:02:04.200" style="s2">is considered the absolutely crucial</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.700" end="01:02:06.150" style="s2">thing people debate the compass</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.200" end="01:02:07.740" style="s2">of the Supreme Court much as people</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.150" end="01:02:11.010" style="s2">might have debated the composition of</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.740" end="01:02:12.750" style="s2">Congress in 1850 right so I think in</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.010" end="01:02:17.280" style="s2">that way over time this will diminish</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.750" end="01:02:19.230" style="s2">the reputation of law as such because</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.280" end="01:02:21.720" style="s2">people will come to see law is no longer</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.230" end="01:02:23.790" style="s2">the semi objective thing neutral thing</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.720" end="01:02:28.200" style="s2">technocratic thing and see it as more</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.790" end="01:02:29.670" style="s2">tactical is more opportunistic so I</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.200" end="01:02:31.740" style="s2">think even within the international</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.670" end="01:02:33.960" style="s2">system centered on the United States and</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.740" end="01:02:36.599" style="s2">these like institutions that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.960" end="01:02:39.170" style="s2">happen I think that the court the</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.599" end="01:02:42.599" style="s2">Strasbourg the Stratford Court is and</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.170" end="01:02:45.030" style="s2">the European Court serve a very good and</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.599" end="01:02:47.220" style="s2">positive example overall but in a way</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.030" end="01:02:49.650" style="s2">they&#39;re relying on a reservoir of like</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.220" end="01:02:51.570" style="s2">liberal thinking in Europe so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.650" end="01:02:53.220" style="s2">not adding to liberal thinking in Europe</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.570" end="01:02:54.660" style="s2">but they are on the basis of this</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.220" end="01:02:58.500" style="s2">liberal thinking liberal norms</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.660" end="01:03:02.040" style="s2">institutions exporting the effects to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.500" end="01:03:03.839" style="s2">places like Turkey right so it&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.040" end="01:03:05.490" style="s2">important to see what&#39;s powering the</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.839" end="01:03:06.990" style="s2">process and ultimately distribution</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.490" end="01:03:10.050" style="s2">channel so I think of them as an</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.990" end="01:03:12.390" style="s2">important distribution channel but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.050" end="01:03:14.490" style="s2">once the power plant is off like once</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.390" end="01:03:16.800" style="s2">the power plant stops operating all the</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.490" end="01:03:18.390" style="s2">lights in the town will go out so don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.800" end="01:03:22.950" style="s2">think it&#39;s permanently altering the</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.390" end="01:03:25.470" style="s2">societies right and I think you know in</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.950" end="01:03:27.150" style="s2">Israel my prediction is in Israel</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.470" end="01:03:29.460" style="s2">actually the court will be fairly robust</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.150" end="01:03:31.319" style="s2">because I think the intellectual level</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.460" end="01:03:34.980" style="s2">of argumentation in the court is</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.319" end="01:03:37.700" style="s2">extremely high I think in Europe it will</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.980" end="01:03:39.930" style="s2">remain robust but will decrease in</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.700" end="01:03:42.450" style="s2">international prestige as the prestige</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.930" end="01:03:44.190" style="s2">of Europe decreases and in the United</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.450" end="01:03:48.480" style="s2">States I&#39;m not sure whether the Supreme</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.190" end="01:03:50.190" style="s2">Court will remain robust like over the</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.480" end="01:03:52.050" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about over a 30 year time</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.190" end="01:03:54.390" style="s2">period right so I&#39;m not expecting</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.050" end="01:03:56.190" style="s2">anything weird next year but like again</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.390" end="01:04:00.810" style="s2">like this stuff changes very quickly</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.190" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">FDR threatened to tack the Supreme Court</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.810" end="01:04:04.800" style="s2">back in the day this could easily be</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.359" end="01:04:07.140" style="s2">done by a different president there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.800" end="01:04:09.060" style="s2">like no limit on how many people you can</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.140" end="01:04:11.160" style="s2">add to the Supreme Court so if I</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.060" end="01:04:12.690" style="s2">increased if I press a little button and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.160" end="01:04:15.000" style="s2">increase the size of America&#39;s Supreme</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.690" end="01:04:17.460" style="s2">Court to 50 judges I&#39;ve actually made it</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.000" end="01:04:17.999" style="s2">less powerful because their ability to</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.460" end="01:04:20.159" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.999" end="01:04:22.109" style="s2">with each other is diminished and the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.159" end="01:04:24.479" style="s2">power of external stakeholders to come</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.109" end="01:04:29.639" style="s2">into it and internally divide it has</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.479" end="01:04:32.939" style="s2">increased I also think it can&#39;t possibly</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.639" end="01:04:35.549" style="s2">handle the load of all the laws that</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.939" end="01:04:37.769" style="s2">have to be taken so a lot of them just</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.549" end="01:04:39.389" style="s2">fall down to bureaucratic implementation</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.769" end="01:04:44.999" style="s2">instead even a Court decision let alone</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.389" end="01:04:46.259" style="s2">legislature decision thank you very much</p>
