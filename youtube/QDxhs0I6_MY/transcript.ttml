<p begin="00:00:07.550" end="00:00:15.599" style="s2">hey folks welcome back to the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:20.279" style="s2">podcast livestream Q&amp;A section our 25th</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:24.779" style="s2">right yes ok 25th good we are now ready</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.279" end="00:00:26.490" style="s2">to to address ASD your Q&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.779" end="00:00:28.949" style="s2">we do that&#39;s what we do that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.490" end="00:00:30.840" style="s2">do ok we&#39;re going to start with one that</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.949" end="00:00:31.769" style="s2">we passed that we read but passed over</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.840" end="00:00:34.649" style="s2">last time because neither of us</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.769" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">recognized the term it was why is the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.649" end="00:00:39.989" style="s2">Gini coefficient not part geg ini why is</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:42.000" style="s2">the Gini coefficient not part of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.989" end="00:00:43.800" style="s2">conversation even though it explains</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.000" end="00:00:46.110" style="s2">clearly that inequality is the root of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.800" end="00:00:48.270" style="s2">crime the West is the 1% of the world</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:48.980" style="s2">but we only see what&#39;s close to us thank</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.270" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.980" end="00:00:53.610" style="s2">so I&#39;m embarrassed to say I did not</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:55.430" style="s2">remember what the Gini coefficient was</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.610" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">but it is a measure of inequality</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.430" end="00:00:59.730" style="s2">effectively a measure of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:04.049" style="s2">concentration of well-being as measured</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.730" end="00:01:05.549" style="s2">by wealth in a society so I would say a</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.049" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">it should be front and center in our</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.549" end="00:01:09.869" style="s2">discussions but I would say you need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">be slightly cautious about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.869" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">conclusion that the coefficient reveals</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">that inequality is the root cause of</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">crime because although I believe that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">that is likely to be true there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:28.080" style="s2">question of cause and effect here so you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:31.710" style="s2">could argue potential Wow my god yes the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.080" end="00:01:36.290" style="s2">people wolf you could argue that other</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.710" end="00:01:40.140" style="s2">causes would create the concentration of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.290" end="00:01:43.790" style="s2">well-being and crime or you could argue</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.140" end="00:01:46.200" style="s2">that crime actually causes a decrease in</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.790" end="00:01:47.490" style="s2">wealth accumulation in certain sectors I</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.200" end="00:01:49.530" style="s2">don&#39;t think either of these things are</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.490" end="00:01:52.170" style="s2">liable to be true but nonetheless you do</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.530" end="00:01:54.960" style="s2">it is too simple to say that it simply</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.170" end="00:01:56.070" style="s2">reveals what it does reveal is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.960" end="00:01:57.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a correlation between these</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.070" end="00:02:01.530" style="s2">things it doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t tell you what</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.840" end="00:02:04.229" style="s2">the the pathway is yep good hard to stay</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.530" end="00:02:05.549" style="s2">on on track when your people wolf comes</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.229" end="00:02:07.729" style="s2">into the room it&#39;s very frightening when</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.549" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">a wolf enters the room on announce yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.729" end="00:02:14.490" style="s2">what are you gonna do floppy ears Oh</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:16.680" style="s2">okay first question from livestream that</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.490" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">we just did is it plausible that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.680" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">epigenetic signals of our environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:23.190" style="s2">represents a primary genetic code and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:24.270" style="s2">DNA a secondary one is the environment</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.190" end="00:02:26.730" style="s2">the instrumentalist</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.270" end="00:02:30.360" style="s2">and are we its instruments thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.730" end="00:02:33.120" style="s2">your leadership did you get it you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.360" end="00:02:35.100" style="s2">understand what they&#39;re asking okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.120" end="00:02:37.590" style="s2">took me a while to Depar sit but then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.100" end="00:02:40.050" style="s2">I got it I think this is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.590" end="00:02:43.530" style="s2">audacious question yeah I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.050" end="00:02:44.520" style="s2">almost certain to be a blind alley I</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.530" end="00:02:45.900" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything down this</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.520" end="00:02:49.080" style="s2">road I think the genes have to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.900" end="00:02:51.209" style="s2">primary and then epigenetics happens on</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.080" end="00:02:53.459" style="s2">top epigenetics including things beyond</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.209" end="00:02:55.500" style="s2">the molecular epigenetic mechanisms that</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.459" end="00:02:57.989" style="s2">have become so fashionable to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.500" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">but it&#39;s audacious in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.989" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">testable and scientific unlike say pants</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:07.050" style="s2">psychism yeah right so i mean i i&#39;m i</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:07.769" style="s2">enjoy the question i don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.050" end="00:03:09.660" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.769" end="00:03:11.820" style="s2">i don&#39;t know anyone who&#39;s investigating</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.660" end="00:03:14.130" style="s2">it i don&#39;t know it is a live hypothesis</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.820" end="00:03:15.870" style="s2">and active in practicing scientists</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.130" end="00:03:19.200" style="s2">heads right now but the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.870" end="00:03:22.019" style="s2">epigenetics is first and genetics is is</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.200" end="00:03:23.370" style="s2">is less fundamental there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.019" end="00:03:27.329" style="s2">intriguing one well let&#39;s put it this</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.370" end="00:03:30.840" style="s2">way i love the way i love the instinct</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.329" end="00:03:34.950" style="s2">to take the most fundamental assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.840" end="00:03:36.360" style="s2">of a system and to just try flipping</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.950" end="00:03:37.829" style="s2">them on their heads to see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.360" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">because every so often you do that and</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.829" end="00:03:42.600" style="s2">the world makes more sense not less and</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">i you begin to wonder is that assumption</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.600" end="00:03:46.650" style="s2">way off or why just cancel out a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:48.900" style="s2">of terms that were plaguing me right</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.650" end="00:03:50.549" style="s2">exactly so anyway keep up with that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.900" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">style of logic and if you&#39;re right and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.549" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">we&#39;re wrong man you&#39;re set that is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">great and that is a great idea to</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">explore yep next question in episode 23</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:04.380" style="s2">at time stamp permit in episode 23 at 32</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">minutes three seconds you said that</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.380" end="00:04:07.980" style="s2">intermediate understanding of evolution</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:10.380" style="s2">is not enough to analyze cognition</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.980" end="00:04:12.180" style="s2">across populations because quote it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.380" end="00:04:13.500" style="s2">different kind of inheritance I know</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.180" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">this is the worst subject but please</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.500" end="00:04:18.359" style="s2">expand I hurt you all right I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:21.840" style="s2">expand a little this is something that</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.359" end="00:04:24.690" style="s2">really requires a great deal of care the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.840" end="00:04:26.160" style="s2">thing is people do not understand</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.690" end="00:04:28.830" style="s2">what it means that something is</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.160" end="00:04:32.430" style="s2">heritable heritable has a very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.830" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">definition inside of biology and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.430" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">narrow is it implies in this case that</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:42.620" style="s2">the the percentage of the variance in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:45.570" style="s2">trait that is accounted for by genetic</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.620" end="00:04:47.730" style="s2">differences and certain very odd things</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.570" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">happen when we define heritability this</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.730" end="00:04:53.940" style="s2">way things traits that are fixed things</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:56.820" style="s2">that we all share by fidelity bipedality</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.940" end="00:04:59.070" style="s2">for example their heritability goes to</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.820" end="00:05:00.990" style="s2">zero which in common parlance suggests</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.070" end="00:05:02.550" style="s2">that they are it&#39;s not genetically</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.990" end="00:05:04.740" style="s2">encoded which is exactly not what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.550" end="00:05:06.690" style="s2">suggests so anyway there&#39;s let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.740" end="00:05:08.790" style="s2">say there&#39;s a landscape of things that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.690" end="00:05:10.770" style="s2">go on in and around the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.790" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">heritability that is totally</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.770" end="00:05:13.590" style="s2">counterintuitive and you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:15.720" style="s2">understand them well in order to know</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.590" end="00:05:18.240" style="s2">what the claim that X Y or Z is</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.720" end="00:05:20.430" style="s2">heritable actually implies so one thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.240" end="00:05:23.220" style="s2">the example I think I use this with Sam</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.430" end="00:05:27.060" style="s2">Harris on his podcast and when I was on</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.220" end="00:05:28.830" style="s2">it you could take a trait it could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.060" end="00:05:31.260" style="s2">skin color it could be no shape it could</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.830" end="00:05:34.770" style="s2">be any trait right and it could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.260" end="00:05:38.010" style="s2">associated with a kind of prejudice in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.770" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">society and that trait could therefore</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.010" end="00:05:43.230" style="s2">have impacts on how you were treated if</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:46.200" style="s2">you had it versus didn&#39;t have it and it</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.230" end="00:05:49.140" style="s2">might then have impacts on how capable</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.200" end="00:05:51.300" style="s2">you ended up on some tests that we gave</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.140" end="00:05:53.190" style="s2">you and it would show up as heritable it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.300" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">would actually be heritable right if I</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.190" end="00:05:57.530" style="s2">had a nose shape that made people think</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:05:59.970" style="s2">I was a dummy and so they didn&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.530" end="00:06:01.980" style="s2">things that were mentally enriching in</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.970" end="00:06:04.950" style="s2">front of me as a kid and I ended up less</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.980" end="00:06:07.260" style="s2">well-off mentally than I otherwise would</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.950" end="00:06:09.360" style="s2">have if that&#39;s a common pattern then the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.260" end="00:06:11.370" style="s2">point is my X perfectly with no shape</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.360" end="00:06:14.130" style="s2">right no shape is variable it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.370" end="00:06:17.040" style="s2">fixed so my nose shape tends to predict</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.130" end="00:06:20.990" style="s2">what I will experience and that then</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.040" end="00:06:23.700" style="s2">becomes a heritable component of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.990" end="00:06:25.260" style="s2">intelligence but the point is to say oh</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.700" end="00:06:27.240" style="s2">such-and-such a percentage of</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.260" end="00:06:29.610" style="s2">intelligence is heritable or the</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.240" end="00:06:31.650" style="s2">difference in between two populations is</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.610" end="00:06:33.000" style="s2">heritable you don&#39;t think well it may be</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.650" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">its heritable through the following</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.000" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">route I&#39;ve got a nose shape that causes</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:38.249" style="s2">people not to treat me seriously in an</p>

<p begin="00:06:38.249" end="00:06:41.459" style="s2">way and that has impact right that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.259" end="00:06:43.079" style="s2">heritable but it doesn&#39;t mean what you</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.459" end="00:06:44.909" style="s2">think it means it doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.079" end="00:06:46.979" style="s2">anything in the genes that specifies</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.909" end="00:06:49.669" style="s2">these differences now here&#39;s a tough</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.979" end="00:06:52.019" style="s2">part okay you probably ought to sit down</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.669" end="00:06:53.819" style="s2">are you waiting for them to sit down I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.019" end="00:06:56.789" style="s2">given in a minute - sure find a chair</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.819" end="00:06:59.009" style="s2">right if I or make one I need more than</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.789" end="00:07:00.989" style="s2">a mat okay well we&#39;ll just skip ahead if</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.009" end="00:07:04.049" style="s2">your pause and then you can come back to</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.989" end="00:07:08.519" style="s2">it if you&#39;re making your own chair but</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.049" end="00:07:10.739" style="s2">the problem in this case is wait I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.519" end="00:07:12.979" style="s2">lost my train of thought I&#39;m sorry was</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.739" end="00:07:15.209" style="s2">the chair there&#39;s the chair thing not</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.979" end="00:07:18.389" style="s2">difficult the truly difficult thing in</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.209" end="00:07:19.679" style="s2">discussing heritability is this yeah</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.389" end="00:07:24.239" style="s2">the truly difficult thing in discussing</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.679" end="00:07:26.399" style="s2">heritability is this the fact of</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.239" end="00:07:29.279" style="s2">population level differences in</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.399" end="00:07:31.529" style="s2">intelligence has to have existed in</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.279" end="00:07:33.329" style="s2">history in evolutionary history in order</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.529" end="00:07:34.860" style="s2">for us to have gained the</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.329" end="00:07:36.599" style="s2">disproportionate intelligence that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.860" end="00:07:38.309" style="s2">have as a species in other words they</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.599" end="00:07:40.289" style="s2">will have to have been populations that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.309" end="00:07:41.759" style="s2">had less of it and they will have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.289" end="00:07:45.029" style="s2">have been out competed by populations</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.759" end="00:07:46.949" style="s2">that had more so I&#39;m not denying that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.029" end="00:07:50.789" style="s2">differences between populations could</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.949" end="00:07:52.919" style="s2">exist however that is not to say that in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.789" end="00:07:54.779" style="s2">the present those differences that we</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.919" end="00:07:56.809" style="s2">see and the differences are real the</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.779" end="00:07:58.919" style="s2">question is really about their cause</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.809" end="00:08:01.649" style="s2">also the degree to which they are</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.919" end="00:08:03.299" style="s2">representative across the board in other</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.649" end="00:08:05.489" style="s2">words you could test some very narrow</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.299" end="00:08:08.669" style="s2">kind of intelligence and you could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.489" end="00:08:09.749" style="s2">thinking that it was overly important or</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.669" end="00:08:11.279" style="s2">more important than it actually was</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.749" end="00:08:13.229" style="s2">given that if various different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.279" end="00:08:16.789" style="s2">intelligence but nonetheless the</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.229" end="00:08:19.110" style="s2">question is do we currently have</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.789" end="00:08:22.110" style="s2">differences between populations that owe</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.110" end="00:08:23.969" style="s2">to genetic differences between them that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.110" end="00:08:25.799" style="s2">account for disproportionate</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.969" end="00:08:28.019" style="s2">intelligence in some populations and</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.799" end="00:08:30.059" style="s2">less of it in others and I don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.019" end="00:08:32.189" style="s2">that we have evidence that strongly</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.059" end="00:08:34.289" style="s2">suggests this we have the population</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.189" end="00:08:35.759" style="s2">level differences we have heritable</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.289" end="00:08:37.769" style="s2">differences between those populations</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.759" end="00:08:40.829" style="s2">but what the mechanism of action here is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.769" end="00:08:42.539" style="s2">is really not clear and so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.829" end="00:08:44.850" style="s2">there&#39;s not enough room to really go</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.539" end="00:08:47.160" style="s2">deeply but I would just say you would</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.850" end="00:08:48.929" style="s2">want to run an experiment that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.160" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">run in order to know the answer to this</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.929" end="00:08:53.660" style="s2">and the experiment involves a</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:56.149" style="s2">completely equal society in which the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.660" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">prejudices do not exist and therefore we</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.149" end="00:09:02.690" style="s2">could see whatever residual heritability</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">in intelligence differences existed when</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.690" end="00:09:07.250" style="s2">you had controlled for things like the</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:09.740" style="s2">different culture in the household the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.250" end="00:09:11.390" style="s2">different propensity for to have two</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.740" end="00:09:13.070" style="s2">parents or maybe two parents and an</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.390" end="00:09:15.050" style="s2">extended family contributing to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.070" end="00:09:17.750" style="s2">raising of offspring so anyway there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.050" end="00:09:21.529" style="s2">lot of confounds here and my personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.750" end="00:09:25.190" style="s2">expectation is that genetically encoded</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.529" end="00:09:27.980" style="s2">differences in cognitive machinery will</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.190" end="00:09:30.500" style="s2">account for very little approaching none</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.980" end="00:09:33.670" style="s2">I can defend that further at some other</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.500" end="00:09:35.270" style="s2">time but there you go</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.670" end="00:09:37.370" style="s2">given the correlation between</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.270" end="00:09:39.440" style="s2">socioeconomic status and reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.370" end="00:09:41.300" style="s2">strategies if we want to increase</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.440" end="00:09:43.010" style="s2">equality of opportunity wouldn&#39;t it make</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.300" end="00:09:47.120" style="s2">sense to implement policies that promote</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.010" end="00:09:48.820" style="s2">marriage and strengthen families yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.120" end="00:09:51.500" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.820" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">families are a let&#39;s put it this way</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.500" end="00:09:57.529" style="s2">human babies are disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.310" end="00:10:01.490" style="s2">helpless the term we would use</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.529" end="00:10:04.520" style="s2">professionally is altricial they as</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.490" end="00:10:05.899" style="s2">opposed to precocial the generic term</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.520" end="00:10:07.399" style="s2">being precocious but it&#39;s nice I could</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.899" end="00:10:09.529" style="s2">the same thing but we&#39;re born helpless</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.399" end="00:10:13.010" style="s2">rather than skillful we&#39;ve won super</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.529" end="00:10:14.510" style="s2">helpless super needy and we are not</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.010" end="00:10:17.029" style="s2">blank slates but blank our than any</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.510" end="00:10:20.180" style="s2">other creature and therefore we have a</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.029" end="00:10:24.110" style="s2">lot more room to get upgraded by having</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.180" end="00:10:25.490" style="s2">more intel around to convey their</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.110" end="00:10:27.529" style="s2">particular kinds of insights and</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.490" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">intelligence to us which we&#39;ve then pick</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.529" end="00:10:33.020" style="s2">up so yeah more adults who are in stable</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">relationship with us and with each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.020" end="00:10:39.440" style="s2">and who love us and are interested in as</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:41.930" style="s2">as children as babies love us as babies</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.440" end="00:10:45.500" style="s2">and children and who are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.930" end="00:10:48.860" style="s2">giving their best shot at raising us</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.500" end="00:10:51.829" style="s2">having having more than one caregiver in</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.860" end="00:10:55.010" style="s2">your life who does that well allows you</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.829" end="00:10:56.570" style="s2">to calibrate the wisdom of each or all</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.010" end="00:10:58.370" style="s2">of them in a way that if you only have</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.570" end="00:11:01.490" style="s2">one primary caregiver it&#39;s much harder</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.370" end="00:11:04.310" style="s2">to do yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.490" end="00:11:05.870" style="s2">so I would also say this</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.310" end="00:11:08.660" style="s2">question is obviously motivated by the</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.870" end="00:11:10.520" style="s2">claim that we can do away with the so</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.660" end="00:11:12.529" style="s2">called nuclear family and replace it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.520" end="00:11:15.200" style="s2">with extended communities and this is</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.529" end="00:11:17.300" style="s2">this kind of garbage utopian idea I hear</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.200" end="00:11:19.960" style="s2">it now coming out of this movement I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.300" end="00:11:22.720" style="s2">also heard it thrown about in</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.960" end="00:11:25.550" style="s2">polyamorous circles and here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.720" end="00:11:27.890" style="s2">unless you understand what the argument</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.550" end="00:11:30.610" style="s2">is about group selection and whether</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.890" end="00:11:33.230" style="s2">group selection is an important force in</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.610" end="00:11:35.210" style="s2">evolution you&#39;re not in a position</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.230" end="00:11:37.010" style="s2">really to evaluate the likelihood that</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.210" end="00:11:39.200" style="s2">you could swap this other mechanism in</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.010" end="00:11:41.060" style="s2">because the fact is there&#39;s a very good</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.200" end="00:11:43.910" style="s2">reason that families do this job well</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.060" end="00:11:44.630" style="s2">and when you say well we&#39;ll just swap in</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.910" end="00:11:46.940" style="s2">this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.630" end="00:11:48.470" style="s2">in lieu of families you are making a</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.940" end="00:11:50.270" style="s2">claim about something being</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.470" end="00:11:52.190" style="s2">evolutionarily stable that some of us</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.270" end="00:11:54.589" style="s2">would argue is absolutely not going to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.190" end="00:11:56.029" style="s2">be evolutionarily stable so this is why</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.589" end="00:12:00.080" style="s2">we need stem because it said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.029" end="00:12:01.970" style="s2">inherently a stem question yep thanks</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.080" end="00:12:04.400" style="s2">guys for the clarity what are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.970" end="00:12:06.860" style="s2">chances that repeated spaced out below</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.400" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">threshold exposure to cope at 19 we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.860" end="00:12:11.780" style="s2">end up conferring immunity</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:15.770" style="s2">similar to diluted virus after passages</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.780" end="00:12:17.330" style="s2">greetings from Peru LRU : spaced out</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.770" end="00:12:19.910" style="s2">that&#39;s what I want I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.330" end="00:12:21.080" style="s2">after passing we&#39;re first so I know what</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.910" end="00:12:24.020" style="s2">the question means I wasn&#39;t quite sure</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.080" end="00:12:25.660" style="s2">what the analogy for to passage a past</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.020" end="00:12:28.880" style="s2">meeting is the laboratory technique oh</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.660" end="00:12:31.880" style="s2">yeah so the question is asking if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.880" end="00:12:34.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t come down with Cove at 19 but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.880" end="00:12:37.040" style="s2">were exposed repeatedly to Stars Cove -</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.060" end="00:12:38.810" style="s2">would that exposure trigger immunity</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.040" end="00:12:40.820" style="s2">your immune system seeing fragments</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.810" end="00:12:45.170" style="s2">basically what it&#39;s arguing is like a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.820" end="00:12:48.470" style="s2">vaccine well we have there is some</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.170" end="00:12:50.150" style="s2">evidence and with Kovan 19 it&#39;s so hard</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.470" end="00:12:52.339" style="s2">to know what that we think is true is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.150" end="00:12:55.250" style="s2">true there&#39;s been so much bad data and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.339" end="00:12:58.250" style="s2">so much bad analysis of the data that</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.250" end="00:13:00.140" style="s2">are there but I have seen evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.250" end="00:13:02.900" style="s2">looks compelling to me from what I can</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.140" end="00:13:06.920" style="s2">judge of of the data that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.900" end="00:13:08.990" style="s2">actually been some background immunity</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.920" end="00:13:12.770" style="s2">to coronavirus and populations that were</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.990" end="00:13:14.480" style="s2">imagined to be naive to it suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.770" end="00:13:16.459" style="s2">that exposure potentially to other</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.480" end="00:13:16.990" style="s2">coronaviruses might be conferring some</p>

<p begin="00:13:16.990" end="00:13:22.350" style="s2">and so if that&#39;s true I think it</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.450" end="00:13:25.029" style="s2">possible that you might end up with some</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.350" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">low-level immunity to the novel</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.029" end="00:13:29.290" style="s2">coronavirus with this sort of background</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:30.459" style="s2">low level of media it&#39;s not exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.290" end="00:13:32.770" style="s2">same yeah you&#39;re talking about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.459" end="00:13:35.529" style="s2">talking mighty different things but but</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.770" end="00:13:38.410" style="s2">that first result that I that I just</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.529" end="00:13:41.339" style="s2">mentioned is incredibly hopeful the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.410" end="00:13:43.230" style="s2">that exposure to some of the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.339" end="00:13:45.910" style="s2">rotating you know out there</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.230" end="00:13:47.589" style="s2">coronaviruses can confer some background</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.910" end="00:13:49.750" style="s2">immunity for the novel Crona virus is</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.589" end="00:13:51.490" style="s2">exciting it&#39;s actually one of the few or</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.750" end="00:13:52.029" style="s2">the rays of hope and this whole pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.490" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.029" end="00:13:56.140" style="s2">although I have the the darkness that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:59.380" style="s2">will absorb that ray of hope as always a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.140" end="00:14:04.990" style="s2">paper recently emerged that suggested</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.380" end="00:14:06.760" style="s2">that even people who had been infected</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.990" end="00:14:08.800" style="s2">I think I&#39;m understanding it correctly I</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.760" end="00:14:10.450" style="s2">only briefly looked at it but even</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.800" end="00:14:13.450" style="s2">people who had been infected by SARS</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.450" end="00:14:15.610" style="s2">Cove who didn&#39;t necessarily cero convert</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.450" end="00:14:18.190" style="s2">and therefore we&#39;re testing negative on</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.610" end="00:14:21.250" style="s2">these antibody tests which also implies</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.190" end="00:14:23.770" style="s2">a likely failure of immunity going</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.250" end="00:14:25.300" style="s2">forward I think that&#39;s correct yeah now</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.770" end="00:14:27.070" style="s2">you showed me I think you just showed me</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.300" end="00:14:31.029" style="s2">the abstract but the idea would be that</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.070" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">the t-cells kicked in enough to allow</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.029" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">the person who had been sick to get</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:37.690" style="s2">better but then no memory cells were</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:39.279" style="s2">generated such that you might have had</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.690" end="00:14:40.959" style="s2">immunity for a week or two</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.279" end="00:14:42.970" style="s2">I&#39;m just making those numbers up but</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.959" end="00:14:45.250" style="s2">after being sick with coven 19 but if</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.970" end="00:14:46.930" style="s2">you didn&#39;t see her convert then you had</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.250" end="00:14:48.790" style="s2">no immunity you know within a month</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.930" end="00:14:51.120" style="s2">after being sick this is just terrifying</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.790" end="00:14:53.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of speculation here one</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.120" end="00:14:55.390" style="s2">likely would be the t-cells that did the</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.470" end="00:14:58.570" style="s2">work which would then fail to create the</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.390" end="00:15:00.459" style="s2">b-cells that would create memory cells</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:15:01.570" style="s2">that would give you lasting immunity we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.459" end="00:15:02.740" style="s2">don&#39;t know what any of the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.570" end="00:15:04.660" style="s2">are frankly we don&#39;t even know that this</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.740" end="00:15:05.740" style="s2">result is true you know you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.660" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">really want to see this result</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.740" end="00:15:10.839" style="s2">replicated but if this result is true it</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.820" style="s2">does suggest a there may be a more SARS</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.839" end="00:15:14.380" style="s2">curve to circulating out there than we</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.820" end="00:15:18.459" style="s2">know because it&#39;s evading our tests</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.380" end="00:15:21.220" style="s2">better than we think and B that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.459" end="00:15:22.930" style="s2">that if you had it your immune might not</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.220" end="00:15:24.080" style="s2">be true in this case which would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.930" end="00:15:26.240" style="s2">really bad</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.080" end="00:15:30.130" style="s2">yep absolutely thanks for the darkness</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.240" end="00:15:30.130" style="s2">man you&#39;re welcome</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.000" end="00:15:35.180" style="s2">racism so this is written a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.140" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">telegraphic Lee I&#39;m gonna try to spell</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.180" end="00:15:38.779" style="s2">it out</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:41.990" style="s2">racism accorded D&#39;Angelo is a system and</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.779" end="00:15:44.540" style="s2">all reliable sources constitute a belief</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:59.240" style="s2">has capitulated I don&#39;t have I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.680" end="00:16:01.220" style="s2">see this question coming so I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.240" end="00:16:03.350" style="s2">the reference but there&#39;s an article a</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.220" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">week or two ago suggesting that some</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.350" end="00:16:07.190" style="s2">high school kid had been writing into I</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:09.290" style="s2">don&#39;t know if was Webster&#39;s it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.190" end="00:16:12.140" style="s2">the OED but it was one of the big big</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.290" end="00:16:16.459" style="s2">dictionaries and basically argued for a</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.140" end="00:16:18.440" style="s2">new definition that of racism that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.459" end="00:16:22.730" style="s2">tracks with this sort of systemic vague</p>

<p begin="00:16:24.649" end="00:16:29.660" style="s2">definition that many in the black lives</p>

<p begin="00:16:29.660" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">the dictionary did capitulate so how</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.240" end="00:16:39.680" style="s2">long yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:41.829" style="s2">yep that&#39;s not long yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.680" end="00:16:44.420" style="s2">toughy you know all of these terms</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.829" end="00:16:45.800" style="s2">there&#39;s not even really a good answer to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.420" end="00:16:48.680" style="s2">what you&#39;re supposed to do because the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.800" end="00:16:50.180" style="s2">fact is terms do naturally evolve what</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.680" end="00:16:52.250" style="s2">do you what happens when somebody it</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.180" end="00:16:53.839" style="s2">takes charge of that process and they</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.250" end="00:16:55.430" style="s2">redefine white supremacy and racism</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.839" end="00:16:57.380" style="s2">right out from under you and they define</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.430" end="00:17:03.260" style="s2">them as really mundane things are you</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.380" end="00:17:08.329" style="s2">begging the question here I&#39;m yes the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.260" end="00:17:11.720" style="s2">answer is Mary um but there is the thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.329" end="00:17:13.459" style="s2">that troubles me terms change maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.720" end="00:17:14.780" style="s2">change at lightning speed and you still</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.459" end="00:17:16.250" style="s2">need to update the dictionary but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.780" end="00:17:19.130" style="s2">the thing and actually the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.250" end="00:17:21.650" style="s2">alludes to it I&#39;ve said in the past is</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.130" end="00:17:23.990" style="s2">the problem is that the threshold for</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.650" end="00:17:26.000" style="s2">triggering these terms has been lowered</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.990" end="00:17:28.069" style="s2">so you can&#39;t possibly avoid tripping</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.000" end="00:17:29.750" style="s2">over it right of course you&#39;re racist of</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.069" end="00:17:31.940" style="s2">course you support white supremacy how</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.750" end="00:17:33.679" style="s2">could you not right and then you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.940" end="00:17:35.570" style="s2">a definition that supports the oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.679" end="00:17:37.820" style="s2">you&#39;re you know even you know if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.570" end="00:17:39.730" style="s2">sleep silently that&#39;s you in</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.820" end="00:17:43.130" style="s2">gauging in violence against you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.730" end="00:17:45.830" style="s2">minorities or something right yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.130" end="00:17:50.960" style="s2">the point is at the point that you say</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.830" end="00:17:52.940" style="s2">well I guess then and the penalty phase</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.960" end="00:17:54.530" style="s2">it goes right back up to the old</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.940" end="00:17:56.360" style="s2">definition so it&#39;s not even that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.530" end="00:18:00.110" style="s2">been redefined right it&#39;s like as soon</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.360" end="00:18:03.200" style="s2">as you agree that white supremacy is you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.110" end="00:18:04.910" style="s2">know it comes out of the tap right as</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.200" end="00:18:07.040" style="s2">soon as you agree to that then the point</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.910" end="00:18:08.540" style="s2">is it&#39;s as if there are crosses burning</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.040" end="00:18:10.820" style="s2">on everybody&#39;s long and that ain&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.540" end="00:18:12.950" style="s2">way it is so even the redefinition</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.820" end="00:18:14.330" style="s2">process doesn&#39;t quite capture because</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.950" end="00:18:15.890" style="s2">the point is we&#39;re gonna redefine it for</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.330" end="00:18:16.940" style="s2">these purposes and we&#39;re gonna keep it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.890" end="00:18:19.040" style="s2">to find the way it was for those</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.940" end="00:18:22.510" style="s2">purposes and that&#39;s how we&#39;re gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.040" end="00:18:25.130" style="s2">you yep it&#39;s a trick yeah it&#39;s a trick</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.510" end="00:18:26.720" style="s2">the scariest aspect of the science</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.130" end="00:18:28.940" style="s2">shutdown was the potential permission</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.720" end="00:18:31.760" style="s2">this movement gave itself if science is</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.940" end="00:18:34.160" style="s2">racist the movement can or must be</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.760" end="00:18:36.080" style="s2">unscientific to avoid being racist was</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.160" end="00:18:39.590" style="s2">this intellectual looting the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.080" end="00:18:43.430" style="s2">goal of the science shut down yeah so we</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.590" end="00:18:44.600" style="s2">did I think it was episode 22 maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.430" end="00:18:48.800" style="s2">which we talked a lot about the shut</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.600" end="00:18:51.770" style="s2">down stem and yes certainly there</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.800" end="00:18:54.560" style="s2">hand-in-hand and you know what is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.770" end="00:18:56.150" style="s2">is the benefit of shutting down stem is</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.560" end="00:18:57.980" style="s2">it you know honestly to get a stall</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.150" end="00:19:00.440" style="s2">reflect on our internalized an</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.980" end="00:19:02.200" style="s2">externalized racism or is it actually go</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.440" end="00:19:05.090" style="s2">after science and logic and</p>

<p begin="00:20:25.640" end="00:20:31.070" style="s2">little fallback position so as that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.330" end="00:20:32.690" style="s2">evergreen where they did want every</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.059" end="00:20:49.670" style="s2">right so anyway these things the little</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.429" end="00:20:52.610" style="s2">protective fallback for shut down stem</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.670" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2">is well it&#39;s linked for a day but no</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.610" end="00:20:56.150" style="s2">didn&#39;t you just get science magazine</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.050" end="00:20:57.890" style="s2">reacting right you&#39;re that productive</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.150" end="00:20:59.809" style="s2">every single day can&#39;t you just take a</p>

<p begin="00:21:12.530" end="00:21:15.530" style="s2">fooled by the little fallback positions</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:17.390" style="s2">it&#39;s nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.530" end="00:21:19.520" style="s2">shut down stem really is about shutting</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.390" end="00:21:22.940" style="s2">down stem and yes this is rationalizing</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.520" end="00:21:26.210" style="s2">the saying of illogical things the</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.940" end="00:21:31.040" style="s2">foregoing of analytical tools that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:32.300" style="s2">what they&#39;re doing yeah we did that one</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.040" end="00:21:33.980" style="s2">what advice would you give to</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.300" end="00:21:35.480" style="s2">professor&#39;s at private universities that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.980" end="00:21:38.620" style="s2">will soon face or are currently facing</p>

<p begin="00:21:38.620" end="00:21:46.400" style="s2">you&#39;re trying really hard not to say</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.700" end="00:21:47.480" style="s2">quit I mean it depends a week ago maybe</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.400" end="00:21:50.300" style="s2">I would have said it depends on where</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.480" end="00:21:51.920" style="s2">you are and you know I&#39;ve I&#39;ve given a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.300" end="00:21:53.600" style="s2">couple of talks in which you know one at</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.920" end="00:21:55.070" style="s2">the Department of Justice in which I was</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.600" end="00:21:57.340" style="s2">asked you know what advice what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.070" end="00:22:00.020" style="s2">would you give and I separated out</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.340" end="00:22:02.360" style="s2">between faculty admin and students I</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.020" end="00:22:03.470" style="s2">find faculty the most complicit in in</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.360" end="00:22:07.490" style="s2">this madness</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.470" end="00:22:09.650" style="s2">and if you are faculty who do not have a</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.490" end="00:22:11.090" style="s2">complicit in the madness administration</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.650" end="00:22:13.100" style="s2">behind you you have no excuse and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.090" end="00:22:14.900" style="s2">can stand up if however you would all</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.100" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">doubt the administration that you have</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.900" end="00:22:18.770" style="s2">and the reason I say as of a week ago</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.020" style="s2">that was my advice and as of now</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.770" end="00:22:23.299" style="s2">University of Chicago even is willing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.020" end="00:22:25.400" style="s2">investigate one of its own esteemed</p>

<p begin="00:22:25.400" end="00:22:32.390" style="s2">not racist skepticism yes for skepticism</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.940" end="00:22:35.840" style="s2">well University of Chicago is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.390" end="00:22:36.740" style="s2">bastion of hope and I don&#39;t know how you</p>

<p begin="00:22:36.740" end="00:22:42.350" style="s2">administration has your back unless you</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:44.270" style="s2">have a clear honest and deep</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.350" end="00:22:47.390" style="s2">relationship with an administrator who</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:49.220" style="s2">really can protect you but you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.390" end="00:22:53.539" style="s2">individuals standing up against this</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.220" end="00:22:57.950" style="s2">madness if the administration will fall</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.539" end="00:23:01.130" style="s2">in line to the new religion don&#39;t stand</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.950" end="00:23:03.740" style="s2">much chance how how if you do feel like</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.130" end="00:23:07.250" style="s2">you either need to because it&#39;s who you</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.740" end="00:23:10.130" style="s2">are or you maybe can&#39;t afford to how</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.250" end="00:23:13.270" style="s2">would you say you stand up well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.130" end="00:23:20.390" style="s2">gonna give I&#39;ve gotten over my little</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.270" end="00:23:21.470" style="s2">episode of darkness and in any case I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.390" end="00:23:22.820" style="s2">give you I&#39;ll give you my real advice</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.470" end="00:23:25.820" style="s2">but almost nobody&#39;s going to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.820" end="00:23:27.710" style="s2">position to do anything with it for</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.820" end="00:23:28.850" style="s2">various reasons the thing you should do</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.710" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">is you should look around you should</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.850" end="00:23:35.270" style="s2">figure out who else on your campus has</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:38.840" style="s2">courage courage and integrity it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.270" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">big list you find those people though</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.840" end="00:23:43.490" style="s2">and your reason with them and you say</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:46.429" style="s2">what our colleagues would not hear when</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.490" end="00:23:49.970" style="s2">we approached them but might be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.429" end="00:23:54.020" style="s2">visible now which is look this ends very</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.970" end="00:23:57.110" style="s2">very badly and either you attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.020" end="00:24:00.799" style="s2">bootstrap a response that has some new</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.110" end="00:24:04.820" style="s2">effect you try to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.799" end="00:24:08.450" style="s2">response might halt the juggernaut at</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.820" end="00:24:10.370" style="s2">your college and the problem is you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.450" end="00:24:13.940" style="s2">probably fail but the logic here is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.370" end="00:24:15.290" style="s2">same one that nobody seems to like</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.940" end="00:24:17.390" style="s2">except me</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.290" end="00:24:20.810" style="s2">about the the first against the wall&#39;</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.810" end="00:24:26.510" style="s2">can&#39;t actually buy yourself anything</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.150" end="00:24:29.660" style="s2">other than a brief respite that you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.510" end="00:24:31.250" style="s2">sacrifice your own integrity and you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.660" end="00:24:33.470" style="s2">get a brief respite but you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.250" end="00:24:35.150" style="s2">any permanent refuge from what&#39;s coming</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.470" end="00:24:36.980" style="s2">then the point is well which would you</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.150" end="00:24:38.930" style="s2">rather would you rather hold on to your</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.980" end="00:24:41.510" style="s2">integrity and say what you really think</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.930" end="00:24:43.730" style="s2">and see if you can arrange some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.510" end="00:24:44.840" style="s2">response that allows you to survive in</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.730" end="00:24:48.320" style="s2">spite of that even though it probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.840" end="00:24:50.090" style="s2">won&#39;t work or do you want to pretend to</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.870" end="00:25:01.160" style="s2">know even know what you are at that</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.950" end="00:25:02.630" style="s2">point yeah an effective collaborator one</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.160" end="00:25:05.300" style="s2">thing I would add yesterday sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.630" end="00:25:06.410" style="s2">logistical level and answer this</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.300" end="00:25:07.820" style="s2">question what would what advice would</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.410" end="00:25:10.880" style="s2">you give is that there is a growing</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.820" end="00:25:13.850" style="s2">literature that points out that things</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.880" end="00:25:15.800" style="s2">like the implicit bias test and equity</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.850" end="00:25:18.890" style="s2">and diversity training are actually not</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.800" end="00:25:19.790" style="s2">just not effective but but negatively</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.890" end="00:25:23.180" style="s2">effect they aren&#39;t productive</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.790" end="00:25:25.540" style="s2">counterproductive I cited a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.180" end="00:25:28.760" style="s2">them in my piece on college presidents</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.540" end="00:25:31.340" style="s2">which I might if I think of it might dig</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.760" end="00:25:32.540" style="s2">up in place here but I&#39;ve got a piece on</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.340" end="00:25:34.010" style="s2">college presidents where I think some of</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.540" end="00:25:36.440" style="s2">these pieces are but there&#39;s more that</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.010" end="00:25:38.270" style="s2">scholarship is actually growing I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.440" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">already by then so that piece came out</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.270" end="00:25:44.180" style="s2">maybe two years ago one year ago and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:46.640" style="s2">there was already a lot of evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.180" end="00:25:49.100" style="s2">suggest that the implicit bias test</p>

<p begin="00:25:51.380" end="00:25:56.710" style="s2">and the results are not reliable but</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.010" end="00:25:59.680" style="s2">increasingly there&#39;s evidence that these</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.700" end="00:26:06.230" style="s2">counterproductive and so perhaps arming</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.460" end="00:26:07.550" style="s2">yourself with some of some of that</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.230" end="00:26:10.190" style="s2">literature you know given that you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.550" end="00:26:11.990" style="s2">an academic environment trotting out</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.190" end="00:26:15.020" style="s2">peer-reviewed literature to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.990" end="00:26:16.220" style="s2">administrators who are trying to force</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.020" end="00:26:19.160" style="s2">you to take these kinds of workshops</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.220" end="00:26:22.040" style="s2">might be a first step</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.160" end="00:26:22.940" style="s2">yeah they won&#39;t listen and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.040" end="00:26:25.040" style="s2">is that the purpose of these things</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.940" end="00:26:27.530" style="s2">isn&#39;t the advertised purpose anyway oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.040" end="00:26:28.790" style="s2">actually one other thing I was reminded</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.530" end="00:26:30.200" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.790" end="00:26:32.660" style="s2">valerie tweeted something to this effect</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.200" end="00:26:34.760" style="s2">today and you know she we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.660" end="00:26:37.040" style="s2">about her before on his podcast he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.760" end="00:26:39.620" style="s2">been on the podcast right but she&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.040" end="00:26:41.780" style="s2">and she&#39;s just she&#39;s a friend of ours</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.620" end="00:26:45.470" style="s2">and she&#39;s fabulous and her one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.780" end="00:26:48.110" style="s2">things that she does is offers dia</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.470" end="00:26:52.460" style="s2">training stood diversity inclusion and</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.110" end="00:26:55.490" style="s2">equity he died trainings but she does so</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.460" end="00:26:59.320" style="s2">with integrity and honesty and care with</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.490" end="00:27:01.490" style="s2">an actual goal and I think effect of</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.320" end="00:27:03.050" style="s2">getting people to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.490" end="00:27:04.430" style="s2">differences of their experiences so that</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.050" end="00:27:06.680" style="s2">they can come so that you know whatever</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.430" end="00:27:08.810" style="s2">the team is can come together with a</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.680" end="00:27:11.720" style="s2">shared understanding of who they all are</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.810" end="00:27:13.160" style="s2">and so she was the reason that she was</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.720" end="00:27:14.960" style="s2">in Portland and you know stayed with us</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.160" end="00:27:17.540" style="s2">and was on the podcast back in September</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.960" end="00:27:20.300" style="s2">of last year was because she&#39;d been</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.540" end="00:27:25.550" style="s2">hired to give one of these trainings for</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.300" end="00:27:29.000" style="s2">a bunch of FAA people right and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.550" end="00:27:31.130" style="s2">available like I covered I&#39;d love to see</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.000" end="00:27:35.480" style="s2">her star rise in this regard to see her</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.130" end="00:27:38.210" style="s2">be a kind of golden Trojan horse walking</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.480" end="00:27:42.410" style="s2">into these trainings where people expect</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.210" end="00:27:44.390" style="s2">the same all divisive anti-racist</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.410" end="00:27:45.980" style="s2">garbage and instead they get Chloe and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.390" end="00:27:46.730" style="s2">her theory of Enchantment that would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.980" end="00:27:48.800" style="s2">amazing</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.730" end="00:27:51.680" style="s2">yeah also suggesting hurts theory of</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.800" end="00:27:54.320" style="s2">Enchantment Chloe Valerie is the is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.680" end="00:27:56.210" style="s2">founder and the she just does amazing</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.320" end="00:28:00.260" style="s2">work she&#39;s the opposite of a Trojan</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.210" end="00:28:02.240" style="s2">horse I&#39;m trying to have a little occur</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.260" end="00:28:05.990" style="s2">to us when when we&#39;re done with the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.240" end="00:28:08.360" style="s2">here but yes I if you are inside one of</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.990" end="00:28:10.940" style="s2">these entities and you are trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.360" end="00:28:13.820" style="s2">figure out what you might do it would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.940" end="00:28:17.290" style="s2">a very wise idea to take the genuine</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.820" end="00:28:21.530" style="s2">article and substitute it for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.290" end="00:28:24.350" style="s2">reeducation camps that is the intent of</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.530" end="00:28:25.880" style="s2">these other things with Chloe Chloe</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.350" end="00:28:27.710" style="s2">rather than the people brandishing the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.880" end="00:28:30.470" style="s2">modern little red book yep</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.710" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">for sure next question could you please</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.470" end="00:28:33.530" style="s2">go deeper or guide me to a video where</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:35.480" style="s2">you explain how you break away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.530" end="00:28:37.700" style="s2">evolutionary truth and live a morally</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.480" end="00:28:39.990" style="s2">and ethical live a moral and ethical</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.700" end="00:28:42.810" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.990" end="00:28:44.340" style="s2">so I I know where this is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.810" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">that it&#39;s not exactly breaking away from</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.340" end="00:28:49.080" style="s2">evolutionary truth but are in our</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.870" end="00:28:50.790" style="s2">evolutionary foundations and the drives</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.080" end="00:28:53.520" style="s2">that we have that are evolutionary and</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.790" end="00:28:56.610" style="s2">that are that are real but not honorable</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.520" end="00:28:58.530" style="s2">it is it is one of the main themes of</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.610" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">the book that we are writing that will</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.530" end="00:29:04.020" style="s2">be out in hopefully less than a year in</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:04.920" style="s2">spring of next year other than that well</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.020" end="00:29:06.540" style="s2">I want to I want to challenge the</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.920" end="00:29:09.450" style="s2">question a little bit okay</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.540" end="00:29:11.250" style="s2">I think the key actually to doing what</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.450" end="00:29:14.250" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about involves staring</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.250" end="00:29:16.500" style="s2">directly at evolutionary theory because</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.250" end="00:29:18.330" style="s2">when you realize what it is that your</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.500" end="00:29:19.980" style="s2">genes are trying to arrange and that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.330" end="00:29:23.160" style="s2">some of the things that they have set</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.980" end="00:29:24.390" style="s2">you up for are magical and tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.160" end="00:29:27.080" style="s2">and some of the things that they have</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.390" end="00:29:30.330" style="s2">set you up for perfectly ghastly and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.080" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">that at some level you are either going</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.330" end="00:29:35.550" style="s2">to make an is aught failure you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:36.480" style="s2">engage in the naturalistic fallacy and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.550" end="00:29:38.010" style="s2">you&#39;re going to embrace everything</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.480" end="00:29:40.590" style="s2">evolution thinks is cool</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.010" end="00:29:42.840" style="s2">or you&#39;re gonna reject it you say you</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.590" end="00:29:44.460" style="s2">know what no my values don&#39;t fit that</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.840" end="00:29:47.640" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna choose the things that I like</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.460" end="00:29:49.260" style="s2">from evolution and I&#39;m going to resist</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.640" end="00:29:50.700" style="s2">those things that my genes would have me</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.260" end="00:29:53.340" style="s2">do that I don&#39;t believe are honorable</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.700" end="00:29:55.710" style="s2">right that&#39;s it the basis tribalistic</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.340" end="00:29:57.750" style="s2">impulses for instance sure I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.710" end="00:29:59.160" style="s2">know look it&#39;s no secret to anybody who</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.750" end="00:30:01.050" style="s2">studied evolution that rape is an</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.160" end="00:30:02.880" style="s2">evolutionary strategy did you engage in</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.050" end="00:30:04.590" style="s2">it no that&#39;s that&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.880" end="00:30:06.870" style="s2">abhorrent so that if you can see that</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.590" end="00:30:09.710" style="s2">much it&#39;s one sentence right you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.870" end="00:30:11.970" style="s2">on board with rape then you are already</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.710" end="00:30:14.100" style="s2">dividing what it is that evolution might</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.970" end="00:30:15.810" style="s2">point you towards and choosing some and</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.100" end="00:30:18.000" style="s2">rejecting others and the point is okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.810" end="00:30:20.130" style="s2">now take that model and take it over the</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.000" end="00:30:21.900" style="s2">entire spectrum of things and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.130" end="00:30:23.820" style="s2">find it there are things that evolution</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.900" end="00:30:25.320" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have you do that are well worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.820" end="00:30:27.270" style="s2">your while and there are things that it</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.320" end="00:30:31.140" style="s2">would have you do that you best not you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.270" end="00:30:33.360" style="s2">must not and but understanding what what</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.140" end="00:30:35.970" style="s2">of our drives our evolutionary and have</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.360" end="00:30:37.680" style="s2">been effective at some points for some</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.970" end="00:30:39.870" style="s2">of our ancestors in the past and are</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.680" end="00:30:41.940" style="s2">therefore why they persist is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.870" end="00:30:43.860" style="s2">important piece of the puzzle and</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.940" end="00:30:45.750" style="s2">understanding how to then unhook those</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.860" end="00:30:48.470" style="s2">things from our current motivational</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.750" end="00:30:48.470" style="s2">structures yep</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.920" end="00:30:54.900" style="s2">many BLM and Tifa motives BLM slash and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.890" end="00:30:56.970" style="s2">Tifa motives make sense to me within the</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.900" end="00:30:58.590" style="s2">US progressive lineage but for some</p>

<p begin="00:31:05.370" end="00:31:12.660" style="s2">mean I see it as a mechanism right in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.850" end="00:31:16.320" style="s2">order so when it when you deploy all of</p>

<p begin="00:32:11.160" end="00:32:16.350" style="s2">part of me objects to this the premise</p>

<p begin="00:32:32.460" end="00:32:37.440" style="s2">has been a history of for instance</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.930" end="00:32:39.060" style="s2">Marxism in progressivism in the u.s. and</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.440" end="00:32:41.010" style="s2">that&#39;s never you know we&#39;ve urban</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.060" end="00:32:43.320" style="s2">Marxists and that&#39;s not what what we are</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.010" end="00:32:45.720" style="s2">engaging in but is that has that been a</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.320" end="00:32:47.880" style="s2">long-standing part of some part of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.720" end="00:32:49.230" style="s2">progressivism in the u.s. it has sure so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.880" end="00:32:53.070" style="s2">you know that that much is true</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.230" end="00:32:56.910" style="s2">yep so I would say also white fragility</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.070" end="00:32:59.760" style="s2">is two strategies okay it&#39;s a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.910" end="00:33:01.200" style="s2">for the movement it&#39;s also a marvelous</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.760" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">strategy</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.200" end="00:33:04.559" style="s2">to advance the cause of Robyn D&#39;Angelo</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:07.320" style="s2">oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.559" end="00:33:09.480" style="s2">who is getting fantastically wealthy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.320" end="00:33:11.429" style="s2">famous and powerful and it&#39;s weird</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.480" end="00:33:15.540" style="s2">because she&#39;s white and so she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.429" end="00:33:17.549" style="s2">figured out how to sell out all sorts of</p>

<p begin="00:33:17.549" end="00:33:23.190" style="s2">crime in exchange for it&#39;s like it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.120" end="00:33:26.429" style="s2">she&#39;s transferred so much well-being to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.190" end="00:33:29.760" style="s2">herself by becoming the you know the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.429" end="00:33:31.980" style="s2">queen of this insane</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.760" end="00:33:34.799" style="s2">ideology instead of false claims it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.980" end="00:33:38.040" style="s2">really well done Robin yeah very of</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.799" end="00:33:39.120" style="s2">someone a year ago or so on Twitter said</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.040" end="00:33:41.490" style="s2">to me something about her being a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.120" end="00:33:43.620" style="s2">scholar I said she&#39;s about as much of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.490" end="00:33:46.290" style="s2">scholar as Donald Trump is but the two</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.620" end="00:33:49.230" style="s2">of them share shares something which is</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.290" end="00:33:51.540" style="s2">a deep-rooted narcissistic ability to</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.230" end="00:33:54.090" style="s2">look out for number one mm-hmm and to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.540" end="00:33:56.220" style="s2">really promote number one at the cost of</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.090" end="00:33:58.549" style="s2">all sorts of people around them she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.220" end="00:34:01.980" style="s2">wickedly good at it now I did see a</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.549" end="00:34:03.419" style="s2">response to my suggestion again on</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.980" end="00:34:06.270" style="s2">Twitter just before we began the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.419" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">livestream today that white fragility</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.270" end="00:34:10.260" style="s2">was akin to the little red book someone</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:12.359" style="s2">said uh Heather you&#39;re too late actually</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.260" end="00:34:13.560" style="s2">BLM is now going after white fragility</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.359" end="00:34:15.179" style="s2">precisely because it was written by a</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.560" end="00:34:17.190" style="s2">white woman and now she&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.179" end="00:34:18.149" style="s2">denounced it&#39;s like well you know it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.190" end="00:34:23.940" style="s2">could have happened to a more</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.149" end="00:34:26.100" style="s2">appropriate person I can&#39;t help but have</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.940" end="00:34:29.669" style="s2">some sympathy if they finally come for</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.100" end="00:34:32.429" style="s2">her but god damn it oh yeah I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.669" end="00:34:35.550" style="s2">were warned the left eats itself that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.429" end="00:34:37.740" style="s2">what&#39;s going on yep I did some research</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.550" end="00:34:39.570" style="s2">into the McRaven yang idea well I like</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.740" end="00:34:41.580" style="s2">your intent I don&#39;t trust this pair I</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.570" end="00:34:43.980" style="s2">would suggest representative Dan</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.580" end="00:34:45.899" style="s2">Crenshaw of Texas and Eric Weinstein</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.980" end="00:34:49.500" style="s2">that&#39;s love and respect to you both</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.899" end="00:34:51.419" style="s2">never heard of either Italy our producer</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.500" end="00:34:58.230" style="s2">also our son is in the other room</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.419" end="00:35:00.510" style="s2">laughing now here&#39;s the thing I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.230" end="00:35:04.440" style="s2">sure exactly what to say I believe</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.510" end="00:35:06.450" style="s2">McRaven yang is the right pair they will</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.440" end="00:35:08.400" style="s2">have to be drafted lots of things could</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.450" end="00:35:11.760" style="s2">happen the most important thing to</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.400" end="00:35:13.790" style="s2">recognize is that the plan is viable if</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.760" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">it can be populated by a</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.790" end="00:35:19.610" style="s2">that makes sense so I have laid out</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:21.020" style="s2">criteria there are only three I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.610" end="00:35:22.790" style="s2">say there&#39;s a kind of a fourth one</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.020" end="00:35:24.800" style="s2">haunting to the three criteria for the</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.790" end="00:35:28.930" style="s2">two right of center in the left of</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.800" end="00:35:31.100" style="s2">center our patriotic courageous capable</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.930" end="00:35:32.330" style="s2">okay we need two people and one from the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.100" end="00:35:34.670" style="s2">left one from the right that have those</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.330" end="00:35:41.150" style="s2">characteristics be very desirable if</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.670" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">they were also well known so I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.150" end="00:35:46.490" style="s2">certainly trust Eric in this position</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:48.470" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure you know given that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.490" end="00:35:51.860" style="s2">advanced the plan I&#39;m not sure how it</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.470" end="00:35:54.580" style="s2">would strike people but whatever he&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.860" end="00:35:57.620" style="s2">a very short list of people who would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.580" end="00:35:59.840" style="s2">highly qualified for the left of center</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.620" end="00:36:03.410" style="s2">part of that puzzle I know Dan Crenshaw</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.840" end="00:36:06.290" style="s2">as well but in any case the important</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.410" end="00:36:07.970" style="s2">thing is that we defeat the duopoly that</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.290" end="00:36:11.300" style="s2">we defeat the duopoly with a plan that</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.970" end="00:36:14.600" style="s2">actually allows the power to move us</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.300" end="00:36:16.090" style="s2">forward and who inhabits that plan is</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.600" end="00:36:24.620" style="s2">secondary</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.090" end="00:36:28.700" style="s2">so anyway suggestion taken okay we&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.620" end="00:36:30.760" style="s2">a couple more here and then we&#39;ll switch</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.700" end="00:36:33.350" style="s2">to the other livestream questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.760" end="00:36:35.900" style="s2">heterozygous tay-sachs and torsion</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.350" end="00:36:37.810" style="s2">dystonia definitely boost IQ about ten</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.900" end="00:36:40.130" style="s2">points even controlling for ethnicity</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.810" end="00:36:43.220" style="s2">Cochrane it all says it implies group</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.130" end="00:36:46.670" style="s2">differences in IQ why else select for</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.220" end="00:36:47.780" style="s2">homozygous bad stuff that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.670" end="00:36:49.520" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.780" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">I don&#39;t do you know the torsion dystonia</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.520" end="00:36:56.120" style="s2">example no I don&#39;t know what that is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:58.130" style="s2">only vaguely aware of it exists you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.120" end="00:37:00.620" style="s2">basically right that you would select</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.130" end="00:37:02.090" style="s2">4-bit well no there are a couple reasons</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.620" end="00:37:04.070" style="s2">you would select for bad stuff in the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.090" end="00:37:05.180" style="s2">case of these things the reason that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.070" end="00:37:07.370" style="s2">would select for it is that it comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.180" end="00:37:10.730" style="s2">coupled with positive traits that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.370" end="00:37:12.200" style="s2">outweigh the negative I still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.730" end="00:37:16.700" style="s2">think we have enough information about</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.200" end="00:37:18.440" style="s2">the the mechanisms involved and what</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.700" end="00:37:20.360" style="s2">sort of heritability we are looking at</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.440" end="00:37:22.040" style="s2">there are lots of possibilities and we</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.360" end="00:37:26.820" style="s2">don&#39;t have the answer so</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.040" end="00:37:29.840" style="s2">it&#39;s on the table of possibilities 10 IQ</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.820" end="00:37:32.700" style="s2">points is significant it is not decisive</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.840" end="00:37:34.050" style="s2">but in any case we need to look deeper</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.700" end="00:37:36.060" style="s2">into these things and we need to do so</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.050" end="00:37:37.830" style="s2">with an upgraded understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.060" end="00:37:38.970" style="s2">heritability is because otherwise we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.830" end="00:37:41.940" style="s2">just going to keep tripping over the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.970" end="00:37:43.020" style="s2">same kinds of errors where we think we</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.940" end="00:37:47.370" style="s2">were saying something when we say</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.020" end="00:37:49.800" style="s2">heritability that we&#39;re not okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.370" end="00:37:51.860" style="s2">violence in great apes compared to</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.800" end="00:37:54.360" style="s2">humans for evolutionary advantage</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.860" end="00:37:56.520" style="s2">thoughts on non-violence and cultural</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.360" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">evolution question mark thresholds where</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.520" end="00:38:01.380" style="s2">violence creates evolutionary advantage</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:03.150" style="s2">you turn that into a cent less turd for</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.380" end="00:38:04.590" style="s2">me how much I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sure exactly</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.150" end="00:38:07.800" style="s2">I sort of have the sense that the</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.590" end="00:38:11.250" style="s2">question is you&#39;ve got cultural</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.800" end="00:38:13.800" style="s2">mechanisms increasing what many call</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.250" end="00:38:16.230" style="s2">pro-sociality and thereby decrease</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.800" end="00:38:18.960" style="s2">violence and so they&#39;re looking for a</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.230" end="00:38:21.060" style="s2">comparison with great ape models where</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.960" end="00:38:24.660" style="s2">presumably those cultural mechanisms are</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.060" end="00:38:27.450" style="s2">much less elaborate which is true</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.660" end="00:38:30.030" style="s2">although they also I mean group size is</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.450" end="00:38:33.860" style="s2">such a good predictor of both degree of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.030" end="00:38:36.390" style="s2">sociality and therefore violence that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.860" end="00:38:38.370" style="s2">interestingly humans have by far the</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.390" end="00:38:41.010" style="s2">biggest group size of any primate but</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.370" end="00:38:42.270" style="s2">baboons which are not apes have the next</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.010" end="00:38:45.630" style="s2">biggest group size have you know you</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.270" end="00:38:47.940" style="s2">keep very high rates of violence and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.630" end="00:38:50.220" style="s2">then you know chimps tend to have bigger</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.940" end="00:38:53.430" style="s2">groups than gorillas and have higher</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.220" end="00:38:55.590" style="s2">rates of violence bonobos which your</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.430" end="00:38:59.580" style="s2">sister two chimps both both Gina span</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.590" end="00:39:02.270" style="s2">have similar group size to chimps but</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.580" end="00:39:06.030" style="s2">have lower rates of violence so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.270" end="00:39:08.340" style="s2">there&#39;s it&#39;s more it&#39;s more than just</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.030" end="00:39:09.600" style="s2">group size it&#39;s more than just great</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.340" end="00:39:11.930" style="s2">apes versus humans</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.600" end="00:39:15.420" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s complex and in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.930" end="00:39:17.250" style="s2">bonobos are a really interesting example</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.420" end="00:39:20.160" style="s2">I&#39;m not convinced we understand them</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.250" end="00:39:22.710" style="s2">very well yet but the fashion thing I</p>

<p begin="00:39:22.710" end="00:39:28.950" style="s2">did not put anyone on the on the job of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.610" end="00:39:31.320" style="s2">spending decades</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.950" end="00:39:33.240" style="s2">and I&#39;m sure that there are at this</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.320" end="00:39:35.040" style="s2">point some people trying to do long term</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.240" end="00:39:36.480" style="s2">behavioral work on bonobos this has been</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.040" end="00:39:39.079" style="s2">done on the three other species of great</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.480" end="00:39:42.720" style="s2">apes and chimps are rangs and gorillas</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.079" end="00:39:44.250" style="s2">but I don&#39;t even I can&#39;t call up the</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.720" end="00:39:45.570" style="s2">name which says something you know for</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.250" end="00:39:47.130" style="s2">someone deeply embedded in animal</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.570" end="00:39:50.670" style="s2">behavior and you know and this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.130" end="00:39:53.730" style="s2">thing so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think good</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.670" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">longitudinal work on bonobo social</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.730" end="00:39:56.369" style="s2">systems has been done we have a couple</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:58.710" style="s2">of things that everyone likes to trot</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.369" end="00:40:00.510" style="s2">out around sex for food trades and being</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.710" end="00:40:04.020" style="s2">less violent and you know almost being</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.510" end="00:40:05.609" style="s2">matriarchal and all but it&#39;s it&#39;s much</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.020" end="00:40:06.960" style="s2">more scattershot in anecdotal it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.609" end="00:40:08.339" style="s2">scattershot I think some of that has to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.960" end="00:40:11.430" style="s2">do with the practicality of studying</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.339" end="00:40:13.109" style="s2">bonobos existing over just much smaller</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.430" end="00:40:15.630" style="s2">range and places where it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.109" end="00:40:18.390" style="s2">study them but but I would just point</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.630" end="00:40:22.050" style="s2">out I think our understanding of what</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.390" end="00:40:25.560" style="s2">happened so we split from chimps six</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.050" end="00:40:27.359" style="s2">million years ago if yeah from the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.560" end="00:40:29.099" style="s2">recent common ancestor of us chimps and</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.359" end="00:40:31.770" style="s2">bonobos right and so the chimp lineage</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.099" end="00:40:33.329" style="s2">split into two much more recently like</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.770" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">two million years ago don&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.329" end="00:40:35.550" style="s2">know when that is supposed to have</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:39.230" style="s2">happened but in any case my</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.550" end="00:40:42.720" style="s2">understanding of the story is that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.230" end="00:40:46.069" style="s2">chimps and gorillas lived in overlapping</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.720" end="00:40:49.640" style="s2">ranges and the gorillas in this range</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.069" end="00:40:53.670" style="s2">went extinct which opened a niche for</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.640" end="00:40:56.369" style="s2">chimp like organism to move into</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.670" end="00:40:59.670" style="s2">gorillas space so the fact that that had</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.369" end="00:41:03.030" style="s2">profound influence on the behavior of</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.670" end="00:41:05.849" style="s2">the chimp lineage that sprung off at</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.030" end="00:41:08.069" style="s2">that point is interesting especially if</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.849" end="00:41:09.869" style="s2">it took them in the direction of reduced</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.069" end="00:41:11.550" style="s2">violence because of course gorillas are</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.869" end="00:41:14.250" style="s2">less violent than chimps a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.550" end="00:41:17.030" style="s2">violent so anyway there&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.250" end="00:41:20.280" style="s2">be said that hints at an ecological</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.030" end="00:41:21.750" style="s2">interaction with this that may have an</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.280" end="00:41:24.060" style="s2">important role that we haven&#39;t yet</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.750" end="00:41:24.930" style="s2">understood so anyway it&#39;s worth it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.060" end="00:41:27.270" style="s2">worth thinking about what the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.930" end="00:41:28.319" style="s2">implications of that are if I even have</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.270" end="00:41:31.170" style="s2">the story right I&#39;m I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.319" end="00:41:34.589" style="s2">primatologist yeah I don&#39;t I I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.170" end="00:41:36.690" style="s2">know of that piece and when you said it</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.589" end="00:41:37.829" style="s2">it made me wonder you know well was it</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.690" end="00:41:41.220" style="s2">the chimps that drove the gorillas</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.829" end="00:41:41.950" style="s2">extinct just as you know homo homo drove</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.220" end="00:41:43.900" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.950" end="00:41:45.220" style="s2">Australopithecus and such don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.900" end="00:41:47.490" style="s2">there&#39;s any evidence of that I think it</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.220" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">was ecological no major</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.490" end="00:41:53.079" style="s2">okay so let&#39;s find if I can figure out</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:56.470" style="s2">where it is ah here we go</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.079" end="00:41:59.680" style="s2">Zach do you have a line here on where</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.470" end="00:42:00.910" style="s2">the new questions are or can you just</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.680" end="00:42:10.680" style="s2">tell me what line I&#39;m looking for oh</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.910" end="00:42:15.280" style="s2">it&#39;s right there no no that&#39;s not right</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.680" end="00:42:18.609" style="s2">mmm no because yeah but I only had 32</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.280" end="00:42:27.790" style="s2">questions from before so I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.609" end="00:42:31.930" style="s2">go to line 32 oh boy if that is true if</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.790" end="00:42:36.730" style="s2">they didn&#39;t all come in then guys I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.930" end="00:42:39.040" style="s2">really sorry we missed a lot of your</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.730" end="00:42:42.940" style="s2">questions we will try to collect them</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.040" end="00:42:47.200" style="s2">and return to them yeah these were not</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.940" end="00:42:50.140" style="s2">in in before all right here we go</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.200" end="00:42:52.119" style="s2">a friend of mine told me that sex and</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.140" end="00:42:54.040" style="s2">gender are different sex being</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.119" end="00:43:01.359" style="s2">biological and gender being more fluid</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.040" end="00:43:02.950" style="s2">and social true or BS kinda yeah so so</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.359" end="00:43:04.630" style="s2">feel like writing a teen books on this</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.950" end="00:43:08.440" style="s2">no no I think we got we got one sentence</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.630" end="00:43:12.490" style="s2">well so okay go for the one sentence one</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.440" end="00:43:15.640" style="s2">sense is gender is the software of sex</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.490" end="00:43:18.069" style="s2">does that make it more flexible yes but</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.640" end="00:43:20.170" style="s2">gender is the software of sex gives us</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.069" end="00:43:22.780" style="s2">the correct inference which is that this</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.170" end="00:43:24.490" style="s2">is not a completely free variable this</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.780" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">is also subject to evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.490" end="00:43:31.359" style="s2">pressures and evolutionary history there</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:33.059" style="s2">is much more reason to expect variation</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.359" end="00:43:36.040" style="s2">between populations and how this</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.059" end="00:43:38.349" style="s2">parameter functions there&#39;s also reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.040" end="00:43:42.010" style="s2">to expect that we have more room going</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.349" end="00:43:44.950" style="s2">forward to change gender than we do sex</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.010" end="00:43:48.069" style="s2">but the to say that gender and sex are</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.950" end="00:43:50.140" style="s2">different is not to say the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.069" end="00:43:53.799" style="s2">is usually implied when people invoke</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.140" end="00:43:55.460" style="s2">that which is that gender is an</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.799" end="00:43:57.860" style="s2">arbitrary landscape that</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.460" end="00:44:00.500" style="s2">you&#39;re free to choose you recognize that</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.860" end="00:44:02.030" style="s2">wasn&#39;t one sentence right there was one</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.500" end="00:44:04.130" style="s2">that was about the eight sentences I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.030" end="00:44:08.270" style="s2">going to say about let me let me let me</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.130" end="00:44:10.940" style="s2">also say you know I have written about</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.270" end="00:44:14.330" style="s2">this a fair bit already and spoken about</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.940" end="00:44:16.400" style="s2">it in various places in non-human</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.330" end="00:44:19.310" style="s2">organisms the thing that we call gender</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.400" end="00:44:21.530" style="s2">in humans we call sex role and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.310" end="00:44:23.870" style="s2">effectively the behavioral component</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.530" end="00:44:28.370" style="s2">that is mostly predictable from what sex</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.870" end="00:44:30.380" style="s2">you are and so for instance in the much</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.370" end="00:44:33.440" style="s2">trotted out by the trans rights</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.380" end="00:44:35.930" style="s2">activists generally not what I call true</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.440" end="00:44:38.630" style="s2">trans but in the trans rights activists</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.930" end="00:44:40.070" style="s2">like to point out hermaphrodite xx</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.630" end="00:44:42.080" style="s2">switching fish sequentially</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.070" end="00:44:45.230" style="s2">hermaphroditic fish reef fish like clown</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.080" end="00:44:47.360" style="s2">fish and damsel fish and such which as</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.230" end="00:44:48.680" style="s2">if that suggests that people can do the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.360" end="00:44:52.520" style="s2">same thing and of course it means no</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.680" end="00:44:57.380" style="s2">such thing but what happens in these</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.520" end="00:44:59.330" style="s2">fish is for depending on the ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.380" end="00:45:01.580" style="s2">the particular species at the point that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.330" end="00:45:03.830" style="s2">a male switches to a female actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.580" end="00:45:06.440" style="s2">switches to a female goes from producing</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.830" end="00:45:08.510" style="s2">sperm to producing ovaries has</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.440" end="00:45:10.040" style="s2">anatomical and physiological changes</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.510" end="00:45:13.030" style="s2">that accompany that that are also about</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.040" end="00:45:15.980" style="s2">the sex but also changes the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.030" end="00:45:18.050" style="s2">from male typical behavior to female</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.980" end="00:45:21.110" style="s2">typical behavior and the behavior is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.050" end="00:45:24.110" style="s2">gender it&#39;s the sex role so are there</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.110" end="00:45:25.040" style="s2">things that men and women do that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.110" end="00:45:27.520" style="s2">sex</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.040" end="00:45:32.420" style="s2">typical sex stereotypical if you wish</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.520" end="00:45:35.600" style="s2">that that are true across cultures yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.420" end="00:45:38.060" style="s2">less so across all cultures than within</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.600" end="00:45:39.800" style="s2">cultures are the things that we</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.060" end="00:45:43.400" style="s2">behaviorally do that aren&#39;t absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.800" end="00:45:46.030" style="s2">mandated by our anatomy and physiology</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.400" end="00:45:49.220" style="s2">like breastfeeding and gestating and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.030" end="00:45:51.830" style="s2">ejaculating and things like this are are</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.220" end="00:45:54.650" style="s2">things that are behaviorally following</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.830" end="00:45:58.910" style="s2">from sex more flexible and malleable</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.650" end="00:46:01.160" style="s2">than sex itself for sure but of course a</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.910" end="00:46:04.700" style="s2">lot of the trans ideology that is being</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.160" end="00:46:06.440" style="s2">trotted out suggests that the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.700" end="00:46:08.240" style="s2">is the same so I mean they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.440" end="00:46:09.170" style="s2">doing a kind of a motte-and-bailey thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.240" end="00:46:11.030" style="s2">where they</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.170" end="00:46:12.920" style="s2">we&#39;re only talking about gender and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.030" end="00:46:16.340" style="s2">they&#39;ll also claim in the next breath</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.920" end="00:46:18.350" style="s2">that sex isn&#39;t real either so sex and</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.340" end="00:46:20.660" style="s2">gender are different but gender follows</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.350" end="00:46:22.610" style="s2">from sex and yes we can unhook some of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.660" end="00:46:31.580" style="s2">the traditional expectations of gender</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.610" end="00:46:32.810" style="s2">roles usually that&#39;s not in the room we</p>

<p begin="00:49:32.960" end="00:49:37.369" style="s2">there we can now turn a blind eye and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.990" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">say well we did away with the racism</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.369" end="00:49:40.940" style="s2">everything else must be the result of</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.900" end="00:49:50.750" style="s2">but we don&#39;t know that it does because</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.520" end="00:49:52.339" style="s2">we haven&#39;t seen the experiment run I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.750" end="00:49:53.390" style="s2">been shocked at the proclivity of so</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.339" end="00:49:56.300" style="s2">many of my friends to subscribe</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.390" end="00:49:57.770" style="s2">wholeheartedly to the woke mentality do</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.300" end="00:49:59.210" style="s2">you think intellect and attention to</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.770" end="00:50:04.190" style="s2">detail has anything to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.210" end="00:50:06.200" style="s2">political choices people make so this</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.190" end="00:50:08.390" style="s2">was one of these things I often</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.200" end="00:50:09.589" style="s2">reference that Eric once said to me in</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.390" end="00:50:11.569" style="s2">fact I think I&#39;ve called it the smartest</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.589" end="00:50:14.660" style="s2">thing anyone ever said which was truth</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.569" end="00:50:19.220" style="s2">is the second best strategy and by that</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.660" end="00:50:21.410" style="s2">he meant that social affiliation that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.220" end="00:50:23.810" style="s2">to say signing on to what the group that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.410" end="00:50:26.150" style="s2">has power wants you to say in order that</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.810" end="00:50:28.430" style="s2">it will share its power with you is</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.150" end="00:50:30.619" style="s2">often a much better strategy than truth</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.430" end="00:50:33.130" style="s2">so what it is that I think is going on</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.619" end="00:50:36.549" style="s2">with those who don&#39;t sign up with this</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.130" end="00:50:38.799" style="s2">it&#39;s one of two things either they have</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.549" end="00:50:40.450" style="s2">correctly realized that they could get</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.799" end="00:50:42.029" style="s2">somewhere in the short term by signing</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.450" end="00:50:44.529" style="s2">on but they will ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.029" end="00:50:47.859" style="s2">confronted by this thing in the end so</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.529" end="00:50:49.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not a good deal or they are</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.859" end="00:50:51.279" style="s2">sticklers for the truth and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.599" end="00:50:54.099" style="s2">I think all of us sticklers for the</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.279" end="00:50:56.410" style="s2">truth are I don&#39;t want to call us broken</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.099" end="00:50:58.930" style="s2">but we say we do not have the circuit</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.410" end="00:51:00.250" style="s2">that allows you to just simply socially</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.930" end="00:51:01.720" style="s2">affiliate no matter what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.250" end="00:51:04.029" style="s2">nonsense it forces to come out of your</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.720" end="00:51:07.509" style="s2">mouth right some people do and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.029" end="00:51:09.970" style="s2">that they say some crazy thing and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.509" end="00:51:11.349" style="s2">everybody cheers assures them that it</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.970" end="00:51:12.940" style="s2">must be right mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.349" end="00:51:16.960" style="s2">so anyway this can happen all over the</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.940" end="00:51:18.789" style="s2">place you know there&#39;s some danger you</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.960" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">know in the case of Dave Rubin for</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.789" end="00:51:25.269" style="s2">example that he&#39;s hearing you know the</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:27.700" style="s2">fears of a bunch of people who are all</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.269" end="00:51:29.920" style="s2">concentrated in one mindset and he</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.700" end="00:51:31.779" style="s2">thinks that what he&#39;s saying is making</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.920" end="00:51:34.210" style="s2">sense and in fact it seems to be making</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.779" end="00:51:36.910" style="s2">less sense over time as he&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.210" end="00:51:39.279" style="s2">closer to a group that is united behind</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.910" end="00:51:40.990" style="s2">ideas that are not robust closer to a</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.279" end="00:51:46.630" style="s2">different ideology than one that he</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.990" end="00:51:48.460" style="s2">formerly formerly ascribed to but seems</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.630" end="00:51:50.740" style="s2">to be a jump from ideology to ideology</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.460" end="00:51:53.289" style="s2">rather than to more first principles</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.740" end="00:51:56.759" style="s2">thinking yeah and you know I&#39;ve seen him</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.289" end="00:52:00.309" style="s2">of late attack Chloe he&#39;s attacked</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.759" end="00:52:02.470" style="s2">Josephine mattias there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.309" end="00:52:04.809" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason we know both of these</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.470" end="00:52:06.940" style="s2">people incredibly decent incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.809" end="00:52:09.250" style="s2">bright and incredibly insightful and</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.940" end="00:52:11.170" style="s2">frankly open to other perspectives both</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.250" end="00:52:14.559" style="s2">of them have that characteristic in</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.170" end="00:52:16.930" style="s2">spades so why you know on what basis</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.559" end="00:52:18.609" style="s2">could you possibly attack them well to</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.930" end="00:52:21.460" style="s2">the extent that he is now moved in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.609" end="00:52:24.880" style="s2">direction of an ideology that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.460" end="00:52:28.359" style="s2">abide voices like theirs he now can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.880" end="00:52:30.009" style="s2">even hear what they&#39;re saying yeah if</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.359" end="00:52:31.630" style="s2">the primary issue is the lack of equal</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.009" end="00:52:33.819" style="s2">opportunity that disproportionately</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.630" end="00:52:35.500" style="s2">affects black Americans could the issue</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.819" end="00:52:37.420" style="s2">then be described as a class problem</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.500" end="00:52:39.700" style="s2">that presents as a race issue any</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.420" end="00:52:44.680" style="s2">solution must address both question mark</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.700" end="00:52:49.150" style="s2">any solution must address both yes</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.680" end="00:52:51.510" style="s2">I think his historically it was much</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.150" end="00:52:55.029" style="s2">more of a race problem than it is now</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.510" end="00:52:59.250" style="s2">but because of exactly what you say here</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.029" end="00:53:03.970" style="s2">we have a socio-economic problem that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.250" end="00:53:07.450" style="s2">unfortunately not purely by any means</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.970" end="00:53:10.539" style="s2">but somewhat correlated with race so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.450" end="00:53:12.910" style="s2">would say we have two populations for</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.539" end="00:53:15.819" style="s2">which we still have a significant race</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.910" end="00:53:18.250" style="s2">problem all right blacks and Indians and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.819" end="00:53:20.319" style="s2">it is intermingled</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.250" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">American Indians yes it is intermingled</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.319" end="00:53:29.079" style="s2">with an economic problem it&#39;s a vicious</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:31.539" style="s2">cycle and it of course demands a</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.079" end="00:53:37.829" style="s2">solution that addresses both but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.539" end="00:53:41.619" style="s2">think what we don&#39;t have is a an active</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.829" end="00:53:43.539" style="s2">racism problem at large scale right I</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">that era this is an era for people who</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.049" end="01:00:17.809" style="s2">can figure out how to walk a tightrope</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:21.079" style="s2">that you can&#39;t see and it&#39;s a learned</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.809" end="01:00:23.750" style="s2">skill so I would just say watch some of</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.079" end="01:00:25.730" style="s2">these things figure out you know okay</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.750" end="01:00:27.740" style="s2">I&#39;m looking at a sign it says something</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.730" end="01:00:29.270" style="s2">you know part of me agrees with this</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.740" end="01:00:31.160" style="s2">sign and part of me knows that I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.270" end="01:00:32.809" style="s2">agree with this sign try to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.160" end="01:00:34.670" style="s2">which word it is that causes it to flip</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.809" end="01:00:37.880" style="s2">just see get good at it just train</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.670" end="01:00:40.790" style="s2">yourself and you know there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.880" end="01:00:43.220" style="s2">perfect but really the answer is when</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.790" end="01:00:46.069" style="s2">many of us figure out how to evade these</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.220" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">traps the traps go away right if you can</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.069" end="01:00:50.960" style="s2">show that you can stare down one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:52.910" style="s2">these traps and not perish then others</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.960" end="01:00:55.010" style="s2">will learn that thing as well and so we</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.910" end="01:00:58.119" style="s2">need to unhook them one by one and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.010" end="01:01:00.650" style="s2">mechanism to unhook them has to spread</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.119" end="01:01:03.109" style="s2">all right we&#39;re gonna do two more</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.650" end="01:01:05.510" style="s2">because the the final one is a is a big</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.109" end="01:01:07.220" style="s2">question I think we should get two new</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.510" end="01:01:08.720" style="s2">penultimate question to what extent are</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.220" end="01:01:10.760" style="s2">jordan Peterson&#39;s views on the sovereign</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.720" end="01:01:12.740" style="s2">individual free speech and meaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.760" end="01:01:14.490" style="s2">relevant to this crisis and do you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.740" end="01:01:17.700" style="s2">if he&#39;s returning soon</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.490" end="01:01:19.800" style="s2">because views are highly relevant and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.700" end="01:01:21.960" style="s2">is doing better and will hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.800" end="01:01:24.690" style="s2">hopefully be back in the public eye soon</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.960" end="01:01:28.560" style="s2">I think that&#39;s what we don&#39;t just ya can</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.690" end="01:01:30.180" style="s2">say right now yeah finally why is not a</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.560" end="01:01:31.830" style="s2">branded movement emerged against this</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.180" end="01:01:34.320" style="s2">yet a way for us to stand together to</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.830" end="01:01:35.670" style="s2">say yes to equality but no to over</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.320" end="01:01:37.650" style="s2">categorizing humans are shutting down</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.670" end="01:01:39.330" style="s2">ideas and speech pointing out the</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.650" end="01:01:42.050" style="s2">warnings that history has given us this</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.330" end="01:01:44.760" style="s2">would provide us strength in numbers</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.050" end="01:01:50.040" style="s2">this is a terrific question</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.760" end="01:01:51.450" style="s2">yep and you know there I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.040" end="01:01:53.220" style="s2">this is the right answer at all in it at</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.450" end="01:01:54.839" style="s2">the very least it&#39;s only a part of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.220" end="01:02:01.710" style="s2">right answer but I think that many of us</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.839" end="01:02:07.109" style="s2">who are most loud at the moment also</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.710" end="01:02:09.270" style="s2">have a real aversion to branding and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.109" end="01:02:11.339" style="s2">promotion and self-promotion and such</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.270" end="01:02:13.710" style="s2">and you know are doing it insofar as we</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.339" end="01:02:17.040" style="s2">feel the need but don&#39;t like it at all</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.710" end="01:02:19.290" style="s2">and so you know this it might be easier</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.040" end="01:02:22.430" style="s2">to get behind this if it was for you</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.290" end="01:02:25.440" style="s2">know a movement as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.430" end="01:02:29.160" style="s2">individuals but I also don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.440" end="01:02:30.869" style="s2">know none of us are expert in what kind</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.160" end="01:02:32.640" style="s2">of logistical thing that would require</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.869" end="01:02:34.859" style="s2">so like what but maybe the question is</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.640" end="01:02:36.869" style="s2">why hasn&#39;t it emerged organically well I</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.859" end="01:02:39.060" style="s2">think it is emerging organic okay we</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.869" end="01:02:41.339" style="s2">just don&#39;t know enough to see it but you</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.060" end="01:02:44.640" style="s2">know it doesn&#39;t have a chap jaws has job</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.339" end="01:02:47.190" style="s2">doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t have it have declared</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.640" end="01:02:48.839" style="s2">a part of the garden autonomous I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.190" end="01:02:50.010" style="s2">know if you noticed the sign I put up I</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.839" end="01:02:52.950" style="s2">didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.010" end="01:03:00.420" style="s2">well the slugs must have eaten no so</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.950" end="01:03:03.210" style="s2">here&#39;s what I would say IDW was clearly</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.420" end="01:03:05.940" style="s2">partially an answer to this puzzle</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.210" end="01:03:08.670" style="s2">IDW was about figuring out how to</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.940" end="01:03:10.859" style="s2">continue to have reasoned discussion on</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.670" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">topics where that was supposed to be</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.859" end="01:03:16.290" style="s2">ruled out by these various Kafka traps</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:20.040" style="s2">and it was wildly successful and I</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.290" end="01:03:24.119" style="s2">cannot emphasize enough what it was like</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.040" end="01:03:26.849" style="s2">to be on stage for example in Vancouver</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.119" end="01:03:28.390" style="s2">with jordan peterson and sam harris and</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.849" end="01:03:30.819" style="s2">lookout for two consent</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.390" end="01:03:33.640" style="s2">of knives at an audience of 3,000 people</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.819" end="01:03:35.950" style="s2">who you wouldn&#39;t have known they weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.640" end="01:03:38.170" style="s2">at a rock concert if you didn&#39;t know who</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.950" end="01:03:39.730" style="s2">was on stage except no one&#39;s phones were</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.170" end="01:03:42.039" style="s2">out yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.730" end="01:03:45.369" style="s2">everyone was wrapped and he&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.039" end="01:03:47.769" style="s2">they weren&#39;t really there for the</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.369" end="01:03:50.170" style="s2">question of what is the nature of truth</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.769" end="01:03:52.359" style="s2">they were there for something bigger it</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.170" end="01:03:54.880" style="s2">was much more movement like it was much</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.359" end="01:03:57.880" style="s2">more people interested in the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.880" end="01:04:00.250" style="s2">reasoned discussion in an era of no</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.880" end="01:04:03.309" style="s2">reason so in any case</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.250" end="01:04:05.710" style="s2">IDW had a part of it I think rebel</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.309" end="01:04:07.599" style="s2">wisdom has a party rebel wisdom has been</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.710" end="01:04:09.369" style="s2">curating different conversations some of</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.599" end="01:04:10.869" style="s2">them don&#39;t get along all that well but</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.369" end="01:04:12.910" style="s2">nonetheless there&#39;s an idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.869" end="01:04:14.500" style="s2">answer to this involves juxtaposing</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.910" end="01:04:16.269" style="s2">these things and seeing if you can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.500" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">them to play nice together yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.269" end="01:04:22.390" style="s2">game B was an early version of well</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:25.420" style="s2">we&#39;ve got structural problems is there a</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.390" end="01:04:27.400" style="s2">way to actually plausibly get from here</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.420" end="01:04:28.960" style="s2">to an alternative stable solution that</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.400" end="01:04:30.460" style="s2">is wildly more successful at</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.960" end="01:04:33.009" style="s2">accomplishing what we claim to want to</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.460" end="01:04:34.960" style="s2">accomplish so Jamie wheel has got part</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.009" end="01:04:37.079" style="s2">of it apparently he and two of our</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.960" end="01:04:39.579" style="s2">friends will be familiar to some people</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.079" end="01:04:42.009" style="s2">listening or starting a podcast Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.579" end="01:04:45.579" style="s2">Hall and Daniel shellacking Berger young</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.009" end="01:04:47.890" style="s2">along with big think yep so all of these</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.579" end="01:04:49.990" style="s2">entities but none of that is a branding</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.890" end="01:04:53.079" style="s2">right we can point to these pockets of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.990" end="01:04:54.460" style="s2">such intensely reasonable discourse that</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.079" end="01:04:56.230" style="s2">you know when it comes to disagree with</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.460" end="01:04:58.750" style="s2">itself I can confront that and say okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.230" end="01:05:01.210" style="s2">you know can we live with this this</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.750" end="01:05:04.329" style="s2">dissonance or must it be resolved but</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.210" end="01:05:06.609" style="s2">but in terms of a you know there is no</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.329" end="01:05:09.099" style="s2">hashtag Beale I&#39;m equivalent right but</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.609" end="01:05:11.650" style="s2">so one thing that I&#39;ve been thinking is</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.099" end="01:05:14.170" style="s2">that all of these thing if it is in fact</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.650" end="01:05:15.609" style="s2">true that we are going to bootstrap our</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.170" end="01:05:17.710" style="s2">way out of this terrible predicament</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.609" end="01:05:21.849" style="s2">rather than just allow the dumpster fire</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.710" end="01:05:24.279" style="s2">to happen then probably all those</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.849" end="01:05:26.589" style="s2">entities ought to coalesce in one way or</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.279" end="01:05:28.359" style="s2">another and if they can coalesce they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.589" end="01:05:30.220" style="s2">gonna do it hopefully under a banner</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.359" end="01:05:32.200" style="s2">right at some level they are all</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.220" end="01:05:33.640" style="s2">coalescing by virtue of the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.200" end="01:05:37.029" style="s2">the audience that is hungry for that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.640" end="01:05:38.150" style="s2">kind of interaction bounces from you</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.029" end="01:05:41.210" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.150" end="01:05:43.610" style="s2">the portal to rebel wisdom - darkhorse</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.210" end="01:05:45.680" style="s2">you know it&#39;s doing that trick so the</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.610" end="01:05:49.640" style="s2">question is what is the overarching</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.680" end="01:05:51.410" style="s2">thing and in any case I don&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="01:05:49.640" end="01:05:53.180" style="s2">answer to it but at some level if</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.410" end="01:05:55.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a political dimension here if we</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.180" end="01:05:58.400" style="s2">are going to try to save the Republic</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.640" end="01:06:01.460" style="s2">through a novel plan that interfaces</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.400" end="01:06:04.400" style="s2">with our existing electoral system then</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.460" end="01:06:06.410" style="s2">maybe that flies under a banner it</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.400" end="01:06:09.650" style="s2">occurred to me I don&#39;t have the mug down</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.410" end="01:06:13.250" style="s2">here but what game B was before it was</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.650" end="01:06:16.490" style="s2">game B was the Emancipation Party mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.250" end="01:06:19.550" style="s2">might be up there but in any case the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.490" end="01:06:21.590" style="s2">Emancipation Party that&#39;s a decent brand</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.550" end="01:06:23.900" style="s2">because the point is it&#39;s non-political</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.590" end="01:06:27.110" style="s2">right it&#39;s non-political si DW was</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.900" end="01:06:29.300" style="s2">non-political mm-hmm and so anyway there</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.110" end="01:06:33.860" style="s2">is room for a branding I would be up for</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.300" end="01:06:36.740" style="s2">anything that caused the various loosely</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.860" end="01:06:39.320" style="s2">aligned populations who are following</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.740" end="01:06:41.270" style="s2">one or the other of these threads to</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.320" end="01:06:42.800" style="s2">come together and say well actually you</p>
