<p begin="00:01:04.830" end="00:01:09.600" style="s2">try to address them as many as we can in</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.070" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2">the order in which they come in that is</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.600" end="00:01:15.810" style="s2">our rubric which seems to split the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:17.729" style="s2">difference between the various pros and</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.810" end="00:01:20.460" style="s2">cons of the various approaches so from</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.729" end="00:01:22.590" style="s2">episode 27 we have just a logistical</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.460" end="00:01:24.150" style="s2">question which actually I should have</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.590" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">turned into an announcement I&#39;m also</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.150" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">covered in cat fur how do you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:29.880" style="s2">a listener download just the audio</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:31.740" style="s2">portion of these videos so he can listen</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.880" end="00:01:34.740" style="s2">to them while driving or data signals</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.740" end="00:01:37.020" style="s2">are spotty at best so we have the the</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.740" end="00:01:40.170" style="s2">not the Q&amp;A is but the main episodes are</p>

<p begin="00:01:47.490" end="00:01:51.810" style="s2">tech answer but probably if we say that</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.220" end="00:01:55.009" style="s2">again here in the chat someone will</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.810" end="00:01:57.899" style="s2">there is a way you keep you can download</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.009" end="00:01:59.340" style="s2">YouTube videos there are many services</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.899" end="00:02:01.290" style="s2">that will allow you to do it and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.340" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">you could play them in a video player I</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.290" end="00:02:05.909" style="s2">believe that would work in a video</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:08.220" style="s2">player while he&#39;s driving you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.909" end="00:02:11.239" style="s2">to look at the video you could turn it</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.220" end="00:02:11.239" style="s2">upside down in the seat here</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.970" end="00:02:19.080" style="s2">we are told that spotify premium would</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.890" end="00:02:21.060" style="s2">allow you to do it also the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.080" end="00:02:24.030" style="s2">that costs money and I would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.060" end="00:02:25.650" style="s2">yeah yeah alright next question from</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.030" end="00:02:27.810" style="s2">last time so I&#39;m reading this even</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.650" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">though I sort of inadvertently addressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.810" end="00:02:31.620" style="s2">some of it last hour what parts of Raman</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.030" style="s2">DeAngelo&#39;s book do you agree with there</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.620" end="00:02:34.440" style="s2">are Parts I agree with how do you hold a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.030" end="00:02:36.450" style="s2">dominant culture accountable without</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.440" end="00:02:37.980" style="s2">slipping into tearing all the white</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.450" end="00:02:42.180" style="s2">Jesus statues down as a sign of white</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.980" end="00:02:44.190" style="s2">supremacy so I I really I I did my best</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.180" end="00:02:46.560" style="s2">to steal man may be the most egregious</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.190" end="00:02:49.709" style="s2">point in it by saying well if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.560" end="00:02:54.690" style="s2">go back if you replace the word racist</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.709" end="00:02:58.129" style="s2">with benefiting from structures that</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.690" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">have in the past been racist policies</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.129" end="00:03:03.209" style="s2">then yes people with white skin are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:06.780" style="s2">fact still benefiting from those</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.209" end="00:03:08.220" style="s2">stretchers today I maybe will say more</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:09.329" style="s2">about this depending on whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.220" end="00:03:11.459" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a little essay that may come</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.329" end="00:03:14.549" style="s2">out soon and if not I&#39;ll share more of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.459" end="00:03:16.349" style="s2">this with the eyes later I would say two</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.549" end="00:03:20.069" style="s2">things there are parts of her book that</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.349" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">I agree with the ISP and number there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.069" end="00:03:23.609" style="s2">a price marker on it I believe that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:25.169" style="s2">is the price I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.609" end="00:03:26.849" style="s2">it but I do believe it you think they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.169" end="00:03:28.440" style="s2">factually accurate factually that&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.849" end="00:03:30.239" style="s2">agree with you mean you think that this</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.440" end="00:03:31.530" style="s2">is actually a description of reality to</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.239" end="00:03:33.540" style="s2">the extent that there&#39;s a factual</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.530" end="00:03:36.120" style="s2">description of the selling price I agree</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.540" end="00:03:38.010" style="s2">that it is the selling price but my</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.120" end="00:03:39.389" style="s2">point would be why the hell are we in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.010" end="00:03:41.519" style="s2">situation where we&#39;re answering the</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.389" end="00:03:43.680" style="s2">question which parts of this incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.519" end="00:03:45.780" style="s2">insane book do we believe in is that a</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.680" end="00:03:48.000" style="s2">game now I mean which parts of mine comp</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.780" end="00:03:50.549" style="s2">do we believe it I mean no the book is</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.000" end="00:03:53.250" style="s2">so bad that searching for the good in it</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.549" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">is an insane exercise search for a book</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.250" end="00:03:56.970" style="s2">that is at least somewhat good before</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:58.379" style="s2">you try to find the parchment I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.970" end="00:04:01.470" style="s2">push back on this because many people</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.379" end="00:04:04.500" style="s2">you and I are lucky now not three years</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.470" end="00:04:05.730" style="s2">ago but that we we presumably never have</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.500" end="00:04:07.379" style="s2">to face one of these things again one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.730" end="00:04:08.970" style="s2">these trainings went you know a</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.379" end="00:04:10.829" style="s2">colleague coming up to you with sad eyes</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.970" end="00:04:12.720" style="s2">and saying can you just read the book</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.829" end="00:04:14.340" style="s2">yet then you&#39;ll understand just own your</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.720" end="00:04:15.720" style="s2">white supremacy right like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.340" end="00:04:18.840" style="s2">people are still having to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.720" end="00:04:21.150" style="s2">so being armed with okay here&#39;s a point</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.840" end="00:04:22.700" style="s2">that makes sense and you know and now</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.150" end="00:04:24.840" style="s2">that you&#39;ve know that I&#39;ve demonstrated</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.700" end="00:04:26.520" style="s2">my attempt at good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.840" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">understanding what is in this thing let</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.520" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">me explain to you why</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:33.229" style="s2">overall it is divisive demonic</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:35.870" style="s2">destabilizing of good political</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.229" end="00:04:38.210" style="s2">structure and all the rest I disagree</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.870" end="00:04:42.169" style="s2">with this that book is a Trojan horse</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.210" end="00:04:45.380" style="s2">and the idea that we are in some way</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.169" end="00:04:47.180" style="s2">required to spend our effort finding</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.380" end="00:04:49.849" style="s2">what might be acceptable in it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.180" end="00:04:53.860" style="s2">preposterous this is a bad person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.849" end="00:04:56.569" style="s2">written a dangerous book and the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.860" end="00:04:58.729" style="s2">there is a limited amount of time in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.569" end="00:05:00.889" style="s2">life if you&#39;re going to dedicate it to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.729" end="00:05:03.590" style="s2">books find one that actually helps you</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.889" end="00:05:05.539" style="s2">this one to read it to find the good in</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.590" end="00:05:09.169" style="s2">it you are likely to absorb garbage</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.539" end="00:05:10.940" style="s2">arguments so my point with you okay so</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.169" end="00:05:13.580" style="s2">I&#39;m just like I just read it as you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.940" end="00:05:15.380" style="s2">I know I had looked at parts of it when</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.580" end="00:05:16.759" style="s2">it came out but I actually because I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.380" end="00:05:18.259" style="s2">asked to write this piece I actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.759" end="00:05:21.530" style="s2">finally just sat down I read the damn</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.259" end="00:05:23.930" style="s2">thing which drove me a bit mad but I did</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.530" end="00:05:25.159" style="s2">so over the last couple of days and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.930" end="00:05:26.750" style="s2">know I wasn&#39;t reading it to find the</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.159" end="00:05:30.159" style="s2">good but I was reading it to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.750" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">you know what what what is there and</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.159" end="00:05:37.909" style="s2">what are the kernels of truth in this</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:41.289" style="s2">that is being used brandished as this as</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.909" end="00:05:43.729" style="s2">this marker of fealty in this movement</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.289" end="00:05:45.740" style="s2">is true that you can point to and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.729" end="00:05:47.900" style="s2">yes that thing is true that is real</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.740" end="00:05:51.620" style="s2">grievance that thing is true but this</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.900" end="00:05:53.840" style="s2">approach is nasty and reprehensible well</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.620" end="00:05:56.690" style="s2">but you also pointed out what I think</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.840" end="00:05:59.300" style="s2">neither of us knew there&#39;s a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.690" end="00:06:02.060" style="s2">tape of Robyn D&#39;Angelo speaking at</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.300" end="00:06:03.469" style="s2">Evergreen that Benjamin Boyce has shown</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.060" end="00:06:05.330" style="s2">and I believe Mike Nene and his</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.469" end="00:06:06.979" style="s2">documentary also shows it you know she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.330" end="00:06:08.270" style="s2">just shout out to Benjamin boy so I went</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.979" end="00:06:09.740" style="s2">to Benjamin when I told him I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.270" end="00:06:11.570" style="s2">asked to write this piece and said I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.740" end="00:06:13.039" style="s2">know you&#39;ve talked about Robin</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.039" end="00:06:17.180" style="s2">evergreen campus can you point me and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.080" end="00:06:18.889" style="s2">he&#39;s done in a number of places and he</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.180" end="00:06:22.370" style="s2">also directed me to the actually full</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.889" end="00:06:24.889" style="s2">video and man is that one when a piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.370" end="00:06:27.289" style="s2">of work yeah so she was she was there in</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.889" end="00:06:28.699" style="s2">spring of 2016 while we were actually in</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.289" end="00:06:30.199" style="s2">Ecuador it was just it was the same</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.699" end="00:06:33.860" style="s2">month as the boat accident that I almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.199" end="00:06:36.979" style="s2">died in in Galapagos and we see many of</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.860" end="00:06:41.540" style="s2">the usual suspects on campus speaking</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.979" end="00:06:45.380" style="s2">they&#39;re willfully ridiculous truths</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.540" end="00:06:48.590" style="s2">and we see her actively dividing people</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.380" end="00:06:49.880" style="s2">and in her language some of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.590" end="00:06:51.410" style="s2">that&#39;s not even in the book which wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.880" end="00:06:53.300" style="s2">out yet like the book came out in 2018</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.410" end="00:06:57.650" style="s2">but she was already doing her damage all</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.300" end="00:06:59.510" style="s2">over the place we see here in what she</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.650" end="00:07:01.130" style="s2">says even some of the turns of phrase we</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.510" end="00:07:02.690" style="s2">then saw from our own colleagues just</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.130" end="00:07:04.190" style="s2">months later that then took an entire</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.690" end="00:07:05.660" style="s2">College down right so then she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.190" end="00:07:09.290" style="s2">incredibly powerful this is my point</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.660" end="00:07:10.550" style="s2">yeah um that was a talk yeah but now had</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.290" end="00:07:11.810" style="s2">I been at Evergreen when she was there I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.550" end="00:07:14.030" style="s2">would have gone to that talk and I would</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.810" end="00:07:16.220" style="s2">have asked pointed questions and I&#39;m you</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.030" end="00:07:17.600" style="s2">know convinced that I understand my own</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.220" end="00:07:21.560" style="s2">mind well enough that I would not have</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.600" end="00:07:24.890" style="s2">been persuaded by her nonsense but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.560" end="00:07:28.130" style="s2">obviously lethal to people who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.890" end="00:07:30.740" style="s2">have the proper tools to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.130" end="00:07:31.940" style="s2">to escape the logical traps right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.740" end="00:07:33.290" style="s2">just saying if you&#39;re not expecting</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.940" end="00:07:34.850" style="s2">these traps they&#39;ll catch you off guard</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.290" end="00:07:38.840" style="s2">and you&#39;ll sign up for things that seem</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.850" end="00:07:40.640" style="s2">safe and they won&#39;t be so I for the very</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.840" end="00:07:43.250" style="s2">same reason that I think it is not safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.640" end="00:07:44.750" style="s2">to have her visitor campus and lecture</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.250" end="00:07:47.180" style="s2">people on the racism that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.750" end="00:07:50.000" style="s2">know is in their own minds it&#39;s not safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.180" end="00:07:51.770" style="s2">to assign people the job of figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.000" end="00:07:55.310" style="s2">what good exists in her book it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.770" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">garbage book fair enough</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.310" end="00:07:58.790" style="s2">so these two just comments from last</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:00.710" style="s2">time that I wanted to share because I</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.790" end="00:08:03.080" style="s2">was so I was so touched by them thank</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.710" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">you I have a 17 year old son who was</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.080" end="00:08:09.140" style="s2">about to march off to college I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:11.390" style="s2">lock him in his room if I could and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.140" end="00:08:13.910" style="s2">too you know speaking to the craziness</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.390" end="00:08:15.500" style="s2">on college campuses specifically and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.910" end="00:08:17.690" style="s2">to help me figure out I wanted to apply</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.500" end="00:08:19.310" style="s2">for a PhD in biotechnology I got the</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.690" end="00:08:20.480" style="s2">position on Friday thank you so much for</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.310" end="00:08:22.670" style="s2">the inspiration keep up the great work</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.480" end="00:08:25.190" style="s2">congratulations awesome that is awesome</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.670" end="00:08:27.890" style="s2">congratulations all right on to</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.190" end="00:08:30.770" style="s2">questions from the last hour I have a</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.890" end="00:08:32.150" style="s2">friend who wakes around 3 to 4 a.m. for</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.770" end="00:08:34.490" style="s2">about an hour then goes back to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.150" end="00:08:36.260" style="s2">she has suffered some trauma and anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.490" end="00:08:37.700" style="s2">I&#39;m aware that some cultures may</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.260" end="00:08:39.560" style="s2">different sleep patterns what could be</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.700" end="00:08:41.120" style="s2">going on here and it looks done the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.560" end="00:08:42.169" style="s2">question in the private Q&amp;A so we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.120" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">want to just touch on this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.169" end="00:08:46.850" style="s2">and then probably we&#39;ll come back to it</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:49.190" style="s2">yeah it sounds like a very normal</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.850" end="00:08:51.830" style="s2">pattern actually exactly I&#39;m that yet a</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.190" end="00:08:52.500" style="s2">unbroken night of sleep is an unusual</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.830" end="00:08:54.600" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.500" end="00:08:56.940" style="s2">perhaps not the healthiest thing there</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.600" end="00:08:58.320" style="s2">is something to be said for a break in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.940" end="00:09:00.450" style="s2">the middle it&#39;s very common that people</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:03.660" style="s2">who have good good sleep cycles do this</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.450" end="00:09:06.270" style="s2">and insofar as it&#39;s been looked at by</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.660" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">anthropologists many hunter-gatherer</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.270" end="00:09:09.360" style="s2">societies I actually don&#39;t know if there</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">are exceptions to this I just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.360" end="00:09:13.350" style="s2">how many anthropologists have looked</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:15.390" style="s2">specifically at sleep cycles but several</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.350" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">and I can&#39;t recall at the moment which</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.390" end="00:09:21.660" style="s2">which people which peoples do exactly</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:24.120" style="s2">this it&#39;s neatly not quite so late in</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.660" end="00:09:25.890" style="s2">the night but you know sitting around a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.120" end="00:09:28.710" style="s2">snare and a fire yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.890" end="00:09:31.230" style="s2">go to bed sleep for three or four hours</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.710" end="00:09:33.540" style="s2">and then get up and actually do some</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.230" end="00:09:35.790" style="s2">some work or just conversation which is</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.540" end="00:09:37.650" style="s2">a kind of work in many cases for an hour</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.790" end="00:09:38.970" style="s2">or two and then go back to sleep for</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.650" end="00:09:42.720" style="s2">another three or four hours and this</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.970" end="00:09:46.590" style="s2">also apparently is known from some era</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.720" end="00:09:48.300" style="s2">in second millennial Europe I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.590" end="00:09:50.340" style="s2">remember exactly what I do not know my</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.300" end="00:09:51.510" style="s2">sort of Medieval and Renaissance and</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.340" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">enlightenment European history very well</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.510" end="00:09:56.820" style="s2">but there&#39;s some evidence that many</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:09:59.940" style="s2">people were doing that then whenever</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.820" end="00:10:04.170" style="s2">that exactly then was yep now I find on</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.940" end="00:10:06.210" style="s2">a related note that if I am sleeping and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.170" end="00:10:09.480" style="s2">I wake up in the middle of the night and</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.210" end="00:10:11.160" style="s2">I make contact with the clock now this</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.480" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">is obviously not a natural pattern but</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.160" end="00:10:13.350" style="s2">if I figure out what time it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:15.690" style="s2">middle of the night and there&#39;s a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.350" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">of hours left to sleep having gone to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.690" end="00:10:18.990" style="s2">sleep again</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:21.150" style="s2">having seen the clock I tend to wake up</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.990" end="00:10:22.500" style="s2">at exactly the right moment so I&#39;m at</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.150" end="00:10:24.570" style="s2">the right place in my sleep cycle and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.500" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">that probably has a huge positive impact</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.570" end="00:10:28.050" style="s2">on all sorts of things waking up in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:29.670" style="s2">middle of your sleep cycle because your</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.050" end="00:10:32.610" style="s2">alarm clock suddenly decided you should</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.670" end="00:10:37.320" style="s2">be out of bed is at least very stressful</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.610" end="00:10:40.230" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so damaging so that would have</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.320" end="00:10:41.730" style="s2">been perfectly possible to do under some</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.230" end="00:10:44.610" style="s2">but not all circumstances in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.730" end="00:10:45.870" style="s2">pre-industrial era where even if you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.610" end="00:10:47.250" style="s2">were not sleeping outside you could</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.870" end="00:10:48.810" style="s2">easily go outside and look at the moon</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.250" end="00:10:51.089" style="s2">the position the other moon and so this</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.810" end="00:10:53.339" style="s2">requires that you not only know what the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.089" end="00:10:54.750" style="s2">phase of the Moon is but what that phase</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.339" end="00:10:56.520" style="s2">means about where the moon will be in</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.750" end="00:10:59.520" style="s2">the sky and you can&#39;t do it as reliably</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.520" end="00:11:01.050" style="s2">the closer to new it is but you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.520" end="00:11:02.820" style="s2">given that the full moon rises</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.050" end="00:11:04.730" style="s2">approximately at sundown depending on</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.820" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">how close you are to the equator</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.730" end="00:11:10.550" style="s2">and you know Rises an hour-ish later</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:14.990" style="s2">every every night as it wanes and</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:17.959" style="s2">approaches again rising around sundown</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.990" end="00:11:19.579" style="s2">as it approaches fall if you know that</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.959" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">yeah that all sounded like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.579" end="00:11:22.190" style="s2">words and how would you exactly form a</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.959" end="00:11:23.449" style="s2">model of that well of course she would</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.190" end="00:11:25.579" style="s2">anyone who spent a lot of time outside</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.449" end="00:11:27.889" style="s2">you know doing say research in</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.579" end="00:11:29.990" style="s2">Madagascar or backpacking or just in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.889" end="00:11:31.730" style="s2">background tree comes to understand</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.990" end="00:11:33.290" style="s2">these patterns and you internalize it</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.730" end="00:11:35.449" style="s2">and it is a clock it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.290" end="00:11:38.750" style="s2">the precision of a clock but it is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.449" end="00:11:40.339" style="s2">clock yep and they&#39;re also oh sorry yeah</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.750" end="00:11:42.829" style="s2">it won&#39;t work around the new moon it</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.339" end="00:11:46.970" style="s2">won&#39;t work with cloud cover really right</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.829" end="00:11:49.579" style="s2">there&#39;s also in every place on earth</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.970" end="00:11:51.139" style="s2">local patterns which you couldn&#39;t global</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.579" end="00:11:52.399" style="s2">eyes can say this is the pattern but</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.139" end="00:11:55.070" style="s2">they&#39;re things that you learn if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:57.019" style="s2">there sounds of birds and insects and</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.070" end="00:12:00.170" style="s2">such yeah when I was working on bats</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.019" end="00:12:01.579" style="s2">when I was radio tracking active bats</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.170" end="00:12:05.000" style="s2">you go out at night you&#39;re up all night</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.579" end="00:12:06.649" style="s2">and the sounds are very different at</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.000" end="00:12:08.029" style="s2">dawn and at dusk and in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.649" end="00:12:10.339" style="s2">the night and you know you would have</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.029" end="00:12:13.190" style="s2">some idea how many hours had passed</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.339" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">based on on what you were hearing and</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.190" end="00:12:19.370" style="s2">then like I mean like in every place</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:20.510" style="s2">that I&#39;ve been in the tropics where you</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.370" end="00:12:22.910" style="s2">know I&#39;m particularly attuned to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.510" end="00:12:24.350" style="s2">frog calls that you know well I have</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.910" end="00:12:26.630" style="s2">focused on the diurnal frogs the</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.350" end="00:12:28.100" style="s2">nocturnal frogs are much more common but</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.630" end="00:12:30.709" style="s2">two in the morning there&#39;s very little</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.100" end="00:12:33.699" style="s2">frog call the so called nocturnal frogs</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.709" end="00:12:37.130" style="s2">tend to start calling around dusk and</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.699" end="00:12:39.680" style="s2">they and so near the tropics you call it</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.130" end="00:12:41.480" style="s2">basically 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. is daytime so</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:43.760" style="s2">they&#39;ll start calling around 6 p.m. or</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.480" end="00:12:47.089" style="s2">so by midnight they&#39;re pretty much done</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.760" end="00:12:49.069" style="s2">and then you&#39;ll start hearing maybe some</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.089" end="00:12:50.690" style="s2">of them again around 5 a.m. or so so if</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.069" end="00:12:51.860" style="s2">you wake up and there&#39;s no frog call at</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.690" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">all you know at least you&#39;re sort of in</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.860" end="00:12:55.550" style="s2">the middle of the night and then in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:13:00.410" style="s2">depth of the night yeah sorry no that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.550" end="00:13:02.089" style="s2">all right ah we do in the past most</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.410" end="00:13:04.010" style="s2">everyone participated in making music</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.089" end="00:13:06.350" style="s2">through folk or religious later state</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.010" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">traditions religion morality history and</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.350" end="00:13:10.220" style="s2">pedagogy were incorporated into verse do</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:13.040" style="s2">you think modern recorded music has</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.220" end="00:13:15.439" style="s2">adequately filled this role no not you</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.040" end="00:13:17.209" style="s2">know it is no it&#39;s in fact it destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.439" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">our relationship to music and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.209" end="00:13:20.460" style="s2">the relationship to each other that</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:22.230" style="s2">used to have through music and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.460" end="00:13:26.340" style="s2">tragedy and it&#39;s not the only one of</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.230" end="00:13:28.470" style="s2">these either the loss of a romantic</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.340" end="00:13:30.240" style="s2">dancing tradition I think is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.470" end="00:13:31.530" style="s2">destructive and has resulted in all</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.240" end="00:13:35.310" style="s2">kinds of carnage that we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.530" end="00:13:36.690" style="s2">think of as related so anyway yes all</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.310" end="00:13:39.510" style="s2">sorts of things you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.690" end="00:13:41.130" style="s2">Chesterton&#39;s offense if you wear lots of</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.510" end="00:13:42.900" style="s2">things in which it was a little hard to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.130" end="00:13:46.350" style="s2">put your finger on exactly what the</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.900" end="00:13:47.670" style="s2">utility of X Y &amp; Z was you eliminate the</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.350" end="00:13:49.050" style="s2">thing because you couldn&#39;t tell and</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.670" end="00:13:51.060" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;ve caused some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.050" end="00:13:53.460" style="s2">pathology that you don&#39;t even realize is</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.060" end="00:13:57.720" style="s2">connected yeah so not so the recorded</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.460" end="00:13:59.700" style="s2">music is not just not live so you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.720" end="00:14:01.500" style="s2">exchanging information directly with the</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.700" end="00:14:04.830" style="s2">musicians and you&#39;re not participating</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.500" end="00:14:07.560" style="s2">in making music yourself but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.830" end="00:14:09.210" style="s2">static form of music so you go back and</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.560" end="00:14:11.310" style="s2">hear exactly the same thing over and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.210" end="00:14:13.320" style="s2">over and over again and that never would</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.310" end="00:14:15.300" style="s2">have been possible yeah before so there</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.320" end="00:14:18.000" style="s2">was information there was valuable</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.300" end="00:14:19.860" style="s2">information in the ways that songs</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.000" end="00:14:22.320" style="s2">changed and not just you know not just</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.860" end="00:14:24.510" style="s2">lyrical content not just actual words</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.320" end="00:14:27.660" style="s2">but in the way so the tempo changed</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.510" end="00:14:30.210" style="s2">maybe maybe you know maybe the key maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.660" end="00:14:32.430" style="s2">the tambour maybe the pitch you know all</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.210" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">of these things a song is actually a</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.430" end="00:14:36.570" style="s2">living entity that develops over time</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:39.330" style="s2">and we have turned them into static</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.570" end="00:14:41.850" style="s2">entities where you you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.330" end="00:14:44.460" style="s2">exactly how much cowbell there is in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.850" end="00:14:48.780" style="s2">song and you know yeah your demands for</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.460" end="00:14:51.000" style="s2">more of it or go unheated yes are their</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.780" end="00:14:52.860" style="s2">evolutionary ties to songs or portions</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.000" end="00:14:54.930" style="s2">of songs being stuck in our heads if so</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.860" end="00:14:56.220" style="s2">what&#39;s the utility also thank all of you</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.930" end="00:14:58.050" style="s2">at Dark Horse I love the show</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.220" end="00:15:00.030" style="s2">well actually I think these two things</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.050" end="00:15:01.950" style="s2">may be related yeah that&#39;s why I put it</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.030" end="00:15:03.990" style="s2">here yeah the earworm phenomenon may</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.950" end="00:15:07.680" style="s2">well be about the fact that your brain</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.990" end="00:15:10.020" style="s2">gets trained to a particular instance of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.680" end="00:15:11.190" style="s2">a song such that it gets recorded in</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.020" end="00:15:14.460" style="s2">your mind in a way that it would be</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.190" end="00:15:17.640" style="s2">recorded much more generally right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.460" end="00:15:19.140" style="s2">so anyway it&#39;s likely that that has some</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.640" end="00:15:20.340" style="s2">interface with it but I would guess I</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.140" end="00:15:22.230" style="s2">mean it&#39;d be very interesting to find</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.340" end="00:15:24.780" style="s2">out whether hunter-gatherers who have no</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.230" end="00:15:27.000" style="s2">contact with modern music ever get ear</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.780" end="00:15:29.250" style="s2">worms or DejaVu or any one of a number</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.000" end="00:15:31.830" style="s2">of other things yeah be great to know</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.250" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">the questions anthropologist should be</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.830" end="00:15:36.110" style="s2">well I have long argued that we better</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:38.610" style="s2">figure out what it is that</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.110" end="00:15:40.770" style="s2">hunter-gatherers dream about to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.610" end="00:15:42.570" style="s2">extent that we do not know what normal</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.770" end="00:15:44.010" style="s2">dreams look like it would be really</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.570" end="00:15:46.890" style="s2">important to figure that out before</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.010" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">there is no one left to ask yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.890" end="00:15:51.750" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be a lot of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:54.540" style="s2">variability on whether or not they even</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.750" end="00:15:57.540" style="s2">encode what happens in their dreams as</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.540" end="00:15:59.430" style="s2">something that can be recalled right and</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.540" end="00:16:01.560" style="s2">it&#39;s not saying maybe they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.430" end="00:16:04.080" style="s2">remember their dreams I&#39;m saying you</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.560" end="00:16:05.430" style="s2">know we all we all all humans I will I</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.080" end="00:16:07.200" style="s2">will pause it without having the</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.430" end="00:16:08.460" style="s2">evidence to back it up but all humans I</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.200" end="00:16:10.620" style="s2">will say remember some of our dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.460" end="00:16:13.380" style="s2">not others yeah but I suspected the</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.620" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">ability to recall consciously when asked</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.380" end="00:16:17.430" style="s2">or when even just asked to think about</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:19.380" style="s2">it privately is going to be culturally</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.430" end="00:16:22.530" style="s2">informed by whether or not there&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.380" end="00:16:24.420" style="s2">discussion in your in your milieu well I</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.530" end="00:16:25.950" style="s2">would say unless it&#39;s taboo which it may</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.420" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">be I don&#39;t know it to be anywhere but</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.950" end="00:16:30.810" style="s2">unless it&#39;s taboo everybody&#39;s gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:32.340" style="s2">the experience of recalling some dreams</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.810" end="00:16:36.330" style="s2">and there will be some discussion about</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.340" end="00:16:37.560" style="s2">it no I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true I would I</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.330" end="00:16:39.390" style="s2">would be shocked if it wasn&#39;t again</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.560" end="00:16:41.490" style="s2">there may be a taboo against it for</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.390" end="00:16:43.460" style="s2">reasons there may be good reasons that</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.490" end="00:16:47.610" style="s2">some cultures aren&#39;t involved in it but</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.460" end="00:16:49.290" style="s2">it it seems highly likely that absent a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.610" end="00:16:51.210" style="s2">prohibition the discovery that you have</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">awakened with some sort of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.210" end="00:16:57.510" style="s2">experience just prior would it would</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:58.830" style="s2">naturally come up sometimes and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.510" end="00:17:00.560" style="s2">anyway I think you would get an answer</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.830" end="00:17:03.270" style="s2">to the question anywhere that it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.560" end="00:17:05.400" style="s2">taboo but I would be curious for example</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.270" end="00:17:07.380" style="s2">whether people who have never had the</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.400" end="00:17:09.900" style="s2">experience of flying</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.380" end="00:17:11.850" style="s2">for example ever have the experience in</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.900" end="00:17:13.890" style="s2">a dream is that normal does the</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.850" end="00:17:16.350" style="s2">experience oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:18.930" style="s2">absolutely how do you know I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.350" end="00:17:20.839" style="s2">don&#39;t but I feel like flying in dreams</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.930" end="00:17:24.150" style="s2">isn&#39;t about airplanes it&#39;s about birds</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.839" end="00:17:26.010" style="s2">well I would let&#39;s put it this way I</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.150" end="00:17:29.790" style="s2">take note sir you made plenty plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.010" end="00:17:32.970" style="s2">plenty of people who live in countries</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.790" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">with a lot of air flight don&#39;t fly and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.970" end="00:17:37.080" style="s2">yet still writing but even so we all</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:38.850" style="s2">have the experience and you know movies</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.080" end="00:17:40.950" style="s2">and things so we don&#39;t know how much</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.850" end="00:17:43.110" style="s2">we&#39;ve got sort of contagious fodder for</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.950" end="00:17:43.980" style="s2">dreams and I do know from running the</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.110" end="00:17:46.530" style="s2">experiment in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.980" end="00:17:49.440" style="s2">many of my classes of asking people to</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.530" end="00:17:51.660" style="s2">try to report what their dreams are like</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.440" end="00:17:53.610" style="s2">mm-hmm that the variation in what dreams</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.660" end="00:17:54.630" style="s2">are like is absolutely spectacular</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.610" end="00:17:56.190" style="s2">the Headless dreams don&#39;t look anything</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.630" end="00:17:58.980" style="s2">like mine okay well I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.190" end="00:18:01.470" style="s2">there&#39;s an interesting disparity here</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.980" end="00:18:03.870" style="s2">that I think it is far more likely that</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.470" end="00:18:05.700" style="s2">flying in dreams is universal but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.870" end="00:18:06.990" style="s2">speaking about dreams is not universal</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.700" end="00:18:08.130" style="s2">across cultures and you think the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.990" end="00:18:10.410" style="s2">opposite you know I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.130" end="00:18:11.790" style="s2">opposite I&#39;m not I would I would not be</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.410" end="00:18:13.590" style="s2">shocked if flying is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.790" end="00:18:15.870" style="s2">universal but what I&#39;d like to know is</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.590" end="00:18:18.030" style="s2">that that is the case before I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.870" end="00:18:23.060" style="s2">assume it is because it&#39;s a ubiquitous</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.030" end="00:18:25.800" style="s2">feature of modern dreams yeah cool let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.060" end="00:18:28.140" style="s2">say we end up talking about dreams and</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.800" end="00:18:32.040" style="s2">the question about songs right that was</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.140" end="00:18:34.920" style="s2">the songs question I think a question do</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.040" end="00:18:37.170" style="s2">you have opinions on in this together</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.920" end="00:18:38.730" style="s2">america.org do you know what this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.170" end="00:18:40.560" style="s2">Bret I pulled it up but I haven&#39;t had</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.730" end="00:18:43.410" style="s2">time to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.560" end="00:18:45.240" style="s2">declaration of interdependence you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.410" end="00:18:47.220" style="s2">declaration of interdependence that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:49.080" style="s2">what it says this is a title I have used</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.220" end="00:18:51.600" style="s2">for a document I have written myself and</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.080" end="00:18:53.370" style="s2">be curious what they have gotten yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.600" end="00:18:57.750" style="s2">they do use that title I don&#39;t know I</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.370" end="00:19:00.150" style="s2">love that title so I will put this in</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.750" end="00:19:03.150" style="s2">yellow and we&#39;ll take a look and try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.150" end="00:19:05.070" style="s2">revisit this next Q&amp;A okay okay and</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.150" end="00:19:07.260" style="s2">similarly there&#39;s a couple more like</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.070" end="00:19:09.590" style="s2">that someone asks if we could revisit a</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.260" end="00:19:13.470" style="s2">thread let me know your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.590" end="00:19:14.910" style="s2">depredation given how much money they</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.470" end="00:19:16.440" style="s2">threw at the problem we will take you</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.910" end="00:19:20.010" style="s2">take at least a quick look and revisit</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.440" end="00:19:23.970" style="s2">next time also a patreon message about</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.010" end="00:19:25.740" style="s2">guerrilla artwork that we will spend a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.970" end="00:19:28.230" style="s2">moment next time looking at okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.740" end="00:19:29.400" style="s2">guerrilla artwork actually I have an</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.230" end="00:19:31.890" style="s2">interesting story about guerrilla</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.400" end="00:19:35.190" style="s2">artwork maybe we&#39;ll return to it okay I</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.890" end="00:19:36.480" style="s2">mean we can we can do this one now sent</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.190" end="00:19:37.920" style="s2">a hurried patreon message about my</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.480" end="00:19:40.260" style="s2">guerrilla artwork revising and abridging</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.920" end="00:19:42.780" style="s2">as someone still drenched in the filth</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.260" end="00:19:44.220" style="s2">of our societal subterfuge what siren of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.780" end="00:19:46.290" style="s2">truth can I sound without simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.220" end="00:19:50.910" style="s2">amplifying my perceived ethical</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.290" end="00:19:52.590" style="s2">shortcomings so it sounds cool but I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.910" end="00:19:53.940" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t really know my sympathies</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.590" end="00:19:55.470" style="s2">I love the question yes</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.940" end="00:19:56.880" style="s2">yeah no you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.470" end="00:19:59.159" style="s2">look totally the solution to this</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.880" end="00:20:00.720" style="s2">involves narrative it involves art it</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.159" end="00:20:03.330" style="s2">involves music you&#39;re on the right track</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.720" end="00:20:05.070" style="s2">so yeah let&#39;s put some thought into what</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.330" end="00:20:08.030" style="s2">messages might be amplified and how it</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.070" end="00:20:10.650" style="s2">could be done okay cool</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.030" end="00:20:12.179" style="s2">next question I think a current problem</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.650" end="00:20:13.740" style="s2">is using current morality for past</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.179" end="00:20:15.510" style="s2">choices absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.740" end="00:20:16.799" style="s2">couple that with conflating those past</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.510" end="00:20:18.059" style="s2">choices with current morality and</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.799" end="00:20:19.380" style="s2">pulling it into the present is very</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.059" end="00:20:20.789" style="s2">harmful basically I don&#39;t think we</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.380" end="00:20:23.370" style="s2">should have a societal book of grudges</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.789" end="00:20:25.320" style="s2">happy for us yeah now and this is when</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.370" end="00:20:26.370" style="s2">you were talking about monuments you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.320" end="00:20:28.740" style="s2">know I agreed with everything you said</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.370" end="00:20:30.120" style="s2">but I also just thought I cannot believe</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.740" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">we&#39;re here like why why does this</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.120" end="00:20:36.330" style="s2">require any discussion at all haven&#39;t we</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:38.429" style="s2">been over this one many many times and</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.330" end="00:20:43.049" style="s2">exactly this form the idea of erasing</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.429" end="00:20:45.450" style="s2">history as a response to you know as if</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.049" end="00:20:47.280" style="s2">these kids mostly right are suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.450" end="00:20:51.659" style="s2">recognizing that atrocities happened</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.280" end="00:20:52.980" style="s2">like okay as we know this atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.659" end="00:20:56.220" style="s2">happened that doesn&#39;t mean that the</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.980" end="00:20:58.350" style="s2">response is to tear down the people who</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.220" end="00:21:00.900" style="s2">were adjacent to them or who did them</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.350" end="00:21:04.500" style="s2">well all right now I&#39;m gonna push back a</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.900" end="00:21:06.720" style="s2">little bit okay some monuments aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.500" end="00:21:09.900" style="s2">despicable and need to come down in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.720" end="00:21:14.309" style="s2">way right so you remember the the Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.900" end="00:21:18.120" style="s2">Eagle that famously was blown up and</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.309" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">destroyed on film after the war yep</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.120" end="00:21:26.640" style="s2">that Eagle can&#39;t stay Yeah right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:30.090" style="s2">there are also statues hold on interrupt</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.640" end="00:21:32.130" style="s2">you it was blown down then by the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.090" end="00:21:33.600" style="s2">who were conquering Nazi Germany and</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.130" end="00:21:37.260" style="s2">getting rid of the threat right and</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.600" end="00:21:40.200" style="s2">they&#39;re toppling statues now but they</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.260" end="00:21:42.090" style="s2">were responding that that was a history</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.200" end="00:21:44.429" style="s2">was being made in Nazi Germany yes has</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.090" end="00:21:46.140" style="s2">been made now they are responding to</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.429" end="00:21:47.669" style="s2">something that happened hundreds and</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.140" end="00:21:49.440" style="s2">hundred two hundred thirteen years ago</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.669" end="00:21:51.260" style="s2">my point is that the Nazi Eagle that was</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.440" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">destroyed and I&#39;m not saying that all</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.260" end="00:21:57.450" style="s2">monuments need to stand obviously but</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:59.490" style="s2">when was it the Americans who destroyed</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.450" end="00:22:02.460" style="s2">the Nazi Eagle I think right they</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.490" end="00:22:05.429" style="s2">marched in to a regime that was actively</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.460" end="00:22:07.500" style="s2">proclaiming that thing as virtuous and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.429" end="00:22:08.100" style="s2">in the moment like that was side by side</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.500" end="00:22:10.770" style="s2">in time</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.100" end="00:22:12.990" style="s2">space and this is side-by-side in space</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.770" end="00:22:15.539" style="s2">but not in time there is a remove right</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.990" end="00:22:18.120" style="s2">but that remove means very little to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.539" end="00:22:20.039" style="s2">right my point is that these people</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.120" end="00:22:22.679" style="s2">believe this is the moment at which they</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.039" end="00:22:24.570" style="s2">are confronting such a regime now they</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.679" end="00:22:26.370" style="s2">are wrong they are making up history in</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.570" end="00:22:29.309" style="s2">order to justify this but the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.370" end="00:22:31.169" style="s2">the well okay but when are you and when</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.309" end="00:22:34.919" style="s2">aren&#39;t you that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.169" end="00:22:36.510" style="s2">so they are doing something and my guess</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.919" end="00:22:38.190" style="s2">is if we looked at all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.510" end="00:22:40.020" style="s2">that they are confronting that there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.190" end="00:22:42.840" style="s2">actually statues which are deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.020" end="00:22:45.720" style="s2">a finger in the eye right and that those</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.840" end="00:22:47.250" style="s2">statues are a problem and the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.720" end="00:22:50.130" style="s2">that just like they are going to tear</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.250" end="00:22:51.809" style="s2">down people and this week okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.130" end="00:22:53.820" style="s2">we&#39;ve arrived at Steven Pinker yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.809" end="00:22:56.909" style="s2">right Steven Pinker is going to be torn</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.820" end="00:22:58.169" style="s2">down now I haven&#39;t I think Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.909" end="00:23:00.150" style="s2">is wrong about some important stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.169" end="00:23:01.620" style="s2">nonetheless the idea that Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.150" end="00:23:03.270" style="s2">is a vile racist who must be torn down</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.620" end="00:23:05.940" style="s2">is a bit preposterous</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.270" end="00:23:08.280" style="s2">it&#39;s totally preposterous right so the</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.940" end="00:23:10.500" style="s2">point is there are statues out there</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.280" end="00:23:12.360" style="s2">which are truly problematic to use the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.500" end="00:23:14.130" style="s2">vernacular and there are statues out</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.360" end="00:23:16.200" style="s2">there that are debatable and there are</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.130" end="00:23:19.049" style="s2">statues out there that must stand and</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.200" end="00:23:21.360" style="s2">somehow in the space of a week we are</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.049" end="00:23:23.490" style="s2">you know we are dealing with tearing</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.360" end="00:23:24.270" style="s2">down the Steven Pinker&#39;s and the George</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.490" end="00:23:28.110" style="s2">Washington&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.270" end="00:23:29.820" style="s2">right but the point is you know it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.110" end="00:23:32.940" style="s2">never-ending game of would you believe</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.820" end="00:23:36.390" style="s2">you know from Get Smart where the idea</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.940" end="00:23:39.179" style="s2">is they keep upping the ante of these of</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.390" end="00:23:41.400" style="s2">these claims that something is so</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.179" end="00:23:42.659" style="s2">terrible that it is finally time that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.400" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">can recognize it and tear it down and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.659" end="00:23:47.010" style="s2">the point is everybody&#39;s on the list but</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:48.659" style="s2">I mean I feel like you&#39;re making the</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.010" end="00:23:51.270" style="s2">point of the person with the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.659" end="00:23:55.710" style="s2">and my point as well which is that if</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.270" end="00:23:58.049" style="s2">you go back into into history and try to</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.710" end="00:24:00.299" style="s2">use the morals of today on the</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.049" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">historical figures you will always find</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.299" end="00:24:03.690" style="s2">them walking you will always find modern</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:06.179" style="s2">people lacking as well but especially</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.690" end="00:24:08.429" style="s2">the longer in history you go back the</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.179" end="00:24:10.380" style="s2">less likely they are to resemble the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.429" end="00:24:12.270" style="s2">morals of today and the easier it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.380" end="00:24:16.830" style="s2">going to be to decide they&#39;re not worthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.270" end="00:24:18.900" style="s2">of our respect and that is a naivete</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.830" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">that is patently dangerous right but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.900" end="00:24:24.059" style="s2">fact is we fought the Civil War</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:25.799" style="s2">I mean we fought the civil war we fought</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.059" end="00:24:29.690" style="s2">the civil war because many people</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.799" end="00:24:32.940" style="s2">understood that the justifications for</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.690" end="00:24:35.120" style="s2">slavery were absolutely despicable and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.940" end="00:24:37.710" style="s2">unsupportable and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.120" end="00:24:40.320" style="s2">memorializing the Confederacy was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.710" end="00:24:41.970" style="s2">at the time it&#39;s still wrong so it does</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.320" end="00:24:44.460" style="s2">not mean that so I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.970" end="00:24:47.330" style="s2">positive of that but but I&#39;ll accept so</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.460" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">anyway all I&#39;m saying is there is no</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.330" end="00:24:51.929" style="s2">algorithmic way to do this right you try</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:53.549" style="s2">to write the algorithm and there&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.929" end="00:24:56.040" style="s2">to be carnage that is the result of it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.549" end="00:24:58.380" style="s2">and so in light of that we have to have</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.040" end="00:24:59.970" style="s2">a good faith discussion about the costs</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.380" end="00:25:02.040" style="s2">and benefits of various things and it</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.970" end="00:25:03.450" style="s2">may be that you know the Nazi eagle</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.040" end="00:25:06.630" style="s2">should have been moved into a museum</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.450" end="00:25:09.390" style="s2">about despicable things right but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.630" end="00:25:12.929" style="s2">tendency to see the symbols of a culture</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.390" end="00:25:15.360" style="s2">that has transgressed as themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.929" end="00:25:16.740" style="s2">transgressive and to want to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.360" end="00:25:18.510" style="s2">something about it is a normal human</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.740" end="00:25:19.830" style="s2">thing and the problem is that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.510" end="00:25:21.630" style="s2">reaction which is that all of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.830" end="00:25:23.370" style="s2">things should be preserved because</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.630" end="00:25:25.470" style="s2">they&#39;re simply historical and in their</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.370" end="00:25:27.929" style="s2">context they were okay that can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.470" end="00:25:31.850" style="s2">right so it&#39;s it&#39;s a difficult puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.929" end="00:25:35.700" style="s2">and you know I mean we&#39;re tearing down</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.850" end="00:25:40.290" style="s2">George Washington Steven Pinker and in</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.700" end="00:25:42.600" style="s2">the center of Portland a bonfire was lit</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.290" end="00:25:43.919" style="s2">under this beautiful statue of an elk</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.600" end="00:25:45.780" style="s2">which is he can make just now gone</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.919" end="00:25:49.620" style="s2">they&#39;ve taken it down they&#39;ve taken it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.780" end="00:25:53.070" style="s2">down so they win they the the city of</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.620" end="00:25:54.570" style="s2">Portland had to spend to take down a</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.070" end="00:25:56.429" style="s2">hundred and twenty something year old</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.570" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">beautiful statue of an elk because elk</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.429" end="00:26:01.830" style="s2">are racist I don&#39;t even know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:04.140" style="s2">impossible it&#39;s impossible it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.830" end="00:26:07.740" style="s2">incoherent it&#39;s simple destruction and</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.140" end="00:26:11.309" style="s2">my point so I you&#39;re going to say and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.740" end="00:26:13.770" style="s2">think I will agree with you that even a</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.309" end="00:26:15.630" style="s2">rubric around decisions about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.770" end="00:26:19.830" style="s2">monuments from the past may have</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.630" end="00:26:24.630" style="s2">outlived their virtue and and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.830" end="00:26:27.690" style="s2">utility should not happen at the hands</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.630" end="00:26:30.030" style="s2">of a violent mob you never oh so you so</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.690" end="00:26:32.760" style="s2">you do agree with that oh yeah I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.030" end="00:26:34.830" style="s2">for seeing people pull down public</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.760" end="00:26:36.750" style="s2">monuments because David decides</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.830" end="00:26:38.250" style="s2">the disagreement is whether or not some</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.750" end="00:26:40.290" style="s2">of these monuments need to come down by</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.250" end="00:26:42.060" style="s2">some process in which we discuss what it</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.290" end="00:26:44.610" style="s2">is that they are memorialized okay oh</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.060" end="00:26:45.990" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m not advocating oh boy this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.610" end="00:26:47.100" style="s2">the second time this week that people</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.990" end="00:26:51.570" style="s2">have thought I was ready to pull down</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.100" end="00:26:54.570" style="s2">monuments no I mean but you are arguing</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:26:56.340" style="s2">for for the fact that some monuments</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.570" end="00:26:57.780" style="s2">will need to be pulled down or or or</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.340" end="00:26:59.010" style="s2">would be we&#39;d be better off with</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.780" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">somebody else pulled down I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.010" end="00:27:01.980" style="s2">I disagree with you there I thought that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:04.440" style="s2">you were actually arguing and I can</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.980" end="00:27:07.980" style="s2">actually find some truth in this that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.440" end="00:27:11.970" style="s2">sometimes monuments will sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.980" end="00:27:14.310" style="s2">society might be better off if people</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.970" end="00:27:16.140" style="s2">who are not in charge of deciding what</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.310" end="00:27:17.760" style="s2">monuments get to stand and not are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.140" end="00:27:20.100" style="s2">ones who actually say you know what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.760" end="00:27:21.630" style="s2">done you&#39;re not listening and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.100" end="00:27:23.280" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take it into my own hands</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.630" end="00:27:27.030" style="s2">now this what&#39;s happening on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.280" end="00:27:29.370" style="s2">is insane and incoherent yeah but the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.030" end="00:27:31.740" style="s2">idea that it always has to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.370" end="00:27:32.370" style="s2">hands of the gatekeepers is also not</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.740" end="00:27:34.380" style="s2">safe</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.370" end="00:27:35.970" style="s2">well this is part of my point is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.380" end="00:27:37.830" style="s2">algorithmically this is very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.970" end="00:27:38.790" style="s2">to do but you have to have a process it</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.830" end="00:27:40.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be an algorithmic</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.790" end="00:27:42.030" style="s2">process but you have to have a process</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.500" end="00:27:42.390" style="s2">that at least knows what the objective</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.030" end="00:27:45.390" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.390" end="00:27:47.910" style="s2">right so anyway I&#39;d blow up the Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.390" end="00:27:49.340" style="s2">Eagle sure it&#39;s already been done oh</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.910" end="00:27:54.600" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.340" end="00:27:59.030" style="s2">fair points yes do the reservations</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.600" end="00:28:02.430" style="s2">become States that&#39;s the question I</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.030" end="00:28:05.310" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think so yeah I think it</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.430" end="00:28:07.050" style="s2">creates problems it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.310" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">reparations which is I get what problem</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.050" end="00:28:10.920" style="s2">it&#39;s solving but I also get what</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.510" style="s2">problems it might create yeah but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.920" end="00:28:17.090" style="s2">would say that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.510" end="00:28:19.530" style="s2">not a you know as I&#39;ve said many times</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.090" end="00:28:21.510" style="s2">America is not great until it&#39;s great</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.530" end="00:28:23.130" style="s2">for everyone it has lots of greatness</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.510" end="00:28:26.520" style="s2">unit it has been great for many</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.130" end="00:28:28.890" style="s2">including you and me yep but until every</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.520" end="00:28:31.140" style="s2">population is included in that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.890" end="00:28:36.240" style="s2">done and so yeah we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.140" end="00:28:38.250" style="s2">what to do so that Indians and black</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.240" end="00:28:39.870" style="s2">people are not left behind by the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.250" end="00:28:44.730" style="s2">American project of course yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.870" end="00:28:46.140" style="s2">course I don&#39;t know I feel like you or I</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.730" end="00:28:48.110" style="s2">couldn&#39;t just decide to live on a</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.140" end="00:28:51.559" style="s2">reservation is that right</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.110" end="00:28:54.290" style="s2">that&#39;s right in which case making them a</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.559" end="00:28:57.100" style="s2">state with with equal representation of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.290" end="00:28:59.870" style="s2">the other states in Congress and such</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.100" end="00:29:02.090" style="s2">would be it seems to me and I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.870" end="00:29:05.030" style="s2">point to the place in the founding</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.090" end="00:29:06.380" style="s2">documents that would prescribe against</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.030" end="00:29:08.929" style="s2">this but that seems to me deeply</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.380" end="00:29:10.760" style="s2">anti-american that if not all Americans</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.929" end="00:29:14.030" style="s2">could live there and yet they have equal</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.760" end="00:29:16.370" style="s2">representation that would not fly oh</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.030" end="00:29:17.840" style="s2">right I think you you you would you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.370" end="00:29:19.730" style="s2">would need to open them up which is like</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.840" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">they&#39;re not their operations yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.730" end="00:29:29.780" style="s2">think that&#39;s right I support this page</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:30.710" style="s2">indeed hi you two first off I want to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.780" end="00:29:33.650" style="s2">thank you both for all that you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.710" end="00:29:35.360" style="s2">my question is about unity 2020 I love</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.650" end="00:29:37.250" style="s2">the idea but what are you planning to do</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.360" end="00:29:38.900" style="s2">about the Electoral College issue if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.250" end="00:29:39.799" style="s2">win the popular vote but lose to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.900" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">electoral college</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.799" end="00:29:46.370" style="s2">what then all right this is a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:49.850" style="s2">that those who are involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.370" end="00:29:51.830" style="s2">effort daily and we are spending much</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.850" end="00:29:53.600" style="s2">more time on it than a full-time job</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.830" end="00:29:57.890" style="s2">would require I mean really every spare</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.600" end="00:30:01.070" style="s2">moment and many beyond that I think you</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.890" end="00:30:03.679" style="s2">need to stop asking us what the exact</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.070" end="00:30:06.049" style="s2">details of the plan are it does not make</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.679" end="00:30:08.290" style="s2">sense to be sharing them at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.049" end="00:30:10.370" style="s2">we have to be able to engage</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.290" end="00:30:13.280" style="s2">strategically in a strategic landscape</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.370" end="00:30:15.380" style="s2">and that means not simply talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.280" end="00:30:17.179" style="s2">the various details about how we intend</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.380" end="00:30:19.549" style="s2">to solve this at the moment the question</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.179" end="00:30:22.070" style="s2">you have to ask is if you took</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.549" end="00:30:24.230" style="s2">intelligent people who have access to</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.070" end="00:30:25.940" style="s2">libraries and online resources about</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.230" end="00:30:27.470" style="s2">what the various constraints are and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.940" end="00:30:28.940" style="s2">those people are looking at this and</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.470" end="00:30:31.820" style="s2">saying yes this is a genuine possibility</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.940" end="00:30:34.040" style="s2">in this election cycle this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.820" end="00:30:35.450" style="s2">joke it&#39;s not a symbolic act this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.040" end="00:30:38.660" style="s2">something we actually intend to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.450" end="00:30:41.030" style="s2">accomplish then do you really would you</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.660" end="00:30:43.280" style="s2">want the details of what we intend to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.030" end="00:30:44.750" style="s2">if that also crippled the effort is that</p>

<p begin="00:30:44.750" end="00:30:48.200" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.049" end="00:30:50.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you want us to draft</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.200" end="00:30:53.270" style="s2">candidates too early if it cripples them</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.720" end="00:30:55.130" style="s2">if it causes the effort to fail I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.270" end="00:30:57.110" style="s2">you want us to do this properly so that</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.130" end="00:30:58.760" style="s2">it actually works so that come January</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.110" end="00:31:01.970" style="s2">we inaugurate people who are ready to</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.760" end="00:31:03.860" style="s2">lead and I would ask you to please</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.970" end="00:31:05.450" style="s2">think about whether or not you are</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.860" end="00:31:07.009" style="s2">willing to compromise the effort in</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.450" end="00:31:08.539" style="s2">order to answer all of your questions</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.009" end="00:31:10.639" style="s2">right away or you would rather see the</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.539" end="00:31:12.909" style="s2">effort function over time and be</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.639" end="00:31:15.730" style="s2">pleasantly surprised</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.909" end="00:31:17.960" style="s2">the next question is totally different</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.730" end="00:31:20.690" style="s2">it&#39;s a series of questions okay</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.960" end="00:31:22.700" style="s2">was the first human man trans creating</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.690" end="00:31:24.529" style="s2">the first woman from his rib is the</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.700" end="00:31:26.629" style="s2">story creating a hierarchy of biological</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.529" end="00:31:30.019" style="s2">men above women also conversions give</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.629" end="00:31:31.909" style="s2">birth by conjuring a spirit well some of</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.019" end="00:31:35.049" style="s2">these stories may be somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.909" end="00:31:37.669" style="s2">exaggerated or completely not true</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.049" end="00:31:41.059" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a level of exaggerated</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.669" end="00:31:44.090" style="s2">it&#39;s like full exaggeration really</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.059" end="00:31:47.570" style="s2">really ravenous isn&#39;t the right word</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.090" end="00:31:49.940" style="s2">Raveena&#39;s gap between the two yeah kind</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.570" end="00:31:51.200" style="s2">of a big cavern or it would be the</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.940" end="00:32:01.970" style="s2">adjective how do you adjective eyes</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.200" end="00:32:04.009" style="s2">ravine ravine like oh good yes so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.970" end="00:32:05.330" style="s2">look let&#39;s put it this way yes I mean of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.009" end="00:32:07.250" style="s2">course it creates a hierarchy that that</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.330" end="00:32:10.159" style="s2">particular origin story which is Pyramus</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.250" end="00:32:12.860" style="s2">creates a hierarchy of men above a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.159" end="00:32:14.269" style="s2">minimum man came first represent and you</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.860" end="00:32:17.450" style="s2">know conversions give birth by conjuring</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.269" end="00:32:20.200" style="s2">spirit yeah no well can&#39;t happen unless</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.450" end="00:32:22.519" style="s2">if you&#39;re a komodo dragon actually yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.200" end="00:32:23.629" style="s2">virtual Komodo dragons could do it and I</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.519" end="00:32:24.919" style="s2">think that they do it by conjuring</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.629" end="00:32:26.389" style="s2">spirits I passed</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.919" end="00:32:29.240" style="s2">we did some anthropology of Komodo</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.389" end="00:32:29.750" style="s2">dragon well what we need to know no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.240" end="00:32:35.360" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.750" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">so Jesus being a guy being there for an</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.360" end="00:32:42.919" style="s2">X Y bearing human could not have been</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:46.820" style="s2">given birth to by a virgin conjuring a</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.919" end="00:32:50.840" style="s2">spirit or otherwise so anyway were worse</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.820" end="00:32:52.820" style="s2">the bird were Jesus a female we could</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.840" end="00:32:56.240" style="s2">ask the question was this a part in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.820" end="00:32:58.940" style="s2">genetic creation&#39; of of a human which</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.240" end="00:33:00.799" style="s2">has never been noted in mammals or birds</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.940" end="00:33:02.649" style="s2">which have chromosomal sex determination</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.799" end="00:33:06.259" style="s2">there&#39;s parthenogenesis there is</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.649" end="00:33:08.600" style="s2">reproduction without two individuals</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.259" end="00:33:10.429" style="s2">coming together with gametes in other</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.600" end="00:33:12.280" style="s2">vertebrates but never mammals or birds</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.429" end="00:33:14.050" style="s2">so Komodo dragons being</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.280" end="00:33:16.930" style="s2">one of them I didn&#39;t just make that part</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.050" end="00:33:19.780" style="s2">up yep nonetheless no the obvious most</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.930" end="00:33:22.600" style="s2">parsimonious parsimonious explanation</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.780" end="00:33:24.670" style="s2">for all of these things is that some</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.600" end="00:33:26.770" style="s2">narrative stuff was necessary in order</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.670" end="00:33:28.990" style="s2">to take the payload of these stories and</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.770" end="00:33:31.900" style="s2">link them to something that people could</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.990" end="00:33:36.600" style="s2">remember and pass on and so yes the</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.900" end="00:33:41.350" style="s2">stories are fictionalized substantially</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.600" end="00:33:43.000" style="s2">Ravine like underlying this woke moment</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.350" end="00:33:45.190" style="s2">are we seeing the replacement of merit</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.000" end="00:33:47.140" style="s2">with a notion of merit due to social</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.190" end="00:33:48.490" style="s2">tribal connection are we seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.140" end="00:33:51.310" style="s2">replacement of personal virtues with a</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.490" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">virtue of only power games yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.310" end="00:33:55.090" style="s2">two the first one in fact the very</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.200" end="00:33:58.390" style="s2">concept of meritocracy is on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.090" end="00:34:01.590" style="s2">chopping block and there are those of us</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.390" end="00:34:04.180" style="s2">who will say just because meritocracy a</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.590" end="00:34:07.950" style="s2">pure and true meritocracy may be</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.180" end="00:34:10.840" style="s2">impossible under current socio-political</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.950" end="00:34:12.520" style="s2">constraints does not render the idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.840" end="00:34:15.610" style="s2">something that we need to give up or</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.520" end="00:34:18.610" style="s2">should give up there are those on the on</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.610" end="00:34:20.620" style="s2">the woke side who will say actually no</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.610" end="00:34:22.720" style="s2">merit you know the the very idea of</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.620" end="00:34:24.310" style="s2">meritocracy is itself embedded in might</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.720" end="00:34:26.470" style="s2">supremacy and racism and all this and</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.310" end="00:34:29.679" style="s2">therefore it&#39;s not worthy of our</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.470" end="00:34:31.600" style="s2">consideration so yeah not only are we</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.679" end="00:34:33.880" style="s2">seeing exactly that but it&#39;s explicit</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.600" end="00:34:35.169" style="s2">then the second one replacement of</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.880" end="00:34:37.899" style="s2">personal virtues with the virtue of only</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.169" end="00:34:40.360" style="s2">power games yeah I mean that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.899" end="00:34:41.890" style="s2">is the post-modernism that lives at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.360" end="00:34:43.630" style="s2">heart of this thing claims that</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.890" end="00:34:45.600" style="s2">everything is about power and then it</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.630" end="00:34:47.380" style="s2">attempts to create a world in which it</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.600" end="00:34:49.960" style="s2">everything is about power and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.380" end="00:34:53.409" style="s2">powerful yeah this is almost that simple</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.960" end="00:34:55.630" style="s2">that&#39;s right give up big government Bret</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.409" end="00:34:58.750" style="s2">that&#39;s not me talking you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.630" end="00:35:00.010" style="s2">not like you it&#39;s the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.750" end="00:35:01.300" style="s2">slippery slope that led us here in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.010" end="00:35:03.610" style="s2">first place otherwise keep telling the</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.300" end="00:35:05.140" style="s2">truth and standing up for free speech um</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.610" end="00:35:06.790" style="s2">I like it</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.140" end="00:35:09.160" style="s2">I&#39;m not a fan of big government I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.790" end="00:35:10.750" style="s2">fan of some various things which you may</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.160" end="00:35:13.600" style="s2">not have heard of one of them is called</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.750" end="00:35:14.830" style="s2">subsidiarity subsidiarity is a concept</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.600" end="00:35:16.720" style="s2">that actually weirdly comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.830" end="00:35:18.400" style="s2">Catholicism and what it means is that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.720" end="00:35:20.770" style="s2">everything should be regulated at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.400" end="00:35:22.210" style="s2">lowest effective level so it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.770" end="00:35:24.190" style="s2">fan of big government but it is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.210" end="00:35:25.300" style="s2">recognize it has a recognition built</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.190" end="00:35:28.210" style="s2">into it that</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.300" end="00:35:29.590" style="s2">everything has to be governed at the</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.210" end="00:35:30.550" style="s2">right level and that means that there</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.590" end="00:35:33.220" style="s2">actually some things that have to be</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.550" end="00:35:35.230" style="s2">governed globally did he say globally</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.220" end="00:35:37.450" style="s2">yeah I did say globally he said it it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.230" end="00:35:39.970" style="s2">happens that we are watching a heat wave</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.450" end="00:35:41.890" style="s2">in the Arctic right this is really</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.970" end="00:35:44.380" style="s2">frightening if you know what&#39;s frozen in</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.890" end="00:35:45.910" style="s2">the Arctic all those methane clathrates</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.380" end="00:35:47.980" style="s2">that are frozen in the Arctic that could</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.910" end="00:35:49.600" style="s2">be suddenly released if we warm too</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.980" end="00:35:51.250" style="s2">quickly it&#39;s looking like we&#39;re headed</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.600" end="00:35:53.860" style="s2">there and you know what this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.250" end="00:36:00.070" style="s2">be an emergency unlike all others if we</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.860" end="00:36:02.440" style="s2">see the the methane gun set off as it</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.070" end="00:36:04.600" style="s2">were so we have to be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.440" end="00:36:07.330" style="s2">questions of atmospheric chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.600" end="00:36:08.830" style="s2">ocean pollution at the global level</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.330" end="00:36:10.600" style="s2">because that&#39;s the level at which these</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.830" end="00:36:12.610" style="s2">processes function on the other hand we</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.600" end="00:36:14.260" style="s2">do not want to see your local school</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.610" end="00:36:16.890" style="s2">governed at a global level we want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.260" end="00:36:19.210" style="s2">see it governed at a much lower level</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.890" end="00:36:21.490" style="s2">quite possibly smaller than the federal</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.210" end="00:36:23.050" style="s2">level yeah or maybe go absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.490" end="00:36:27.010" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.050" end="00:36:31.090" style="s2">so anyway what I would say is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.010" end="00:36:33.100" style="s2">of decentralized governance has reached</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.090" end="00:36:34.420" style="s2">those of us who are paying attention who</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.100" end="00:36:35.950" style="s2">are thinking about how these structures</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.420" end="00:36:39.070" style="s2">ought to work at the moment we have an</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.950" end="00:36:41.260" style="s2">emergency that we cannot solve by simply</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.070" end="00:36:43.660" style="s2">appealing to decentralized governance we</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.260" end="00:36:46.390" style="s2">have a governance structure it is out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.660" end="00:36:48.190" style="s2">control due to rampant corruption and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.390" end="00:36:51.070" style="s2">needs to be recaptured just to stabilize</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.190" end="00:36:54.520" style="s2">the ship just so it doesn&#39;t sink then we</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.070" end="00:36:56.140" style="s2">can talk about what might be rethought</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.520" end="00:36:59.590" style="s2">and we should be thinking about those</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.140" end="00:37:01.750" style="s2">things we we don&#39;t live in 1776 we leave</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.590" end="00:37:05.350" style="s2">in 2020 and the realities have radically</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.750" end="00:37:07.420" style="s2">changed so you know the values at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.350" end="00:37:09.640" style="s2">heart of the founding are exactly right</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.420" end="00:37:11.830" style="s2">or at least they were a start on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.640" end="00:37:14.140" style="s2">path that leads you to exactly right but</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.830" end="00:37:16.000" style="s2">the mechanisms some of them are great</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.140" end="00:37:17.650" style="s2">some of them are showing their age some</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.000" end="00:37:20.650" style="s2">of them weren&#39;t quite right to begin</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.650" end="00:37:22.810" style="s2">with and as far as I&#39;m concerned the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.650" end="00:37:25.120" style="s2">thing that matters is that the values</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.810" end="00:37:27.190" style="s2">get carried forward and that everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.120" end="00:37:28.360" style="s2">gets brought in on them and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.190" end="00:37:30.070" style="s2">going to have to do that but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.360" end="00:37:32.710" style="s2">decentralized would be great to the</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.070" end="00:37:34.210" style="s2">extent it&#39;s possible we should do it and</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.710" end="00:37:37.330" style="s2">to the extent that we have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.210" end="00:37:38.599" style="s2">some things with a larger structure we</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.330" end="00:37:41.720" style="s2">should just accept it</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.599" end="00:37:43.849" style="s2">yep I&#39;ve used Brett&#39;s statement of we</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.720" end="00:37:45.769" style="s2">must defeat the Biden trump ticket and</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.849" end="00:37:47.950" style="s2">telling others about unity 2020 I think</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.769" end="00:37:52.309" style="s2">it&#39;s a very effective slogan I do to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.950" end="00:37:54.380" style="s2">defeat Trump Biden 2020 yep why do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.309" end="00:37:56.239" style="s2">think why do you two think reelect and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.380" end="00:37:58.640" style="s2">Donald Trump would be a bad idea I know</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.239" end="00:38:00.410" style="s2">he&#39;s not very presidential but bring but</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.640" end="00:38:01.309" style="s2">bringing industry and jobs to the US and</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.410" end="00:38:02.210" style="s2">getting troops out of the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.309" end="00:38:06.380" style="s2">sounds good</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.210" end="00:38:09.849" style="s2">please elaborate and thank you let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.380" end="00:38:14.119" style="s2">it this way we have seen the man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.849" end="00:38:16.880" style="s2">inability to lead at moments when it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.119" end="00:38:18.619" style="s2">necessary there are things he has</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.880" end="00:38:22.309" style="s2">pointed towards yes pulling people out</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.619" end="00:38:24.109" style="s2">of the Middle East is sensible if it can</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.309" end="00:38:26.239" style="s2">be done safely certainly we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.109" end="00:38:28.880" style="s2">tremendous hazards for ourselves and</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.239" end="00:38:30.380" style="s2">we&#39;ve burned an awful lot of treasure in</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.880" end="00:38:32.839" style="s2">the Middle East on adventures that did</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.380" end="00:38:35.479" style="s2">not work out so it&#39;s it&#39;s not to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.839" end="00:38:37.910" style="s2">that every single thing points against</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.479" end="00:38:40.910" style="s2">the man but we need a leader who can</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.910" end="00:38:43.910" style="s2">deal with kovat 19 mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.910" end="00:38:46.369" style="s2">Trump botched this badly people died in</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.910" end="00:38:47.989" style="s2">great numbers right we need people who</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.369" end="00:38:50.180" style="s2">are able to figure out how to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.989" end="00:38:51.319" style="s2">experts and what to do about it and how</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.180" end="00:38:53.269" style="s2">to deal with the fact that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.319" end="00:38:56.029" style="s2">experts aren&#39;t trustworthy this is just</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.269" end="00:38:59.869" style="s2">simply necessary so no he&#39;s he&#39;s he slid</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.029" end="00:39:02.269" style="s2">over from being completely embedded in</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.869" end="00:39:03.109" style="s2">the system that has someone else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.269" end="00:39:04.789" style="s2">interests at heart</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.109" end="00:39:06.950" style="s2">but which is completely informing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.789" end="00:39:09.650" style="s2">President to saying I trust none of them</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.950" end="00:39:12.739" style="s2">and you know maybe the right president</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.650" end="00:39:14.809" style="s2">actually needs to from scratch figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.739" end="00:39:16.609" style="s2">out who it is that they trust and accept</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.809" end="00:39:19.039" style="s2">no one who was handed to him or her</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.609" end="00:39:21.440" style="s2">because because that&#39;s what&#39;s been done</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.039" end="00:39:24.170" style="s2">before but the idea that there will be</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.440" end="00:39:26.059" style="s2">no one whom he comes consults no one</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.170" end="00:39:27.589" style="s2">whom he trusts with the possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.059" end="00:39:31.579" style="s2">exception of a couple of people right in</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.589" end="00:39:34.339" style="s2">his immediate family is clearly led to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.579" end="00:39:36.739" style="s2">so many mistakes and just a failure to</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.339" end="00:39:42.519" style="s2">govern yeah and we have an economic</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.739" end="00:39:46.609" style="s2">crisis we have a viral crisis we have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.519" end="00:39:48.829" style="s2">unrest crisis and we may be on the</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.609" end="00:39:51.480" style="s2">tipping point of an environmental crisis</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.829" end="00:39:55.650" style="s2">so we need somebody who is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.480" end="00:39:58.230" style="s2">thinker and who has the right leadership</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.650" end="00:40:01.020" style="s2">qualities written in at the bottom level</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.230" end="00:40:02.790" style="s2">of their code and I&#39;m sorry he had the</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.020" end="00:40:04.050" style="s2">right qualities to beat one of the two</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.790" end="00:40:06.240" style="s2">major parties that&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.050" end="00:40:08.100" style="s2">accomplishment but he doesn&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.240" end="00:40:14.340" style="s2">right temperament to lead the nation at</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.100" end="00:40:15.510" style="s2">this point and he&#39;s got to go okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.340" end="00:40:18.170" style="s2">let&#39;s get through just a couple more</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.510" end="00:40:20.430" style="s2">here and we&#39;ll skip to the other thread</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.170" end="00:40:21.900" style="s2">guys I love your show but I think you</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.430" end="00:40:23.490" style="s2">should debate supporters of critical</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.900" end="00:40:25.800" style="s2">theory as this feels like an echo</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.490" end="00:40:26.940" style="s2">chamber sometimes I believe vouch is one</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.800" end="00:40:29.220" style="s2">of them and I&#39;m sure he would jump at</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.940" end="00:40:33.710" style="s2">the opportunity so I don&#39;t know who vow</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.220" end="00:40:35.609" style="s2">is but I will say that we spent decades</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.710" end="00:40:37.350" style="s2">debating supporters of critical theory</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.609" end="00:40:39.180" style="s2">because we were academics we were seeing</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.350" end="00:40:41.040" style="s2">the germs of this when we were</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.180" end="00:40:42.990" style="s2">undergraduates and we were fighting</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.040" end="00:40:44.340" style="s2">against it then with no platform and</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.990" end="00:40:47.250" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t internet widely available</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.340" end="00:40:49.650" style="s2">at this point in the early 90s and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.250" end="00:40:53.220" style="s2">have done so I think just once</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.650" end="00:40:54.630" style="s2">explicitly publicly in debate here in</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.220" end="00:40:56.580" style="s2">Portland actually before we moved here a</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.630" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">couple years ago and very well yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.580" end="00:41:00.060" style="s2">was it was quite interesting actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:03.210" style="s2">and actually this that&#39;s where we met</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.060" end="00:41:06.480" style="s2">John Wood yeah who he was he was not he</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.210" end="00:41:08.880" style="s2">was not he was not one of the people on</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.480" end="00:41:11.100" style="s2">the other side he was moderating and</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.880" end="00:41:12.119" style="s2">he&#39;s now with bravery angels</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.100" end="00:41:13.680" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.119" end="00:41:15.150" style="s2">terrific it was an organization called</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.680" end="00:41:21.000" style="s2">bridging the divide or bridging our</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.150" end="00:41:22.859" style="s2">divide that ran it and it was a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.000" end="00:41:24.690" style="s2">audio out there of it the video was was</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.859" end="00:41:27.930" style="s2">pretty bad and I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.690" end="00:41:31.290" style="s2">fascinating but the fact is that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.930" end="00:41:33.630" style="s2">spend literally decades talking with</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.290" end="00:41:36.090" style="s2">that you know at various volumes and in</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.630" end="00:41:38.430" style="s2">various levels of private conversation</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.090" end="00:41:41.130" style="s2">to entire faculty meetings this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.430" end="00:41:45.000" style="s2">and at some point it&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.130" end="00:41:46.980" style="s2">contingent on us to keep on talking ad</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.000" end="00:41:48.540" style="s2">nauseam to the people who will not</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.980" end="00:41:52.680" style="s2">respond in good faith yep</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.540" end="00:41:55.200" style="s2">you know so you frankly I mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.680" end="00:41:56.430" style="s2">different levels I also had a I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.200" end="00:41:58.980" style="s2">call it a debate it was a friendly</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.430" end="00:42:03.640" style="s2">conversation with Thaddius Russell who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.980" end="00:42:08.019" style="s2">a postmodernist on his podcast No</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.640" end="00:42:10.089" style="s2">oh voice &amp; exit&#39; did a thing and it was</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.019" end="00:42:11.799" style="s2">hosted by I can&#39;t remember who</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.089" end="00:42:14.549" style="s2">libertarian of some kinds out there</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.799" end="00:42:18.519" style="s2">somewhere it&#39;s out there somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.549" end="00:42:22.329" style="s2">anyway Nick Gillespie at reason is also</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.519" end="00:42:25.209" style="s2">a postmodernist by his own diagnosis and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.329" end="00:42:26.440" style="s2">we have not discussed with him actively</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.209" end="00:42:28.690" style="s2">but he&#39;s in our circle and would be</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.440" end="00:42:30.640" style="s2">happy to do it but yeah I mean either of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.690" end="00:42:32.829" style="s2">those I mean I I know I know Nick better</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.640" end="00:42:36.249" style="s2">than I know next work and thinking</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.829" end="00:42:37.440" style="s2">better than that ESS but that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.249" end="00:42:40.059" style="s2">just feels different</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.440" end="00:42:41.289" style="s2">right there because it&#39;s good and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.059" end="00:42:44.920" style="s2">they&#39;ve come to very different</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.289" end="00:42:47.829" style="s2">conclusions both of them about what is</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.920" end="00:42:52.569" style="s2">wrong with with the current thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.829" end="00:42:54.219" style="s2">academia but they like we are open to</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.569" end="00:42:55.749" style="s2">discussion and to hearing things and you</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.219" end="00:42:57.549" style="s2">know the the one extent conversation</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.749" end="00:42:59.529" style="s2">I&#39;ve had with Nick actually you know he</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.549" end="00:43:01.180" style="s2">he told me things I didn&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.529" end="00:43:02.859" style="s2">that&#39;s you know that&#39;s what I look for</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.180" end="00:43:07.660" style="s2">in every conversation it was wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.859" end="00:43:10.690" style="s2">yep but there are concepts out there so</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.660" end="00:43:12.369" style="s2">bad that they don&#39;t merit investigation</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.690" end="00:43:14.049" style="s2">right there&#39;s a point at which you you</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.369" end="00:43:16.930" style="s2">know you realize that time zones exist</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.049" end="00:43:18.999" style="s2">and that the Flat Earth Society might be</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.930" end="00:43:20.709" style="s2">off track how many times do you have to</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.999" end="00:43:24.190" style="s2">engage the Flat Earth Society yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.709" end="00:43:25.989" style="s2">so anyway critical race theory is is</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.190" end="00:43:28.180" style="s2">that which doesn&#39;t mean it started there</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.989" end="00:43:30.489" style="s2">it didn&#39;t it started as an investigation</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.180" end="00:43:33.119" style="s2">of systematic biases in our court system</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.489" end="00:43:35.410" style="s2">which is still exists and are important</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.119" end="00:43:38.769" style="s2">okay we got a three-part question here</p>

<p begin="00:43:38.769" end="00:43:41.619" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.759" end="00:43:43.029" style="s2">what is the evolutionary significance</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.619" end="00:43:44.799" style="s2">I&#39;m going to read all of them</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.029" end="00:43:46.329" style="s2">what is the evolutionary significance of</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.799" end="00:43:49.209" style="s2">humanity&#39;s confusion about the hard</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.329" end="00:43:50.709" style="s2">problem of consciousness suppose you</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.209" end="00:43:52.299" style="s2">studied a dead civilization on another</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.709" end="00:43:53.859" style="s2">planet could the presence or absence of</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.299" end="00:43:55.269" style="s2">this search say something about the</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.859" end="00:43:58.059" style="s2">presence or absence of consciousness in</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.269" end="00:44:00.670" style="s2">an alien civilization and suppose a</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.059" end="00:44:02.019" style="s2">powerful AI claimed to be conscious with</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.670" end="00:44:03.579" style="s2">the independent emergence of the hard</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.019" end="00:44:05.949" style="s2">problem of consciousness in that mind</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.579" end="00:44:10.930" style="s2">provide any basis to suspect that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.949" end="00:44:13.390" style="s2">confusion is sincere I&#39;m trying to parse</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.930" end="00:44:14.799" style="s2">all that yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot so I</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.390" end="00:44:17.019" style="s2">don&#39;t know that we are obligated to</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.799" end="00:44:19.269" style="s2">respond to all of them let me start by</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.019" end="00:44:23.619" style="s2">addressing the idea of a civilization on</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.269" end="00:44:25.119" style="s2">another planet I&#39;m not sure you know you</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.619" end="00:44:28.869" style="s2">say suppose you studied a dead</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.119" end="00:44:30.099" style="s2">civilization on another planet what</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.869" end="00:44:31.569" style="s2">would that what could you learn about</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.099" end="00:44:33.189" style="s2">the presence or absence of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.569" end="00:44:35.199" style="s2">and alien civilization I think if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.189" end="00:44:37.659" style="s2">use the word civilization and we could</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.199" end="00:44:39.309" style="s2">spend years talking about exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.659" end="00:44:40.749" style="s2">that means but if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.309" end="00:44:42.429" style="s2">civilization and they have consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.749" end="00:44:45.819" style="s2">you know we see the rudiments of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.429" end="00:44:48.609" style="s2">consciousness in organisms on this</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.819" end="00:44:49.989" style="s2">planet that wouldn&#39;t be understood to</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.609" end="00:44:53.349" style="s2">have civilization but they have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.989" end="00:44:55.479" style="s2">the glimmerings of culture elephants and</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.349" end="00:45:01.089" style="s2">toothed whales like dolphins and great</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.479" end="00:45:03.069" style="s2">apes and wolves and such and I think and</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.089" end="00:45:05.529" style="s2">again we could spend a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.069" end="00:45:07.859" style="s2">talking about this that that will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.529" end="00:45:09.909" style="s2">true every place that you find</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.859" end="00:45:11.079" style="s2">civilization in the rest of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.909" end="00:45:13.179" style="s2">that consciousness is a necessary</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.079" end="00:45:16.029" style="s2">precursor because it is about the</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.179" end="00:45:18.369" style="s2">exchange of ideas and absent exchange of</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.029" end="00:45:20.259" style="s2">ideas there is not going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.369" end="00:45:25.229" style="s2">possibility for civilization what would</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.259" end="00:45:27.339" style="s2">you do if you found remember this</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.229" end="00:45:31.089" style="s2">extraordinary piece of footage where</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.339" end="00:45:34.569" style="s2">somebody pours concrete down a leaf</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.089" end="00:45:37.389" style="s2">cutter ant nest and then digs it up and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.569" end="00:45:38.979" style="s2">you have this elaborate structure with</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.389" end="00:45:40.899" style="s2">all of the various chambers connected by</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.979" end="00:45:43.599" style="s2">all of the various passageways 3d</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.899" end="00:45:45.880" style="s2">sculptural map if you found that on</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.599" end="00:45:50.139" style="s2">another planet what you know that it</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.880" end="00:45:51.429" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a kind of civilization no not</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.139" end="00:45:53.109" style="s2">necessarily because I&#39;m pretty sure</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.429" end="00:45:55.630" style="s2">there&#39;s no consciousness involved in</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.109" end="00:45:58.829" style="s2">that yeah so we&#39;re getting into you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.630" end="00:46:03.639" style="s2">what what is it that you need to see to</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.829" end="00:46:06.039" style="s2">distinguish between sort of a an</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.639" end="00:46:08.380" style="s2">organism that is so you social that</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.039" end="00:46:10.809" style="s2">really individual organisms don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.380" end="00:46:12.489" style="s2">much being unto themselves such as is</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.809" end="00:46:14.349" style="s2">the super organism that is the unit that</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.489" end="00:46:17.529" style="s2">matters in terms of whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.349" end="00:46:19.509" style="s2">how it behaves yeah or are you looking</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.529" end="00:46:21.759" style="s2">at something that has as we do and</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.509" end="00:46:23.229" style="s2">glimmerings of eusociality where but</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.759" end="00:46:25.749" style="s2">still absolutely retain our</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.229" end="00:46:28.989" style="s2">individuality and make decisions that</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.749" end="00:46:29.619" style="s2">are often distinct from and different</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.989" end="00:46:31.539" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.619" end="00:46:34.059" style="s2">what the rest of the society is doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.539" end="00:46:36.039" style="s2">yep and even a very large organism could</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.059" end="00:46:38.200" style="s2">throw you if you weren&#39;t familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.039" end="00:46:40.269" style="s2">the tree of life that it had come from</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.200" end="00:46:42.880" style="s2">you know an organism is a hyper</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.269" end="00:46:44.440" style="s2">organized thing with lots of division of</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.880" end="00:46:46.749" style="s2">labor and exchange of information and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.440" end="00:46:49.539" style="s2">the I think the problem is definitional</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.749" end="00:46:51.369" style="s2">hmm defining civilization is easy enough</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.539" end="00:46:53.529" style="s2">when you&#39;re talking about you know the</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.369" end="00:46:56.230" style="s2">earth and you&#39;re basically limiting</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.529" end="00:46:58.119" style="s2">yourself to the versions of it that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.230" end="00:47:01.029" style="s2">have seen well both of your both of your</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.119" end="00:47:03.190" style="s2">examples use the concept of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.029" end="00:47:06.369" style="s2">individual as what causes us to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.190" end="00:47:08.049" style="s2">confused right that is a single organism</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.369" end="00:47:09.430" style="s2">of civilization well no it&#39;s a single</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.049" end="00:47:11.579" style="s2">organism well what if you didn&#39;t know it</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.430" end="00:47:13.509" style="s2">was a single organism is an ant nest</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.579" end="00:47:14.799" style="s2">civilization well probably not but</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.509" end="00:47:16.269" style="s2">that&#39;s because it&#39;s like a super</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.799" end="00:47:17.829" style="s2">organism and those individuals aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.269" end="00:47:19.749" style="s2">really fully individual so this all gets</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.829" end="00:47:22.119" style="s2">at the at the question of what is an</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.749" end="00:47:23.859" style="s2">individual and how it what happens when</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.119" end="00:47:25.690" style="s2">individuals come together and have to</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.859" end="00:47:27.999" style="s2">share information that&#39;s the origin of</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.690" end="00:47:29.920" style="s2">consciousness and then they can become I</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.999" end="00:47:30.970" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say civilize and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:34.900" style="s2">not right but then they can create</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.970" end="00:47:36.549" style="s2">civilization but it does it the premise</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.900" end="00:47:39.640" style="s2">is that there are individuals with</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.549" end="00:47:42.130" style="s2">agency right but even then even I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.640" end="00:47:44.589" style="s2">all I&#39;m demonstrating here is that I can</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.130" end="00:47:47.289" style="s2">wreck your definition of civilization no</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.589" end="00:47:50.279" style="s2">matter what you throw at it because even</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.289" end="00:47:53.650" style="s2">a single organism you know we have our</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.279" end="00:47:54.910" style="s2">gut flora and those guts are exchanging</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.650" end="00:47:57.430" style="s2">information with us and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.910" end="00:47:59.619" style="s2">partnership and we also have our</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.430" end="00:48:01.329" style="s2">mitochondria and our mitochondria are</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.619" end="00:48:03.819" style="s2">separate individuals that have then</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.329" end="00:48:05.680" style="s2">become so synonymous with us that we are</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.819" end="00:48:07.269" style="s2">you know we are hybrids that regard</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.680" end="00:48:09.670" style="s2">ourselves as singular but we are not</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.269" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">yeah so all of these things mean that</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.670" end="00:48:14.710" style="s2">any definition you throw is gonna fall</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:16.480" style="s2">apart in some cases and sometimes very</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.710" end="00:48:18.640" style="s2">central cases yeah it&#39;s not just the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.480" end="00:48:20.769" style="s2">edge cases yeah everything&#39;s in educates</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.640" end="00:48:23.019" style="s2">when you get right down to it so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.769" end="00:48:24.460" style="s2">not helpful that&#39;s my point I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.019" end="00:48:26.309" style="s2">to have to be helpful in order to point</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.460" end="00:48:30.190" style="s2">out why you can&#39;t do this</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.309" end="00:48:34.269" style="s2">but this here I should also just say I</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.190" end="00:48:36.220" style="s2">don&#39;t think you or I think that there is</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.269" end="00:48:37.720" style="s2">a hard problem of consciousness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.220" end="00:48:39.069" style="s2">not to say that there&#39;s not a difficult</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.720" end="00:48:40.809" style="s2">problem of consciousness but a hard</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.069" end="00:48:41.619" style="s2">problem suggests that there&#39;s some sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.809" end="00:48:44.220" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.619" end="00:48:46.440" style="s2">special boundary that prevents you from</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.220" end="00:48:49.089" style="s2">elucidating in the case of the hard</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.440" end="00:48:51.900" style="s2">problem of consciousness it is usually</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.089" end="00:48:56.170" style="s2">claimed that the nature of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.900" end="00:48:58.269" style="s2">is itself difficult to explain and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.170" end="00:49:00.130" style="s2">fact is it&#39;s an evolutionary adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.269" end="00:49:02.259" style="s2">like everything else which doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.130" end="00:49:04.450" style="s2">that we have the explanation nailed to a</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.259" end="00:49:06.400" style="s2">fare-thee-well at the moment but you</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.450" end="00:49:09.130" style="s2">know it hasn&#39;t been long that we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.400" end="00:49:11.859" style="s2">the explanation for and I nailed down</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.130" end="00:49:13.319" style="s2">either so give us some time on</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.859" end="00:49:15.730" style="s2">consciousness yep</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.319" end="00:49:19.480" style="s2">okay we&#39;re going to switch to the next</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.730" end="00:49:20.499" style="s2">thread or the the Q&amp;A the questions from</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.480" end="00:49:22.059" style="s2">this live stream the super check</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.499" end="00:49:24.579" style="s2">questions for this live stream so I</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.059" end="00:49:26.980" style="s2">think you&#39;ve drawn the line at least one</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.579" end="00:49:33.009" style="s2">off but I think that this is the first</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.980" end="00:49:35.049" style="s2">one from this live stream yeah pretty</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.009" end="00:49:37.150" style="s2">sure for one thing we already answered</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.049" end="00:49:38.950" style="s2">the question the question right above it</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.150" end="00:49:41.910" style="s2">so it must be from the previous live</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.950" end="00:49:43.930" style="s2">stream left evangelical movement before</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.910" end="00:49:45.309" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna just read it first I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:50:14.950" end="00:50:20.890" style="s2">even worse than that I was reading a</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.029" end="00:50:22.480" style="s2">subreddit and somebody posted a comment</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.890" end="00:50:23.890" style="s2">about the frightening situation that</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.480" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">they faced this was somebody who had</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.890" end="00:50:33.599" style="s2">come to the u.s. from abroad from a a</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:36.609" style="s2">country with a dictatorial regime and</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.599" end="00:50:38.710" style="s2">their point was my family has seen this</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.609" end="00:50:40.180" style="s2">before yeah I don&#39;t know what to do it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.710" end="00:50:41.710" style="s2">very frightening I know what it is but</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.180" end="00:50:43.150" style="s2">people who haven&#39;t seen it before don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.710" end="00:50:48.160" style="s2">know what it is and they&#39;re falling prey</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.150" end="00:50:50.650" style="s2">to it and anyway that&#39;s alarming yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.160" end="00:50:53.140" style="s2">and the comments that followed that</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.650" end="00:50:54.670" style="s2">comment also reflected other parts of</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.140" end="00:50:55.130" style="s2">the world in which people have seen this</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.670" end="00:50:56.870" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.130" end="00:50:59.240" style="s2">descendants who are now here are</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.870" end="00:51:01.730" style="s2">recognizing the analogy and people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.240" end="00:51:04.150" style="s2">rightly concerned about it</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.730" end="00:51:06.350" style="s2">I also detected something in this thread</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.150" end="00:51:07.550" style="s2">that I thought was pretty important</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.350" end="00:51:10.160" style="s2">something I had never put together</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.550" end="00:51:12.500" style="s2">before which was that the communism that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.160" end="00:51:14.470" style="s2">happened in the Soviet Union resulted in</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.500" end="00:51:17.030" style="s2">slavery by a different name that</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.470" end="00:51:20.090" style="s2">effectively rural people were enslaved</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.030" end="00:51:22.340" style="s2">to create the productivity that kept the</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.090" end="00:51:26.660" style="s2">Soviet Union going I never put that</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.340" end="00:51:28.610" style="s2">together right I knew it was terrible</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.660" end="00:51:30.560" style="s2">but I didn&#39;t understand that basically</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.610" end="00:51:32.600" style="s2">they had reinvented slavery as a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.560" end="00:51:35.900" style="s2">mechanism to make that civilization work</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.600" end="00:51:37.640" style="s2">and I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s very far off</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.900" end="00:51:40.550" style="s2">from the Great Leap Forward either no</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.640" end="00:51:43.010" style="s2">it&#39;s in the sixties early Maoist China</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.550" end="00:51:45.820" style="s2">so in some sense I guess what I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.010" end="00:51:48.380" style="s2">is to the extent that this movement</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.820" end="00:51:50.690" style="s2">imagines that what it is is the final</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.380" end="00:51:52.760" style="s2">complete uninvent of slavery it may be</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.690" end="00:51:54.260" style="s2">the reinvention of slavery and that that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.760" end="00:51:58.760" style="s2">is something that we have to track very</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.260" end="00:52:00.710" style="s2">carefully yeah so embedded in this</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.760" end="00:52:02.200" style="s2">question was had any success in changing</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.710" end="00:52:05.840" style="s2">anyone&#39;s mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.200" end="00:52:09.680" style="s2">I don&#39;t maybe we should announce this</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.840" end="00:52:11.330" style="s2">here we actually have a podcast and tens</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.680" end="00:52:13.520" style="s2">of thousands of people sometimes a</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.330" end="00:52:15.380" style="s2">hundred thousand people in in a matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.520" end="00:52:17.330" style="s2">of a couple days we&#39;ll see episodes of</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.380" end="00:52:21.230" style="s2">this podcast and my guess is they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.330" end="00:52:23.000" style="s2">convinced of something so the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.230" end="00:52:27.230" style="s2">premise there is that not everyone and</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.000" end="00:52:27.980" style="s2">arrived in lockstep right and they never</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.230" end="00:52:29.990" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.980" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">but anyway I guess my point would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.990" end="00:52:36.440" style="s2">look you know our story&#39;s weird we stood</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:38.360" style="s2">up people in our immediate midst were</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.440" end="00:52:41.240" style="s2">horrified some people in our immediate</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.360" end="00:52:43.820" style="s2">midst were encouraged people far and</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.240" end="00:52:45.260" style="s2">wide were encouraged some far and wide</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.820" end="00:52:47.780" style="s2">were horrified but you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.260" end="00:52:51.140" style="s2">absolutely reaching people is it happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.780" end="00:52:53.420" style="s2">and it it changes things so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.140" end="00:52:54.680" style="s2">what more to say but yes I think I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.420" end="00:52:56.540" style="s2">unless you&#39;re asking some question I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.680" end="00:53:00.260" style="s2">not quite spotting well I mean I do</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.540" end="00:53:02.570" style="s2">think the question is more more about</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.260" end="00:53:04.490" style="s2">not the fence sitters and the quiet ones</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.570" end="00:53:06.830" style="s2">who were waiting to figure out what they</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.490" end="00:53:07.770" style="s2">thought but the ones who are vocally</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.830" end="00:53:13.100" style="s2">woke</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.770" end="00:53:15.330" style="s2">who are vocal social justice or me um I</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.100" end="00:53:17.430" style="s2">have been approached by a number of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.330" end="00:53:18.630" style="s2">people who said I had it wrong I thought</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.430" end="00:53:20.460" style="s2">you were the villain and then I</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.630" end="00:53:22.800" style="s2">discovered it wasn&#39;t true I&#39;m so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.460" end="00:53:24.870" style="s2">Gavin people it&#39;s not that it&#39;s by far</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.800" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">not the bulk of the people but those</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.870" end="00:53:29.580" style="s2">people also are not the majority that</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:33.690" style="s2">they would want us to believe yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.580" end="00:53:36.270" style="s2">are not yep I agree self-awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.690" end="00:53:38.040" style="s2">ability to abstract obviously adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.270" end="00:53:39.660" style="s2">advantageous for survival of each</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.040" end="00:53:41.130" style="s2">organism but could it be a liability for</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.660" end="00:53:43.320" style="s2">the species or at least for the</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.130" end="00:53:46.370" style="s2">ecosystem once atop the food chain does</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.320" end="00:53:46.370" style="s2">it have diminishing returns</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.760" end="00:53:53.730" style="s2">yeah can I take a shot yes yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.330" end="00:53:56.640" style="s2">you&#39;re a robot with a computer that has</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.730" end="00:53:58.800" style="s2">software running on it that software has</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.640" end="00:54:00.240" style="s2">a lot of heuristics in it that means</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.800" end="00:54:02.580" style="s2">things that aren&#39;t written out fully</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.240" end="00:54:04.080" style="s2">literally they&#39;re things that work</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.580" end="00:54:05.870" style="s2">approximately right if they&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.080" end="00:54:08.250" style="s2">circumstances that they&#39;re built for</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.870" end="00:54:10.920" style="s2">right so your whole visual system uses</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.250" end="00:54:12.540" style="s2">various tricks to parse the way photons</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.920" end="00:54:14.580" style="s2">are bouncing around the world but it</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.540" end="00:54:16.170" style="s2">makes objects that are real appear real</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.580" end="00:54:21.320" style="s2">and you know where to find them by</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.170" end="00:54:21.320" style="s2">experience right so those heuristics are</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.770" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">because they are not the object itself</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.390" end="00:54:29.550" style="s2">they can fail if they are faced with</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">data they can either fail because the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.550" end="00:54:33.240" style="s2">data is noisy or worse they can fail</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:35.340" style="s2">because there&#39;s something systematically</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.240" end="00:54:38.280" style="s2">off about the data and the problem that</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.340" end="00:54:43.290" style="s2">you are identifying is that we are wired</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.280" end="00:54:47.730" style="s2">to deal with a social world in which the</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.290" end="00:54:51.060" style="s2">illusion of self is useful but empowered</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.730" end="00:54:53.340" style="s2">to actually bring something of the self</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.060" end="00:54:55.890" style="s2">into the world and treat it as the</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.340" end="00:54:57.360" style="s2">important object many people fall into</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.890" end="00:54:59.400" style="s2">that and they do not understand that</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.360" end="00:55:01.590" style="s2">they are a tiny blip on a long</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.400" end="00:55:04.710" style="s2">historical trajectory and that it is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.590" end="00:55:06.510" style="s2">gift to be alive for you know 80 90</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.710" end="00:55:08.460" style="s2">years but that that is not the point of</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.510" end="00:55:10.260" style="s2">the exercise all right the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.460" end="00:55:12.840" style="s2">exercise has to do with that long</p>

<p begin="00:55:15.330" end="00:55:19.290" style="s2">is actually a hazard to the entire</p>

<p begin="00:55:33.150" end="00:55:37.109" style="s2">hear commentary on the Trump speech from</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.670" end="00:56:27.119" style="s2">whoa cleft is now handing the president</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.589" end="00:56:30.930" style="s2">truth just as we have handed over</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.119" end="00:56:33.089" style="s2">science and we have handed over reason</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.930" end="00:56:34.980" style="s2">and we have handed over the logic behind</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.089" end="00:56:37.380" style="s2">governance and all of these things we</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.980" end="00:56:40.140" style="s2">are handing over all of the most</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.380" end="00:56:41.789" style="s2">important stuff to one side that is also</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.140" end="00:56:44.490" style="s2">fiercely ideological and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.789" end="00:56:46.829" style="s2">terrible error but at the other hand you</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.490" end="00:56:48.150" style="s2">know I don&#39;t want to be part of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.829" end="00:56:50.430" style="s2">group that just because the president</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.150" end="00:56:52.279" style="s2">says it thinks it&#39;s wrong it&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.430" end="00:56:54.630" style="s2">it works right if we&#39;re gonna hand over</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.279" end="00:56:56.339" style="s2">science to the president and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.630" end="00:56:58.500" style="s2">president&#39;s gonna defend it then well</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.339" end="00:57:02.430" style="s2">when the president defends science you</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.500" end="00:57:05.309" style="s2">know he&#39;s he&#39;s saying the truth yep next</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.430" end="00:57:06.779" style="s2">question from echo you said communism</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.309" end="00:57:08.460" style="s2">can&#39;t work because jeans will openly or</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.779" end="00:57:10.589" style="s2">secretly work at least partly for</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.460" end="00:57:12.210" style="s2">themselves would it work in a nation of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.589" end="00:57:14.759" style="s2">clones maybe with different clone types</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.210" end="00:57:19.140" style="s2">for each function like ants yes let me</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.759" end="00:57:22.099" style="s2">okay so that was your answer I actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.140" end="00:57:27.509" style="s2">had just an aside so ants aren&#39;t clones</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.099" end="00:57:29.579" style="s2">but they are mostly female workers who</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.509" end="00:57:31.200" style="s2">if they share both a mother and father</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.579" end="00:57:32.880" style="s2">are three-quarters related to each other</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.200" end="00:57:35.340" style="s2">the sisters are which is more closely</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.880" end="00:57:36.660" style="s2">related to each other than the</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.340" end="00:57:39.140" style="s2">are to whether their mother or would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.660" end="00:57:41.550" style="s2">daughters and so they&#39;re invested in</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.140" end="00:57:44.850" style="s2">protecting their queen their mothers so</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.550" end="00:57:47.310" style="s2">that they can get more sisters at a</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.850" end="00:57:48.840" style="s2">purely genetic level they win more when</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.310" end="00:57:51.000" style="s2">they get more full sisters than they do</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.840" end="00:57:52.470" style="s2">by breaking out on their own and</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.000" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">producing kids of their own and so you</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.470" end="00:57:59.550" style="s2">end up with a youth social society which</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:02.070" style="s2">is quite close-knit and has very little</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.550" end="00:58:03.450" style="s2">reason for competition within it</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.070" end="00:58:06.810" style="s2">although obviously competition does</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.450" end="00:58:10.440" style="s2">happen so there are no ant clone</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.810" end="00:58:12.210" style="s2">societies there are for instance well</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.440" end="00:58:14.730" style="s2">unlike nomads offer us the whiptail</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.210" end="00:58:17.130" style="s2">lizards in the Sonoran Desert go</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.730" end="00:58:18.840" style="s2">parthenogenetic and they have you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.130" end="00:58:20.100" style="s2">totally they&#39;re still not clones they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.840" end="00:58:22.050" style="s2">they&#39;re actually parthenogenetic so</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.100" end="00:58:23.670" style="s2">there are a hundred percent each kid</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.050" end="00:58:26.430" style="s2">each daughter is a hundred percent</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.670" end="00:58:29.370" style="s2">related to its mother but they self</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.430" end="00:58:32.010" style="s2">they don&#39;t clone and so you lose genetic</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.370" end="00:58:34.080" style="s2">variability with each reproductive event</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.010" end="00:58:36.000" style="s2">but in each of the cases of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.080" end="00:58:37.920" style="s2">parthenogenetic species there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.000" end="00:58:39.330" style="s2">place to borrow diversity from so even</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.920" end="00:58:41.430" style="s2">down that road we&#39;re not going to find</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.330" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">with the right tails for model right lip</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.430" end="00:58:47.100" style="s2">tails and a fits and all the others but</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:49.080" style="s2">anyway the thing you&#39;re looking for the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.100" end="00:58:50.700" style="s2">answer is a simple yes right the body is</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.080" end="00:58:52.410" style="s2">communist that&#39;s what it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.700" end="00:58:54.990" style="s2">communist because all the cells are</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.410" end="00:58:56.400" style="s2">clones and it works and communism can</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.990" end="00:58:57.920" style="s2">work hey isn&#39;t that good news you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.400" end="00:59:00.260" style="s2">what you need to make communism work</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.920" end="00:59:04.110" style="s2">brutality you need to reorganize</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.260" end="00:59:05.160" style="s2">people&#39;s motivations by threatening them</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.110" end="00:59:07.080" style="s2">if they act according to their</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.160" end="00:59:09.870" style="s2">individuality which is why communism is</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.080" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">so frightening and you need to keep up</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.870" end="00:59:14.580" style="s2">the brutality day-in day-out forever or</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:17.010" style="s2">you never ends or you need to build it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.580" end="00:59:18.090" style="s2">into people&#39;s developmental environment</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.010" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">so that they can&#39;t think for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.090" end="00:59:22.290" style="s2">you turn them into to sound like</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:26.130" style="s2">cultural zombies so anyway it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.290" end="00:59:27.810" style="s2">bad idea and that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.130" end="00:59:30.180" style="s2">be made to function I mean and this is a</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.810" end="00:59:33.590" style="s2">it&#39;s just it&#39;s very clear</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.180" end="00:59:36.300" style="s2">the fact is for life to be worth living</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.590" end="00:59:38.730" style="s2">the human has to be liberated to</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.300" end="00:59:40.170" style="s2">discover what is good it does not mean</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.730" end="00:59:41.880" style="s2">that everybody uses their Liberty well</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.170" end="00:59:44.580" style="s2">they don&#39;t most people squander it but</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.880" end="00:59:46.200" style="s2">having Liberty is the gift that we</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.580" end="00:59:48.610" style="s2">should be trying to give to other human</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.200" end="00:59:51.910" style="s2">beings and a communism</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.610" end="00:59:54.040" style="s2">exit because it requires brutality in</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.910" end="00:59:55.930" style="s2">order to overcome the individuality that</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.040" end="00:59:58.260" style="s2">would cause the game theory to break</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.930" end="01:00:02.110" style="s2">down that&#39;s a very dangerous situation</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.260" end="01:00:06.250" style="s2">so it is not a glorious solution to any</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.110" end="01:00:09.310" style="s2">problem do multiple identical twins get</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.250" end="01:00:12.280" style="s2">along any studies doing some so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.310" end="01:00:13.780" style="s2">know this could mean pairings of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.280" end="01:00:15.040" style="s2">identical twins where you have more than</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.780" end="01:00:17.470" style="s2">one set of identical twins within</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.040" end="01:00:19.090" style="s2">families do the different sets get along</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.470" end="01:00:20.830" style="s2">or we talk about multiples like triplets</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.090" end="01:00:21.820" style="s2">and quadruplets do they get along either</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.830" end="01:00:22.420" style="s2">way I don&#39;t know the answer to our</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.820" end="01:00:24.400" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.420" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">now there were double mint gum</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.400" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">commercials that suggests that identical</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:31.030" style="s2">twins often get along and look lovely</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:36.250" style="s2">that&#39;s we&#39;re probably the target</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.030" end="01:00:38.770" style="s2">audience for those like a preteen yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.250" end="01:00:40.330" style="s2">probably but here&#39;s the thing twins</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.770" end="01:00:41.650" style="s2">identical twins do get along very well</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.330" end="01:00:42.970" style="s2">and they have a very good reason to get</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.650" end="01:00:44.590" style="s2">along very well they get along really</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.970" end="01:00:46.420" style="s2">well for the same reason that your liver</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.590" end="01:00:49.300" style="s2">and your heart get along they have no</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.420" end="01:00:51.760" style="s2">reason to disagree and then at some</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.300" end="01:00:53.830" style="s2">point we will delve deeply into the</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.760" end="01:00:55.930" style="s2">story of Kalat rickets I think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.830" end="01:00:58.120" style="s2">mentioned it once before but Calicut</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.930" end="01:00:59.680" style="s2">monkeys have a whole different twist on</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.120" end="01:01:01.150" style="s2">this identical twin thing and no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.680" end="01:01:03.960" style="s2">not identical twins yeah they go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.150" end="01:01:06.820" style="s2">and get it twisted they get it twisted</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.960" end="01:01:08.770" style="s2">this is Marva sets and tamarins yellow</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.820" end="01:01:10.300" style="s2">chickens which are marvelous they are so</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.770" end="01:01:11.980" style="s2">weightless Reacher&#39;s yeah and actually</p>

<p begin="01:01:11.980" end="01:01:17.350" style="s2">they include the smallest extant species</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.170" end="01:01:19.560" style="s2">of monkey the pygmy marmoset tiny tiny</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.350" end="01:01:21.760" style="s2">little guys as adults with long tails I</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.560" end="01:01:23.710" style="s2">put in a lot of work and I got a great</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.760" end="01:01:25.020" style="s2">picture of a pygmy marmoset in our last</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.710" end="01:01:27.970" style="s2">trip to the Amazon</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.020" end="01:01:30.760" style="s2">that was this year what do you mean this</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.970" end="01:01:31.300" style="s2">we were in the Amazon in 2020 yes that</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.760" end="01:01:34.060" style="s2">can&#39;t be right</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.300" end="01:01:37.150" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s gotta have been decades ago my</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.060" end="01:01:38.770" style="s2">god hmm yeah before coronavirus we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.150" end="01:01:43.420" style="s2">about an hour okay let&#39;s do four more</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.770" end="01:01:45.910" style="s2">how about where could a genuinely valid</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.420" end="01:01:48.340" style="s2">scientific study quantifying wow I just</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.910" end="01:01:49.870" style="s2">lost my place could a genuinely valid</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.340" end="01:01:51.910" style="s2">scientific study quantifying how much</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.870" end="01:01:54.220" style="s2">influence past racism in its current</p>

<p begin="01:01:57.160" end="01:02:01.960" style="s2">would it be desirable to do so yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.580" end="01:02:10.630" style="s2">see no obstacle</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.960" end="01:02:14.170" style="s2">this I don&#39;t see it is not clear to me</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.630" end="01:02:16.720" style="s2">as my experiment design brain is working</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.170" end="01:02:18.820" style="s2">here and I&#39;m trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.720" end="01:02:23.290" style="s2">all the inputs are that you would have</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.820" end="01:02:25.510" style="s2">to track and and in what way over how</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.290" end="01:02:27.580" style="s2">much time with different degrees of</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.510" end="01:02:30.220" style="s2">accuracy and I don&#39;t see how it can be</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.580" end="01:02:31.420" style="s2">done well I think you would start</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.220" end="01:02:33.760" style="s2">because I think you would have different</p>

<p begin="01:03:06.760" end="01:03:10.150" style="s2">could actually track the fine-grain</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.680" end="01:03:12.400" style="s2">relatedness and you could figure out</p>

<p begin="01:03:12.400" end="01:03:19.869" style="s2">what prior population and let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.849" end="01:03:21.520" style="s2">you could reconstruct the history of</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.869" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">slavery so you could see which</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.520" end="01:03:28.270" style="s2">individuals were enslaved where and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:31.359" style="s2">you could do a statistical analysis of</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.270" end="01:03:33.910" style="s2">the ways in which people live and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.359" end="01:03:36.089" style="s2">could compare it to the percentages that</p>

<p begin="01:03:38.380" end="01:03:44.560" style="s2">could just simply test hypotheses of</p>

<p begin="01:03:50.800" end="01:03:56.200" style="s2">not sure how operational it is operation</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.250" end="01:03:57.490" style="s2">Eliza below I don&#39;t think it is</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.200" end="01:04:00.849" style="s2">operationalized well I&#39;m just trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.490" end="01:04:03.580" style="s2">see in principle if such a thing is if</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.849" end="01:04:05.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a valid line of inquiry yeah no I</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.580" end="01:04:08.200" style="s2">think it is but I mean this is this is</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.200" end="01:04:10.300" style="s2">exactly where we will tend to butt heads</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.200" end="01:04:12.339" style="s2">and it&#39;s not butting heads it&#39;s just I</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.300" end="01:04:13.180" style="s2">read the question as very much one about</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.339" end="01:04:15.640" style="s2">County</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.180" end="01:04:17.349" style="s2">cool science be done and I&#39;m not sure it</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.640" end="01:04:20.230" style="s2">can be I don&#39;t think it&#39;s operation</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.349" end="01:04:22.000" style="s2">Eliza ball and so well I think I agree</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.230" end="01:04:24.010" style="s2">with you about that yeah I&#39;m sure it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.000" end="01:04:26.440" style="s2">not operationalize about today it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.010" end="01:04:28.589" style="s2">practical in the future when the</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.440" end="01:04:33.640" style="s2">technology supports it does it become</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.589" end="01:04:35.770" style="s2">possible I don&#39;t know yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.640" end="01:04:36.910" style="s2">it&#39;s theoretically possible so then the</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.770" end="01:04:38.290" style="s2">second part of the question so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.910" end="01:04:39.790" style="s2">still in the first of the four questions</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.290" end="01:04:41.710" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna still try to get to hear it</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.790" end="01:04:44.589" style="s2">would it be desirable to do so assuming</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.710" end="01:04:45.550" style="s2">we have moved forward which means we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.589" end="01:04:48.730" style="s2">also in a different you know social</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.550" end="01:04:51.250" style="s2">milieu but what we want to um I think I</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.730" end="01:04:54.819" style="s2">got this one yeah I believe it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.250" end="01:04:56.559" style="s2">necessary that it remain allowable right</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.819" end="01:04:59.349" style="s2">you have to be allowed to investigate</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.559" end="01:05:00.609" style="s2">any empirical phenomenon I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.349" end="01:05:02.589" style="s2">it would be desirable I don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.609" end="01:05:04.540" style="s2">answer would be helpful right because I</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.589" end="01:05:06.579" style="s2">don&#39;t think it an&#39;t it does anything for</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.540" end="01:05:08.500" style="s2">you that is useful in terms of actually</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.579" end="01:05:12.369" style="s2">remedying the problem and ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.500" end="01:05:17.829" style="s2">what you want is a society in which the</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.369" end="01:05:22.359" style="s2">downstream consequences of of racism Jim</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.829" end="01:05:24.730" style="s2">Crow slavery all of those things has</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.359" end="01:05:26.940" style="s2">been neutralized where we are all in on</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.730" end="01:05:29.349" style="s2">the same story where opportunity is</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.940" end="01:05:31.299" style="s2">distributed as widely as possible and</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.349" end="01:05:33.369" style="s2">where the degree to which it is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.299" end="01:05:35.109" style="s2">evenly distributed is randomly</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.369" end="01:05:37.480" style="s2">distributed right in other words bad</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.109" end="01:05:39.280" style="s2">luck cannot be totally stamped out but</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.480" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">it should not be more likely that you</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.280" end="01:05:42.460" style="s2">encounter bad luck if you&#39;re black for</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:43.150" style="s2">example that&#39;s not bad luck that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.460" end="01:05:47.740" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.150" end="01:05:50.500" style="s2">so the ideal solution does not depend at</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.740" end="01:05:53.980" style="s2">all on the answer to the question of how</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.500" end="01:05:56.020" style="s2">exactly have the the downsides flown to</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.980" end="01:05:58.930" style="s2">different people through time right</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.020" end="01:06:00.040" style="s2">they&#39;re independent so as long as the</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.930" end="01:06:02.349" style="s2">right solution doesn&#39;t depend on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.040" end="01:06:04.930" style="s2">answer to that question I don&#39;t see the</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.349" end="01:06:06.940" style="s2">advantage in pursuing it in fine detail</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.930" end="01:06:09.490" style="s2">there might be some things in it that</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.940" end="01:06:11.440" style="s2">would be desirable to know right because</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.490" end="01:06:12.609" style="s2">we would like to know what the harms of</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.440" end="01:06:14.829" style="s2">those things are and how they have</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.609" end="01:06:16.000" style="s2">travelled through time but the fine</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.829" end="01:06:18.190" style="s2">grained analysis probably isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.000" end="01:06:20.200" style="s2">worthwhile but again the ability to</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.190" end="01:06:21.700" style="s2">study it somebody else may have found</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.200" end="01:06:23.710" style="s2">some reason that it would be valuable to</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.700" end="01:06:25.990" style="s2">find these things and much of what we</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.710" end="01:06:27.190" style="s2">have derived value from in science comes</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.990" end="01:06:28.930" style="s2">from what we call basics</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.190" end="01:06:30.460" style="s2">which means science you do and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.930" end="01:06:31.780" style="s2">know why you&#39;re doing it you just think</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.460" end="01:06:33.310" style="s2">that actually knowing the answer to how</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.780" end="01:06:34.780" style="s2">something works might be helpful in the</p>

<p begin="01:06:34.780" end="01:06:41.040" style="s2">worth the investment so it&#39;s got to be</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.660" end="01:06:43.150" style="s2">allowed I don&#39;t see the advantage but</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.040" end="01:06:44.950" style="s2">the most important thing is that the</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.150" end="01:06:46.240" style="s2">remedies are not dependent on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.950" end="01:06:47.620" style="s2">answers to those questions and so</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.240" end="01:06:54.790" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that should stop us from</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.620" end="01:06:56.680" style="s2">going to the remedies immediately I want</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.790" end="01:07:04.930" style="s2">a large an asterisk but we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.680" end="01:07:06.910" style="s2">time to do I have one I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.930" end="01:07:11.230" style="s2">we need to allow everything that is</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.910" end="01:07:14.020" style="s2">possible and maybe I&#39;ll just leave it</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.230" end="01:07:16.210" style="s2">leave it there you know we we were told</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.020" end="01:07:17.950" style="s2">by a would-be advisor in graduate school</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.210" end="01:07:18.880" style="s2">that some questions shouldn&#39;t be asked</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.950" end="01:07:19.930" style="s2">and they were exactly some of the</p>

<p begin="01:07:19.930" end="01:07:26.470" style="s2">asking and it struck us as destructive</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.200" end="01:07:28.270" style="s2">of science to be told that you just</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.470" end="01:07:30.130" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t ask some questions if people</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.270" end="01:07:33.000" style="s2">imagine that the answers that you get</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.130" end="01:07:37.000" style="s2">might be politically unexperienced</p>

<p begin="01:07:41.980" end="01:07:47.860" style="s2">cannot begin to imagine the effects of</p>

<p begin="01:07:53.830" end="01:07:57.910" style="s2">empower what doesn&#39;t but but here a full</p>

<p begin="01:07:57.910" end="01:08:02.230" style="s2">phenomenon so look I would I would</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.580" end="01:08:03.700" style="s2">accept a caveat based on what ya said</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.230" end="01:08:05.440" style="s2">there are certain phenomena that in</p>

<p begin="01:08:07.030" end="01:08:13.750" style="s2">no but an empirical science so that it</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.030" end="01:08:15.670" style="s2">isn&#39;t as easy and lovely a statement no</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.750" end="01:08:16.930" style="s2">it requires judgment which requires</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.670" end="01:08:19.660" style="s2">gatekeepers which requires that the</p>

<p begin="01:08:24.730" end="01:08:28.540" style="s2">combat here you are right that my</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.470" end="01:08:30.580" style="s2">statement is incorrect there are things</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.540" end="01:08:33.090" style="s2">we must forbid ourselves but what I</p>

<p begin="01:08:38.800" end="01:08:42.190" style="s2">because it&#39;s too dangerous to find them</p>

<p begin="01:08:49.330" end="01:08:54.310" style="s2">draw this line is that if the finding</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.940" end="01:08:56.710" style="s2">out is dangerous then Society has a</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.310" end="01:08:58.750" style="s2">right to prevent it if the knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.710" end="01:09:01.180" style="s2">might be dangerous the problem is you</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.750" end="01:09:02.950" style="s2">can&#39;t draw that line well right because</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.180" end="01:09:04.300" style="s2">as soon as you say oh there&#39;s certain</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.950" end="01:09:06.310" style="s2">knowledge that would be too dangerous if</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.300" end="01:09:09.100" style="s2">we had it then what you&#39;ve done is</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.310" end="01:09:10.840" style="s2">you&#39;ve established the need to judge</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.100" end="01:09:12.730" style="s2">which knowledge is dangerous and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.840" end="01:09:13.720" style="s2">five minutes later we&#39;re screwed yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.730" end="01:09:16.990" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.720" end="01:09:19.510" style="s2">so asterisk right maybe we come back to</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.990" end="01:09:21.790" style="s2">this yeah that&#39;s a good one yeah okay a</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.510" end="01:09:24.880" style="s2">pen penultimate question this one&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.790" end="01:09:26.650" style="s2">a logistical one I think from what I</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.880" end="01:09:28.260" style="s2">understand the Bret and other patreon</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.650" end="01:09:30.730" style="s2">have different purposes so what are they</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.260" end="01:09:33.610" style="s2">also how can a patron find the mentioned</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.730" end="01:09:35.860" style="s2">discord you know we haven&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.610" end="01:09:37.480" style="s2">specified they just they&#39;re both doing</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.860" end="01:09:40.810" style="s2">their thing we&#39;re doing the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.480" end="01:09:43.750" style="s2">membership over at mine because flipping</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.810" end="01:09:46.060" style="s2">back and forth in logging into the two</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.750" end="01:09:47.410" style="s2">of them was proving was driving me a</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.060" end="01:09:50.470" style="s2">little bit crazy so we&#39;re doing that at</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.410" end="01:09:52.990" style="s2">mine and the part of Bret&#39;s that he is</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.470" end="01:09:56.680" style="s2">you know really tending to the most are</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.990" end="01:10:00.330" style="s2">the once monthly longer conversations</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.680" end="01:10:04.600" style="s2">for the patrons at the higher tiers and</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.330" end="01:10:08.050" style="s2">we don&#39;t yet have the discord links up</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.600" end="01:10:08.770" style="s2">there but we will do so maybe not by end</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.050" end="01:10:11.440" style="s2">of business today</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.770" end="01:10:13.150" style="s2">fourth of July there is no business by</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:15.190" style="s2">the end of the weekend for sure okay</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.150" end="01:10:16.690" style="s2">we&#39;ll have those up yep anything you</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.190" end="01:10:18.940" style="s2">wanna say about well I should probably</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.690" end="01:10:20.770" style="s2">say I do feel a little bad there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.940" end="01:10:23.140" style="s2">stuff we&#39;ve set up the patreon my</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.770" end="01:10:24.880" style="s2">patreon a long time ago and we guessed</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.140" end="01:10:26.980" style="s2">at sort of what the tiers should be and</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.880" end="01:10:28.420" style="s2">it&#39;s more complex to change thing I</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.980" end="01:10:31.120" style="s2">believe it might have actually been a</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.420" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">suggestion of Joe Rogan on the very</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.120" end="01:10:34.270" style="s2">first time when we went when we went</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:37.410" style="s2">down to LA with our kids when we left</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.270" end="01:10:39.460" style="s2">Olympia and he was in his old studio and</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.410" end="01:10:41.290" style="s2">Hannah we met him we spent some time</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.460" end="01:10:44.340" style="s2">talking afterwards he was terrific he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.290" end="01:10:48.850" style="s2">just a great guy he was a great guy and</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.340" end="01:10:52.240" style="s2">then I think he said start a podcast and</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.850" end="01:10:53.590" style="s2">and get a patreon and people want to</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.240" end="01:10:54.050" style="s2">hear what you have to say that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.590" end="01:10:55.639" style="s2">he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.050" end="01:10:56.750" style="s2">start a podcast and I said I have the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.639" end="01:10:58.489" style="s2">name it&#39;s gonna be the Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.750" end="01:11:00.530" style="s2">podcast and he said don&#39;t do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.489" end="01:11:02.030" style="s2">gotta be your name right otherwise he</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.530" end="01:11:03.770" style="s2">did but that&#39;s why your name was on it</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.030" end="01:11:05.630" style="s2">that&#39;s why Brett Weinstein is Dark Horse</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.770" end="01:11:08.059" style="s2">podcast was the the compromise position</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.630" end="01:11:10.340" style="s2">yeah um but anyway yeah I think he did</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.059" end="01:11:11.960" style="s2">suggest it but anyway in setting it up</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.340" end="01:11:13.579" style="s2">it was very hard to figure out what the</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.960" end="01:11:15.260" style="s2">teacher should be and some of them have</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.579" end="01:11:17.840" style="s2">worked out less well than others but</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.260" end="01:11:20.840" style="s2">what I would say is the result of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.840" end="01:11:24.260" style="s2">patreon is the podcast now there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.840" end="01:11:26.179" style="s2">stuff too but there&#39;s a lot of podcast</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.260" end="01:11:28.760" style="s2">coming out and that is really what this</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.179" end="01:11:30.409" style="s2">has gone to support and you know it</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.760" end="01:11:32.179" style="s2">exceeds anything promised in the patreon</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.409" end="01:11:35.920" style="s2">so to the extent that I have fallen down</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.179" end="01:11:39.980" style="s2">on things like newsletters the podcast</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.920" end="01:11:41.809" style="s2">hopefully is is a worthy compensation</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.980" end="01:11:44.389" style="s2">yeah and we really really do appreciate</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.809" end="01:11:46.880" style="s2">this employer Sam you do sir it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.389" end="01:11:48.290" style="s2">allowing us to do this and as are the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.880" end="01:11:51.170" style="s2">super chat questions yeah buddy</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.290" end="01:11:52.820" style="s2">appreciate it two more questions would</p>

<p begin="01:11:54.380" end="01:11:57.710" style="s2">there any possibility of him showing up</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.300" end="01:12:00.349" style="s2">on the podcast as well as others from</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.630" end="01:12:20.420" style="s2">seen either of them so I&#39;m a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.739" end="01:12:22.460" style="s2">hesitant to say where things are because</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.420" end="01:12:23.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t have the most recent updates but</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.460" end="01:12:28.010" style="s2">would love to have Jordan on of course</p>

<p begin="01:12:31.880" end="01:12:36.290" style="s2">for the entire family and I believe</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.349" end="01:12:38.199" style="s2">everybody has squeaked by and we</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.290" end="01:12:40.790" style="s2">couldn&#39;t be happier it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.199" end="01:12:44.239" style="s2">important and I hope he will use his</p>

<p begin="01:12:44.239" end="01:12:47.570" style="s2">question what do you think about</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.739" end="01:12:49.670" style="s2">creating an anti woke Pro humanist</p>

<p begin="01:12:56.989" end="01:12:59.719" style="s2">were suggesting is that you figure out</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.130" end="01:13:02.090" style="s2">how to bootstrap these things and my</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.719" end="01:13:03.860" style="s2">guess is they would coalesce ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.090" end="01:13:05.329" style="s2">that to the extent that different</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.860" end="01:13:06.590" style="s2">communities figure out how to get their</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.329" end="01:13:08.420" style="s2">reality check from others</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.590" end="01:13:10.220" style="s2">who are not so sure about what&#39;s going</p>

<p begin="01:13:10.220" end="01:13:16.880" style="s2">would find each other and we might be</p>
