<p begin="00:03:16.080" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">somehow finally in 1987 they had a hit</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.270" end="00:03:24.459" style="s2">but before that they just kept</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:29.220" style="s2">performing live and people kept showing</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.459" end="00:03:33.610" style="s2">up and it was this cult thing mm-hmm and</p>

<p begin="00:03:37.690" end="00:03:41.019" style="s2">you when you looked at their shows it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.310" end="00:03:43.030" style="s2">like a fat guy that looks like Santa</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.019" end="00:03:45.310" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a weird gay looking guy in</p>

<p begin="00:03:45.310" end="00:03:51.720" style="s2">their audience is all like crazy hippies</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.950" end="00:03:54.550" style="s2">and yet somehow when you go to that show</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.720" end="00:03:56.560" style="s2">it&#39;s a mind-blowing experience every</p>

<p begin="00:03:56.560" end="00:04:01.810" style="s2">they had one big hit and then they</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.720" end="00:04:05.040" style="s2">didn&#39;t play it every time and they just</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.810" end="00:04:07.750" style="s2">kind of did they they had an ethic of</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.040" end="00:04:09.300" style="s2">feeding off the audience&#39;s energy never</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.750" end="00:04:12.250" style="s2">playing the same show twice</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.300" end="00:04:14.320" style="s2">experimenting yeah and a lot of times</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.250" end="00:04:15.459" style="s2">they failed and it sucked and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.320" end="00:04:18.070" style="s2">but there was always a couple moments</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.459" end="00:04:19.510" style="s2">when it was incredible yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.070" end="00:04:20.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what I&#39;d like that&#39;s where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.510" end="00:04:23.050" style="s2">like I&#39;m gonna stop just gonna keep</p>

<p begin="00:04:23.050" end="00:04:25.870" style="s2">music that suits the energy of the time</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.630" end="00:04:28.150" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.870" end="00:04:29.530" style="s2">do my best but then suddenly when I have</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.150" end="00:04:33.820" style="s2">something where I can measure with a</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.530" end="00:04:35.740" style="s2">metric and also like I have there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.820" end="00:04:38.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a real desperation that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.740" end="00:04:41.260" style="s2">trying to own I&#39;m like I I&#39;m coming to</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.440" end="00:04:42.820" style="s2">realize like I was always like I do want</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.260" end="00:04:45.160" style="s2">to have artistic integrity in other</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.820" end="00:04:47.229" style="s2">words I can&#39;t I can&#39;t sell out I just am</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.160" end="00:04:49.900" style="s2">not capable of doing something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.229" end="00:04:52.090" style="s2">sort of popular or tailored to Taylor to</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.900" end="00:04:54.490" style="s2">The Times or whatever but I want the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.090" end="00:04:59.320" style="s2">trappings of success I want lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.490" end="00:05:01.770" style="s2">money a beautiful girlfriend and I want</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.320" end="00:05:03.520" style="s2">people to recognize me on the street</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.770" end="00:05:05.289" style="s2">sounds like this sounds like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.520" end="00:05:07.690" style="s2">beginning of Trainspotting and we know</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.289" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">we know where that ended up right so the</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.690" end="00:05:10.660" style="s2">Grateful Dead is an interesting thing to</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:12.940" style="s2">bring up because they were one of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.660" end="00:05:14.800" style="s2">original content marketers right because</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.940" end="00:05:16.270" style="s2">they would allow people to record their</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.800" end="00:05:18.010" style="s2">shows and then distribute their shows</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.270" end="00:05:20.229" style="s2">yeah underground and they didn&#39;t charge</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.010" end="00:05:22.240" style="s2">or license or anything and it was those</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.229" end="00:05:23.800" style="s2">underground tapes that got me into the</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.240" end="00:05:25.539" style="s2">Grateful Dead in the 90s because you</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.800" end="00:05:27.820" style="s2">know there was only like six archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.539" end="00:05:29.199" style="s2">you could pick of who regular character</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.820" end="00:05:30.669" style="s2">you were gonna be in high school and</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.199" end="00:05:32.919" style="s2">Grateful Dead was one of my character</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.669" end="00:05:34.720" style="s2">selections for a couple of years and</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.919" end="00:05:36.190" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s how I got into them because</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.720" end="00:05:37.660" style="s2">somebody handed me a tape of a show and</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.190" end="00:05:40.120" style="s2">so really that&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.660" end="00:05:41.380" style="s2">original original content marketing from</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.120" end="00:05:42.789" style="s2">our perspective you put all this</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.380" end="00:05:44.979" style="s2">out there for free and then eventually</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.789" end="00:05:46.450" style="s2">when you got something to sell hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.979" end="00:05:48.820" style="s2">your people will see well we&#39;ll buy it</p>

<p begin="00:40:32.030" end="00:40:37.220" style="s2">deliberately cynical and the last two</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.520" end="00:40:40.780" style="s2">pieces are very hopeful and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.220" end="00:40:46.880" style="s2">sort of development is is from despair</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.780" end="00:40:50.000" style="s2">to spiritual growth and yes there is</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.880" end="00:40:51.590" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s about the struggle you still</p>

<p begin="00:40:55.700" end="00:41:01.120" style="s2">world and what you&#39;re trying to achieve</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.590" end="00:41:04.790" style="s2">is some kind of surrender to God&#39;s plan</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.120" end="00:41:07.940" style="s2">mmm-hmm I think I as I was reading the</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.790" end="00:41:10.430" style="s2">book I was feeling I&#39;m asking myself</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.940" end="00:41:12.080" style="s2">what&#39;s the arc gonna be here I know that</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.430" end="00:41:15.200" style="s2">there&#39;s not gonna just be a collection</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.080" end="00:41:17.480" style="s2">of just ran bang yeah well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.200" end="00:41:18.710" style="s2">kind of is too it kind of is but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.480" end="00:41:20.240" style="s2">know I&#39;m reading I&#39;m reading I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.710" end="00:41:22.700" style="s2">okay where&#39;s the arc where&#39;s arc I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.240" end="00:41:25.100" style="s2">feeling where&#39;s that I felt set up for</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.700" end="00:41:27.860" style="s2">hope to be honest and so I was looking</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.100" end="00:41:31.550" style="s2">for it and I feel like I found it even</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.860" end="00:41:33.830" style="s2">in its own way but you know what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.550" end="00:41:36.020" style="s2">doing is real art and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.830" end="00:41:37.940" style="s2">because of that people bring their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.020" end="00:41:39.650" style="s2">biases I mean to everything but in</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.940" end="00:41:41.900" style="s2">particular to art their own perception</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.650" end="00:41:43.700" style="s2">and history and expectations and their</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.900" end="00:41:46.040" style="s2">own value of themselves and their own</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.700" end="00:41:47.720" style="s2">self judgment to the observation and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.040" end="00:41:49.310" style="s2">interpretation of real art and in near</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.720" end="00:41:50.840" style="s2">case if they&#39;re reading your book and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.310" end="00:41:52.130" style="s2">they feel like about themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.840" end="00:41:54.650" style="s2">the world maybe they&#39;re gonna come away</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.130" end="00:41:59.180" style="s2">feeling feeling like but like if</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.650" end="00:42:01.760" style="s2">you read the hope comes from the fact</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.180" end="00:42:03.589" style="s2">that you&#39;re grappling with issues that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.760" end="00:42:07.579" style="s2">everyone has to grab</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.589" end="00:42:11.390" style="s2">with fur and so it&#39;s like a it creates a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.579" end="00:42:13.849" style="s2">community community in a way in that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.390" end="00:42:17.509" style="s2">can all relate to this shared experience</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.849" end="00:42:19.999" style="s2">of basically wanting to love and be</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.509" end="00:42:21.950" style="s2">loved I mean is that a fair yes fair</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.999" end="00:42:23.239" style="s2">assessment that&#39;s absolutely what the</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.950" end="00:42:26.749" style="s2">book is about and that&#39;s definitely what</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.239" end="00:42:28.430" style="s2">the next book is about like the next the</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.749" end="00:42:30.019" style="s2">next novel is called true love and</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.430" end="00:42:33.049" style="s2">that&#39;s really the big one so this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.019" end="00:42:34.849" style="s2">this this this book was by the way it</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.049" end="00:42:36.619" style="s2">was meant to be like a creative vacation</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.849" end="00:42:38.390" style="s2">where I collect oh just to collect all</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.619" end="00:42:39.650" style="s2">my old again and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.390" end="00:42:41.569" style="s2">it&#39;s about time for another collection</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.650" end="00:42:43.789" style="s2">and then it just became like it became</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.569" end="00:42:45.559" style="s2">so much more difficult than that this</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.789" end="00:42:47.779" style="s2">was supposed to be a pallid palate</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.559" end="00:42:49.940" style="s2">cleanser between novels and then I</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.779" end="00:42:52.039" style="s2">wanted to put like new stuff into it and</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.940" end="00:42:53.479" style="s2">then the new stuff like so the last</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.039" end="00:42:55.549" style="s2">story in this book it&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.479" end="00:42:57.950" style="s2">spirit and I think it&#39;s one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.549" end="00:42:59.930" style="s2">things I&#39;ve ever done but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.950" end="00:43:01.910" style="s2">transitional the last two pieces in this</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.930" end="00:43:04.190" style="s2">book are sort of transitional into the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.910" end="00:43:08.180" style="s2">the style that I&#39;m trying to build for</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.190" end="00:43:11.029" style="s2">the the next book and I forget what the</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.180" end="00:43:13.249" style="s2">question was at this point but hope yeah</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.029" end="00:43:15.289" style="s2">hope and that&#39;s that&#39;s the message I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.249" end="00:43:20.690" style="s2">trying to build toward more like hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.289" end="00:43:26.630" style="s2">emotionally open vulnerable less jaded</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.690" end="00:43:28.849" style="s2">less persona and I&#39;m trying to but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.630" end="00:43:30.499" style="s2">trying to both do that I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.849" end="00:43:33.710" style="s2">sort of artificially do that as a writer</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.499" end="00:43:36.229" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to do that as a person and</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.710" end="00:43:38.210" style="s2">the writing will reflect that but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.229" end="00:43:41.239" style="s2">hard journey man because I&#39;m still horny</p>

<p begin="00:43:43.849" end="00:43:52.099" style="s2">that won&#39;t cooperate with my desires</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.770" end="00:48:47.540" style="s2">bodies of people who never evolved and</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.450" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">never were able to write honestly about</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.540" end="00:48:51.710" style="s2">themselves and then reflect enough to</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:53.450" style="s2">know that they themselves have changed</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.710" end="00:48:55.670" style="s2">and then therefore their content should</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.450" end="00:48:58.070" style="s2">have changed and perspectives could have</p>

<p begin="00:52:59.040" end="00:53:04.890" style="s2">back once I had some separation from it</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.880" end="00:53:06.990" style="s2">and was able to look at it again and not</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.890" end="00:53:08.910" style="s2">I really agonized over what to include</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.990" end="00:53:10.620" style="s2">in this and like is the first section</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.910" end="00:53:13.020" style="s2">about like sex addiction like too</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.620" end="00:53:16.890" style="s2"> long and all this and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.020" end="00:53:20.940" style="s2">once so right now I&#39;m sick of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.890" end="00:53:22.950" style="s2">it but once I get some distance from</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.940" end="00:53:25.200" style="s2">anima I&#39;m able to appreciate it like</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.950" end="00:53:27.870" style="s2">okay my is pretty good it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.200" end="00:53:29.360" style="s2">good as Michelle Welbeck but it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.870" end="00:53:30.810" style="s2"> good like I&#39;m doing okay</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.360" end="00:53:33.240" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.810" end="00:53:34.710" style="s2">I remember finishing my book and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.240" end="00:53:36.390" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to talk about it think about</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.710" end="00:53:38.940" style="s2">it see it or anything for a while</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.390" end="00:53:41.580" style="s2">afterwards but now when I pick it up I</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.940" end="00:53:43.590" style="s2">just ran a page everyone smile</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.580" end="00:53:47.220" style="s2">end up reading like 20 pages in other</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.590" end="00:53:49.380" style="s2">words I put I&#39;m like a book bed that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.220" end="00:53:51.420" style="s2">what you&#39;d build a style for it so you</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.380" end="00:53:54.980" style="s2">build a style to pull people forward and</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.420" end="00:53:57.210" style="s2">that&#39;s what you sort of you learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.980" end="00:53:59.010" style="s2">you know you&#39;re kind of controlling the</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.210" end="00:54:01.140" style="s2">eye right you&#39;re controlling how how</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.010" end="00:54:02.670" style="s2">fast you drag the eye along the page and</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.140" end="00:54:04.290" style="s2">that has to do with like sentence length</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.670" end="00:54:06.090" style="s2">and how many words you cut you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.290" end="00:54:08.130" style="s2">on the last podcast that like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.090" end="00:54:09.450" style="s2">the sentences are cut really down to</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.130" end="00:54:10.860" style="s2">where like the verbs are cut out and</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.450" end="00:54:12.510" style="s2">stuff and that&#39;s because like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.860" end="00:54:16.740" style="s2">moment where you got to really pull the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.510" end="00:54:19.890" style="s2">person forward fast yeah so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.740" end="00:54:23.250" style="s2">you do the work of building a style is</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.890" end="00:54:25.319" style="s2">so that you can modulate you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.250" end="00:54:28.569" style="s2">pull people alone</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.319" end="00:54:30.520" style="s2">where were you going fanatically do you</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.569" end="00:54:33.339" style="s2">think cuz I want to take this time to</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.520" end="00:54:34.930" style="s2">say one on one hand I&#39;m a huge fan of</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.339" end="00:54:36.579" style="s2">your work I followed you from about more</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.930" end="00:54:38.500" style="s2">than a decade my friend isn&#39;t reading</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.579" end="00:54:40.750" style="s2"> since the old days Jesus Christ</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.500" end="00:54:42.339" style="s2">yeah you know it&#39;s that&#39;s true right</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.750" end="00:54:44.109" style="s2">think back think back to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.339" end="00:54:46.210" style="s2">forums and stuff and this is we used to</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.109" end="00:54:48.609" style="s2">congregate at Laura&#39;s point 20/20 brown</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.210" end="00:54:49.960" style="s2">or in ten years right so I&#39;ve been</p>

<p begin="00:54:53.260" end="00:54:57.520" style="s2">I think I think you could tackle any</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.119" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">theme that you would like the next the</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.520" end="00:55:02.529" style="s2">next book is called true love and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:05.010" style="s2">about true love and there&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.529" end="00:55:07.359" style="s2">plot to it and I have maybe the first</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.010" end="00:55:11.609" style="s2">chapter that I may or may not keep and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.359" end="00:55:13.930" style="s2">have the last sentence and then I have a</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.609" end="00:55:16.420" style="s2">structural I mean I think you need three</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.930" end="00:55:18.430" style="s2">beats when you&#39;re with any story you</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.420" end="00:55:20.559" style="s2">need a that correspond with three</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.430" end="00:55:22.299" style="s2">heuristics right you have the way you</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:24.069" style="s2">remember a long story is by three</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.299" end="00:55:25.660" style="s2">heuristics primacy recency and</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.069" end="00:55:28.119" style="s2">availability in other words you remember</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.660" end="00:55:29.440" style="s2">the first thing primacy the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.119" end="00:55:30.730" style="s2">recently the last thing you heard and</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.440" end="00:55:35.799" style="s2">availability which is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.730" end="00:55:38.410" style="s2">pops and the thing that pops is the end</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.799" end="00:55:40.240" style="s2">of Act two it&#39;s the moment when your</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.410" end="00:55:44.380" style="s2">character is at his most despairing</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.240" end="00:55:46.839" style="s2">point so I have those three things</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.380" end="00:55:48.579" style="s2">and I have kind of a framework of how I</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:51.220" style="s2">want to fit those things together and I</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.579" end="00:55:54.009" style="s2">have I have concepts of the books the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.220" end="00:55:55.869" style="s2">stories that I wanted to resemble but I</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.009" end="00:55:57.369" style="s2">need to experience true love or</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.869" end="00:55:59.529" style="s2">understand what true love is</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.369" end="00:56:01.059" style="s2">and that&#39;s the journey right I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.529" end="00:56:02.470" style="s2">already I&#39;ve also been travelling around</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.059" end="00:56:04.779" style="s2">the country like interviewing people</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.470" end="00:56:07.230" style="s2">about this I&#39;ve been doing like a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.779" end="00:56:10.119" style="s2">the yeah they&#39;re you know I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.230" end="00:56:12.220" style="s2">don&#39;t around like I&#39;m not lazy</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.119" end="00:56:13.210" style="s2">about this stuff I go gather store</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.220" end="00:56:13.960" style="s2">especially when I have to write about</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.210" end="00:56:16.690" style="s2">women</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.960" end="00:56:18.250" style="s2">I very intensely talked to lots of women</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.690" end="00:56:20.500" style="s2">and hear their stories and put them all</p>
