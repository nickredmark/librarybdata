<p begin="00:00:03.050" end="00:00:09.630" style="s2">Okay, we&#39;re going to take a step back, historically</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.630" end="00:00:16.029" style="s2"> Last time we talked about Carl Rogers as a phenomenologist</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.029" end="00:00:21.189" style="s2"> We started our brief exploration of the ideas behind the phenomenology, but now we&#39;re going back in time</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.189" end="00:00:26.109" style="s2"> to talk about the end of the nineteenth century,</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.109" end="00:00:33.410" style="s2"> and we&#39;ll deal with Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard a little more closely,</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.410" end="00:00:38.440" style="s2"> and the reason is because those three men</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.440" end="00:00:44.059" style="s2"> (in my opinion more than anyone else in the nineteenth century) laid the foundation, not just for psychoanalysis</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.059" end="00:00:50.510" style="s2"> and then personality psychology and clinical psychology, but described them</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.510" end="00:00:57.850" style="s2"> also the broader social, political and cultural situation in which modern man finds itself today,</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.850" end="00:01:06.550" style="s2"> and their ideas are extraordinarily refined and well worth understanding,</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.550" end="00:01:12.270" style="s2"> because if you are able ... we&#39;ll cover these personality theories one by one,</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.270" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2"> and we explore biology and neuropsychology, you need an underlying structure.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:21.070" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:01:21.070" end="00:01:24.470" style="s2"> You need an understanding of an underlying structure to give everything a place,</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.470" end="00:01:31.790" style="s2"> in order to be able to understand it better that way ... ideas develop historically,</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.790" end="00:01:37.870" style="s2"> an idea is like a seed,</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.870" end="00:01:40.500" style="s2"> From a seed other plants grow, and the plant grows and gets branches.</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.500" end="00:01:45.950" style="s2"> If you go back to the starting point, you can often better understand the entire structure,</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.950" end="00:01:54.480" style="s2"> and these three men, they are so brilliant it is a pleasure to learn their way of thinking,</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.480" end="00:02:01.430" style="s2"> although it is very debilitating, really.</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.430" end="00:02:09.110" style="s2"> We start with this diagram that you can remember.</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.110" end="00:02:14.020" style="s2"> Think about it from Piaget&#39;s perspective, as we explained that the child “puts themselves together”</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.020" end="00:02:22.750" style="s2"> by practicing micro-routines (motor micro-routines) that are accompanied by perception frames,</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.750" end="00:02:27.660" style="s2"> and also be integrated into a motivation system because they are motivated actions,</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.660" end="00:02:34.060" style="s2"> and the child practices that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.060" end="00:02:39.920" style="s2"> align micro-personalities,</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.920" end="00:02:44.350" style="s2"> to create increasingly complex and increasingly integrated macro personalities.</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.350" end="00:02:48.990" style="s2"> That&#39;s what this diagram shows</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.990" end="00:02:55.530" style="s2"> We look at it from an adult&#39;s point of view,</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.530" end="00:03:00.790" style="s2"> so if you want to be a good person, you can divide “being a good person” into parts,</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.790" end="00:03:07.630" style="s2"> being a good person is an abstract ideal, but as you move closer to the point where goodness is manifested in action,</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.630" end="00:03:13.010" style="s2"> you get closer to concrete actions in the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.010" end="00:03:14.470" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:03:14.470" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2"> So the abstract category of “good person” actually consists of ...</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:25.990" style="s2"> you can see it as a complex melody of motor actions and perceptions,</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.990" end="00:03:29.560" style="s2"> and perception is closely related to motor action because when you perceive something,</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.560" end="00:03:31.460" style="s2"> you do that in part by actively exploring the world.</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.460" end="00:03:34.600" style="s2"> Partly that&#39;s why your eyes are always moving,</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.600" end="00:03:38.890" style="s2"> and that your head moves when you listen, and if you want to touch something you must actively examine it,</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.890" end="00:03:41.890" style="s2"> so it is always an activity of exploration.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.890" end="00:03:50.250" style="s2"> When you think about how the child “assembles” itself step by step</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.250" end="00:03:56.680" style="s2"> can you see that as a biological process unfolding,</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.680" end="00:04:00.700" style="s2"> the child who crawls first and then learns to walk can be seen as a biological development,</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.700" end="00:04:06.990" style="s2"> but that is an unjustified simplification,</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.990" end="00:04:08.890" style="s2"> because people live in a very social world from day one.</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.890" end="00:04:15.709" style="s2"> What that means is the way behavioral patterns or micro-personalities</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.709" end="00:04:22.949" style="s2"> begin to organize, always takes place under the influence of the society of which they are a part.</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.949" end="00:04:34.300" style="s2"> Piaget stated that the child has basic built-in reflexes at birth,</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.300" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2"> and that those reflexes are extended to increasingly complex structures,</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:44.559" style="s2"> but you can see that even the extension of those basic reflexes ...</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.559" end="00:04:48.909" style="s2"> even in the beginning, there is a search and suck reflex that you can elicit from a child</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.909" end="00:04:52.969" style="s2"> tapping the side of his cheek if it&#39;s newborn,</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.969" end="00:04:59.690" style="s2"> and it will try to put whatever ticks in its mouth, that&#39;s part of the reflexes,</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.690" end="00:05:05.919" style="s2"> the built-in perceptual and motor unit that enables the child to start sucking.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.919" end="00:05:11.150" style="s2"> But the bottom line is that what it sucks in is not a static and objective entity.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.150" end="00:05:16.389" style="s2"> It&#39;s a person, and part of breastfeeding is establishing a relationship,</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.389" end="00:05:19.060" style="s2"> a complex relationship because it is not just a nutritional relationship.</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.060" end="00:05:20.449" style="s2"> It is a relationship with concern.</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.449" end="00:05:24.589" style="s2"> It is a relationship based on physical interaction.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.589" end="00:05:30.129" style="s2"> It can be accompanied by nerves, and this often happens, especially with a new mother.</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.129" end="00:05:34.909" style="s2"> It is a very complicated, dynamic, social act,</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.909" end="00:05:42.650" style="s2"> and that means right in the beginning, the baby&#39;s knee-jerk movements</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.650" end="00:05:49.560" style="s2"> must be modified by social necessity in order for that process to run smoothly.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.560" end="00:05:55.800" style="s2"> For example, if a baby is breastfed, it should not bite,</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.800" end="00:06:00.819" style="s2"> he has no teeth yet, so being bitten “in itself” is not a catastrophe, but it is not pleasant.</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.819" end="00:06:04.529" style="s2"> So what happens when the baby bites the mother is the mother pulls back and scares the baby,</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.529" end="00:06:11.550" style="s2"> the baby will cry, and the mother will be shocked by the mistake. The baby must learn ...</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.550" end="00:06:12.659" style="s2"> in a sense he must immediately behave civilized.</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.659" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2"> When Freud talked about the process of socialization, he tended to focus more on toilet training,</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:20.039" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:06:20.039" end="00:06:24.439" style="s2"> because he thought that was the first place where ...</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.439" end="00:06:28.669" style="s2"> the first important place where the “id”</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.669" end="00:06:34.639" style="s2"> of the child (what Rogers would see as the organism&#39;s domain of experience)</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.639" end="00:06:43.979" style="s2"> is brought under the control of the superego,</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.979" end="00:06:50.419" style="s2"> because for the baby it is of course its fundamental biological function to relieve itself,</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.419" end="00:06:55.889" style="s2"> but that is put under very strict social control,</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.889" end="00:06:56.889" style="s2"> and that is a complicated form of learning.</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.889" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2"> In essence, it is the acquisition of voluntary mastery over what before one</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:08.649" style="s2"> involuntary reflex, and that can go well, or bad, or very bad.</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.649" end="00:07:14.219" style="s2"> I knew a family with a daughter who, when she was three,</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.219" end="00:07:16.650" style="s2"> only let her stool flow when she was wearing a diaper.</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.650" end="00:07:20.969" style="s2"> That meant she had complete control over her bowel movements,</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.969" end="00:07:26.699" style="s2"> but that she refused to participate in the social ritual of proper toileting.</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.699" end="00:07:31.650" style="s2"> It was a war, really a war, and such things don&#39;t rarely happen,</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.650" end="00:07:38.289" style="s2"> and you remember the movie Crumb, the mother ... the boy accuses the mother of giving them enemas,</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.289" end="00:07:42.930" style="s2"> and of course she denies that such a thing would have happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.930" end="00:07:46.930" style="s2"> where they both roll their eyes, and they all laugh,</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.930" end="00:07:49.479" style="s2"> but it&#39;s not really amusing.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.479" end="00:07:57.149" style="s2"> Anyway, my point is that even at the micro level, the manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.149" end="00:08:02.909" style="s2"> of micro-personalities expands and organizes in an environment conditioned by social expectation.</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.909" end="00:08:04.580" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:08:04.580" end="00:08:11.849" style="s2"> Okay, then ... this is something we haven&#39;t discussed yet.</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.849" end="00:08:17.419" style="s2"> You may wonder where social expectation comes from.</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.419" end="00:08:22.460" style="s2"> That&#39;s a complicated question because in a way it&#39;s the same question</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.460" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2"> is like where culture comes from, and that&#39;s partly a complex question</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:34.250" style="s2"> because you have to include the evolutionary history that the basic material for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.250" end="00:08:35.250" style="s2"> the development of culture, thus human biology.</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.250" end="00:08:39.579" style="s2"> You have to take that into account,</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.579" end="00:08:44.940" style="s2"> and then you have to consider human history,</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.940" end="00:08:52.190" style="s2"> and what you do not have to take into account is not clear, because it is very difficult to determine the origin</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.190" end="00:08:53.190" style="s2"> discovering the social routines that determine the fundamental social contract.</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.190" end="00:08:55.800" style="s2"> We know how to behave appropriately, in general.</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.800" end="00:09:00.780" style="s2"> We have a set of expectations and a set of desires about how other people will behave towards us</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.780" end="00:09:05.800" style="s2"> and they have the same thing, and everyone is in, and everyone knows,</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.800" end="00:09:09.631" style="s2"> unless they are badly socialized and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.631" end="00:09:11.509" style="s2"> can usually see you immediately.</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.509" end="00:09:15.610" style="s2"> Kids see that because when a three-year-old plays with another three-year-old,</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.610" end="00:09:20.019" style="s2"> and one of them is poorly socialized causing the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.019" end="00:09:25.130" style="s2"> of a ill-mannered two-year-old, the other three-year-old will,</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.130" end="00:09:27.889" style="s2"> the socially developed, do not play with the former.</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.889" end="00:09:33.270" style="s2"> Although they would be fine with playing with a real two-year-old for a while.</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.270" end="00:09:34.270" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:09:34.270" end="00:09:36.130" style="s2"> It takes little time.</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.130" end="00:09:40.750" style="s2"> Children are already developed at the age of three</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.750" end="00:09:47.480" style="s2"> enough to embody the rules that dictate culturally appropriate behavior,</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.480" end="00:09:51.350" style="s2"> and those rules… they are patterns, they are not rules for the child, because the child is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.350" end="00:09:55.800" style="s2"> able to articulate it explicitly, but it can act intuitively.</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.800" end="00:10:00.410" style="s2"> Piaget talked about this because he said it the way</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:09.079" style="s2"> the slightly larger micro personalities, such as a two-year-old,</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.079" end="00:10:14.100" style="s2"> be integrated into the wider social world through games</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.100" end="00:10:20.790" style="s2"> takes place, with peers and older children, and games are a way to ...</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.790" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2"> a game is essentially an agreed… it is an agreed domain of action and perception</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:32.690" style="s2"> with a specific goal, and the goal is defined by the players, and the domain becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.690" end="00:10:36.880" style="s2"> defined by the players, so if you are a good player,</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:39.899" style="s2"> you become part of a higher structure, and that higher structure is the game.</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.899" end="00:10:44.330" style="s2"> When you play football, you will suddenly (if you are civilized) all forms of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.330" end="00:10:50.420" style="s2"> manifest that are appropriate in playing football, and you create your</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.420" end="00:10:55.420" style="s2"> individuality voluntarily subordinate to the higher structure of the game, that one</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.420" end="00:10:59.190" style="s2"> joint agreement, it is a basic social contract.</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.190" end="00:11:04.639" style="s2"> You practice being part of a basic social contract by playing games,</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.639" end="00:11:12.660" style="s2"> and that can be done with games that are relatively simple and regulated by</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.660" end="00:11:17.790" style="s2"> certain conventions and explicit rules, such as football, or that can be on a lake</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.790" end="00:11:26.920" style="s2"> complex, and less structured and explicit way, through</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.920" end="00:11:27.920" style="s2"> &quot;Pretend&quot; play.</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.920" end="00:11:31.540" style="s2"> What kids normally do, when they do, is gather in one</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.540" end="00:11:37.660" style="s2"> small group, and discuss what the play will be like, for example:</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.660" end="00:11:41.399" style="s2"> “We&#39;re going to imitate x. We are going to imitate a family. ”</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.399" end="00:11:45.731" style="s2"> Then everyone gets a role, and you have to act your role, but exactly how to do it</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.731" end="00:11:50.470" style="s2"> acting is left open during the game so you can improvise, and what?</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.470" end="00:11:57.199" style="s2"> children do when they do is act like family because they have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.199" end="00:12:02.400" style="s2"> feeling the family, being a parent is not a collection of ideas about parenting,</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.400" end="00:12:07.560" style="s2"> it is a collection of behavioral patterns.</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.560" end="00:12:12.920" style="s2"> It is a dance that teaches you to dance with your children and your partner,</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.920" end="00:12:18.149" style="s2"> it&#39;s very complicated, and the rules go way beyond what you can put into words,</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.149" end="00:12:21.880" style="s2"> because you can ask yourself a question like, &quot;How should you discipline a child?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.880" end="00:12:27.069" style="s2"> First, you can argue about that endlessly, but second, you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.069" end="00:12:32.740" style="s2"> formulate a set of principles to determine your behavior for all situations in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.740" end="00:12:36.069" style="s2"> a child is likely to disrupt the social environment.</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.069" end="00:12:40.319" style="s2"> You have to be smarter than your expression to be good at something so complex</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.319" end="00:12:45.069" style="s2"> like disciplining a child, for to discipline also means to encourage, one</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.069" end="00:12:49.269" style="s2"> Part of disciplining is, “Don&#39;t do those things,” but another part of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.269" end="00:12:54.390" style="s2"> disciplining is: “You have to do those things,” it is learning</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.390" end="00:13:00.319" style="s2"> a moral code, and much of it is done on the basis of non-verbal behavior,</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.319" end="00:13:07.300" style="s2"> set an example for spontaneous imitation, and all kinds of things that are not verbal.</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.300" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2"> Piaget talked about the game, and games are getting more and more complex</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:20.319" style="s2"> more abstract, and more and more like real life as you get older,</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.319" end="00:13:26.420" style="s2"> until they turn into what sociologists call &quot;roles.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.420" end="00:13:31.889" style="s2"> So the role you&#39;re playing right now is, basically, student, it&#39;s a game,</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.889" end="00:13:36.560" style="s2"> and it is a game because it is in a sense fictional.</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.560" end="00:13:39.760" style="s2"> It&#39;s dramatic fiction in a way.</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.760" end="00:13:45.709" style="s2"> The only reason it exists as a role is because society is structured in such a way that ...</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.709" end="00:13:50.790" style="s2"> it allows you to do what you do and live at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.790" end="00:13:58.560" style="s2"> It is not actually an adaptation to the natural world, but it</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.560" end="00:14:04.410" style="s2"> is real life, you don&#39;t get closer than that to real life, because almost</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.410" end="00:14:09.320" style="s2"> everything that modern humans do, and perhaps for a long time,</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.320" end="00:14:11.339" style="s2"> has this game structure.</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.339" end="00:14:15.470" style="s2"> The games are getting more ... more and more inclusive in a sense,</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.470" end="00:14:21.940" style="s2"> but you can almost say you never get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.940" end="00:14:23.970" style="s2"> you are no longer playing a game.</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.970" end="00:14:28.610" style="s2"> Putting it that way is a bit too simple, because there are games and &quot;meta-games&quot;, but</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.610" end="00:14:31.899" style="s2"> we are not going to talk about meta-games now.</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.899" end="00:14:38.050" style="s2"> You are now able to understand simple games, and you can also do some</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.050" end="00:14:42.459" style="s2"> understand the role patterns of a higher level, for example you can explain what the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.459" end="00:14:44.120" style="s2"> means to be a student.</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.120" end="00:14:48.589" style="s2"> But if you go up the hierarchy… a good person, part of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.589" end="00:14:50.040" style="s2"> good person can be good student.</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.040" end="00:14:53.939" style="s2"> You can roughly indicate what it means to be a good student,</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.939" end="00:15:00.639" style="s2"> although not complete, but if you go to levels above such as “good citizen”</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.639" end="00:15:05.790" style="s2"> or “good person” it becomes more and more difficult to make explicit, because it becomes more and more abstract,</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.790" end="00:15:11.899" style="s2"> and more and more things, so by the time you get to the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.899" end="00:15:14.350" style="s2"> hierarchy, so to speak, &quot;Be a good person&quot; ...</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.350" end="00:15:19.110" style="s2"> That is a phenomenon that is bigger than you can express.</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.110" end="00:15:20.850" style="s2"> It cannot be fully articulated.</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.850" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2"> Now I want to read you something from Nietzsche.</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:52.970" style="s2"> You have to listen carefully, because the way Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.970" end="00:15:53.970" style="s2"> writing has some interesting aspects.</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.970" end="00:16:00.189" style="s2"> He writes aphoristically, and an aphorism is a short statement, often just a sentence</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.189" end="00:16:08.089" style="s2"> usually a paragraph, which contains a lot of ideas, and I think you can say</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.089" end="00:16:11.579" style="s2"> that if you read Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.579" end="00:16:16.190" style="s2"> (and I&#39;m now going to read &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;) every sentence</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.190" end="00:16:20.649" style="s2"> contains an idea, and often an original idea, and that is a remarkable achievement.</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.649" end="00:16:25.779" style="s2"> I have often gone through books and marked them (then I make a fold in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.779" end="00:16:28.620" style="s2"> page) where I found a valuable idea.</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.620" end="00:16:32.600" style="s2"> An idea that I have not seen before, an original idea.</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.600" end="00:16:37.129" style="s2"> And in the average book I read, I don&#39;t find any.</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.129" end="00:16:42.839" style="s2"> Maybe one or two, but Nietzsche&#39;s probably twenty each</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.839" end="00:16:49.449" style="s2"> page, which means… it brings together a tremendous amount of information in a very</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.449" end="00:16:53.089" style="s2"> small space, he tried to do it, and he had reasons for it.</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.089" end="00:16:56.839" style="s2"> One was that his health was not good, although he was a genius from a young age.</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.839" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2"> He was a professor in Germany when he was, I think, twenty-two or twenty-three years old,</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:08.520" style="s2"> which is impossible, because you will not become a professor, certainly one hundred and thirty or one hundred and forty years ago</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.520" end="00:17:14.110" style="s2"> a German university at the age of twenty-three is simply impossible.</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.110" end="00:17:18.850" style="s2"> He was a genius, but his health failed him, causing writing</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.850" end="00:17:24.370" style="s2"> was difficult for him, so what he did was think very long and write very short,</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.370" end="00:17:28.500" style="s2"> that meant he had a huge amount of thoughts (a genius amount)</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.500" end="00:17:32.910" style="s2"> compressed into a single sentence, or paragraph,</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.910" end="00:17:38.210" style="s2"> and he said he liked to philosophize with a hammer ... that hierarchy I just left</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.210" end="00:17:43.920" style="s2"> See, we&#39;ve talked about the idea that if something disrupts your life,</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.920" end="00:17:51.850" style="s2"> the size of your comment matches</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.850" end="00:17:55.980" style="s2"> the level at which it occurs.</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.980" end="00:18:02.000" style="s2"> It does you more harm if you are accused of being a bad person</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.000" end="00:18:05.690" style="s2"> than when someone complains about you, your fork on the other side</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.690" end="00:18:07.870" style="s2"> off the plate.</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.870" end="00:18:14.410" style="s2"> I think you can say that those certain value hierarchies ...</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.410" end="00:18:18.460" style="s2"> they are a kind of cards, as it were.</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.460" end="00:18:25.080" style="s2"> They are small units of manners through which you know how to maneuver in the world,</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.080" end="00:18:30.070" style="s2"> and as you move up the hierarchy the map gets bigger and bigger,</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.070" end="00:18:34.990" style="s2"> and if you destroy someone&#39;s card from whatever fork to put on the table, it&#39;s not that bad.</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.990" end="00:18:37.690" style="s2"> You can easily correct that.</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.690" end="00:18:42.310" style="s2"> That leaves 99.99 percent of the personality intact.</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.310" end="00:18:48.990" style="s2"> But if you fail a crucial test, for example,</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.990" end="00:18:54.310" style="s2"> while you study because you want to study medicine,</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.310" end="00:18:57.540" style="s2"> that will destroy about fifty to sixty percent of your personality,</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.540" end="00:19:03.470" style="s2"> or at least it will feel that way, and that&#39;s because the structure you&#39;re using to create the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.470" end="00:19:08.490" style="s2"> relationship between yourself and the world to regulate at a high level is damaged, and</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.490" end="00:19:13.200" style="s2"> that makes it no longer valid… if you are not a student. If you are no longer a good student,</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:17.710" style="s2"> then all parts that made you a good student can no longer be valid,</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.710" end="00:19:21.950" style="s2"> and you may have put a lot of effort into being a good student, so when all of a sudden you aren&#39;t,</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.950" end="00:19:26.370" style="s2"> you have to ask yourself: &quot;What am I actually, and where are the mistakes?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.370" end="00:19:33.480" style="s2"> That&#39;s an extremely difficult cognitive problem because who knows how long you will</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.480" end="00:19:36.930" style="s2"> it took to build that structure.</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.930" end="00:19:40.760" style="s2"> Maybe fifteen years, and you&#39;ve practiced a lot on it, and it&#39;s a big one</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.760" end="00:19:45.120" style="s2"> part of your identity, because someone may ask you, &quot;What are you?&quot; And you say, “I am</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.120" end="00:19:46.560" style="s2"> a student.&quot; They may say, “What are you doing?” But they can also be easy</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.560" end="00:19:48.020" style="s2"> say &quot;What are you?&quot; &quot;I am a student.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.020" end="00:19:51.530" style="s2"> Now, if you&#39;re not a student (at least, if you define it that way), what are you really?</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.530" end="00:19:52.530" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:19:52.530" end="00:19:59.230" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:19:59.230" end="00:20:01.800" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:20:01.800" end="00:20:06.710" style="s2"> Well, Nietzsche put a lot of information in a sentence or paragraph, and you have to be whole</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.710" end="00:20:08.560" style="s2"> be careful when you read it.</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.560" end="00:20:12.910" style="s2"> Jung is like that, he gives you some information, packaged in a paragraph, kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.910" end="00:20:17.430" style="s2"> information that disrupts tall structures.</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.430" end="00:20:22.140" style="s2"> You won&#39;t even notice, it&#39;s so undermining, and that was exactly</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.140" end="00:20:23.140" style="s2"> intention.</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.140" end="00:20:24.140" style="s2"> That&#39;s what he aimed for.</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.140" end="00:20:25.410" style="s2"> He had his reasons for that.</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.410" end="00:20:29.700" style="s2"> He would say you have to be broken down to the foundation before you can rebuild.</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.700" end="00:20:32.550" style="s2"> It&#39;s like a journey to the underworld.</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.550" end="00:20:37.320" style="s2"> And I think that&#39;s philosophy.</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.320" end="00:20:44.280" style="s2"> You cannot learn a new principle without making old principles disappear, because you</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.280" end="00:20:47.090" style="s2"> cannot have both the old and the new at the same time.</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.090" end="00:20:53.440" style="s2"> Radical insights almost always require the destruction of old habits and</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:21:01.510" style="s2"> actions and perceptions, and that&#39;s a kind of death, an abstract death like it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.510" end="00:21:06.810" style="s2"> true, but that does not mean that it is not painful, and as the abstract death intense</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.810" end="00:21:11.570" style="s2"> enough, it can drive people to suicide because it makes them seem easier</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.570" end="00:21:17.950" style="s2"> kill himself than repair himself, confront the tension,</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.950" end="00:21:20.580" style="s2"> and going through the suffering and the excruciatingly difficult process of rebuilding.</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.580" end="00:21:27.150" style="s2"> It is quite possible that they experience this as more emotionally threatening than death ...</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.150" end="00:21:28.150" style="s2"> that is not very rare.</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.150" end="00:21:31.790" style="s2"> It is certainly a behavior that everyone ... I suspect ...</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.790" end="00:21:36.290" style="s2"> everyone here has known someone who is related in some way</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.290" end="00:21:41.690" style="s2"> had with suicide. Maybe no family members,</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.690" end="00:21:45.530" style="s2"> or even relatives, but the chances of you being someone</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.530" end="00:21:50.290" style="s2"> knows who knows a case of suicide is very great.</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.290" end="00:21:51.290" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:21:51.290" end="00:21:55.230" style="s2"> So Nietzsche is a very dangerous thinker.</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.230" end="00:22:00.910" style="s2"> The only person I know who comes close to him in that regard is Jung, and</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.910" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2"> Jung is actually less problematic, because much of what Dostoevsky does is destruction.</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:13.440" style="s2"> It&#39;s intelligent, brilliant destruction, but it doesn&#39;t really solve it.</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.440" end="00:22:18.460" style="s2"> He outlines, as it were, the possibility of a solution, and died young, and what happened</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.460" end="00:22:23.020" style="s2"> What happened was that Jung continued where Nietzsche had left off, and he did</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.020" end="00:22:24.780" style="s2"> tried to solve the problems that Nietzsche had left behind.</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.780" end="00:22:30.020" style="s2"> It was Nietzsche, in a sense along with Dostoevsky, who made the final death</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.020" end="00:22:35.220" style="s2"> God preached at the end of the nineteenth century, leaving people without it</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.220" end="00:22:39.680" style="s2"> faith, and we&#39;ll discuss why that was so important.</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.680" end="00:22:40.680" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:22:40.680" end="00:22:44.850" style="s2"> What Jung did, he was trying to save the father from the underworld, in a sense.</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.850" end="00:22:45.850" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:22:45.850" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2"> He tried… he tried to go back to the religious traditions that Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:55.040" style="s2"> saw as irretrievably anachronistic and scrapped by the claims of science.</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.040" end="00:23:00.320" style="s2"> He tried to go back to those religious traditions and rethink them</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.320" end="00:23:05.730" style="s2"> from a psychological perspective to the necessary meaning contained therein</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.730" end="00:23:11.160" style="s2"> decided to reclaim so that people could return to their culture and, in principle,</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.160" end="00:23:15.610" style="s2"> would not be as prone to pathological belief systems such as ideologies appearing to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.610" end="00:23:20.330" style="s2"> Nietzsche stated very clearly, and Dostoevsky was also aware of it</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.330" end="00:23:26.201" style="s2"> late nineteenth century, that the death of God would cause people</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.201" end="00:23:29.660" style="s2"> would turn en masse to rationalist ideologies and that would claim many lives.</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.660" end="00:23:32.700" style="s2"> They saw it coming, and that&#39;s a wonderful prediction.</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.700" end="00:23:34.620" style="s2"> It is truly wonderful.</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.620" end="00:23:37.730" style="s2"> It shows how deeply they understood the structure.</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.730" end="00:23:41.960" style="s2"> Okay, I&#39;m going to read something from Nietzsche, and then we&#39;ll go back to the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.960" end="00:23:47.150" style="s2"> so that you can understand more of the structure of the hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.150" end="00:23:48.150" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:23:48.150" end="00:23:52.950" style="s2"> He&#39;s talking about philosophical ideas here, and in fact he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.950" end="00:23:54.830" style="s2"> formulated ethics.</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.830" end="00:24:01.460" style="s2"> You might think that philosophers come up with moral principles,</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.460" end="00:24:06.830" style="s2"> and that is how one often thinks about, in particular, philosophical ethics.</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.830" end="00:24:11.390" style="s2"> As if it were the philosophers who come up with the ideas, but that&#39;s not what Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.390" end="00:24:12.740" style="s2"> believed.</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.740" end="00:24:15.690" style="s2"> Instead, he thought the following:</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.690" end="00:24:24.820" style="s2"> “Different philosophical ideas are not developed freely or independently.</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.820" end="00:24:30.630" style="s2"> They grow in connection with each other, even if they seem sudden and random</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.630" end="00:24:35.880" style="s2"> appear in the history of thought, they are part of a system</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.880" end="00:24:40.470" style="s2"> like all members of the fauna of a continent. ”</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.470" end="00:24:42.400" style="s2"> It&#39;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.400" end="00:24:47.300" style="s2"> The first idea he brings up is that you… the best way to get over</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.300" end="00:24:54.540" style="s2"> to think of a philosophical system, such as a philosophical ethic, is as if the</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.540" end="00:24:58.410" style="s2"> different claims are like animals related to each other within an ecosystem.</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.410" end="00:25:04.240" style="s2"> He uses a biological metaphor for the emergence of a philosophical system.</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.240" end="00:25:09.540" style="s2"> It&#39;s an interesting way of thinking, and it makes sense because</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.540" end="00:25:13.970" style="s2"> as a philosophical system of ethics (a philosophical system that tells you how to behave and why)</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.970" end="00:25:19.590" style="s2"> is about how you should behave and you&#39;re a biological being</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.590" end="00:25:24.140" style="s2"> then it makes sense that the concepts that direct actions can be seen</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.140" end="00:25:30.800" style="s2"> as biological entities.</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.800" end="00:25:35.120" style="s2"> They are abstract biological entities, but they have the same nature</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.120" end="00:25:39.380" style="s2"> as biological entities, which, according to Nietzsche, means that they function within the same rules.</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.380" end="00:25:44.380" style="s2"> In places like this he is ahead of Freud.</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.380" end="00:25:52.360" style="s2"> Nietzsche says, “They are part of a system like all members of the fauna</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.360" end="00:25:55.090" style="s2"> of a continent.</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.090" end="00:26:01.950" style="s2"> This eventually becomes visible through the following: continuously fill the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.950" end="00:26:08.650" style="s2"> various philosophers always put in a basic scheme of possible philosophies.</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.650" end="00:26:13.710" style="s2"> Through an invisible spell they end up in the same orbit again and again, how</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.710" end="00:26:18.190" style="s2"> independent they also feel with their critical or systematic will.</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.190" end="00:26:20.230" style="s2"> They are guided by something within.</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.230" end="00:26:25.550" style="s2"> Something drives them to a certain order, one after the other, namely the inner methodology</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.550" end="00:26:28.580" style="s2"> and proportion of their ideas.</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.580" end="00:26:35.620" style="s2"> Their thinking is not so much a discovery as a recognition,</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.620" end="00:26:41.230" style="s2"> a remembering, a return, and a coming home to a distant, old communal house</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.230" end="00:26:43.080" style="s2"> of the soul from which these ideas sprang.</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.080" end="00:26:46.950" style="s2"> Philosophizing in that respect is actually a kind of atavism of the highest level. ”</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.950" end="00:26:51.570" style="s2"> Okay, this is the idea.</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.570" end="00:27:00.160" style="s2"> It contains two basic ideas that distinguish Nietzsche.</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.160" end="00:27:18.960" style="s2"> Okay, I&#39;m going to read another piece, which explains the first.</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.960" end="00:27:24.860" style="s2"> “It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up to now consisted of,</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.860" end="00:27:32.020" style="s2"> namely, a confession of its creator, and a taste of an involuntary and</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.020" end="00:27:37.590" style="s2"> unconscious autobiography, and in addition that morality (or non-morality) in every philosophy is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.590" end="00:27:42.000" style="s2"> true core, from which the whole plant sprouts. ”</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.000" end="00:27:46.180" style="s2"> That is a very radical claim, because what Nietzsche says is that philosophies,</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.180" end="00:27:53.270" style="s2"> even if they see themselves as rational, are deeply personal, and they are also necessary</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.270" end="00:27:58.720" style="s2"> part of a motivational structure that is either life-affirming or life-denying, something in that trend.</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.720" end="00:27:59.860" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:27:59.860" end="00:28:03.300" style="s2"> There is no philosophizing without values.</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.300" end="00:28:09.470" style="s2"> It is the expression of biological and culturally conditioned existence,</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.470" end="00:28:14.250" style="s2"> conditioned by (say) the kind of fundamental forces that Freud has</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.250" end="00:28:20.210" style="s2"> described in the biological domain, and conditioned by the cultural processes</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.210" end="00:28:25.350" style="s2"> which we described when we just talked about Piaget, and what the philosopher does is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.350" end="00:28:31.800" style="s2"> observing all those things that are going on, putting words to it, and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.800" end="00:28:33.290" style="s2"> confuse with his own thoughts.</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.290" end="00:28:35.320" style="s2"> It&#39;s a brilliant idea.</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.320" end="00:28:37.210" style="s2"> You can see it like this.</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.210" end="00:28:42.761" style="s2"> One of the things Piaget said was when kids start playing games</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.761" end="00:28:48.090" style="s2"> (if they are little), games together… you can watch the children together</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.090" end="00:28:52.530" style="s2"> play games, maybe eight children are playing marbles for example,</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.530" end="00:28:57.520" style="s2"> then you take the children out of the game and ask what the rules are, and what is there</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.520" end="00:29:05.070" style="s2"> then it happens that you have a collection of different (different and conflicting)</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.070" end="00:29:09.600" style="s2"> explicit rules, and what that means is that the children can play the game</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.600" end="00:29:14.480" style="s2"> when they are playing the game, and in the context of all other people,</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.480" end="00:29:18.180" style="s2"> because in a sense the game is partially present in all of them, and as long as they are there</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.180" end="00:29:24.940" style="s2"> all are, it works, but when you take a kid out, it doesn&#39;t have the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.940" end="00:29:29.110" style="s2"> ability to describe the behavioral patterns that make up the game, that is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.110" end="00:29:34.410" style="s2"> say they know things they can&#39;t put into words because you may think</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.410" end="00:29:36.290" style="s2"> that the rules of the game come first, and then the game arises, but that is incorrect.</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.290" end="00:29:41.580" style="s2"> The game is created first, and only then do the rules appear, and of course</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.580" end="00:29:46.410" style="s2"> There is a reciprocal relationship between the two because once the rules once</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.410" end="00:29:50.870" style="s2"> formulated somewhat, the game gets more structure, and then the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.870" end="00:29:51.870" style="s2"> rules get more structure, and so on.</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.870" end="00:29:53.860" style="s2"> So the wording changes the rules.</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.860" end="00:29:58.150" style="s2"> What Nietzsche says is that the same is true of societies.</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.150" end="00:30:04.770" style="s2"> He says that insofar as you can see society as a collective game</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.770" end="00:30:11.250" style="s2"> played by millions of people over long periods of time ... it is one</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.250" end="00:30:12.830" style="s2"> game of a higher order, and it came about &quot;bottom up.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.830" end="00:30:21.240" style="s2"> It arose from biological impulses and interpersonal and social interactions,</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.240" end="00:30:25.020" style="s2"> who conditioned and shaped everyone&#39;s behavior and perception.</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.020" end="00:30:30.740" style="s2"> And that happened long before anyone could articulate what those rules were.</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.740" end="00:30:36.660" style="s2"> Remember that when Nietzsche wrote, people did not really know how old the earth was,</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.660" end="00:30:38.750" style="s2"> or how old the universe was.</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.750" end="00:30:42.790" style="s2"> People, even the radical people, thought in terms of hundreds of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.790" end="00:30:47.450" style="s2"> years, while we now know that the universe is fourteen billion years old, and that the</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.450" end="00:30:53.410" style="s2"> Earth is four billion years old, and there has been much life since</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.410" end="00:30:55.560" style="s2"> three point five billion years.</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.560" end="00:31:03.800" style="s2"> So the historical context in which we arose has expanded enormously since the</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.800" end="00:31:08.860" style="s2"> nineteenth century, and what that means is the way our games</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.860" end="00:31:14.930" style="s2"> structure goes back a very long way in time.</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.930" end="00:31:19.740" style="s2"> I thought I already told you about the lobster social hierarchy, right? Even lobsters ...</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.740" end="00:31:23.460" style="s2"> that is four hundred million years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.460" end="00:31:28.320" style="s2"> Cancerians organize in a social space, and they regulate each other, and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.320" end="00:31:36.610" style="s2"> basically means that lobsters have a lobster society, and every lobster has</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.610" end="00:31:39.330" style="s2"> biological dispositions that are strongly determined.</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.330" end="00:31:45.180" style="s2"> They are very ... the lobster is a very determined creature, but the way</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.180" end="00:31:51.870" style="s2"> that biological dispositions manifest is conditioned and shaped by the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.870" end="00:31:57.670" style="s2"> social environment. Cancers started playing games 400 million years ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.670" end="00:32:03.150" style="s2"> games, and we&#39;ve been on a very long evolutionary journey since then, and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.150" end="00:32:10.080" style="s2"> have been playing social games all this time, and that means that the way</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.080" end="00:32:14.540" style="s2"> we interact with each other has evolved, and it has even shaped how our biology</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.540" end="00:32:20.290" style="s2"> manifests itself, because culture is so old, and then we were able to abstract better and better ...</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.290" end="00:32:25.290" style="s2"> that arose probably seven million years ago, modern man arose</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.290" end="00:32:30.830" style="s2"> about a hundred and fifty thousand years ago, we separated about seven</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.830" end="00:32:35.700" style="s2"> million years ago from the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.700" end="00:32:39.190" style="s2"> We can deduce this from the analysis of genetic differences.</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.190" end="00:32:44.320" style="s2"> The brain got bigger quickly after that point, and our culture got bigger and bigger</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.320" end="00:32:49.700" style="s2"> conscious, formulated, complex, larger and increasingly technological.</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.700" end="00:32:55.620" style="s2"> As a result, it became more defined by social norms than in a number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.620" end="00:33:00.570" style="s2"> by deterministic, biological dispositions, but that will be the case for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.570" end="00:33:06.370" style="s2"> been. We have solid evidence for that… we started about two</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.370" end="00:33:11.040" style="s2"> million years ago, and (I apologize if I told you this) as</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.040" end="00:33:14.540" style="s2"> you look at a human, and at a chimpanzee, there are some things out there</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.540" end="00:33:16.630" style="s2"> morphologically very different.</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.630" end="00:33:21.880" style="s2"> The chimpanzee is much smaller, much wider, and much stronger.</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.880" end="00:33:27.470" style="s2"> An average chimpanzee male has about six times the strength of the strongest Olympic athlete.</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.470" end="00:33:29.290" style="s2"> So don&#39;t mess with chimpanzees.</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.290" end="00:33:30.440" style="s2"> They tear you apart.</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.440" end="00:33:32.630" style="s2"> They are very strong and dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.630" end="00:33:36.630" style="s2"> But the chimpanzee has something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.630" end="00:33:41.610" style="s2"> They have a huge digestive system, because they mainly eat leaves,</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.610" end="00:33:45.890" style="s2"> and leaves have few nutrients, making them large amounts</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.890" end="00:33:50.940" style="s2"> leaves need to eat, and leaves are difficult to digest, so they</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.940" end="00:33:51.940" style="s2"> have to chew very much.</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.940" end="00:33:56.220" style="s2"> The average chimpanzee is chewing eight hours a day, and they have that</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.220" end="00:34:01.340" style="s2"> very long digestive system because it takes a long time to supply nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.340" end="00:34:03.410" style="s2"> extract leaves.</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.410" end="00:34:09.590" style="s2"> We solved that when we invented fire, fire makes ours possible</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.590" end="00:34:14.879" style="s2"> digestion to “outsource,” because if you cook most things, vegetables, but especially meat ...</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.879" end="00:34:21.840" style="s2"> When you cook it, it becomes much more “bio-available,” and takes a lot less energy to digest.</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.840" end="00:34:27.100" style="s2"> That way your stomach can get smaller, and your brain bigger, and apparently what is what we did,</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.100" end="00:34:32.399" style="s2"> because here we are, relatively slim, at least compared to chimpanzees.</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.399" end="00:34:34.909" style="s2"> The use of fire originated two million years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.909" end="00:34:40.060" style="s2"> It&#39;s a real cultural revolution, but that cultural revolution is so old that it is us</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.060" end="00:34:45.250" style="s2"> body has completely changed, so this dynamic between biology and culture is already</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.250" end="00:34:50.080" style="s2"> has been going on for a long time, and it defines everything we do.</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.080" end="00:34:51.270" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:34:51.270" end="00:35:00.950" style="s2"> Well, now a complex idea.</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.950" end="00:35:09.620" style="s2"> Think of a pack of wolves.</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.620" end="00:35:13.800" style="s2"> A wolf pack is a fairly complicated social group.</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.800" end="00:35:20.710" style="s2"> It looks a lot like a primitive human group, which is why we are already alive</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.710" end="00:35:23.500" style="s2"> twenty-five thousand years along with dogs.</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.500" end="00:35:26.790" style="s2"> Maybe it was wolves who first followed us to look for leftover food,</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.790" end="00:35:34.830" style="s2"> or (which I think is more likely) someone went hunting (a primitive hunter),</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.830" end="00:35:40.320" style="s2"> killed a wolf woman, found the puppies, and brought one for the children to play.</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.320" end="00:35:42.690" style="s2"> Thus the dog was born. I think it must have been something like this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.690" end="00:35:46.860" style="s2"> because dogs are, in fact, genetically identical to wolves.</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.860" end="00:35:48.360" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:35:48.360" end="00:35:53.160" style="s2"> We get along with dogs, and the reason for that is dogs</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.160" end="00:35:54.470" style="s2"> have a social organization.</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.470" end="00:36:00.780" style="s2"> You can call it a social hierarchy, which is quite similar to the human social organization,</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.780" end="00:36:05.620" style="s2"> and you can see that what it, in part, means to be human is the same as what it means</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.620" end="00:36:10.710" style="s2"> means to be a group animal like a dog, or a group animal like ours</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.710" end="00:36:15.120" style="s2"> domestic animals, horses or cows, for example, which we can tame because they are social.</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.120" end="00:36:20.680" style="s2"> Part of the structure of our social organization is the same as that of one</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.680" end="00:36:24.710" style="s2"> animal social hierarchy, such as the chimpanzee social hierarchy, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.710" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2"> We know that chimpanzees and other primates, monkeys for example, are very aware</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:35.010" style="s2"> are of the hierarchical levels in their social structure, and there are ...</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.010" end="00:36:36.010" style="s2"> I think Vervet monkeys ...</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.010" end="00:36:37.790" style="s2"> This is a funny experiment.</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.790" end="00:36:42.870" style="s2"> Imagine that the top Vervet monkeys are some kind of famous monkeys, and the monkeys</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.870" end="00:36:48.380" style="s2"> at the bottom are the mob, you take pictures of people from the street, at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.380" end="00:36:51.780" style="s2"> hierarchy, and you take pictures of celebrities, and you show those pictures to a</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.780" end="00:36:56.940" style="s2"> human audience, then people will look at the celebrities longer.</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.940" end="00:36:59.290" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:36:59.290" end="00:37:03.790" style="s2"> If you take pictures of the Vervet monkeys at the top and Vervet monkeys at the bottom, and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.790" end="00:37:07.080" style="s2"> if you show those photos to Vervet monkeys, they will look longer at the photos of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.080" end="00:37:11.780" style="s2"> the Vervet monkeys at the top than those at the bottom of the ladder.</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.780" end="00:37:13.400" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:37:13.400" end="00:37:19.320" style="s2"> In a sense they are captivated by the individuals who are higher in the social order</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.320" end="00:37:25.500" style="s2"> stand, and that makes sense, because what you should feel, certainly in a fairly aggressive one</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.500" end="00:37:30.020" style="s2"> social hierarchy, what you should feel as you rise to the top of the social</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.020" end="00:37:34.830" style="s2"> approaching hierarchy, what you should feel for whatever is at the top,</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.830" end="00:37:39.710" style="s2"> should be more and more awe.</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.710" end="00:37:45.820" style="s2"> When people feel awe, they get shivers.</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.820" end="00:37:49.420" style="s2"> The reason it happens is because it&#39;s an atavism.</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.420" end="00:37:54.520" style="s2"> It is a remnant of the time when we were threatened by something awe-inspiring like</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.520" end="00:37:57.900" style="s2"> a snake or a bear or something like that.</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.900" end="00:38:03.050" style="s2"> Your hair, your fur, would be straight up so you would look taller</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.050" end="00:38:05.880" style="s2"> and you can still see that in cats.</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.880" end="00:38:09.850" style="s2"> Two cats normally look at each other this way.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.850" end="00:38:13.610" style="s2"> But when they fight they turn so you can see them from the side</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.610" end="00:38:17.750" style="s2"> making them appear bigger, and making their fur and tail bigger around the other cat</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.750" end="00:38:19.670" style="s2"> show that they are actually much bigger than that other cat imagined.</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.670" end="00:38:23.160" style="s2"> They both do that so that makes it a little pointless,</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.160" end="00:38:29.180" style="s2"> but they&#39;re just cats so don&#39;t make it so hard for them</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.180" end="00:38:32.530" style="s2"> but the point is they put on their fur, and the same thing happens, for example</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.530" end="00:38:35.320" style="s2"> you listen to very good music that touches you deeply and you get the shivers.</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.320" end="00:38:40.290" style="s2"> The hairs on your neck will stand up, which is a sign of awe.</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.290" end="00:38:44.390" style="s2"> The reason why you should feel in awe of something higher in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.390" end="00:38:49.470" style="s2"> social hierarchy is because that &quot;thing&quot; has power, there are several reasons.</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.470" end="00:38:51.050" style="s2"> First, that thing has power.</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.050" end="00:38:54.710" style="s2"> You better be careful because it can put you in your place, and quickly.</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.710" end="00:39:00.110" style="s2"> And in part there is a social hierarchy, so that everyone knows their place and there</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.110" end="00:39:05.670" style="s2"> does not need to be reminded by on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.670" end="00:39:06.670" style="s2"> to be half finished.</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.670" end="00:39:11.150" style="s2"> You may be number nine, and the top is number one, you may be number nine.</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.150" end="00:39:16.350" style="s2"> That&#39;s not so good, but number nine without pain,</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.350" end="00:39:20.360" style="s2"> is much better than number nine and lying on the floor bleeding, what happens to</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.360" end="00:39:26.500" style="s2"> social hierarchies is that they usually organize, in part on the basis of</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.500" end="00:39:29.530" style="s2"> power, but not just based on power. Everyone knows their place, and about</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.530" end="00:39:34.820" style="s2"> everyone stays there, and remains so for several generations, in complex hierarchical primate groups.</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.820" end="00:39:37.830" style="s2"> Status is hereditary.</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.830" end="00:39:42.250" style="s2"> There is no big difference between that and hereditary monarchies in humans.</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.250" end="00:39:43.250" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:39:43.250" end="00:39:46.140" style="s2"> It&#39;s a reflection of ... it&#39;s much more complex in humans because it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.140" end="00:39:50.620" style="s2"> explicit and structured, but it is basically the same.</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.620" end="00:39:54.540" style="s2"> Nietzsche&#39;s point was… imagine…</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.540" end="00:39:58.790" style="s2"> This is another problem.</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.790" end="00:40:07.350" style="s2"> Imagine…</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.350" end="00:40:12.490" style="s2"> There&#39;s a social hierarchy, and it&#39;s pretty stable, and one of the things you want</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.490" end="00:40:16.280" style="s2"> doing is getting to the top of the social hierarchy, and the reason is that… there are all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.280" end="00:40:20.860" style="s2"> reasons, good quality partners, that is the primary reason.</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.860" end="00:40:27.220" style="s2"> That is especially the case with people if you are a man, because men are</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.220" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2"> very different in reproduction, compared to women, that means</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:37.580" style="s2"> many males do not reproduce at all and a few quite a lot, while the average woman reproduces at least a little.</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.580" end="00:40:41.480" style="s2"> That means the competition between men is fiercer, and that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.480" end="00:40:45.730" style="s2"> why social hierarchies tend to focus on male power,</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.730" end="00:40:46.730" style="s2"> because competition is more important to them.</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.730" end="00:40:48.100" style="s2"> The outcome is more crucial.</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.100" end="00:40:54.450" style="s2"> What happens when people compete within the social hierarchy, what they do is</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.450" end="00:41:01.210" style="s2"> trying to discover who is best suited for the top position.</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.210" end="00:41:07.860" style="s2"> You may think it&#39;s a matter of power and average politics</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.860" end="00:41:12.050" style="s2"> leftist person, social constructivists, make you believe that&#39;s the only aspect,</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.050" end="00:41:16.880" style="s2"> that the whole social hierarchy is nothing but a power system, and the people</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.880" end="00:41:22.100" style="s2"> at the top there because they have power, there is power, and by that mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.100" end="00:41:25.810" style="s2"> they have the ability to impose their will on others.</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.810" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2"> That is a silly theory, because it is one-dimensional.</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:35.300" style="s2"> We know that people are multi-dimensional.</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.300" end="00:41:37.540" style="s2"> There is not one motivation that rules.</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.540" end="00:41:41.610" style="s2"> For Freud, it was sex and aggression, and if you want potential candidates</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.610" end="00:41:46.270" style="s2"> there are two, but there are many others.</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.270" end="00:41:50.250" style="s2"> People are playful, and play is a primary biological network.</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.250" end="00:41:51.250" style="s2"> We suffer.</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.250" end="00:41:52.250" style="s2"> We are hungry.</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.250" end="00:41:53.350" style="s2"> We are thirsty.</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.350" end="00:41:54.440" style="s2"> We make friends.</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.440" end="00:42:02.300" style="s2"> There is a lot of biological necessity that drives the shape of our personality, there are</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.300" end="00:42:07.690" style="s2"> biological sub-personalities, and to randomly designate one of them as</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.690" end="00:42:14.730" style="s2"> the foundation of something as complex as social organization is… is a false form of it</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.730" end="00:42:21.090" style="s2"> monotheism. It&#39;s an absurd idea, and it&#39;s kind of an idea that only humans</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.090" end="00:42:25.930" style="s2"> who don&#39;t like to think, because once you have that idea, all that</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.930" end="00:42:27.720" style="s2"> power, you don&#39;t have to think anymore.</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.720" end="00:42:32.192" style="s2"> Someone may ask you: “Why is complex phenomenon X structured in a certain way?</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.192" end="00:42:34.560" style="s2"> Why does the economy have a certain structure? ”</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.560" end="00:42:37.770" style="s2"> &quot;So that the people at the top can keep their power.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.770" end="00:42:43.640" style="s2"> Yeah, well, but that&#39;s maybe only ten percent of the reason.</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.640" end="00:42:45.590" style="s2"> It is nowhere near 100 percent.</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.590" end="00:42:53.320" style="s2"> There are many reasons why hierarchies have the structure they have, and</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.320" end="00:42:57.030" style="s2"> raw physical force is one of them, but it is not stable.</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.030" end="00:43:03.350" style="s2"> Frans de Waal who observed how chimpanzees change their social hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.350" end="00:43:09.420" style="s2"> organized in the zoo in Arnhem in the Netherlands, saw that it was quite typical,</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.420" end="00:43:15.360" style="s2"> or at least possibly that the meanest, ugliest, strongest chimpanzee male was the dominant one.</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.360" end="00:43:19.150" style="s2"> Sometimes it was the chimpanzee who learned to pick up a trash can and take one</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.150" end="00:43:22.380" style="s2"> stick to intimidate his enemies.</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.380" end="00:43:29.360" style="s2"> Some creativity is possible, but what De Waal discovered was that the stable</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.360" end="00:43:34.860" style="s2"> hierarchies were never led by barbarian chimpanzee dictators because of those</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.860" end="00:43:41.310" style="s2"> were eliminated by coalitions of other males, because if you get one</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.310" end="00:43:48.240" style="s2"> anti-social, aggressive and hard guy, okay, you&#39;re tough, but three less,</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.240" end="00:43:54.530" style="s2"> more friendly males who have a bond of friendship, those with chimpanzees</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.530" end="00:43:55.530" style="s2"> can be very intense ...</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.530" end="00:43:59.380" style="s2"> As soon as that little guy turns around, or has a bad day, or gets hurt,</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.380" end="00:44:03.390" style="s2"> the others jump in and tear him up, and that&#39;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.390" end="00:44:08.590" style="s2"> De Waal discovered that the more stable social chimpanzee usually has hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.590" end="00:44:15.210" style="s2"> were led by males who were kind and comrades who were their</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.210" end="00:44:20.260" style="s2"> respected social obligations towards their friends, and those well</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.260" end="00:44:25.850" style="s2"> were for the females in the group and the children, even if they were not his,</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.850" end="00:44:30.980" style="s2"> and the idea is that power is an unstable basis for the maintenance of one</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.980" end="00:44:36.220" style="s2"> long-term social hierarchy, because even with chimpanzees it is in a sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.220" end="00:44:38.410" style="s2"> that you need the consent of those who are governed or else you will have a revolution.</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.410" end="00:44:42.680" style="s2"> You will have a revolution if you put people or animals in a situation where they</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.680" end="00:44:49.110" style="s2"> have nothing to lose, and what that means is that there are limitations with</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.110" end="00:44:54.330" style="s2"> with regard to how you can behave while trying to advance in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.330" end="00:44:58.880" style="s2"> social hierarchy, because if you are too aggressive, and no one else flatters, and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.880" end="00:45:05.440" style="s2"> communicates with the others in the group, they will turn against you and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.440" end="00:45:10.300" style="s2"> finish, so if you want to move up in group, you have to do it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.300" end="00:45:14.510" style="s2"> civilized enough so that you don&#39;t get everyone against you. It means that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.510" end="00:45:19.980" style="s2"> maneuver to move up a power hierarchy, one in particular</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.980" end="00:45:22.990" style="s2"> complex power hierarchy, demands much more from you than just strength.</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.990" end="00:45:25.730" style="s2"> Well we got this idea now</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.730" end="00:45:32.330" style="s2"> that there are principles that determine how someone moves up in a social hierarchy,</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.330" end="00:45:39.750" style="s2"> even in animals, and one of the hallmarks is… one of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.750" end="00:45:48.430" style="s2"> characteristics that necessarily limit that process is that over a longer period of time, the group</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.430" end="00:45:53.390" style="s2"> cannot allow anyone to rise higher</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.390" end="00:45:55.650" style="s2"> the social hierarchy destabilizes, because then it is over.</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.650" end="00:45:56.650" style="s2"> &quot;Game over.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.650" end="00:46:00.080" style="s2"> So at least you have to learn how to get higher without breaking the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.080" end="00:46:05.250" style="s2"> destabilize, because otherwise there is nothing left when you are on top.</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.250" end="00:46:07.040" style="s2"> Animals know that.</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.040" end="00:46:08.150" style="s2"> They know that instinctively.</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.150" end="00:46:12.830" style="s2"> For example, when wolves fight, they grow up and growl at each other, they</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.830" end="00:46:17.150" style="s2"> thrust their shoulders forward, they become more and more aggressive until an attack</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.150" end="00:46:20.610" style="s2"> seems inevitable, and often one withdraws.</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.610" end="00:46:22.590" style="s2"> They don&#39;t fight.</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.590" end="00:46:26.710" style="s2"> No one gets hurt, and that&#39;s the usual situation.</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.710" end="00:46:30.590" style="s2"> It&#39;s as if one of them says, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.590" end="00:46:32.660" style="s2"> And who knows why.</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.660" end="00:46:37.430" style="s2"> I suspect that the wolf with a higher serotonin level wins, because less</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.430" end="00:46:41.160" style="s2"> has negative emotions, the serotonin level rises when you are higher in the social hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.160" end="00:46:46.119" style="s2"> Occasionally they will actually fight, but the fight usually doesn&#39;t last long,</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.119" end="00:46:51.040" style="s2"> then the loser lies on his back, shows his throat to the winner, what a</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.040" end="00:46:56.990" style="s2"> very special behavior is since wolves have throats of their prey</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.990" end="00:46:57.990" style="s2"> tear open, and the higher wolf will go away, think about that.</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.990" end="00:47:01.190" style="s2"> That is an incredibly refined moral.</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.190" end="00:47:06.760" style="s2"> It is reminiscent of the New Testament commandment to love your enemy</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.760" end="00:47:11.170" style="s2"> because that&#39;s exactly what the wolf does, he doesn&#39;t know about it because he can rule it</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.170" end="00:47:17.240" style="s2"> not formulate, but he acts as if even the one who</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.240" end="00:47:21.340" style="s2"> attacked you is valuable if he belongs to your group.</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.340" end="00:47:28.450" style="s2"> You can thus see the ancient biological origin of the idea that all individuals</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.450" end="00:47:31.950" style="s2"> are equal and have value.</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.950" end="00:47:34.540" style="s2"> These things have very deep roots.</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.540" end="00:47:35.640" style="s2"> They are not random.</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.640" end="00:47:39.120" style="s2"> They are not random, and no one invented them</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.120" end="00:47:40.250" style="s2"> and that&#39;s exactly what Nietzsche says here:</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.250" end="00:47:46.170" style="s2"> “To understand how a philosopher&#39;s most complex metaphysical propositions came about, it is always good and wise to ask yourself first:</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.170" end="00:47:53.670" style="s2"> &quot;What morals do they have, or does he have in mind?&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.670" end="00:47:59.470" style="s2"> Accordingly, I don&#39;t believe an instinct for the truth is the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.470" end="00:48:05.109" style="s2"> father of philosophy, but that another instinct, here too, has only use</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.109" end="00:48:07.700" style="s2"> made of knowledge (and erroneous knowledge) as an instrument.</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.700" end="00:48:13.090" style="s2"> But who examines the instincts of man to see to what extent they behave</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.090" end="00:48:19.340" style="s2"> Posed as inspiring spirits (or as demons), will discover them</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.340" end="00:48:23.170" style="s2"> all have once philosophized, and that each of them is only too happy to be themselves</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.170" end="00:48:28.800" style="s2"> as the ultimate purpose of existence,</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.800" end="00:48:29.940" style="s2"> and as the true ruler of the other instincts. ”</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.940" end="00:48:32.180" style="s2"> What is he saying?</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.180" end="00:48:36.850" style="s2"> Nietzsche makes it clear in passages related to this one.</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.850" end="00:48:42.880" style="s2"> He saw man as a collection of subsouls, and the subsouls were</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.880" end="00:48:47.850" style="s2"> anchored in biological soil, and that is the case with all people, which means</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.850" end="00:48:49.869" style="s2"> we are more or less comparable.</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.869" end="00:48:56.680" style="s2"> It certainly made our groups comparable, and each one of these biological</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.680" end="00:49:01.940" style="s2"> subsystems, conceptualized as a subsoul, was something of its own</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.940" end="00:49:05.480" style="s2"> perspective, own rules, own games, competing for leadership.</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.480" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2"> You know that because sometimes you&#39;re reading, and you&#39;re trying to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:14.830" style="s2"> a higher goal, such as closing a course properly, and suddenly a</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.830" end="00:49:19.600" style="s2"> biologically determined subsystem and says, “This would be a good time for</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.600" end="00:49:21.720" style="s2"> a cup of coffee.&quot;</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.720" end="00:49:27.560" style="s2"> And you might be doing everything you can to stop that system from doing it</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.560" end="00:49:33.590" style="s2"> takes over, but often it does, and often regardless of what you think you actually do</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.590" end="00:49:38.600" style="s2"> want to do, and then you are upset because you have postponed things again ...</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.600" end="00:49:43.790" style="s2"> Nietzsche saw the psyche as a place… you could see yourself as one</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.790" end="00:49:51.980" style="s2"> collection of abstract… it&#39;s like your brain is a collection of animals, and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.980" end="00:49:57.680" style="s2"> animals are all dependent on each other, but every animal has to master every now and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.680" end="00:50:04.010" style="s2"> and every animal wants to be in control more often than it should be and the higher cortex</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.010" end="00:50:09.460" style="s2"> systems exist to figure out how all those animals can coordinate with each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.460" end="00:50:15.470" style="s2"> so that they all get what they need, without interfering with each other, for long periods of time,</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.470" end="00:50:18.590" style="s2"> in the presence of other people, in a way that works.</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.590" end="00:50:21.790" style="s2"> It&#39;s very complex.</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.790" end="00:50:25.850" style="s2"> Okay, let&#39;s go back to the hierarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.850" end="00:50:31.950" style="s2"> There is the hierarchy, and over time ... remember that this hierarchy is a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.950" end="00:50:36.690" style="s2"> long period remains, and do not forget that the people who are the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.690" end="00:50:42.720" style="s2"> are more likely to leave children than those who do not</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.720" end="00:50:49.240" style="s2"> achieve, and what that means is that the hierarchy as one of the primary</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.240" end="00:50:55.690" style="s2"> selection processes work in humanity, which causes us to evolve into</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.690" end="00:51:01.160" style="s2"> that which can most successfully climb the social hierarchy, and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.160" end="00:51:09.290" style="s2"> means that we evolve towards what has the greatest chance of being good</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.290" end="00:51:14.350" style="s2"> government, and that is not only cultural. It&#39;s cultural because it is, it&#39;s constant</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.350" end="00:51:19.770" style="s2"> interplay between culture and biology, which is about four hundred million years, or more, old.</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.770" end="00:51:24.619" style="s2"> But it&#39;s more complicated than that, it&#39;s one of the things you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.619" end="00:51:28.250" style="s2"> understand if you really want to understand what Nietzsche meant by the death of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.250" end="00:51:31.160" style="s2"> God, because that is his most famous statement ...</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.160" end="00:51:34.790" style="s2"> “God is dead, and we&#39;ve killed him, and we&#39;ll never have enough water</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.790" end="00:51:35.920" style="s2"> have to flush out the blood. ”</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.920" end="00:51:38.450" style="s2"> He didn&#39;t say that triumphantly.</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.450" end="00:51:40.730" style="s2"> He said it in horror.</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.730" end="00:51:42.650" style="s2"> Well, imagine.</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.650" end="00:51:47.840" style="s2"> Human society is becoming more and more complex, our brains are becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.840" end="00:51:55.730" style="s2"> bigger to keep up with social organizations, and we always can</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.730" end="00:52:02.280" style="s2"> organize more complex communities, and what happened was that tribes</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.280" end="00:52:08.650" style="s2"> hitherto isolated, come together, and have to enter into conflicts and negotiations,</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.650" end="00:52:13.369" style="s2"> and what partly conflicts about is the way you should act, and what the values ​​should be.</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.369" end="00:52:18.800" style="s2"> There is an old mythological idea that the gods in heaven fight to see who the</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.800" end="00:52:19.800" style="s2"> dominant god.</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.800" end="00:52:27.430" style="s2"> You can imagine that all those separate tribes had their own ideals, that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.430" end="00:52:33.590" style="s2"> were beings of their own imaginations, but they were imaginary representations</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.590" end="00:52:39.400" style="s2"> of appropriate behavioral patterns, and they saw them as transcendent and transcendent. If strain A</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.400" end="00:52:46.410" style="s2"> came into contact with tribe B, the gods would collide, and after all</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.410" end="00:52:50.170" style="s2"> killing and destruction would accompany the two tribes</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.170" end="00:52:54.150" style="s2"> going together would take maybe hundreds of years, and the religious system that</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.150" end="00:52:58.770" style="s2"> &quot;Above that,&quot; and the representation of the social hierarchy would also change.</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.770" end="00:53:02.230" style="s2"> So you take tribe A, then tribe B, then tribe C, and then tribe D, and over time</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.230" end="00:53:11.080" style="s2"> collect, separate, articulate and represent all their beliefs, and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.080" end="00:53:17.330" style="s2"> happens is that this tribe has a game, and this tribe has a game, and this tribe has a game,</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.330" end="00:53:21.270" style="s2"> and if you put all those games together</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.270" end="00:53:24.970" style="s2"> they drift, creating a meta game.</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.970" end="00:53:30.950" style="s2"> With luck, the best of all three games will end up in a larger game, and</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.950" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2"> it has to be the best, otherwise it won&#39;t work.</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:41.830" style="s2"> Then it would fall apart &#39;cause if your family unit don&#39;t work it will fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.830" end="00:53:45.000" style="s2"> and it may kill people.</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.000" end="00:53:47.140" style="s2"> It must… it must be repeatable.</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.140" end="00:53:52.640" style="s2"> It must be playable over a longer period of time, without breaking apart due to internal pressure</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.640" end="00:53:54.450" style="s2"> fall, and without being destroyed by external forces.</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.450" end="00:53:57.320" style="s2"> Precise restrictions apply.</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.320" end="00:53:59.980" style="s2"> Let&#39;s say this happens over tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.980" end="00:54:02.760" style="s2"> It happened in the Middle East, we know that.</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.760" end="00:54:07.700" style="s2"> For example, when Mesapotamia came together, it was a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.700" end="00:54:12.940" style="s2"> different tribes, and all the gods of those tribes, and we know that the</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.940" end="00:54:19.000" style="s2"> mesapotamians gathered all those gods into one god called Marduk, and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.000" end="00:54:25.900" style="s2"> the story they tell about the merging of the gods into one god, the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.900" end="00:54:32.450" style="s2"> story is of the gods who come together and vote on which of them is at the top</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.450" end="00:54:38.620" style="s2"> should stand. And we know that the Emperor of Mesapotamia the</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.620" end="00:54:42.710" style="s2"> had a responsibility to embody that supreme deity, and that he would be a good emperor as a result, and there he became every year</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.710" end="00:54:46.890" style="s2"> with the New Years ceremony recalled. He had to confess in which ways he was not a good Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.890" end="00:54:51.880" style="s2"> and he was punished for that, then they reenacted the battle of the gods, and recreated the character of Marduk.</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.880" end="00:54:56.180" style="s2"> Good, so you can understand how that could come about. You can say it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.180" end="00:55:03.720" style="s2"> idea of ​​the resulting ideal was not rational.</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.720" end="00:55:09.770" style="s2"> It was the result of conflict and real-world cooperation over a period of time.</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.770" end="00:55:14.730" style="s2"> The representations of them were… we can see them as narrative representations</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.730" end="00:55:16.970" style="s2"> or, if deep enough, even mythology.</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.970" end="00:55:22.890" style="s2"> We can consider them as the basis of religious assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.890" end="00:55:29.280" style="s2"> emerging, so what happens is that which is at the top of the social hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.280" end="00:55:36.910" style="s2"> as the representation of the good person, ultimately does not differ from the idea of ​​the sovereign god,</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.910" end="00:55:41.130" style="s2"> that arose over thousands and thousands of years of human history.</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.130" end="00:55:46.990" style="s2"> The whole structure has something at the top, and in the imagination that is understood as</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.990" end="00:55:47.990" style="s2"> divine.</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.990" end="00:55:54.380" style="s2"> It is the result of the struggle between representations of the imagination throughout</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.380" end="00:56:00.490" style="s2"> thousands of years, and that&#39;s a reflection of the actual conflicts and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.490" end="00:56:05.849" style="s2"> reshaping societies at the time.</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.849" end="00:56:07.330" style="s2"> There&#39;s something at the top.</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.330" end="00:56:11.980" style="s2"> We can say that in the West, in Western Europe, Christ is the one who is on top,</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.980" end="00:56:18.070" style="s2"> the dying, and reviving hero.</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.070" end="00:56:19.480" style="s2"> We have discussed reasons for this.</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.480" end="00:56:22.220" style="s2"> It is that which can go to the underworld and come back.</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.220" end="00:56:25.119" style="s2"> Well, that&#39;s at the top.</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.119" end="00:56:26.640" style="s2"></p>
<p begin="00:56:26.640" end="00:56:37.150" style="s2"> What happens when that disappears?</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.150" end="00:56:39.190" style="s2"> For that we go to Dostoevsky.</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.190" end="00:56:43.250" style="s2"> This is from &quot;Notes from the Underground.&quot; This is someone who lives underground because that&#39;s where you go when</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.250" end="00:56:44.250" style="s2"> your value systems collapse.</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.250" end="00:56:45.250" style="s2"> “I am a sick man ...</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.250" end="00:56:47.340" style="s2"> i am a bitter man.</p>

<p begin="01:08:33.159" end="01:08:37.699" style="s2"> So I smoked again, and suddenly the following thought came to mind.</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.699" end="01:08:43.499" style="s2"> You have to do something, but with your limited capabilities it will be impossible to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.499" end="01:08:50.410" style="s2"> something even easier than it already is. You must, with the same humanitarian enthusiasm as the others,</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.410" end="01:08:51.869" style="s2"> try to make something more difficult.</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.869" end="01:08:57.400" style="s2"> I was very pleased with that idea, and at the same time I was flattered by the thought that I,</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.400" end="01:09:03.690" style="s2"> like those others, would be loved and esteemed by the whole community.</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.690" end="01:09:08.239" style="s2"> Because when all people work together in every possible way to make everything easier</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.239" end="01:09:14.759" style="s2"> only one possible danger remains. Namely that the convenience becomes so great,</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.759" end="01:09:19.159" style="s2"> that at some point it gets too big. Then only one defect remains, although it does not become yet</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.159" end="01:09:20.219" style="s2"> felt like lack.</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.219" end="01:09:25.469" style="s2"> When people lack difficulties ... out of charity and out</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.469" end="01:09:31.799" style="s2"> despair because of my embarrassing situation, because I saw that I had achieved nothing, and not</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.799" end="01:09:39.109" style="s2"> was able to make something even easier than it already was, and moved by a genuine interest in those who make everything easy,</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.109" end="01:09:52.139" style="s2"> I imagined it would be my job to create difficulties everywhere. ”</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.139" end="01:09:53.690" style="s2"> This is the same idea, worded differently.</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.690" end="01:09:54.690" style="s2"> &quot;A traveler ...&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.690" end="01:09:58.349" style="s2"> This is Nietzsche, and it is one</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.349" end="01:09:59.869" style="s2"> part of the development of an answer to the problems he had raised.</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.869" end="01:10:04.030" style="s2"> “A traveler who had seen many countries, peoples and continents was asked what human characteristics</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.030" end="01:10:09.269" style="s2"> he had found everywhere, and he replied, &quot;People tend to be idle.&quot;</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.269" end="01:10:13.139" style="s2"> Some might think he should have said, &#39;They are</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.139" end="01:10:15.530" style="s2"> all timid. &#39; They hide behind customs and opinions.</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.530" end="01:10:22.489" style="s2"> Within every person knows very well that he is in this world only once, if</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.489" end="01:10:28.719" style="s2"> something unique, and that no coincidence, no matter how strange, will such a unity be a second time</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.719" end="01:10:35.999" style="s2"> making such a peculiar and scattered multitude. He knows, but hides</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.999" end="01:10:41.829" style="s2"> it as a bad conscience. Why?</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.829" end="01:10:46.400" style="s2"> Because of fear of his neighbor, who stands up to use and veils himself with it.</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.400" end="01:10:50.250" style="s2"> But what is it that makes the individual man fear his neighbor?</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.250" end="01:10:53.739" style="s2"> To think and act like a flock, and not be happy with oneself?</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.739" end="01:10:56.739" style="s2"> A sense of shame, perhaps, on rare occasions.</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.739" end="01:11:02.190" style="s2"> In the vast majority, it is the desire for convenience.</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.190" end="01:11:04.650" style="s2"> Immobility, in short, that tendency to laziness of which the traveler spoke.</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.650" end="01:11:10.090" style="s2"> He is right. People are more lazy than timid.</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.090" end="01:11:14.800" style="s2"> What they fear most are the problems with which unconditional honesty and nakedness would burden them.</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.800" end="01:11:20.860" style="s2"> Only artists hate this careless life with borrowed manners and somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.860" end="01:11:26.780" style="s2"> appropriate opinions, and reveal the secret, everyone&#39;s wrong conscience. The idea that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.780" end="01:11:31.429" style="s2"> every person is a unique miracle. They have the guts to show us humans to the fullest</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.429" end="01:11:37.780" style="s2"> the last muscle. He, and he alone. More so, that in this rigorous continuous uniqueness,</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.780" end="01:11:43.030" style="s2"> he is beautiful and admirable,</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.030" end="01:11:44.369" style="s2"> new and incredible like everything nature does, not boring in any way. ”</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.369" end="01:11:51.489" style="s2"> “If a great thinker despises men, it is their loudness that he despises. Because that makes them look like products from a factory,</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.489" end="01:11:56.139" style="s2"> and indifferent, and unworthy of companionship or teaching.</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.139" end="01:12:00.670" style="s2"> The person who does not want to belong to the masses only has to stop feeling comfortable with himself.</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.670" end="01:12:07.769" style="s2"> Let him follow his conscience, crying out to him.</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.769" end="01:12:15.929" style="s2"> Be yourself.</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.929" end="01:12:28.499" style="s2"> What you do, find, and desire at the moment, you are not really. ”</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.499" end="01:12:40.289" style="s2"> That is Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and existentialism.</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.289" end="01:12:43.830" style="s2"> That is the beginning of their thinking.</p>
