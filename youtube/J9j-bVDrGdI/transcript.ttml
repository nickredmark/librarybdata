<p begin="00:00:11.630" end="00:00:16.580" style="s2">I called the course personality and its</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.600" end="00:00:18.320" style="s2">transformations and I think you could</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.580" end="00:00:21.110" style="s2">think about that as a restatement of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.320" end="00:00:22.700" style="s2">idea of being and becoming and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.110" end="00:00:25.640" style="s2">what you are you&#39;re for whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.700" end="00:00:28.790" style="s2">means you&#39;re an entity that both is and</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.640" end="00:00:30.650" style="s2">is transforming and there&#39;s a rule that</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.790" end="00:00:34.700" style="s2">goes along with that by the way which is</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.650" end="00:00:36.860" style="s2">don&#39;t sacrifice who you could be for who</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.700" end="00:00:38.690" style="s2">you are which means if you have to</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.860" end="00:00:40.250" style="s2">choose to transform in a positive</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.690" end="00:00:43.190" style="s2">direction or maintain your current</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.250" end="00:00:44.540" style="s2">position then it&#39;s better to transform</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.190" end="00:00:46.430" style="s2">in a positive direction so you might</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.540" end="00:00:46.760" style="s2">even think of that as the core of your</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.430" end="00:00:48.470" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.760" end="00:00:50.839" style="s2">that&#39;s a piagetian idea it&#39;s a union</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.470" end="00:00:52.909" style="s2">idea as well who are you you&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.839" end="00:00:55.250" style="s2">thing that transforms who you are now</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.909" end="00:00:57.019" style="s2">you&#39;re also who you are but on top of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.250" end="00:00:59.150" style="s2">that you&#39;re the thing that transforms</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.019" end="00:01:01.250" style="s2">who you are and I do think that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.150" end="00:01:04.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s not an arbitrary statement</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.250" end="00:01:07.060" style="s2">you know one of the things that modern</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.460" end="00:01:11.600" style="s2">universities do dreadfully now is</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.060" end="00:01:14.020" style="s2">convince their students that value</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.600" end="00:01:16.460" style="s2">structures are relative and that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.020" end="00:01:18.200" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a big mistake it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.460" end="00:01:20.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of things wrong with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.200" end="00:01:21.469" style="s2">idea and one of the things that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.060" end="00:01:23.689" style="s2">with that ideas that doesn&#39;t include</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.469" end="00:01:25.729" style="s2">what I just mentioned which is that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.689" end="00:01:26.810" style="s2">good moral rule is you are the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.729" end="00:01:29.119" style="s2">that is and you&#39;re the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.810" end="00:01:31.369" style="s2">becomes and you should put the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.119" end="00:01:32.990" style="s2">that becomes at a higher place than the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.369" end="00:01:34.729" style="s2">thing that is that means you also have</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.990" end="00:01:36.969" style="s2">to allow yourself to shake off those</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.729" end="00:01:40.100" style="s2">things about you that you might be</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.969" end="00:01:42.109" style="s2">pathologically attached to habits and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.100" end="00:01:43.640" style="s2">people for that matter ways of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.109" end="00:01:45.500" style="s2">all of those things you have to allow</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.640" end="00:01:47.329" style="s2">yourself to shake those off and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.500" end="00:01:49.100" style="s2">more like a burning that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.329" end="00:01:51.350" style="s2">Phoenix is that&#39;s why the Phoenix is the</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.100" end="00:01:53.149" style="s2">symbol that it is right it&#39;s all in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.350" end="00:01:55.070" style="s2">deteriorate so bursts into flame and</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.149" end="00:01:57.200" style="s2">then it&#39;s reborn it&#39;s like well do you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.070" end="00:01:58.670" style="s2">want to be reborn like that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.200" end="00:02:00.499" style="s2">question the question is do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.670" end="00:02:02.840" style="s2">burst into flame and the answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.499" end="00:02:05.450" style="s2">generally is no but that&#39;s the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.840" end="00:02:08.720" style="s2">answer the right answer is you let all</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.450" end="00:02:10.399" style="s2">that nonsense burn away and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.720" end="00:02:11.930" style="s2">you might say well I don&#39;t know what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.399" end="00:02:14.569" style="s2">should leave behind and the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.930" end="00:02:15.770" style="s2">that is that&#39;s a lie you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.569" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">the things that you should leave behind</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.770" end="00:02:19.460" style="s2">you all you have to do is ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:20.960" style="s2">you&#39;ll come up with a list instantly of</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.460" end="00:02:22.550" style="s2">a hundred stupid things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.960" end="00:02:24.230" style="s2">doing that you know you could stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.550" end="00:02:25.400" style="s2">some of them maybe you don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.230" end="00:02:27.709" style="s2">could stop doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.400" end="00:02:29.030" style="s2">well fine leave those alone for now but</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.709" end="00:02:30.709" style="s2">there&#39;s a bunch of things you perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.030" end="00:02:34.189" style="s2">know well that you could stop doing that</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.709" end="00:02:36.019" style="s2">would improve your life and so do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.189" end="00:02:36.760" style="s2">see what happens that&#39;s a good that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.019" end="00:02:40.220" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.760" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">all right so it&#39;s personality and its</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.220" end="00:02:44.180" style="s2">transformations because partly I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:47.030" style="s2">to talk to you about talk to you about</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.180" end="00:02:50.120" style="s2">what you are as a human being and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.030" end="00:02:51.950" style="s2">as an individual but also what you could</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.120" end="00:02:54.230" style="s2">become and that&#39;s actually a crucial</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.950" end="00:02:55.819" style="s2">question in the domains of clinical</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.230" end="00:02:57.049" style="s2">psychology in particular because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.819" end="00:02:59.420" style="s2">of what you&#39;re doing with people as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.049" end="00:03:01.040" style="s2">clinician is trying to figure out who</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.420" end="00:03:02.959" style="s2">they could become that&#39;s right you come</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.040" end="00:03:05.269" style="s2">you have a problem your life isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:07.639" style="s2">it could be it&#39;s like fine let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.269" end="00:03:09.620" style="s2">what it could be like if we changed it</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.639" end="00:03:11.930" style="s2">we&#39;ll figure out how to change it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.620" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">got to be a negotiated dialogue right</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.930" end="00:03:14.870" style="s2">because like I don&#39;t know what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:16.489" style="s2">you should do with your life I can help</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.870" end="00:03:17.989" style="s2">you figure it out maybe we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.489" end="00:03:19.879" style="s2">about it but you are the person who has</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.989" end="00:03:21.980" style="s2">to decide if the things that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.879" end="00:03:23.480" style="s2">aiming for you know get you out of bed</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.980" end="00:03:25.220" style="s2">in the morning because that&#39;s really the</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.480" end="00:03:26.900" style="s2">that&#39;s at least one of the crucial</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.220" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">issues so you got to specify the goal</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.900" end="00:03:30.139" style="s2">and then you go to specify the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:31.819" style="s2">transformation processes and start</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.139" end="00:03:33.019" style="s2">practicing them and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.819" end="00:03:34.370" style="s2">understand that you&#39;re going to be bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.019" end="00:03:36.769" style="s2">at it but it doesn&#39;t matter because</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.370" end="00:03:40.549" style="s2">Bad&#39;s fine persistence is what you need</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.769" end="00:03:44.440" style="s2">to be if you persist with tiny</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.549" end="00:03:48.260" style="s2">improvements if you persist you win so</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.440" end="00:03:51.260" style="s2">okay so in a broader you know in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.260" end="00:03:52.340" style="s2">broader context you can think about this</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.260" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">as a more fundamental ontological</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.340" end="00:03:57.409" style="s2">question so one the one question is how</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:03:59.979" style="s2">you should act to the world the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.409" end="00:04:02.900" style="s2">question is well what is the world and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.979" end="00:04:04.669" style="s2">that&#39;s a complicated problem this this</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.900" end="00:04:06.019" style="s2">is a scientific answer to that question</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.669" end="00:04:08.299" style="s2">and that is that the world is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.019" end="00:04:11.479" style="s2">collection of objective phenomena and</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.299" end="00:04:13.659" style="s2">that&#39;s a very powerful perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.479" end="00:04:15.979" style="s2">we have a good method for determining</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.659" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">what the world is like as a collection</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.979" end="00:04:20.539" style="s2">of objective phenomena and and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:23.840" style="s2">made us very technologically powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.539" end="00:04:26.539" style="s2">and so more power to us and all that but</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.840" end="00:04:28.580" style="s2">leaves a question unanswered and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.539" end="00:04:30.050" style="s2">question is well the world isn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.580" end="00:04:32.870" style="s2">place of objective phenomena because</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.050" end="00:04:35.539" style="s2">it&#39;s not a panoply of inert matter it</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.870" end="00:04:37.669" style="s2">has living conscious creatures in it and</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.539" end="00:04:38.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a different they&#39;re a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.669" end="00:04:41.860" style="s2">order of be</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.780" end="00:04:45.020" style="s2">and the fundamental issue for conscious</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.860" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">active creatures is not what is the</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.020" end="00:04:48.530" style="s2">world from an objective perspective but</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:51.260" style="s2">how it is it that you should conduct</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.530" end="00:04:52.790" style="s2">yourself in the world and that&#39;s a and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.260" end="00:04:54.410" style="s2">there&#39;s a very there&#39;s a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.790" end="00:04:55.730" style="s2">unbridgeable gap between those two</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.410" end="00:04:59.440" style="s2">domains of inquiry and I think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.730" end="00:05:02.660" style="s2">reason for that is that there&#39;s a the</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.440" end="00:05:04.070" style="s2">scientific method removes value from its</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.660" end="00:05:06.230" style="s2">description so that&#39;s actually what it</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.070" end="00:05:07.970" style="s2">does and so once you&#39;re left with value</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.230" end="00:05:10.910" style="s2">free descriptions it&#39;s very difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.970" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">extract out a value proposition from</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.910" end="00:05:14.270" style="s2">them because you&#39;ve that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:15.650" style="s2">scientific method removes the value</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.270" end="00:05:18.050" style="s2">propositions you&#39;re supposed to be left</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.650" end="00:05:19.940" style="s2">with only that which is objective right</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.050" end="00:05:21.860" style="s2">and value propositions are in the domain</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.940" end="00:05:24.530" style="s2">of the subjective so I think the idea</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.860" end="00:05:27.290" style="s2">that you can derive what you should be</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.530" end="00:05:29.960" style="s2">or do from a collection of facts is</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.290" end="00:05:31.730" style="s2">flawed a because the collecting the</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.960" end="00:05:34.040" style="s2">facts themselves gets rid of the value</p>

<p begin="00:05:34.040" end="00:05:37.070" style="s2">number of facts and so which how are you</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.780" end="00:05:40.490" style="s2">gonna pick which ones should guide you</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.070" end="00:05:43.220" style="s2">you can&#39;t you can&#39;t you you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.490" end="00:05:45.410" style="s2">something else the facts do not tell you</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.220" end="00:05:47.090" style="s2">what to do with the facts you need</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.410" end="00:05:49.700" style="s2">something else to help you figure that</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.090" end="00:05:51.890" style="s2">out well it&#39;s come to me over the years</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.700" end="00:05:54.200" style="s2">that that&#39;s what essentially that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.890" end="00:05:56.360" style="s2">the narrative cognitive framework does</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.200" end="00:05:57.800" style="s2">it&#39;s the framework that we use to</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.360" end="00:05:59.810" style="s2">specify how we should act in the world</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.800" end="00:06:02.420" style="s2">and so you could divide the world into</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.810" end="00:06:04.130" style="s2">the world as it is and the world as</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.420" end="00:06:06.230" style="s2">perhaps it should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.130" end="00:06:07.940" style="s2">that gives you some direction and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.230" end="00:06:10.100" style="s2">need that and we know this technically</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.940" end="00:06:13.040" style="s2">right you need direction the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.100" end="00:06:15.530" style="s2">that is its direction that produces the</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.040" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">primary that produces primary positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.530" end="00:06:20.840" style="s2">emotion and so if you need positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:22.550" style="s2">emotion to move through life which you</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.840" end="00:06:24.440" style="s2">do because you can&#39;t even move without</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.550" end="00:06:26.240" style="s2">positive emotion and also positive</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.440" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">emotion is a good bulwark against terror</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.240" end="00:06:30.410" style="s2">and pain if you need those things then</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.170" style="s2">you need direction you need a goal you</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.410" end="00:06:35.990" style="s2">need a value structure so that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.170" end="00:06:37.490" style="s2">seem particularly disputable to me you</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.990" end="00:06:39.230" style="s2">could still say well what value</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.490" end="00:06:41.210" style="s2">structure it&#39;s like okay fine that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.230" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">good question but I was you know I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.210" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">thought a lot about that too so if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:46.190" style="s2">gonna adopt a value structure there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:47.450" style="s2">couple of rules that go along with it</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.190" end="00:06:49.160" style="s2">and this is why the bloody post</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.450" end="00:06:52.550" style="s2">modernists are wrong as far as I can</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.160" end="00:06:54.530" style="s2">tell is a it can&#39;t just be my</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.550" end="00:06:56.780" style="s2">value structure because I&#39;m stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.530" end="00:06:59.300" style="s2">you and we&#39;re both stuck with all these</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.780" end="00:07:01.700" style="s2">other people and so if I&#39;m going to lay</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.300" end="00:07:03.230" style="s2">out a value structure which is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.700" end="00:07:05.090" style="s2">interpreting the world let&#39;s say and</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.230" end="00:07:06.740" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite number of potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.090" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">ways of interpreting the world it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.740" end="00:07:10.490" style="s2">the out fine no problem except that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:12.710" style="s2">have to interpret the world in a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.490" end="00:07:14.330" style="s2">that I can use while I&#39;m dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.710" end="00:07:15.980" style="s2">you and the world two of us are dealing</p>

<p begin="00:07:15.980" end="00:07:19.760" style="s2">are dealing with everyone else and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.900" end="00:07:21.620" style="s2">that that&#39;s the piagetian game</p>

<p begin="00:07:25.310" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">that&#39;s a brilliant brilliant brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.980" end="00:07:33.200" style="s2">observation and I told you that Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:34.970" style="s2">was trying to heal the rift between</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.200" end="00:07:36.680" style="s2">science and religion and that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.970" end="00:07:38.840" style="s2">the things that he did that he thought</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.680" end="00:07:40.250" style="s2">helped do that his question is well</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.840" end="00:07:42.830" style="s2">where the moral judgments come from</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.250" end="00:07:44.630" style="s2">well they partly come emerge as a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.830" end="00:07:46.520" style="s2">consequence of consensus and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.630" end="00:07:48.260" style="s2">bounded domain if we&#39;re gonna if we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:07:53.510" end="00:07:58.940" style="s2">a long time then we have to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.240" end="00:08:01.040" style="s2">how to play an iterative game that</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.940" end="00:08:02.990" style="s2">doesn&#39;t spiral downward hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.040" end="00:08:05.180" style="s2">might even improve that we both don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:08:05.180" end="00:08:09.500" style="s2">gonna work right you&#39;ll walk away and</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.490" end="00:08:11.450" style="s2">play another game or the game will will</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.500" end="00:08:14.270" style="s2">disintegrate catastrophically so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.450" end="00:08:15.920" style="s2">massive social constraint on what</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.270" end="00:08:18.620" style="s2">constitutes an appropriate frame of</p>

<p begin="00:08:18.620" end="00:08:22.880" style="s2">argument and then there&#39;s another issue</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.510" end="00:08:24.620" style="s2">that&#39;s equally relevant and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.880" end="00:08:26.660" style="s2">associated with the idea of objective</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.390" end="00:08:36.140" style="s2">I decide to occupy the same place for</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.070" end="00:08:38.210" style="s2">some substantial amount of time and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.140" end="00:08:41.060" style="s2">figured out how to solve the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.210" end="00:08:42.500" style="s2">being together but you and I still have</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.060" end="00:08:44.360" style="s2">to figure out how to solve the problem</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.500" end="00:08:46.970" style="s2">of being together in a manner that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.360" end="00:08:49.070" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make the world object too much</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.970" end="00:08:51.110" style="s2">and it isn&#39;t just other people although</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.070" end="00:08:52.670" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge part of the world you want</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.110" end="00:08:54.440" style="s2">them to know what object you may even</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.670" end="00:08:56.390" style="s2">want them to support you that would even</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.440" end="00:08:59.090" style="s2">be better but you also have to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.390" end="00:09:02.960" style="s2">the you know the the the tendency of</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.090" end="00:09:04.030" style="s2">matter to object because so your mode of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.960" end="00:09:06.410" style="s2">being in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.030" end="00:09:08.420" style="s2">your interpretive framework</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.410" end="00:09:11.779" style="s2">as a description of how you should act</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.420" end="00:09:14.029" style="s2">is actually the laying out of a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.779" end="00:09:15.889" style="s2">that will produce the ends that it</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.029" end="00:09:18.139" style="s2">predicts which are the things that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.889" end="00:09:19.670" style="s2">want so this is the pragmatist</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.139" end="00:09:21.740" style="s2">perspective this was worked out by</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.670" end="00:09:24.199" style="s2">William James and his people back in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.740" end="00:09:26.689" style="s2">late 1800s in New England the only</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.199" end="00:09:28.970" style="s2">genuine brand of American philosophy and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.689" end="00:09:31.250" style="s2">what the pragmatist said is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.970" end="00:09:33.290" style="s2">decide if something&#39;s true the answer is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.250" end="00:09:35.480" style="s2">how the hell can you you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.290" end="00:09:37.310" style="s2">anything well that&#39;s true but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.480" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">helpful because there you&#39;re stuck with</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.310" end="00:09:40.610" style="s2">the problem of how to be in the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:42.259" style="s2">well so what you do is you lay out a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.610" end="00:09:44.569" style="s2">mode of interpretation that has an</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.259" end="00:09:46.639" style="s2">endpoint and then you run the mode of</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.569" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">interpretation embodied right because</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.639" end="00:09:52.300" style="s2">you act it out and if it doesn&#39;t produce</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:55.339" style="s2">the outcome then it&#39;s not let&#39;s say true</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.300" end="00:09:57.199" style="s2">the claims within it aren&#39;t they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.339" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">true by the definition of the game</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.199" end="00:09:59.389" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:01.279" style="s2">so you might say well you&#39;re a kid on a</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.389" end="00:10:03.050" style="s2">playground you want to play a game one</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.279" end="00:10:05.870" style="s2">of the implicit demands is that the game</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.050" end="00:10:07.459" style="s2">is fun if it&#39;s not fun it&#39;s not worth</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.870" end="00:10:09.079" style="s2">playing so you play it for a while and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.459" end="00:10:10.730" style="s2">then you see well was that fun if the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.079" end="00:10:12.889" style="s2">answer is yes then you keep playing the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.730" end="00:10:14.660" style="s2">game you say well that game is it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.889" end="00:10:16.519" style="s2">enough it&#39;s accurate enough it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.660" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">enough and so you lay out</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.519" end="00:10:20.329" style="s2">interpretations in the world and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:21.860" style="s2">subject to massive constraints other</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.329" end="00:10:23.569" style="s2">people have to go along with them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.860" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">cooperate with you because if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.569" end="00:10:28.610" style="s2">then look the hell out like it&#39;s a major</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:30.199" style="s2">serious non-trivial constraint and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.610" end="00:10:32.569" style="s2">the other thing is well social proof</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.199" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t good enough it also has to work in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.569" end="00:10:36.980" style="s2">the world outside of the social world</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:38.569" style="s2">you know so if you have an illness and</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.980" end="00:10:41.360" style="s2">you have some hypothesis about how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.569" end="00:10:43.149" style="s2">construe it you might say well is my</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.360" end="00:10:45.500" style="s2">understanding of the illness correct</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.149" end="00:10:47.449" style="s2">well it implies that I take these</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.500" end="00:10:49.430" style="s2">actions well how do you know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.449" end="00:10:51.439" style="s2">correct while you take the actions and</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.430" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">if the illness gets worse then by the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.439" end="00:10:54.829" style="s2">definitions that are implicit in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:58.009" style="s2">framework of reference that you&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.829" end="00:11:00.050" style="s2">you&#39;ve made an error and so there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.009" end="00:11:01.490" style="s2">relativism in that you could still say</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.050" end="00:11:03.740" style="s2">well there&#39;s a lot of potential</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.490" end="00:11:06.019" style="s2">solutions to any potential set of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.740" end="00:11:07.730" style="s2">problems it&#39;s like yeah yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.019" end="00:11:10.670" style="s2">lots of different ways to play chess on</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.730" end="00:11:12.500" style="s2">the on a single board right but that</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.670" end="00:11:14.269" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that any old solution is as</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.500" end="00:11:15.740" style="s2">good as any other solution it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.269" end="00:11:18.319" style="s2">mean that at all</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.740" end="00:11:19.970" style="s2">so okay so then we&#39;re looking at things</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.319" end="00:11:22.039" style="s2">two ways we&#39;re trying to figure out well</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.970" end="00:11:23.569" style="s2">how does the world present itself and</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.039" end="00:11:27.889" style="s2">then how is it that you should act in it</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.569" end="00:11:29.989" style="s2">and so well there&#39;s other there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.889" end="00:11:31.549" style="s2">constraints on the mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.989" end="00:11:34.099" style="s2">interpretation that you place in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.549" end="00:11:36.019" style="s2">world so we could say well you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.099" end="00:11:37.519" style="s2">constrained in your interpretations by</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.019" end="00:11:39.199" style="s2">the constraints that other people place</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.519" end="00:11:40.849" style="s2">on you but there&#39;s internal constraints</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.199" end="00:11:42.409" style="s2">as well we talked about those mostly</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.849" end="00:11:44.749" style="s2">from a biological perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.409" end="00:11:48.139" style="s2">you could also regard yourself in some</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.749" end="00:11:49.879" style="s2">sense as a loose internal society that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.139" end="00:11:51.529" style="s2">sort of a psychoanalytic dictum right</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.879" end="00:11:53.089" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re a collection of sub</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.529" end="00:11:55.249" style="s2">personalities or you could say your</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.089" end="00:11:58.789" style="s2">collection of subroutines I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.249" end="00:12:00.919" style="s2">how you how you formulate it but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.789" end="00:12:02.779" style="s2">a unity but you&#39;re a you&#39;re a universe</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.919" end="00:12:05.419" style="s2">unity that brings together a plurality</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.779" end="00:12:07.549" style="s2">of sub components and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.419" end="00:12:09.139" style="s2">constraints on how it is that you lay</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.549" end="00:12:11.139" style="s2">out your interpretation of the world is</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.139" end="00:12:13.819" style="s2">that you have to satisfy those internal</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.139" end="00:12:15.769" style="s2">subsystems right so you&#39;re the ego but</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.819" end="00:12:17.659" style="s2">it&#39;s more like you&#39;re the captain of a</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.769" end="00:12:19.819" style="s2">ship full of people who were rowing you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.659" end="00:12:22.249" style="s2">got to keep the people rowing you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.819" end="00:12:23.899" style="s2">you know a tyrant you&#39;re not an impotent</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.249" end="00:12:25.309" style="s2">tyrant of your own destiny you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.899" end="00:12:27.169" style="s2">constrained by the nature of your own</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.309" end="00:12:28.609" style="s2">being and so you have to provide</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.169" end="00:12:29.929" style="s2">yourself with food and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.609" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">provide yourself with shelter and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.929" end="00:12:33.589" style="s2">have to provide yourself with water and</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:35.389" style="s2">all of these things and and those are</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.589" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">demands that are laid on you by the</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.389" end="00:12:39.859" style="s2">nature of your internal processes and of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:42.019" style="s2">course how they lay themselves out as</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.859" end="00:12:44.149" style="s2">demands and what the appropriate</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.019" end="00:12:47.059" style="s2">solutions to that is to those problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.149" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">are is is debatable infinitely but you</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.059" end="00:12:50.689" style="s2">can see that constraints stack up you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:53.209" style="s2">have to satisfy your internal</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.689" end="00:12:54.979" style="s2">constraints so they have to be brought</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.209" end="00:12:56.899" style="s2">into a unity that seems to happen at</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.979" end="00:12:58.909" style="s2">least in part but between the ages of</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.899" end="00:13:01.039" style="s2">two and something like between the ages</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.909" end="00:13:02.359" style="s2">of birth and four years old maybe even</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.039" end="00:13:03.769" style="s2">two years old you bring yourself</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.359" end="00:13:05.599" style="s2">together into something that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.769" end="00:13:07.879" style="s2">functioning as a unity then you have to</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.599" end="00:13:09.829" style="s2">turn that unity into a unity that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.879" end="00:13:12.439" style="s2">function in the social world in with</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.829" end="00:13:14.179" style="s2">increasing breath and that unity in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.439" end="00:13:15.739" style="s2">social world has to be a unity that can</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.179" end="00:13:17.329" style="s2">function inside the natural world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.739" end="00:13:20.359" style="s2">something like that so it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.329" end="00:13:23.179" style="s2">stacking up these games into a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.359" end="00:13:25.249" style="s2">of increasing complexity and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.179" end="00:13:26.809" style="s2">questions that emerges from that is well</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.249" end="00:13:28.009" style="s2">what should be at the top of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.809" end="00:13:29.659" style="s2">hierarchy if it&#39;s a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.009" end="00:13:31.459" style="s2">structure it has to be a hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.659" end="00:13:33.620" style="s2">structure because some things have to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.459" end="00:13:35.540" style="s2">worth doing more than others or</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.620" end="00:13:36.470" style="s2">you can&#39;t act which is another thing I</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.540" end="00:13:39.529" style="s2">really don&#39;t like about the</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.470" end="00:13:41.300" style="s2">postmodernist ethos because it claims</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.529" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">that value structures are there to</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.300" end="00:13:46.130" style="s2">eliminate to exclude and oppress and</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:47.660" style="s2">never once notices that well yeah fair</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.130" end="00:13:49.850" style="s2">enough but value structures are also</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.660" end="00:13:51.770" style="s2">there so that you know which way to walk</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.850" end="00:13:53.300" style="s2">because you can&#39;t figure out which way</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.770" end="00:13:54.710" style="s2">to walk without saying that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.300" end="00:13:55.310" style="s2">direction is preferable to that</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.710" end="00:13:57.140" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.310" end="00:13:59.930" style="s2">so you stuck with the damn things and</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.140" end="00:14:02.000" style="s2">and they do exclude obviously category</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.930" end="00:14:03.230" style="s2">structures exclude the question is if</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.000" end="00:14:06.140" style="s2">you&#39;re going to have a value structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.230" end="00:14:07.880" style="s2">how is it that it should be constituted</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.140" end="00:14:10.370" style="s2">well ready to describe some of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.880" end="00:14:12.260" style="s2">constraints like if your value structure</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.370" end="00:14:14.510" style="s2">is perfectly functioning except that you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.260" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">don&#39;t get enough to eat that turns out</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.510" end="00:14:18.680" style="s2">actually to be a fatal problem right and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:20.839" style="s2">it might be you can run into all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.680" end="00:14:22.880" style="s2">of fatal problems you&#39;re too lonesome</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.839" end="00:14:24.830" style="s2">while means you&#39;re let&#39;s say that your</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.880" end="00:14:26.300" style="s2">value structures too narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.830" end="00:14:28.010" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of reasons to be lonesome</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.300" end="00:14:29.720" style="s2">but that might be one of them or you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.010" end="00:14:31.850" style="s2">too timid or something like that like</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.720" end="00:14:34.820" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna be informed by your own</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.850" end="00:14:36.260" style="s2">internal biological mechanisms when the</p>

<p begin="00:14:36.260" end="00:14:42.350" style="s2">in the world is insufficient to keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.779" end="00:14:44.089" style="s2">itself propagating across time and some</p>

<p begin="00:14:49.310" end="00:14:55.100" style="s2">and absolutely unreasonable to say and</p>

<p begin="00:14:56.630" end="00:15:01.310" style="s2">in the world and see and see how many</p>

<p begin="00:15:28.850" end="00:15:34.010" style="s2">say because Piaget a great fan of Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.150" end="00:15:35.810" style="s2">but Piaget tended to think that the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.010" end="00:15:37.910" style="s2">child came into the world with nothing</p>

<p begin="00:15:40.220" end="00:15:44.030" style="s2">off those reflexes and I think that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.320" end="00:15:45.829" style="s2">underestimates the degree to which the</p>

<p begin="00:15:47.150" end="00:15:50.870" style="s2">and I mean he just thought of those</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.400" end="00:15:52.400" style="s2">things that&#39;s so self-evident that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.870" end="00:15:54.230" style="s2">don&#39;t need to talk about them but that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:15:54.230" end="00:15:57.710" style="s2">about them we know for example that if</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.180" end="00:16:00.200" style="s2">you provide children with food and</p>

<p begin="00:16:23.540" end="00:16:26.690" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.190" end="00:16:28.220" style="s2">things like play and touch because you</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.690" end="00:16:29.960" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t think of those as fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.220" end="00:16:32.060" style="s2">necessities right but it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.960" end="00:16:35.089" style="s2">they are if you deprive a child badly</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.060" end="00:16:36.950" style="s2">enough of play and touch in the first</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.089" end="00:16:38.900" style="s2">three years of their life even if they</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.950" end="00:16:40.339" style="s2">survive what comes out at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.900" end="00:16:42.380" style="s2">that is often something that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.339" end="00:16:44.779" style="s2">barely recognizable as a functional</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.380" end="00:16:46.910" style="s2">human being and cannot be repaired after</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.779" end="00:16:48.890" style="s2">that point and that that experiment was</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.910" end="00:16:52.070" style="s2">done with Romanian orphans back in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.890" end="00:16:53.950" style="s2">back in the 90s so it was it was an ugly</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.070" end="00:16:56.240" style="s2">situation to say the least</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.950" end="00:16:57.980" style="s2">okay so now you take these underlying</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.240" end="00:16:59.690" style="s2">biological systems and maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.980" end="00:17:01.490" style="s2">aggregate themselves into something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.690" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">vaguely looks like your temperament your</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.490" end="00:17:05.089" style="s2">your five temperamental dimensions so</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.189" style="s2">maybe if you&#39;re an extrovert you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.089" end="00:17:08.900" style="s2">dominated by the dopaminergic system</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.189" end="00:17:11.300" style="s2">just like you are is if you&#39;re high an</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.900" end="00:17:13.640" style="s2">openness and if you&#39;re if you&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.300" end="00:17:15.020" style="s2">know if you&#39;re high in eroticism it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.640" end="00:17:18.020" style="s2">mostly that you&#39;re dominated by anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.020" end="00:17:19.939" style="s2">systems and systems that mean mediate</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.020" end="00:17:21.770" style="s2">emotional pain and if you&#39;re agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.939" end="00:17:23.929" style="s2">you&#39;re dominated by the function of the</p>

<p begin="00:17:23.929" end="00:17:29.270" style="s2">affiliation systems but so you could say</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.689" end="00:17:31.960" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got these loose you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.270" end="00:17:33.920" style="s2">multitude of fundamental biological</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.960" end="00:17:36.350" style="s2">predispositions that manifest themselves</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.920" end="00:17:38.450" style="s2">as implicit stories something like that</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.350" end="00:17:40.400" style="s2">and they organize themselves into the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.450" end="00:17:43.820" style="s2">primary temperaments and the primary</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.400" end="00:17:45.740" style="s2">temperaments are biasing factors that</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.820" end="00:17:47.030" style="s2">determine in part the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.740" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">interpretive structure that you&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.030" end="00:17:50.059" style="s2">to lay out in the world it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:51.530" style="s2">entirely determined by your temperament</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.059" end="00:17:53.570" style="s2">we know that personality is only</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.530" end="00:17:55.970" style="s2">predicting you know something like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.570" end="00:17:57.980" style="s2">say 10% of the variance in most complex</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.970" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">social outcomes and and the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.980" end="00:18:00.980" style="s2">elements are well temperamental as you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:02.299" style="s2">might be used</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.980" end="00:18:04.549" style="s2">have to get along with other people in</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.299" end="00:18:06.290" style="s2">the world so you you know you come in</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.549" end="00:18:08.240" style="s2">with these internal biases but they have</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.290" end="00:18:10.120" style="s2">still have to be modified extensively by</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.240" end="00:18:13.820" style="s2">your social and your natural surround</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.120" end="00:18:16.429" style="s2">okay and then you develop your routines</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.820" end="00:18:18.020" style="s2">from the bottom up as Piaget pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.429" end="00:18:20.150" style="s2">and sometimes from the top down because</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.020" end="00:18:22.400" style="s2">now and then you can think yourself into</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.150" end="00:18:24.260" style="s2">a radical transformation but mostly what</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.400" end="00:18:26.150" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is building the micro units</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.260" end="00:18:28.309" style="s2">of your interpretive schemas and your</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.150" end="00:18:30.470" style="s2">behaviors and aggregating them into</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.309" end="00:18:32.929" style="s2">higher order structures that you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.470" end="00:18:34.940" style="s2">then tag with higher order abstractions</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.929" end="00:18:37.040" style="s2">and we talked about that you can&#39;t tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.940" end="00:18:39.020" style="s2">a three-year-old to clean up his room</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.040" end="00:18:40.970" style="s2">and the reason for that is he those are</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:43.940" style="s2">empty boxes as far as the kid&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.970" end="00:18:46.460" style="s2">concerned clean he&#39;s doing he might he</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.940" end="00:18:48.620" style="s2">might have room he might have that clean</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.460" end="00:18:51.260" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t have he might have pick up</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.620" end="00:18:53.030" style="s2">the teddy bear and put it in that space</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.260" end="00:18:55.640" style="s2">right so that&#39;s one of these little</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.030" end="00:18:57.440" style="s2">micro routines and maybe you say you put</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.640" end="00:18:59.179" style="s2">20 of those micro routines together and</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.440" end="00:19:00.830" style="s2">now you can say clean up your room and</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.179" end="00:19:02.570" style="s2">basically what you&#39;re saying is here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.830" end="00:19:04.850" style="s2">implement the 10 micro routines that</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.570" end="00:19:07.309" style="s2">you&#39;ve learned and so a well-functioning</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:09.080" style="s2">personality has all the micro routines</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.309" end="00:19:10.610" style="s2">in place that&#39;s actually something that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.080" end="00:19:12.380" style="s2">you help people with if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.610" end="00:19:14.419" style="s2">behavioral therapist because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.380" end="00:19:16.130" style="s2">things you assume if you&#39;re a behavioral</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.419" end="00:19:18.410" style="s2">therapist is that sometimes the reason</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.130" end="00:19:20.720" style="s2">people aren&#39;t doing things is because</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.410" end="00:19:22.220" style="s2">they don&#39;t know how you know sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.720" end="00:19:24.140" style="s2">maybe the person is depressed but</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.220" end="00:19:26.059" style="s2">potentially high-functioning they got</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.140" end="00:19:28.190" style="s2">all the damn micro routines they&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.059" end="00:19:29.809" style="s2">socialized they&#39;re just dormant you got</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.190" end="00:19:31.610" style="s2">to get them awake again and implementing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.809" end="00:19:33.080" style="s2">them but sometimes you get someone in</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.610" end="00:19:35.900" style="s2">your in your practice say who&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.080" end="00:19:37.370" style="s2">been neglected like you cannot believe</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.900" end="00:19:38.840" style="s2">right the parents never paid any</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.370" end="00:19:40.309" style="s2">attention to them or maybe just punished</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.840" end="00:19:42.830" style="s2">them every time they did something good</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.309" end="00:19:44.120" style="s2">that&#39;s really fun and then you know they</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.830" end="00:19:48.830" style="s2">didn&#39;t make friends and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.120" end="00:19:50.480" style="s2">really really big and and and poorly</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.830" end="00:19:52.220" style="s2">articulated and so then what you do is</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.480" end="00:19:53.770" style="s2">you work at the bottom of the micro</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.220" end="00:19:56.150" style="s2">routines and get them to practice</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.770" end="00:19:57.890" style="s2">building up all these little attributes</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:19:59.419" style="s2">that they didn&#39;t build up and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.890" end="00:20:01.429" style="s2">one of the things you can think about in</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.419" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">terms of character development is so now</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.429" end="00:20:04.490" style="s2">maybe understand something about your</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.900" end="00:20:06.110" style="s2">own personality you might say well what</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.490" end="00:20:08.809" style="s2">could you do to improve your personality</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.110" end="00:20:10.760" style="s2">and the answer is develop some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.809" end="00:20:12.919" style="s2">micro routines on the other side of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.760" end="00:20:14.659" style="s2">personality distribution so if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.919" end="00:20:16.099" style="s2">disagreeable as hell maybe</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.659" end="00:20:18.470" style="s2">start learning how to do nice things for</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.099" end="00:20:20.029" style="s2">people and that actually works by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.470" end="00:20:21.590" style="s2">way so if you take disagreeable people</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.029" end="00:20:22.849" style="s2">who are depressed and you get them doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.590" end="00:20:24.710" style="s2">nice things for other people their</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.849" end="00:20:27.169" style="s2">depression tends to lift but then by the</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.710" end="00:20:29.450" style="s2">same token if you&#39;re agreeable then you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.169" end="00:20:31.249" style="s2">should practice doing some things for</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.450" end="00:20:33.320" style="s2">yourself and being more tough minded in</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.249" end="00:20:35.330" style="s2">your negotiations and so you can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.320" end="00:20:37.279" style="s2">place yourself on the on the personality</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.330" end="00:20:39.590" style="s2">trait distribution you know you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.279" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">extrovert it&#39;s like okay man learn to</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.590" end="00:20:43.759" style="s2">spend some time with yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:45.470" style="s2">you&#39;re low in openness well try reading</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.759" end="00:20:47.239" style="s2">a book that&#39;s outside of your you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.470" end="00:20:50.450" style="s2">your your sphere of interest now and</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.239" end="00:20:51.700" style="s2">then if you&#39;re conscientious well you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.450" end="00:20:54.080" style="s2">should probably learn how to relax</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.700" end="00:20:55.729" style="s2">occasionally and and so forth so you can</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.080" end="00:20:57.109" style="s2">I think partly what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.729" end="00:20:59.389" style="s2">you&#39;re developing your personality is</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.109" end="00:21:01.369" style="s2">not moving the mean much the average</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.389" end="00:21:03.619" style="s2">where you know where you&#39;re located but</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.369" end="00:21:05.119" style="s2">you&#39;re extending the standard deviation</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.619" end="00:21:07.549" style="s2">so that you&#39;re a bigger bag of tricks</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.119" end="00:21:09.440" style="s2">than you were before and I think you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.549" end="00:21:12.379" style="s2">practice that consciously it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.440" end="00:21:14.989" style="s2">you&#39;re hyper orderly it&#39;s well get a dog</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.379" end="00:21:16.340" style="s2">you know dogs they&#39;re messy horrible</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.989" end="00:21:17.659" style="s2">things you know it&#39;s just what you need</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.340" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">if you&#39;re hyper orderly because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.659" end="00:21:21.859" style="s2">gonna leave hair everywhere and force</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:23.599" style="s2">you live with it and so okay so and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.859" end="00:21:26.210" style="s2">this is sort of you right this is your</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.599" end="00:21:28.519" style="s2">personality it&#39;s this connect collection</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.210" end="00:21:30.229" style="s2">of root subroutines that you&#39;ve turned</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.519" end="00:21:31.639" style="s2">into a hierarchy and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.229" end="00:21:33.379" style="s2">something at the top of it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.639" end="00:21:34.700" style="s2">that&#39;s a big question like what the hell</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.379" end="00:21:36.289" style="s2">should be at the top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.700" end="00:21:38.659" style="s2">because that&#39;s the ultimate question of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.289" end="00:21:40.460" style="s2">unity and then the clinicians would say</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.659" end="00:21:42.440" style="s2">well it&#39;s the self-actualized person or</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.009" end="00:21:54.109" style="s2">is does such thing exists that I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.379" end="00:21:56.299" style="s2">say well do you admire people because</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.109" end="00:21:58.789" style="s2">that&#39;s your answer right do you despise</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.299" end="00:22:00.229" style="s2">people well you like some people and you</p>

<p begin="00:22:00.229" end="00:22:04.009" style="s2">people you don&#39;t respect others well</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.119" end="00:22:06.139" style="s2">you&#39;re acting out the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.009" end="00:22:07.609" style="s2">there&#39;s at least an implicit ideal you</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.139" end="00:22:09.289" style="s2">do the same thing when you go to movies</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.609" end="00:22:11.029" style="s2">you know you you know who the hero is</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.289" end="00:22:12.739" style="s2">you know who the bad guy is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.029" end="00:22:14.359" style="s2">acting out the proposition that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.739" end="00:22:16.190" style="s2">some sort of value hierarchy and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.359" end="00:22:17.749" style="s2">some sort of manifestation of it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.190" end="00:22:19.879" style="s2">coherent across time</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.749" end="00:22:21.470" style="s2">so you appear to believe that and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.879" end="00:22:24.019" style="s2">know you are driven at least to some</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.470" end="00:22:27.229" style="s2">degree by your own inner ideals and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.019" end="00:22:29.090" style="s2">you tend to answer the question is that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.229" end="00:22:31.279" style="s2">real with an affirmed</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.090" end="00:22:32.539" style="s2">and if you don&#39;t there&#39;s catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.279" end="00:22:33.710" style="s2">consequences Nietzsche and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.539" end="00:22:35.330" style="s2">existentialist we&#39;re very good at</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.710" end="00:22:37.720" style="s2">detailing that&#39;s like you let your value</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.330" end="00:22:40.850" style="s2">hierarchy disintegrate well then what</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.720" end="00:22:43.159" style="s2">well part of it is nihilistic chaos whoo</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.850" end="00:22:45.350" style="s2">that&#39;s not so much fun and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.159" end="00:22:47.360" style="s2">the alignment of nihilistic chaos with</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.350" end="00:22:49.669" style="s2">the intrinsic desire that someone will</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.360" end="00:22:51.169" style="s2">come along and tell you what to do right</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.669" end="00:22:53.090" style="s2">so what happens is if you let this</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.169" end="00:22:53.659" style="s2">devolve you end up with nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.090" end="00:22:55.639" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.659" end="00:22:57.830" style="s2">not with nihilistic chaos or the demand</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.639" end="00:22:59.809" style="s2">for for the tyrant to come forward and</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.830" end="00:23:04.090" style="s2">we&#39;ve had that happen lots of times and</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.809" end="00:23:04.090" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to have gone that well so</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.869" end="00:23:09.619" style="s2">all right well so what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.490" end="00:23:11.529" style="s2">you lay out these little routines in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.619" end="00:23:14.480" style="s2">world at different levels of analysis</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.529" end="00:23:16.970" style="s2">well this is how your emotions function</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.480" end="00:23:19.999" style="s2">broadly speaking you know you&#39;re aiming</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.970" end="00:23:21.590" style="s2">at something and this is an</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.999" end="00:23:23.119" style="s2">oversimplification which is why I want</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.590" end="00:23:27.850" style="s2">to show you this right when I show you</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.119" end="00:23:30.070" style="s2">this assume that it&#39;s made out of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.850" end="00:23:33.409" style="s2">right it&#39;s just a schematic</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.070" end="00:23:35.119" style="s2">oversimplification because even if let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.409" end="00:23:37.129" style="s2">say that I&#39;m trying to do something as</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.119" end="00:23:40.700" style="s2">simple as walking towards the door I</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.129" end="00:23:42.529" style="s2">mean that the action of walking towards</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.700" end="00:23:45.110" style="s2">the door is predicated on the existence</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.529" end="00:23:48.679" style="s2">of all the subroutines that enable me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.110" end="00:23:51.230" style="s2">propel my body across time and space and</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.679" end="00:23:53.450" style="s2">like there&#39;s that took a lot of internal</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.230" end="00:23:55.580" style="s2">organization to get that right it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.450" end="00:23:58.399" style="s2">traumatized now and so you can treat it</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.580" end="00:24:00.289" style="s2">like it&#39;s invisible but implicit in any</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.399" end="00:24:02.539" style="s2">one of these structures is this entire</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.289" end="00:24:04.549" style="s2">structure and you actually see this in</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.539" end="00:24:07.190" style="s2">therapy very frequently too so I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.549" end="00:24:08.990" style="s2">talking to a client the other day it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.190" end="00:24:11.330" style="s2">so interesting this person said</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.990" end="00:24:13.940" style="s2">something he had been talking to his</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.330" end="00:24:16.220" style="s2">mother and he&#39;s he just made a casual</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.940" end="00:24:17.990" style="s2">comment he said he was talking to his</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.220" end="00:24:19.429" style="s2">mother who was in a state of grief for</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.990" end="00:24:21.740" style="s2">for good reasons that were it</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.429" end="00:24:27.499" style="s2">independent of this particular person</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.740" end="00:24:28.850" style="s2">who said and I hate her and I thought oh</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.499" end="00:24:31.159" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting like where did that</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.850" end="00:24:31.549" style="s2">come from and so I made a comment on</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.159" end="00:24:33.710" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.549" end="00:24:35.509" style="s2">that&#39;s a Freudian slip right because</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.710" end="00:24:38.409" style="s2">there was the conversation was flowing</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.509" end="00:24:40.909" style="s2">and then this little emotion tagged</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.409" end="00:24:42.590" style="s2">utterance came forward and whenever an</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.909" end="00:24:45.230" style="s2">emotion tagged utterance</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.590" end="00:24:47.240" style="s2">of that sort comes forward you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.230" end="00:24:50.740" style="s2">associated with a whole rat&#39;s nest of</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.240" end="00:24:53.600" style="s2">underlying pain and anxiety and and and</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.740" end="00:24:55.129" style="s2">on what would you call it disappointment</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.600" end="00:24:57.259" style="s2">and frustration that hasn&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.129" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">properly rectified so it&#39;s like a marker</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.259" end="00:25:00.350" style="s2">and yet you know this when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:02.360" style="s2">talking to people they say something and</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.350" end="00:25:04.370" style="s2">you think oh you know what Wow</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.360" end="00:25:06.049" style="s2">too much information that&#39;s one way of</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.370" end="00:25:07.700" style="s2">thinking about it&#39;s like just what are</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.049" end="00:25:09.289" style="s2">you up to and and then if you have any</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.700" end="00:25:10.850" style="s2">sense you just forget that that even</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.289" end="00:25:12.769" style="s2">happened and you continue but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.850" end="00:25:15.200" style="s2">that&#39;s like the snout of a dragon</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.769" end="00:25:17.659" style="s2">peeking out from a cave and you might</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.200" end="00:25:19.730" style="s2">say well it&#39;s just a snout man but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.659" end="00:25:21.919" style="s2">not because dragons snouts tend to be</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.730" end="00:25:23.240" style="s2">attached to the whole damn dragon and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.919" end="00:25:24.889" style="s2">this is also something to know about</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.240" end="00:25:26.419" style="s2">relationships because when you&#39;re in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.889" end="00:25:28.639" style="s2">relationship with someone they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.419" end="00:25:30.679" style="s2">that now and then they&#39;ll you know utter</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.639" end="00:25:32.480" style="s2">something and you think huh-huh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.679" end="00:25:34.070" style="s2">like there&#39;s a bump in the road well</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.480" end="00:25:36.679" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna look underneath that at our</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.070" end="00:25:38.480" style="s2">peril but if you do go down there and</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.679" end="00:25:41.119" style="s2">you look at it then then the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:44.710" style="s2">comes you can start to disentangle the</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.119" end="00:25:46.490" style="s2">the web of of memories and and</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.710" end="00:25:48.019" style="s2">experiences that are all tangled</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.490" end="00:25:50.240" style="s2">together as a consequence of their</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.019" end="00:25:51.559" style="s2">emotional identity because I could say</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.240" end="00:25:53.600" style="s2">well everything that makes you anxious</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.559" end="00:25:55.700" style="s2">or everything that makes you upset is</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.600" end="00:25:58.190" style="s2">the same as every other thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.700" end="00:26:00.230" style="s2">ever made you upset and so and then</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.190" end="00:26:01.789" style="s2">there&#39;s an even different subset instead</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.230" end="00:26:03.080" style="s2">of that which is all those things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.789" end="00:26:05.029" style="s2">have made you upset that you&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.080" end="00:26:06.950" style="s2">dealt with they&#39;re all laying down there</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.029" end="00:26:09.019" style="s2">at the bottom of your nasty little soul</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.950" end="00:26:11.690" style="s2">waiting to pop themselves up in some in</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.019" end="00:26:13.940" style="s2">some random utterance right and so then</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.690" end="00:26:15.320" style="s2">you go in there at your peril because if</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.940" end="00:26:16.940" style="s2">you&#39;re the person who pokes around in</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.320" end="00:26:19.009" style="s2">that then you&#39;re gonna get blasted with</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.940" end="00:26:21.769" style="s2">all of that stuff it&#39;s gonna come out</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.009" end="00:26:24.080" style="s2">like almost uncontrollably then then you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.769" end="00:26:25.700" style="s2">can sort it out and so what you find is</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.080" end="00:26:27.470" style="s2">if you ask a person a question like that</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.700" end="00:26:30.110" style="s2">and then you let them free associate</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.470" end="00:26:32.629" style="s2">which is just talk about it they&#39;ll do a</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.110" end="00:26:34.249" style="s2">wandering around like that maze that I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.629" end="00:26:36.710" style="s2">told you about they&#39;ll do a wandering</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.249" end="00:26:38.840" style="s2">around of that entire territory and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.710" end="00:26:40.850" style="s2">sometimes just having them worn during</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.840" end="00:26:42.409" style="s2">it can help them straighten it out but</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.850" end="00:26:44.659" style="s2">you might find out that something</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.409" end="00:26:46.610" style="s2">happened to them 15 years ago that left</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.659" end="00:26:49.220" style="s2">them with a terrible sense of guilt or</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.610" end="00:26:50.659" style="s2">dismay or frustration and then when when</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.220" end="00:26:52.220" style="s2">they interact with their parents in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.659" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">certain way the parent knows exactly how</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.220" end="00:26:55.909" style="s2">to tap that and then that all comes up</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:56.330" style="s2">and that&#39;s what produces that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.909" end="00:26:58.460" style="s2">little</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.330" end="00:27:00.800" style="s2">that little utterance and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.460" end="00:27:02.570" style="s2">material of the world manifesting itself</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.800" end="00:27:04.880" style="s2">that&#39;s what matters</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.570" end="00:27:07.310" style="s2">manifesting itself and it almost always</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.880" end="00:27:09.560" style="s2">manifests itself as an object something</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.310" end="00:27:12.140" style="s2">that objects we&#39;re having a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.560" end="00:27:14.600" style="s2">it&#39;s going quite well no problem there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.140" end="00:27:16.430" style="s2">a bump in it there&#39;s an emotional</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.600" end="00:27:18.140" style="s2">disjunct right now we&#39;re no longer in</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.430" end="00:27:20.300" style="s2">the same place at the same time we&#39;re no</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.140" end="00:27:21.890" style="s2">longer playing the same game so that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.300" end="00:27:23.150" style="s2">might say okay well let&#39;s open that up</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.890" end="00:27:25.730" style="s2">and see what&#39;s behind it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.150" end="00:27:28.160" style="s2">well the question is what&#39;s behind the</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.730" end="00:27:30.380" style="s2">game you&#39;re playing and the answer to</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.160" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">that is all the world that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.380" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">ignoring always so when so when imagine</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:42.050" style="s2">that think about it this way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:45.350" style="s2">trying to do well in a class and you get</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.050" end="00:27:46.670" style="s2">a bad grade okay so you&#39;re in this</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.350" end="00:27:48.290" style="s2">little frame you want to get a good</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.670" end="00:27:51.290" style="s2">grade that isn&#39;t happening you got a bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.290" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">grade okay what is it that&#39;s manifesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.290" end="00:27:55.850" style="s2">itself as the bad grade well you could</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:27:57.590" style="s2">say well it&#39;s a c-minus on a piece of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.850" end="00:28:00.500" style="s2">paper it&#39;s like well that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.590" end="00:28:02.660" style="s2">really no that&#39;s the objective</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.500" end="00:28:04.970" style="s2">manifestation you got a piece of paper</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.660" end="00:28:06.230" style="s2">with a c-minus the value-free</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.970" end="00:28:08.000" style="s2">proposition is that you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.230" end="00:28:09.860" style="s2">delivered a piece of paper with a curve</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.000" end="00:28:12.830" style="s2">on it a little you know negative sign</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.860" end="00:28:15.680" style="s2">well you think well that&#39;s what that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.830" end="00:28:17.300" style="s2">well you know it&#39;s as dopey as thinking</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.680" end="00:28:19.070" style="s2">well here you got your failing grade you</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.300" end="00:28:21.500" style="s2">go into the lab and you like weigh it on</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.070" end="00:28:23.030" style="s2">a scale then you burn it and see what it</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.500" end="00:28:25.310" style="s2">was made of it&#39;s like well why did I get</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.030" end="00:28:29.750" style="s2">so upset about that it&#39;s just paper it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.310" end="00:28:31.130" style="s2">like no that&#39;s not just paper it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.750" end="00:28:33.590" style="s2">entity that exists in a web of</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.130" end="00:28:35.150" style="s2">connections the fact that it&#39;s signified</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.590" end="00:28:38.150" style="s2">by paper is almost completely irrelevant</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.150" end="00:28:40.490" style="s2">what is it the answer is you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.150" end="00:28:43.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s why when you pick it up you</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.490" end="00:28:45.020" style="s2">get this paralyzed sinking feeling</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.040" end="00:28:47.420" style="s2">because your limbic system is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.020" end="00:28:49.460" style="s2">smarter than your perceptual systems and</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.420" end="00:28:51.110" style="s2">your perceptual systems say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.460" end="00:28:56.330" style="s2">a piece of paper and your limbic system</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.110" end="00:28:58.280" style="s2">says nah for sure dragan right right and</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.330" end="00:28:59.930" style="s2">so then you&#39;re sweating and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.280" end="00:29:02.630" style="s2">you put it away and you go play video</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.930" end="00:29:04.790" style="s2">games because you know better the</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.630" end="00:29:07.520" style="s2">hypothetical dragon than the real dragon</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.790" end="00:29:10.070" style="s2">and so instead you pull out the piece of</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.520" end="00:29:13.550" style="s2">paper maybe and you think okay why</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.070" end="00:29:15.160" style="s2">I did I get this c-minus well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.550" end="00:29:18.560" style="s2">hell of a question isn&#39;t it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.160" end="00:29:20.270" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re stupid well that could be</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.560" end="00:29:21.800" style="s2">or at least stupid compared to who you</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.270" end="00:29:23.450" style="s2">think you are like that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.800" end="00:29:24.740" style="s2">real horror that&#39;s lurking there writes</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.450" end="00:29:27.530" style="s2">like all I thought it was kind of smart</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.740" end="00:29:28.310" style="s2">that&#39;s a that&#39;s a proposition of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.530" end="00:29:30.590" style="s2">highest order</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.310" end="00:29:32.330" style="s2">I thought I was kind of smart it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.590" end="00:29:35.540" style="s2">yeah well what about this c-minus it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.330" end="00:29:38.270" style="s2">like well that goddamn professor right</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.540" end="00:29:40.160" style="s2">that&#39;s the first thing it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.270" end="00:29:42.020" style="s2">been attacked by a predator that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.160" end="00:29:43.970" style="s2">first response right so it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.020" end="00:29:45.800" style="s2">nonsensical message it&#39;s just delivered</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.970" end="00:29:49.640" style="s2">by someone evil and predatory well</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.800" end="00:29:51.350" style="s2">that&#39;s you know possible but I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.640" end="00:29:54.860" style="s2">go there I wouldn&#39;t go there first</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.350" end="00:29:56.510" style="s2">necessarily so but then well then say</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.860" end="00:29:59.720" style="s2">you don&#39;t go there okay well so what is</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.510" end="00:30:01.760" style="s2">this exactly do you not know what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.720" end="00:30:03.590" style="s2">thought you know are you not who you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.760" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">think you are do you not work hard</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.590" end="00:30:08.570" style="s2">enough or your values not organized</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:11.510" style="s2">properly do you misuse your time are you</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.570" end="00:30:12.860" style="s2">in the wrong field is the way you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.510" end="00:30:14.570" style="s2">construing your life completely</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.860" end="00:30:16.100" style="s2">inappropriate are you acting out what</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.570" end="00:30:17.390" style="s2">your parents wanted you to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.100" end="00:30:19.820" style="s2">you&#39;re pissed off about it so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.390" end="00:30:22.280" style="s2">only running at 40% despite them despite</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.820" end="00:30:23.990" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;re paying $25,000 a</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.280" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">year for your education because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.990" end="00:30:29.210" style="s2">fun game yeah I&#39;ll go do what you want</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:30.980" style="s2">me to do but I&#39;ll fail but not</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.210" end="00:30:32.510" style="s2">completely because then that would</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.980" end="00:30:35.270" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t cost you very much I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.510" end="00:30:37.010" style="s2">fail a little bit so that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.270" end="00:30:38.660" style="s2">spend all that money forcing me to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.010" end="00:30:40.520" style="s2">what I don&#39;t want to do but you&#39;ll never</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.660" end="00:30:42.320" style="s2">get to escape from it and then every</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.520" end="00:30:43.580" style="s2">time we interact I&#39;ll stab you in</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.320" end="00:30:45.680" style="s2">various ways that you don&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.580" end="00:30:47.420" style="s2">understand just to show you how</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.680" end="00:30:49.010" style="s2">irritated I am that I happen to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.420" end="00:30:51.230" style="s2">acting out the destiny that you&#39;ve put</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.010" end="00:30:53.240" style="s2">forward for me so maybe that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.230" end="00:30:55.760" style="s2">the dragon&#39; right and then that pulls in</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.240" end="00:30:58.700" style="s2">the whole parent thing and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.760" end="00:31:00.470" style="s2">these are bottomless pits often when you</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.700" end="00:31:02.330" style="s2">when you&#39;re in the world there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.470" end="00:31:05.690" style="s2">something objects to you something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.330" end="00:31:08.120" style="s2">matters objects to you then in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.690" end="00:31:09.860" style="s2">entire unrealized world is in that thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.120" end="00:31:11.870" style="s2">that objects it&#39;s all tangled up inside</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.860" end="00:31:14.120" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s the great dragon of</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.870" end="00:31:16.370" style="s2">chaos it&#39;s everything that&#39;s outside of</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.120" end="00:31:18.440" style="s2">your conceptual structure and what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.370" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">that it&#39;s everything that lurks outside</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.440" end="00:31:23.330" style="s2">of your of your walled city and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:24.050" style="s2">manifested itself like the snake in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.330" end="00:31:26.090" style="s2">garden and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.050" end="00:31:27.470" style="s2">easiest thing to do is say I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.090" end="00:31:30.770" style="s2">having anything to do with that but the</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.470" end="00:31:32.540" style="s2">problem with that is well you get your</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.770" end="00:31:33.800" style="s2">c- and you don&#39;t do anything about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.540" end="00:31:35.630" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re a little bitter and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.800" end="00:31:36.980" style="s2">resentful in your study habits get a</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.630" end="00:31:39.770" style="s2">little worse so the next time you get</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.980" end="00:31:41.270" style="s2">like a d-plus and then you collect a</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.770" end="00:31:44.030" style="s2">bunch of FS and then you stop going to</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.270" end="00:31:45.740" style="s2">school then you stop showering right</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.030" end="00:31:48.020" style="s2">then you end up jumping off the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.740" end="00:31:49.580" style="s2">and so that&#39;s a that&#39;s that&#39;s how the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.020" end="00:31:51.620" style="s2">dragon eats you when you don&#39;t pay</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.580" end="00:31:53.930" style="s2">attention to it and so it&#39;s no bloody</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.620" end="00:31:56.150" style="s2">wonder that people avoid you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.930" end="00:31:59.300" style="s2">really no wonder that they avoid because</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.150" end="00:32:02.350" style="s2">error messages contain within them the</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.300" end="00:32:04.370" style="s2">implicit world now the upside of that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.350" end="00:32:06.800" style="s2">while they contain within them the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.370" end="00:32:08.660" style="s2">implicit world and the world isn&#39;t all</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.800" end="00:32:10.100" style="s2">negative and so maybe you get your</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.660" end="00:32:11.630" style="s2">c-minus and that&#39;s actually the best</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.100" end="00:32:14.780" style="s2">gift you ever got because somebody</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.630" end="00:32:17.570" style="s2">finally took you and went whack you no</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.780" end="00:32:18.950" style="s2">clue in and so you take that apart and</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.570" end="00:32:21.080" style="s2">you think oh I don&#39;t know how to write I</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.950" end="00:32:23.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to think I&#39;ve never read</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.080" end="00:32:25.040" style="s2">anything in my life my study habits are</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.210" end="00:32:27.650" style="s2">abysmal you know like maybe I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.040" end="00:32:29.390" style="s2">at 2% efficiency which which is probably</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.650" end="00:32:31.220" style="s2">I would suspect that you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.390" end="00:32:33.950" style="s2">you aren&#39;t doing that but I bet you that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.220" end="00:32:35.480" style="s2">I bet there&#39;s thirty thirty to fifty</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.950" end="00:32:37.550" style="s2">percent of the people in the room are</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.480" end="00:32:39.560" style="s2">working at two percent efficiency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.550" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">like you got it that&#39;s so to find that</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.560" end="00:32:43.400" style="s2">out is so optimistic I mean if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">barely hanging in there but you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.400" end="00:32:47.150" style="s2">working out 2% you might imagine what</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:50.660" style="s2">you could have as a life if you work it</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.150" end="00:32:52.700" style="s2">out like 50 percent so so that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.660" end="00:32:54.740" style="s2">c-minus can be the best gift you ever</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.700" end="00:32:56.330" style="s2">had and that&#39;s the gold that the Dragon</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.740" end="00:33:00.440" style="s2">hoards right that&#39;s exactly what that</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.330" end="00:33:02.330" style="s2">means and so well so you&#39;re moving from</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.440" end="00:33:03.680" style="s2">point A to point B in your little</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.330" end="00:33:05.810" style="s2">circumscribed world you&#39;ve made</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.680" end="00:33:07.820" style="s2">everything invisible and as long as that</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.810" end="00:33:09.410" style="s2">works then your Theory&#39;s good enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.820" end="00:33:11.570" style="s2">it&#39;s accurate enough it&#39;s true enough</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.410" end="00:33:14.420" style="s2">you&#39;re in your little paradise but if</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.570" end="00:33:16.130" style="s2">something comes up and objects well</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.420" end="00:33:18.500" style="s2">that&#39;s where your character is tested</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.130" end="00:33:20.300" style="s2">fundamentally that&#39;s the character test</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.500" end="00:33:23.180" style="s2">it&#39;s like what do you do with messages</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.300" end="00:33:26.810" style="s2">of error and that&#39;s a tricky issue okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.180" end="00:33:29.420" style="s2">so here&#39;s a solution to that here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.810" end="00:33:31.160" style="s2">not to do I am a bad person</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.420" end="00:33:32.510" style="s2">I got to see mice I&#39;m a bad person I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.160" end="00:33:34.460" style="s2">out I&#39;ll just go jump off the bridge</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.510" end="00:33:36.460" style="s2">it&#39;s like no that&#39;s not good because</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.460" end="00:33:37.910" style="s2">what that means is that every time every</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.460" end="00:33:38.780" style="s2">time you try to</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.910" end="00:33:40.370" style="s2">learn something you&#39;re going to make a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.780" end="00:33:41.990" style="s2">mistake because what do you know so</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.370" end="00:33:43.310" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna make mistakes and if the</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.990" end="00:33:45.380" style="s2">rule is every time you make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.310" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna go jump off the bridge then</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.380" end="00:33:50.600" style="s2">that&#39;s not a useful problem-solving</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:52.940" style="s2">strategy and so when you make a mistake</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.600" end="00:33:55.730" style="s2">you don&#39;t get to beat yourself to death</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.940" end="00:33:57.140" style="s2">with a club it&#39;s a bad strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.730" end="00:33:59.150" style="s2">you&#39;ll have your internal tyrant in</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.140" end="00:34:01.490" style="s2">there who&#39;s perfectly happy about doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.150" end="00:34:03.800" style="s2">that that&#39;s the you know overactive</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.490" end="00:34:06.380" style="s2">super-ego that Freud talked about maybe</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.800" end="00:34:08.750" style="s2">it came to you via a parent who was too</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.380" end="00:34:10.220" style="s2">authoritarian or a grandparent or or</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.750" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s just you because you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.220" end="00:34:13.970" style="s2">disagreeable and neurotic and so you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:17.150" style="s2">take you&#39;re at hyper conscientious</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.970" end="00:34:20.660" style="s2">you&#39;ll take yourself apart well starting</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.150" end="00:34:23.780" style="s2">the and so you&#39;ve got a problem</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.660" end="00:34:25.400" style="s2">something has objected to you then the</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.780" end="00:34:26.810" style="s2">question is well what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.400" end="00:34:28.760" style="s2">well maybe you&#39;re not looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.810" end="00:34:30.800" style="s2">world right maybe your goals are wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.760" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re not acting properly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.800" end="00:34:37.910" style="s2">okay so the question that arises when an</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">obstacle emerges is which part of this</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.910" end="00:34:45.020" style="s2">structure needs attention and the first</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.330" end="00:34:46.580" style="s2">answer can&#39;t be all of it which is why</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.020" end="00:34:48.740" style="s2">when you&#39;re arguing with someone in an</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.580" end="00:34:51.169" style="s2">intimate relationship and you&#39;re angry</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.740" end="00:34:51.830" style="s2">at them and you want to win which is a</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.169" end="00:34:56.150" style="s2">big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.830" end="00:34:57.440" style="s2">you want to win you say well your this</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.150" end="00:34:58.820" style="s2">is what you&#39;re like here&#39;s another ten</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.440" end="00:35:01.220" style="s2">examples of how you&#39;ve done that in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.820" end="00:35:02.990" style="s2">past and I can enumerate more of them if</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.220" end="00:35:04.820" style="s2">you&#39;d like and so it doesn&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.990" end="00:35:06.230" style="s2">actually what you like and I&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.820" end="00:35:07.370" style="s2">fixing you and didn&#39;t work and so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.230" end="00:35:08.630" style="s2">looks like you&#39;re gonna be like that up</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.370" end="00:35:10.670" style="s2">into the future and you&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.630" end="00:35:12.290" style="s2">saying to them well you&#39;re a bad person</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.670" end="00:35:15.290" style="s2">and the only thing they can do is either</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.290" end="00:35:17.210" style="s2">collapse or punch you and punching you</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.290" end="00:35:18.260" style="s2">is actually better than collapsing look</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.210" end="00:35:20.030" style="s2">you don&#39;t you know what I mean it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.260" end="00:35:21.740" style="s2">a counterproductive way of arguing they</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.030" end="00:35:24.290" style="s2">you don&#39;t leave the person any out and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.740" end="00:35:26.390" style="s2">so maybe while they&#39;re civilized so it</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.290" end="00:35:28.010" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get physical well maybe that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.390" end="00:35:29.840" style="s2">good and maybe it isn&#39;t but then they</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.010" end="00:35:31.550" style="s2">end up either really not happy with you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.840" end="00:35:33.710" style="s2">in a way that they will manifest the</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.550" end="00:35:34.970" style="s2">first possible opportunity they get or</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.710" end="00:35:37.190" style="s2">they have to go off in the corner and</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.970" end="00:35:39.320" style="s2">cringe it&#39;s like great you won it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.190" end="00:35:40.910" style="s2">now your partners either hates you or is</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.320" end="00:35:43.430" style="s2">cringing it&#39;s great that&#39;s a real good</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.910" end="00:35:44.930" style="s2">victory man cry rack up about a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.430" end="00:35:46.850" style="s2">victories like that and you&#39;ll be in</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.930" end="00:35:48.800" style="s2">divorce court and spending two hundred</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.850" end="00:35:50.510" style="s2">and fifty thousand dollars while being</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.800" end="00:35:53.750" style="s2">miserable about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.510" end="00:35:55.310" style="s2">yeah so anyway so something objects to</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.750" end="00:35:58.070" style="s2">you and you think okay well I need to I</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.310" end="00:35:59.690" style="s2">need to take myself apart right because</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.070" end="00:36:01.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a piece that&#39;s broken somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.690" end="00:36:03.170" style="s2">and then you might think well let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.040" end="00:36:05.270" style="s2">let&#39;s assume it&#39;s a little piece to</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.170" end="00:36:09.140" style="s2">begin with that&#39;s the right mechanism</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.270" end="00:36:11.810" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay you got a c-minus that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.140" end="00:36:13.730" style="s2">doesn&#39;t prove that you&#39;re stupid and now</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.810" end="00:36:15.290" style="s2">it implies that you might be stupid but</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.730" end="00:36:16.310" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t right really it does and</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.290" end="00:36:17.660" style="s2">that&#39;s why you don&#39;t want to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.310" end="00:36:19.670" style="s2">maybe it implies that you&#39;re lazier</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.660" end="00:36:21.440" style="s2">implies that you&#39;re ignorant or like it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.670" end="00:36:23.840" style="s2">implies all sorts of terrible might</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.440" end="00:36:25.130" style="s2">imply that you&#39;re a bad person even but</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.840" end="00:36:27.050" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to leap to that and</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.130" end="00:36:30.170" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of the proclamation of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.050" end="00:36:32.990" style="s2">innocence before guilt assume that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.170" end="00:36:35.570" style="s2">you&#39;re the least amount of reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.990" end="00:36:37.100" style="s2">and ignorant possible and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.570" end="00:36:39.350" style="s2">look at the micro routines it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.100" end="00:36:42.230" style="s2">well I got a c-minus in this course</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.350" end="00:36:44.990" style="s2">maybe I should study for that course</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.230" end="00:36:47.210" style="s2">fifteen minutes more a day for the next</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.990" end="00:36:48.920" style="s2">three months and then you ask yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.210" end="00:36:50.930" style="s2">do you think you could do that no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.920" end="00:36:52.580" style="s2">too useless okay how about fifteen</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.930" end="00:36:53.869" style="s2">minutes every second day you think you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.580" end="00:36:55.940" style="s2">could do that you put it in your</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.869" end="00:36:58.430" style="s2">schedule like 15 minutes every second</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.940" end="00:36:59.690" style="s2">day in the morning and that&#39;s while you</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.430" end="00:37:02.510" style="s2">think well what&#39;s wrong with me</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.690" end="00:37:04.550" style="s2">well I&#39;m not very good at managing my</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.510" end="00:37:06.050" style="s2">study schedule that&#39;s not quite down</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.550" end="00:37:08.060" style="s2">here at the behavioral level but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.050" end="00:37:09.619" style="s2">pretty close because what you you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.060" end="00:37:11.600" style="s2">take an action you can open up your</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.619" end="00:37:13.430" style="s2">schedule and you can say all mark 50</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.600" end="00:37:14.900" style="s2">minutes of it aside then you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.430" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">practice doing that it&#39;s pretty low</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.900" end="00:37:18.770" style="s2">level in the hierarchy means while</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:21.170" style="s2">you&#39;re still not a horrible person you</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.770" end="00:37:23.090" style="s2">just gotta polish up your work ethic and</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.170" end="00:37:25.820" style="s2">so what you want to do is you want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.090" end="00:37:27.260" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the old adage you</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.820" end="00:37:28.790" style="s2">got to stand up for yourself but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.260" end="00:37:31.040" style="s2">don&#39;t want to make unnecessary enemies</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.790" end="00:37:32.720" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good thing to know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.040" end="00:37:34.760" style="s2">like shut the hell up most of the time</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.720" end="00:37:36.200" style="s2">but now and then you don&#39;t shut up</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.760" end="00:37:37.670" style="s2">because it&#39;s time to say something you</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.200" end="00:37:39.590" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t want to make unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.670" end="00:37:41.240" style="s2">enemies though well you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.590" end="00:37:42.760" style="s2">take yourself apart any more than is</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.240" end="00:37:44.990" style="s2">absolutely necessary</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.760" end="00:37:46.550" style="s2">start little and you do that with people</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.990" end="00:37:48.170" style="s2">around you too like if you have a child</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.550" end="00:37:50.090" style="s2">you know and the child does something</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.170" end="00:37:52.520" style="s2">that isn&#39;t right</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.090" end="00:37:54.560" style="s2">then you think okay minimal necessary</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.520" end="00:37:56.240" style="s2">intervention what can we do to decrease</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.560" end="00:37:59.540" style="s2">the probability that that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.240" end="00:38:00.560" style="s2">occur in the future so and that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.540" end="00:38:02.300" style="s2">that&#39;s a good thing to know with</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.560" end="00:38:03.980" style="s2">children it&#39;s also a good thing to know</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.300" end="00:38:06.140" style="s2">with your partners you have an argument</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.980" end="00:38:08.480" style="s2">some it&#39;s like okay what the hell do you</p>

<p begin="00:38:08.480" end="00:38:12.410" style="s2">request from them that would satisfy you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.310" end="00:38:14.540" style="s2">and the evil part of your soul is going</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.410" end="00:38:17.119" style="s2">to be I want them cringing in a corner</p>

<p begin="00:38:17.119" end="00:38:20.990" style="s2">under control man see if you can figure</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.160" end="00:38:22.580" style="s2">out what that person could offer you</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.990" end="00:38:24.920" style="s2">that would be minimal that you would</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.580" end="00:38:26.990" style="s2">accept and then tell them that it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.920" end="00:38:28.280" style="s2">here&#39;s the words I would like you to say</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.990" end="00:38:29.810" style="s2">in the apology I would like you to</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.280" end="00:38:31.490" style="s2">formulate assuming that you think you</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.810" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">did something wrong we have to argue</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.490" end="00:38:35.090" style="s2">about that because maybe you didn&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:37.250" style="s2">if you did I want to specify it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.090" end="00:38:39.770" style="s2">precisely and narrowly and I want to</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.250" end="00:38:41.510" style="s2">give you an escape route and you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.770" end="00:38:43.130" style="s2">you might only be able to do it badly</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.510" end="00:38:44.900" style="s2">because you&#39;re still mad so you</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.130" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">apologize half-heartedly it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.900" end="00:38:50.470" style="s2">get a pat on the head for that good next</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.090" end="00:38:53.780" style="s2">time it&#39;ll be 51% not half-heartedly</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.470" end="00:38:55.460" style="s2">right so it&#39;s careful training its</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.780" end="00:38:57.619" style="s2">careful training of yourself and other</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.460" end="00:39:00.010" style="s2">people with with the goal in mind but</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.619" end="00:39:02.540" style="s2">also with the least amount of harshness</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.010" end="00:39:04.520" style="s2">possible and then the other thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.540" end="00:39:05.660" style="s2">as well and this is also true for you</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.520" end="00:39:08.060" style="s2">and this is something I learned from</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.660" end="00:39:09.740" style="s2">studying the behavior is like watch the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.060" end="00:39:11.660" style="s2">people around you like a hawk whenever</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.740" end="00:39:15.109" style="s2">they do something that you think is good</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.660" end="00:39:17.119" style="s2">you tell them that&#39;s wisdom man you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.109" end="00:39:19.430" style="s2">get so far with that you cannot bloody</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.119" end="00:39:22.850" style="s2">well believe it because most people you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.430" end="00:39:24.050" style="s2">know they&#39;re afraid of any number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.850" end="00:39:25.460" style="s2">things but one of the things they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.050" end="00:39:27.260" style="s2">really afraid of is that now and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.460" end="00:39:28.940" style="s2">they&#39;ll creep out of their cynical shell</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.260" end="00:39:30.140" style="s2">and try to do something good you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.940" end="00:39:31.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re it&#39;s like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.140" end="00:39:34.460" style="s2">popping out this thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.880" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">unbelievably vulnerable to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.460" end="00:39:39.770" style="s2">something good and creep right back into</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:41.869" style="s2">their persona and they&#39;ll look around</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.770" end="00:39:43.130" style="s2">see if anyone noticed and sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.869" end="00:39:44.600" style="s2">they&#39;ll get punished for it and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.130" end="00:39:47.450" style="s2">well then they won&#39;t do it again so</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.600" end="00:39:48.800" style="s2">don&#39;t do that but then now and then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.450" end="00:39:50.090" style="s2">think hey I saw you do this it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.800" end="00:39:54.590" style="s2">actually that was actually pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.090" end="00:39:57.380" style="s2">Oh someone noticed it looks like wow and</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.590" end="00:39:59.540" style="s2">then they&#39;ll think yeah I could maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.380" end="00:40:01.460" style="s2">like I could do that again and if you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.540" end="00:40:03.680" style="s2">want to live with someone for a long</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.460" end="00:40:05.119" style="s2">period of time I would say every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.680" end="00:40:08.119" style="s2">they do something that you would like</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.119" end="00:40:11.780" style="s2">them to do more of number one notice</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.119" end="00:40:13.970" style="s2">number two tell them right because I</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.780" end="00:40:15.890" style="s2">know you don&#39;t want to because you</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.970" end="00:40:17.420" style="s2">really want to dominate them and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.890" end="00:40:17.930" style="s2">don&#39;t you don&#39;t want them thriving</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.420" end="00:40:20.059" style="s2">because then</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.930" end="00:40:21.349" style="s2">maybe a they&#39;d be competition to you and</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.059" end="00:40:22.490" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t be able to go complain to</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.349" end="00:40:24.200" style="s2">your mother about what a miserable</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.490" end="00:40:26.329" style="s2">partner you have and you know how</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.200" end="00:40:28.190" style="s2">delightful that is so you have to forego</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.329" end="00:40:30.200" style="s2">all that pleasure if you actually help</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.190" end="00:40:32.359" style="s2">your person develop so you got to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.200" end="00:40:34.040" style="s2">over all that it&#39;s really annoying so</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.359" end="00:40:35.599" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got this person peg this</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.040" end="00:40:37.160" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re stuck with them and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.599" end="00:40:39.140" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s the best you can do but you</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.160" end="00:40:40.520" style="s2">got one eye open and then every time</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.140" end="00:40:42.589" style="s2">they do something good you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.520" end="00:40:43.640" style="s2">notice because if that elevated them a</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.589" end="00:40:45.410" style="s2">little bit you wouldn&#39;t be able to feel</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.640" end="00:40:47.210" style="s2">so resentful and miserable and keep your</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.410" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">eye open for the next possible affair</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.210" end="00:40:51.589" style="s2">and that is what people are like that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:53.180" style="s2">what people are like and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.589" end="00:40:55.339" style="s2">you&#39;re like - that&#39;s what people are</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.180" end="00:40:57.559" style="s2">like so you got to decide if that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.339" end="00:41:00.890" style="s2">you want or you want to help the person</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.559" end="00:41:02.359" style="s2">that you&#39;re with grow you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.890" end="00:41:05.089" style="s2">dangerous because they might out sign</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.359" end="00:41:07.040" style="s2">you well good then you have someone to</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.089" end="00:41:08.900" style="s2">compare yourself to that would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.040" end="00:41:10.130" style="s2">deal it&#39;s really rough with kids you</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.900" end="00:41:12.500" style="s2">know because parents will stop their</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.130" end="00:41:15.829" style="s2">children from succeeding beyond them</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.500" end="00:41:17.809" style="s2">they get jealous and then they&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.829" end="00:41:20.390" style="s2">them down and then they have kids that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.809" end="00:41:24.109" style="s2">do not like them and they&#39;ll pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.390" end="00:41:25.700" style="s2">so one of the things that I figured out</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.109" end="00:41:28.160" style="s2">over the last years is this is a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.700" end="00:41:31.069" style="s2">proposition so you know it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.160" end="00:41:32.839" style="s2">self-evident that life is has got its</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.069" end="00:41:34.069" style="s2">rat&#39;s nest of miseries and that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.839" end="00:41:35.809" style="s2">sure and maybe you could even make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.069" end="00:41:38.150" style="s2">categorical statement that life is</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.809" end="00:41:39.140" style="s2">mostly a rat&#39;s nest of misery you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.150" end="00:41:41.930" style="s2">and you can make a pretty powerful</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.140" end="00:41:43.400" style="s2">argument for that but then there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.930" end="00:41:44.660" style="s2">counter question which is well what if</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.400" end="00:41:47.660" style="s2">you tried not to make it any more</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.660" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">miserable that had had to be right then</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.660" end="00:41:52.309" style="s2">what then what would it be like and my</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.440" style="s2">suspicions are is that a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.309" end="00:41:55.609" style="s2">misery I would suspect that most of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.440" end="00:41:57.410" style="s2">misery would go away</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.609" end="00:41:58.849" style="s2">because it&#39;s the unnecessary misery that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.410" end="00:42:00.980" style="s2">really brings you down you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.849" end="00:42:05.059" style="s2">like well someone has cancer it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.980" end="00:42:08.240" style="s2">that sucks but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.059" end="00:42:10.130" style="s2">like you can say if only we had done</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.240" end="00:42:12.260" style="s2">this differently then that wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.130" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">happened but when someone&#39;s out like</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.260" end="00:42:15.470" style="s2">torturing you in a malevolent way or</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:17.329" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re doing the same you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.470" end="00:42:19.190" style="s2">always ask yourself was it really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.329" end="00:42:21.589" style="s2">this really necessary is this just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.190" end="00:42:23.599" style="s2">an useless add-on to the miseries of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.589" end="00:42:26.799" style="s2">life that&#39;s what disheartens people and</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.599" end="00:42:29.660" style="s2">so even in your own life if if you if</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.799" end="00:42:31.550" style="s2">you aren&#39;t suffering from self-imposed</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.660" end="00:42:33.410" style="s2">misery and your</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.550" end="00:42:35.660" style="s2">only suffering from an escapable misery</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.410" end="00:42:37.760" style="s2">maybe you could handle that and you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.660" end="00:42:40.540" style="s2">you could you could survive you could</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.760" end="00:42:43.130" style="s2">bear it and even maybe without becoming</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.540" end="00:42:45.110" style="s2">irredeemably corrupt so the goal would</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.130" end="00:42:47.090" style="s2">be well yeah life is a rat&#39;s nest of</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.110" end="00:42:49.310" style="s2">miseries and maybe it has no ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.090" end="00:42:51.260" style="s2">meaning we could say that for feeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.310" end="00:42:53.270" style="s2">particularly pessimistic but it still</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.260" end="00:42:54.470" style="s2">leaves one question open which is if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.270" end="00:42:57.560" style="s2">didn&#39;t do everything you could to make</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.470" end="00:43:00.650" style="s2">it worse how good could you make it be</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.560" end="00:43:04.010" style="s2">and the least answer is well it it could</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.650" end="00:43:05.540" style="s2">be tragedy but maybe not hell and I</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.010" end="00:43:06.890" style="s2">think that&#39;s right I really believe that</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.540" end="00:43:09.620" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the most pessimistic</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.890" end="00:43:11.990" style="s2">proper statement the worst-case outcome</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.620" end="00:43:13.670" style="s2">in the worst of all possible worlds is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.990" end="00:43:16.550" style="s2">that your life could be tragic but not</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.670" end="00:43:18.590" style="s2">hell and that&#39;s blood better than hell</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.550" end="00:43:19.820" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s and you think I could</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.590" end="00:43:21.560" style="s2">give you an example of the difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.820" end="00:43:24.050" style="s2">you&#39;re at your mother&#39;s deathbed</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.560" end="00:43:26.030" style="s2">well that&#39;s tragedy here&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.050" end="00:43:27.770" style="s2">scenario you&#39;re at your mother&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.580" end="00:43:52.250" style="s2">often the case that tragic circumstances</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.590" end="00:43:53.780" style="s2">bring out the Dragons because the stress</p>

<p begin="00:44:00.800" end="00:44:04.430" style="s2">like seriously man you know so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.380" end="00:44:05.960" style="s2">actually a good</p>

<p begin="00:44:19.820" end="00:44:23.180" style="s2">answer is no it&#39;s like well put your</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.740" end="00:44:25.190" style="s2">life together because it&#39;s going to</p>

<p begin="00:44:30.590" end="00:44:35.300" style="s2">undermine your faith in life itself and</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.230" end="00:44:37.660" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen I&#39;ve seen both of those</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.300" end="00:44:41.630" style="s2">situations you know ugly ugly ugly</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.660" end="00:44:43.310" style="s2">situations you know murderously ugly</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.630" end="00:44:44.580" style="s2">situations and then they&#39;re opposite</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.310" end="00:44:46.530" style="s2">where people</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.580" end="00:44:48.060" style="s2">had terrible things happening to happen</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.530" end="00:44:51.270" style="s2">to them as a family and you know they</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.060" end="00:44:53.550" style="s2">pull together and they rebuild their</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.270" end="00:44:57.690" style="s2">damn ship and they sail away so that</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.550" end="00:44:59.430" style="s2">seems to me to be a lot better that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.690" end="00:45:02.460" style="s2">makes you know when the flood comes</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.430" end="00:45:04.320" style="s2">right well okay so the same thing the</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.460" end="00:45:09.540" style="s2">question emerges well who are you well</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.320" end="00:45:11.490" style="s2">you could say your this plan that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.540" end="00:45:13.350" style="s2">people usually that&#39;s how people usually</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.490" end="00:45:15.000" style="s2">identify maybe they have no plan at all</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.350" end="00:45:17.160" style="s2">and they&#39;re just in chaos right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.000" end="00:45:18.750" style="s2">like being in the belly of the beast</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.160" end="00:45:20.940" style="s2">they&#39;re nihilistic and chaos they have</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.750" end="00:45:22.470" style="s2">no plan they&#39;re just chaos itself and</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.940" end="00:45:24.780" style="s2">that&#39;s a very dreadful situation for</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.470" end="00:45:26.910" style="s2">people to be in or maybe they conjure</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.780" end="00:45:28.230" style="s2">together a plan that&#39;s their identity</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.910" end="00:45:29.880" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of fragile and they&#39;re holding</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.230" end="00:45:31.410" style="s2">on to that with with everything they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.880" end="00:45:33.090" style="s2">got it&#39;s their little stick of wood that</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.410" end="00:45:35.100" style="s2">they&#39;re floating in the ocean clinging</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.090" end="00:45:37.500" style="s2">to you know and so they&#39;re identifying</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.100" end="00:45:39.000" style="s2">really hard with that plan that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.500" end="00:45:40.620" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re an ideologue is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.000" end="00:45:43.080" style="s2">you&#39;re identifying really hard with that</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.620" end="00:45:45.300" style="s2">plan the problem is if something comes</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.080" end="00:45:46.710" style="s2">up to confront it well how do you act</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.300" end="00:45:49.890" style="s2">well you can&#39;t let go with a plan</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.710" end="00:45:51.660" style="s2">because you drown then you cling to it</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.890" end="00:45:53.910" style="s2">rigidly well that&#39;s no good because then</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.660" end="00:45:55.530" style="s2">you can&#39;t learn anything then if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.910" end="00:45:57.030" style="s2">you you&#39;re a totalitarian you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.530" end="00:45:58.980" style="s2">going to learn anything you&#39;re gonna end</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.030" end="00:45:59.880" style="s2">up in something that&#39;s close enough to</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.980" end="00:46:01.230" style="s2">hell so that you won&#39;t know the</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.880" end="00:46:03.150" style="s2">difference and you might drag everyone</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.230" end="00:46:04.830" style="s2">along with you that&#39;s happened plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.150" end="00:46:06.600" style="s2">times right it&#39;s the whole story of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.830" end="00:46:09.060" style="s2">20th century happened over and over and</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.600" end="00:46:11.550" style="s2">over and it happens in people&#39;s States</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.060" end="00:46:13.470" style="s2">it happens in their business</p>

<p begin="00:46:50.370" end="00:46:55.050" style="s2">right you don&#39;t want to be that so then</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.370" end="00:46:58.530" style="s2">you think well exactly what are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.050" end="00:47:00.570" style="s2">you know what the chaos you not the plan</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.530" end="00:47:03.270" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re the thing that confronts</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.570" end="00:47:07.080" style="s2">the obstacle and I would say that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.270" end="00:47:09.390" style="s2">categorical lesson of of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.080" end="00:47:11.220" style="s2">insofar as it has to do with personal</p>

<p begin="00:47:21.840" end="00:47:25.440" style="s2">plan and then when you know even further</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:28.470" style="s2">that the obstacle is not only an</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.440" end="00:47:29.730" style="s2">obstacle but opportunity itself well</p>

<p begin="00:47:32.580" end="00:47:37.050" style="s2">object to it it&#39;s like it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.550" end="00:47:38.490" style="s2">that the thing that&#39;s objecting has</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.450" end="00:47:46.740" style="s2">to use it&#39;s like are you so sure that</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.220" end="00:47:48.660" style="s2">this is a problem is that the only way</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.740" end="00:47:50.910" style="s2">that you can look at it or is it an</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.660" end="00:47:53.220" style="s2">opportunity I mean I&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.910" end="00:47:54.570" style="s2">you know naively optimistic there are</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.220" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">some things that&#39;s pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.570" end="00:47:58.140" style="s2">extract gold from some dragons and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:47:58.859" style="s2">the death of a family member is a good</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.140" end="00:48:00.869" style="s2">example of that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.859" end="00:48:02.609" style="s2">but in even in a situation like that I</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.869" end="00:48:05.760" style="s2">can tell you that it&#39;s an opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.609" end="00:48:06.630" style="s2">for it&#39;s an opportunity for maturation</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.760" end="00:48:09.390" style="s2">that&#39;s for sure</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.630" end="00:48:11.550" style="s2">and the thing is you might say well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.390" end="00:48:13.170" style="s2">pretty miserable to go to be digging for</p>

<p begin="00:48:47.640" end="00:48:50.609" style="s2">optimistic so when I tell you to get</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.140" end="00:48:53.700" style="s2">your life together I&#39;m not gonna say</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.609" end="00:48:56.490" style="s2">roses and sunshine it&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.700" end="00:48:59.160" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s pablum for fools</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.490" end="00:49:01.980" style="s2">but it really is something to be the</p>

<p begin="00:49:01.980" end="00:49:05.609" style="s2">you can aim at that you can do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.260" end="00:49:06.900" style="s2">and you got to be tough to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.609" end="00:49:11.280" style="s2">because it also means that you can</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.900" end="00:49:11.940" style="s2">sustain a major loss without collapsing</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.280" end="00:49:13.470" style="s2">and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.940" end="00:49:14.850" style="s2">you&#39;ve got to be a monster to do that</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.470" end="00:49:17.720" style="s2">right because you might think and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.850" end="00:49:21.270" style="s2">had clients like this while I love my</p>

<p begin="00:49:49.470" end="00:49:55.890" style="s2">not at all it&#39;s a horrible thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.380" end="00:49:58.020" style="s2">to someone that&#39;s that&#39;s the witch in</p>

<p begin="00:50:10.650" end="00:50:15.630" style="s2">a major discovery it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:16.980" style="s2">devouring force of love you want the</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.630" end="00:50:18.720" style="s2">person to be able to stand on their own</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.980" end="00:50:20.370" style="s2">and price you pay for that is that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.720" end="00:50:22.830" style="s2">stand on your own</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.370" end="00:50:26.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like good to have you around I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.830" end="00:50:28.080" style="s2">glad you&#39;re here but if if tragedies win</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.010" end="00:50:29.850" style="s2">and if and when tragedy strikes either</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.080" end="00:50:33.330" style="s2">of us I hope that one of us is standing</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.850" end="00:50:34.620" style="s2">when it blows past and and that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.330" end="00:50:36.180" style="s2">a harshness about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.620" end="00:50:38.630" style="s2">unbelievably cruel because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.180" end="00:50:40.590" style="s2">say well if my mother died I could live</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.630" end="00:50:43.020" style="s2">well what kind of monster are you</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.590" end="00:50:45.420" style="s2">exactly death of your mother doesn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.020" end="00:50:49.380" style="s2">you in well turns out that being a</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.420" end="00:50:51.600" style="s2">monster is the right thing so and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.380" end="00:50:53.670" style="s2">a rough thing to learn but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.600" end="00:50:54.990" style="s2">necessary to learn you know because it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.670" end="00:50:57.840" style="s2">also makes you you know at some point</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.990" end="00:50:59.850" style="s2">for example as you get older mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.840" end="00:51:02.970" style="s2">by the time you&#39;re in your mid-20s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.850" end="00:51:04.350" style="s2">something like that you should start</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.970" end="00:51:07.710" style="s2">having a relationship with your parents</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.350" end="00:51:10.230" style="s2">that&#39;s approximately one of peers and</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.710" end="00:51:12.330" style="s2">you can tell if you have that so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.230" end="00:51:14.460" style="s2">a little trick you can use so you have</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.330" end="00:51:16.140" style="s2">parents obviously they have friends you</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.460" end="00:51:17.940" style="s2">probably care what your parents think I</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.140" end="00:51:20.370" style="s2">would imagine do you care what their</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.940" end="00:51:22.080" style="s2">friends think of you and answer that is</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.370" end="00:51:23.370" style="s2">well not nearly as much and so then I</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.080" end="00:51:25.140" style="s2">would say well why do you care what your</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.370" end="00:51:26.339" style="s2">parents think of you then they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.140" end="00:51:28.079" style="s2">same</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.339" end="00:51:30.299" style="s2">you know what I mean it&#39;s just luck of</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.079" end="00:51:33.479" style="s2">the draw that your parents are someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.299" end="00:51:34.799" style="s2">else&#39;s kids friends they don&#39;t think the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.479" end="00:51:35.910" style="s2">same way about them that you do well</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.799" end="00:51:38.369" style="s2">that&#39;s where you see that you have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.910" end="00:51:39.930" style="s2">projection right if by the time you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.369" end="00:51:42.390" style="s2">30 if what your parents think of you</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.930" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">matters more than what say a random set</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.390" end="00:51:45.749" style="s2">of their friends think of you then</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:48.059" style="s2">you&#39;ve still got your parents confused</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.749" end="00:51:49.890" style="s2">with with God that&#39;s one way of looking</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.059" end="00:51:51.930" style="s2">at it you&#39;ve still got them confused</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.890" end="00:51:53.459" style="s2">with an archetype and you&#39;re still a</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.930" end="00:51:54.900" style="s2">child and you might think well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.459" end="00:51:56.309" style="s2">pretty damn rude not to think about what</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.900" end="00:51:58.289" style="s2">your parents think of you anymore not to</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.309" end="00:52:00.089" style="s2">care it&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s kind of rude</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.289" end="00:52:02.700" style="s2">but maybe you&#39;ll be useful for them when</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.089" end="00:52:04.380" style="s2">they get old and that&#39;s a much better</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.700" end="00:52:05.910" style="s2">form of caring it&#39;s like you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.380" end="00:52:09.479" style="s2">be independent enough and strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.910" end="00:52:11.579" style="s2">and and detached enough so that when the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.479" end="00:52:15.180" style="s2">taught when the when the power dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.579" end="00:52:16.979" style="s2">shifts which it will that you&#39;ll be the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.180" end="00:52:18.779" style="s2">person that can carry things forward</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.979" end="00:52:20.849" style="s2">well you can&#39;t do a better thing for</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.779" end="00:52:24.619" style="s2">them than that right that&#39;s the best of</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.849" end="00:52:24.619" style="s2">all possible outcomes for your parents</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.390" end="00:52:35.190" style="s2">well you can think about the world this</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.809" end="00:52:37.769" style="s2">way you can think about it as your</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.190" end="00:52:39.209" style="s2">orderly little plan that&#39;s a place and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.769" end="00:52:41.339" style="s2">you can think about it as the place that</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.209" end="00:52:43.349" style="s2">things that disrupt your plan comes from</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.339" end="00:52:46.440" style="s2">that&#39;s another place this is a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.349" end="00:52:48.180" style="s2">place than this because there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.440" end="00:52:50.009" style="s2">endless number of things that can</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.180" end="00:52:52.109" style="s2">disrupt your plan and only a tiny number</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.009" end="00:52:54.209" style="s2">of them that can you know that will help</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.109" end="00:52:56.489" style="s2">you work it out so part of the question</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.209" end="00:52:58.259" style="s2">then too is like are you the friend of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.489" end="00:53:00.509" style="s2">your plan or are you the friend of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.259" end="00:53:02.459" style="s2">thing that disrupts your plan and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.509" end="00:53:03.959" style="s2">would say you should work to become the</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.459" end="00:53:06.150" style="s2">friend of the thing that disrupts your</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.959" end="00:53:08.519" style="s2">plan because there&#39;s a lot of that and</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.150" end="00:53:11.069" style="s2">then if you become the friend of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.519" end="00:53:13.469" style="s2">thing that disrupts your plan then you</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.069" end="00:53:15.719" style="s2">start to develop strength in proportion</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.469" end="00:53:16.949" style="s2">to the to the disruptive force and</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.719" end="00:53:18.150" style="s2">that&#39;s really what you want you want to</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.949" end="00:53:21.779" style="s2">be able to implement your plan obviously</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.150" end="00:53:24.959" style="s2">but you want to be able to take on the</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.779" end="00:53:27.089" style="s2">consequences of error and learn from it</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.959" end="00:53:28.979" style="s2">and then then you win constantly because</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.089" end="00:53:30.900" style="s2">even if something goes sideways you</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.979" end="00:53:34.799" style="s2">think there&#39;s something to be derived</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.900" end="00:53:37.619" style="s2">from this that&#39;s wisdom fundamentally so</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.799" end="00:53:39.810" style="s2">and so those are the eternal domains</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.619" end="00:53:42.330" style="s2">right there&#39;s the domain of order</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.810" end="00:53:45.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a snake by the way and that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.330" end="00:53:48.270" style="s2">domain of chaos and that&#39;s the world and</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.980" end="00:53:49.830" style="s2">maybe you&#39;re in the order and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.270" end="00:53:51.510" style="s2">you&#39;re in the chaos but those can flip</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.830" end="00:53:53.010" style="s2">on you and maybe you shouldn&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.510" end="00:53:56.280" style="s2">either of those places maybe you should</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.010" end="00:53:57.930" style="s2">be right in the middle and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.280" end="00:54:00.030" style="s2">you should be as far as I can tell and I</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.930" end="00:54:02.280" style="s2">think this is this is another escape</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.030" end="00:54:04.970" style="s2">from postmodern nihilism let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.280" end="00:54:07.320" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a real place it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.970" end="00:54:10.080" style="s2">metaphysical or maybe it is but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.320" end="00:54:11.730" style="s2">metaphysical if metaphysics is more real</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.080" end="00:54:13.020" style="s2">than physics and you can tell when</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.730" end="00:54:15.300" style="s2">you&#39;re at that place because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.020" end="00:54:16.590" style="s2">maximally meaningful place and you drift</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.300" end="00:54:18.000" style="s2">in and out of it all the time in your</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.590" end="00:54:20.370" style="s2">life and when things are really bad for</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.000" end="00:54:21.630" style="s2">you you&#39;re not there hardly at all right</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.370" end="00:54:24.090" style="s2">because everything is overwhelming you</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.630" end="00:54:26.730" style="s2">or the things have become sterile but if</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.090" end="00:54:28.110" style="s2">you watch your life even over a week or</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.730" end="00:54:30.420" style="s2">two you&#39;ll see that now and then you&#39;re</p>
