<p begin="00:00:11.780" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">this meeting is significant in a number</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.610" end="00:00:20.520" style="s2">of ways one way being that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:22.680" style="s2">participants here are what I would call</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:25.590" style="s2">best-in-class for the work that they do</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.680" end="00:00:28.070" style="s2">so they exemplify the best practices</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.590" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">that are needed for doing things like</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.070" end="00:00:34.199" style="s2">restoring forests across large areas of</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">land or for things like building</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.199" end="00:00:38.400" style="s2">economic models for how to help</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:40.890" style="s2">communities participate in regenerative</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.400" end="00:00:43.019" style="s2">practices and so what I&#39;m feeling as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.890" end="00:00:46.110" style="s2">sitting in this group of people over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.019" end="00:00:48.900" style="s2">last few days is that we actually have</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.110" end="00:00:51.420" style="s2">the ability to do this so unlike other</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.900" end="00:00:54.570" style="s2">meetings that I&#39;ve been to where I felt</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.420" end="00:00:57.629" style="s2">there was mostly the ability to do it</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.570" end="00:01:00.960" style="s2">here we have a match of people capable</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.629" end="00:01:03.390" style="s2">and a place that is ready and this is</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.960" end="00:01:06.060" style="s2">beautifully exemplified by Rancho Margot</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.390" end="00:01:08.040" style="s2">because as you walk around these grounds</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.060" end="00:01:10.380" style="s2">and look at what they&#39;ve done here you</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.040" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">have this feeling of human beings who</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.380" end="00:01:16.380" style="s2">care about a piece of land walking into</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">the jungle and making it a place that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.380" end="00:01:22.079" style="s2">exemplifies regeneration and that as we</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:24.359" style="s2">sit down for every meal we know the food</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.079" end="00:01:26.549" style="s2">was grown within walking distance of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.359" end="00:01:28.740" style="s2">where we&#39;re sitting and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.549" end="00:01:31.289" style="s2">buildings are built from materials taken</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.740" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">from the land around us and carried by</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.289" end="00:01:36.869" style="s2">hand or with small equipment that&#39;s on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:39.329" style="s2">human scale it lets us know that not</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.869" end="00:01:41.189" style="s2">only is this tangible impossible but</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.329" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">that it&#39;s already happening so this</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.189" end="00:01:45.630" style="s2">combination of being in a place where</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:48.179" style="s2">it&#39;s already happening and we can feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.630" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">the significance of what it is like to</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.179" end="00:01:52.920" style="s2">live into that on a daily basis while</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:54.810" style="s2">we&#39;re here enables us to dream really</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.920" end="00:01:57.530" style="s2">big and believe we can actually achieve</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.810" end="00:02:00.150" style="s2">it so what I feel from this meeting is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.530" end="00:02:01.710" style="s2">sense of inevitability</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.150" end="00:02:05.910" style="s2">which doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;ll definitely</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.710" end="00:02:09.240" style="s2">succeed but that we have stacked the</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.910" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">deck for our success and so if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.240" end="00:02:14.880" style="s2">do our very best right now to try to</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:17.310" style="s2">succeed this inevitability this feeling</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.880" end="00:02:20.940" style="s2">that is so urgently needed will fade</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.310" end="00:02:23.700" style="s2">away so as we&#39;re here I feel a moral</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.940" end="00:02:25.500" style="s2">calling to step up and take the actions</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.700" end="00:02:28.320" style="s2">that are needed and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.500" end="00:02:31.000" style="s2">this meeting in this place together have</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.320" end="00:02:38.460" style="s2">have created within me</p>
