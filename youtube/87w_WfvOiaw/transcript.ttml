<p begin="00:00:08.639" end="00:00:13.049" style="s2">with you an amazing book that I recently</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.469" end="00:00:14.940" style="s2">read and I have that pleasure of knowing</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.049" end="00:00:17.130" style="s2">you author too which is really great is</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.940" end="00:00:20.039" style="s2">this one right here money blood and</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.130" end="00:00:21.449" style="s2">revolution how Darwin and the doctor of</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.039" end="00:00:24.090" style="s2">King Charles the first could turn</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.449" end="00:00:26.939" style="s2">economics into a science and it&#39;s by</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.090" end="00:00:29.010" style="s2">George Cooper so George Cooper is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.939" end="00:00:31.460" style="s2">financial analyst he lives in the United</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.010" end="00:00:34.380" style="s2">Kingdom and among other things he</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.460" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">forecasts he predicted the financial</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.380" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">crisis of 2008 being within I believe he</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:42.059" style="s2">was a Goldman Sachs at the time and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:44.670" style="s2">he does in this book it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.059" end="00:00:46.350" style="s2">phenomenal two things first thing he</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:48.000" style="s2">does is he tells a story that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.350" end="00:00:50.550" style="s2">accessible because he wrote this for his</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:53.370" style="s2">teenage daughter to answer a question</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.550" end="00:00:54.809" style="s2">she had about why economists just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.370" end="00:00:56.670" style="s2">seem to understand what&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.809" end="00:00:58.230" style="s2">happen with the economy you know if</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.670" end="00:01:00.420" style="s2">economists were really good scientists</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.230" end="00:01:02.190" style="s2">they&#39;d be able to predict or forecast or</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.420" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">at least explain generally how the</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.190" end="00:01:07.170" style="s2">economy behaves and what it&#39;s about to</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:09.030" style="s2">do and of course we know from the 2008</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.170" end="00:01:11.880" style="s2">financial collapse that almost none of</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.030" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">them forecast that so clearly there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.880" end="00:01:15.090" style="s2">something wrong with the throw the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:16.680" style="s2">economics so the second thing that he</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.090" end="00:01:21.299" style="s2">doesn&#39;t this book that&#39;s so awesome is</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.680" end="00:01:24.479" style="s2">he explains why economics is not yet a</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.299" end="00:01:27.450" style="s2">proper science and how it is in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.479" end="00:01:30.290" style="s2">process of becoming one so just really</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.450" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">be brief background there&#39;s this amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.290" end="00:01:34.680" style="s2">field of knowledge known as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">philosophy of science that looks at how</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.680" end="00:01:40.110" style="s2">scientific revolutions happen so like</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">how the Copernican revolution led to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.110" end="00:01:43.710" style="s2">birth of modern astronomy without</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:45.960" style="s2">understanding of the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.710" end="00:01:48.149" style="s2">between the Earth and the Sun and of all</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.960" end="00:01:50.520" style="s2">the planets traveling on the Sun this</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.149" end="00:01:53.759" style="s2">was a revolution or a paradigm shift in</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.520" end="00:01:56.280" style="s2">science for astronomy that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.759" end="00:01:58.920" style="s2">understanding of how science is come</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.280" end="00:02:01.320" style="s2">into being can be applied to the field</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.920" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">of economics now we apply to economics</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.320" end="00:02:05.700" style="s2">what we find is that economics is</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">currently fragmented and at odds with</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.700" end="00:02:09.959" style="s2">itself that there are lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:10.530" style="s2">schools of thought there&#39;s keen v anism</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.959" end="00:02:13.819" style="s2">and there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.530" end="00:02:16.319" style="s2">it&#39;s called the Austrian school there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.819" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">neoliberalism and neoclassical economics</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.319" end="00:02:20.580" style="s2">there&#39;s ecological economics and</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.420" end="00:02:23.130" style="s2">behavioral economics and complexity</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.580" end="00:02:24.990" style="s2">economics and thermo economics all these</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.130" end="00:02:27.420" style="s2">different fields and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.990" end="00:02:29.880" style="s2">monetarism or looking at it through</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:31.319" style="s2">monetary theory what&#39;s interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.880" end="00:02:35.040" style="s2">that every one of these different fields</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.319" end="00:02:36.840" style="s2">is partially correct in some parts of</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.040" end="00:02:39.360" style="s2">what it&#39;s saying and partially incorrect</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.840" end="00:02:41.850" style="s2">and so what that means is that none of</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.360" end="00:02:44.790" style="s2">them is able to stand is a proper fully</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.850" end="00:02:46.620" style="s2">fledged science on its own but when you</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.790" end="00:02:48.739" style="s2">look at all the different pieces you</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.620" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2">start to see that there is a coherent</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.739" end="00:02:53.700" style="s2">paradigm there&#39;s a coherent central</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.420" end="00:02:55.200" style="s2">understanding that connects the pieces</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.700" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">that are correct across all of them and</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.200" end="00:02:59.310" style="s2">that discards all the pieces that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:01.410" style="s2">not correct so at George Cooper does in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.310" end="00:03:04.290" style="s2">this book money blood and revolution is</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.410" end="00:03:07.319" style="s2">he takes the scientific revolutions</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.290" end="00:03:10.830" style="s2">around blood around circulation in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.319" end="00:03:13.350" style="s2">human body and now there&#39;s a doctor of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.830" end="00:03:16.799" style="s2">King Charles brought into being a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.350" end="00:03:18.360" style="s2">paradigm for medical science the gave</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.799" end="00:03:21.480" style="s2">birth to medicine as a proper science</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.360" end="00:03:24.269" style="s2">and he takes the work of Charles Darwin</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.480" end="00:03:25.560" style="s2">and biology and shows that all of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.269" end="00:03:28.019" style="s2">different fragmented ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.560" end="00:03:30.600" style="s2">biological thinking were brought</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.019" end="00:03:32.910" style="s2">together and made coherent by a Darwin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.600" end="00:03:34.140" style="s2">theory of natural selection and that if</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.910" end="00:03:36.690" style="s2">we take the same kind of thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.140" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">actually key findings from Darwinism and</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.690" end="00:03:41.820" style="s2">from circulation and medicine that were</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:44.970" style="s2">able to see what a coherent science of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.820" end="00:03:48.930" style="s2">economics is and so what George Cooper</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.970" end="00:03:51.000" style="s2">offers us is a coherent story about how</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.930" end="00:03:52.890" style="s2">economics has not yet become a proper</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.000" end="00:03:55.769" style="s2">science and how it is becoming one and</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.890" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">in the last few chapters he even offers</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.769" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">his own paradigm kind of conceptual</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:02.730" style="s2">understanding of what this new paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:04.290" style="s2">is about to become and so this is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.730" end="00:04:06.750" style="s2">great book for anyone who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.290" end="00:04:09.660" style="s2">understand economics as a proper science</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.750" end="00:04:11.970" style="s2">or why economics has not yet become one</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.660" end="00:04:14.160" style="s2">and now they can help make economics</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.970" end="00:04:16.380" style="s2">into a proper science more quickly so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.160" end="00:04:18.299" style="s2">found it incredibly enlightening very</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.380" end="00:04:20.070" style="s2">readable and very enjoyable to read and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.299" end="00:04:21.930" style="s2">I was able to read it in just a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.070" end="00:04:23.240" style="s2">of days because it&#39;s you can see it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.930" end="00:04:24.680" style="s2">fairly short</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.240" end="00:04:27.020" style="s2">it&#39;s written in language that a teenager</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.680" end="00:04:29.360" style="s2">can understand and it&#39;s incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.020" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">enlightening for why economics has</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.360" end="00:04:33.800" style="s2">failed us up to now and how we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.520" end="00:04:36.319" style="s2">change that situation so go rap go grab</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.319" end="00:04:42.699" style="s2">lot about economics and the history of</p>
