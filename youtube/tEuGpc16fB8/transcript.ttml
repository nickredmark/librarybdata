<p begin="00:00:01.380" end="00:00:06.330" style="s2">cognitive science program is cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.920" end="00:00:07.620" style="s2">250 which is the introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.330" end="00:00:10.019" style="s2">cognitive science and I&#39;m going to try</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.620" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">and compress the first sort of six weeks</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.019" end="00:00:15.240" style="s2">of lecture into ten minutes so we&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:19.439" style="s2">how well that goes so what is cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.240" end="00:00:22.800" style="s2">science and very often you get sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.439" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">this thing from the catalog well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:25.980" style="s2">the interdisciplinary study of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:27.599" style="s2">nature of cognition but why why</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.980" end="00:00:29.400" style="s2">interdisciplinary well that has to do</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.599" end="00:00:30.869" style="s2">with a little bit of the history so</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.400" end="00:00:32.700" style="s2">we&#39;ve been trying to understand the mind</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.869" end="00:00:35.190" style="s2">and cognition for a long time and you</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.700" end="00:00:37.350" style="s2">know philosophy I did quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.190" end="00:00:39.540" style="s2">work at it but we realized that in</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.350" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">addition to that conceptual work we had</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.540" end="00:00:43.969" style="s2">to do some experimental work where we</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:46.950" style="s2">were studying more carefully behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.969" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">and so psychology also starts to study</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.950" end="00:00:51.840" style="s2">the the nature of the mind but we start</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">to realize that we can&#39;t study that just</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.840" end="00:00:56.100" style="s2">on its own we need to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:57.300" style="s2">brain level how is the brain causing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.100" end="00:00:58.800" style="s2">contributing to behavior and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.300" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">where of course neuroscience comes in</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.800" end="00:01:04.559" style="s2">but it also matters how brains link up</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:07.380" style="s2">to each other and so we need linguistics</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.559" end="00:01:11.220" style="s2">and we need anthropology to also tell us</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.380" end="00:01:13.950" style="s2">how mind and brains work so what we need</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.220" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">is these various disciplines to work</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.950" end="00:01:17.670" style="s2">together in order to get a complete</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:19.950" style="s2">picture because what matters is no one</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.670" end="00:01:21.869" style="s2">of these levels is sufficient for</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:24.060" style="s2">understanding the mind therefore no one</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.869" end="00:01:25.890" style="s2">of these disciplines because all of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.060" end="00:01:27.479" style="s2">these levels are very causally</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.890" end="00:01:29.009" style="s2">interdependent with each other they</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.479" end="00:01:31.020" style="s2">affect each other the brain level</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.009" end="00:01:33.329" style="s2">affects behavior behavior affects the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.020" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">brain right the behavioral level right</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.329" end="00:01:37.340" style="s2">for one brain is affected by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:39.479" style="s2">behavior of other brains so that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.340" end="00:01:41.310" style="s2">anthropological cultural level or that</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.479" end="00:01:43.250" style="s2">linguistic communicative level matters</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.310" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">and so what we need is we need a</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.250" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">discipline that isn&#39;t doing each one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">these levels but the discipline about</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:51.960" style="s2">how they&#39;re causally interdependent and</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">therefore theoretically relevant to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.960" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:56.250" style="s2">that&#39;s what cognitive science is and</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:59.700" style="s2">cognitive science is therefore pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.250" end="00:02:02.960" style="s2">a project of synaptic integration it is</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.700" end="00:02:06.780" style="s2">trying to create a conceptual vocabulary</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.960" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">a theoretical grammar for how these</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.780" end="00:02:11.690" style="s2">various disciplines can talk to each</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:13.720" style="s2">other so as to afford this very valuable</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.690" end="00:02:16.120" style="s2">synoptic integration</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.720" end="00:02:18.280" style="s2">so that means that cognitive science is</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.120" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">this really creative project we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.280" end="00:02:22.030" style="s2">trying to come up with these theoretical</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:25.060" style="s2">constructs that will serve this</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.030" end="00:02:26.470" style="s2">important purpose so what do you do when</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.060" end="00:02:28.030" style="s2">you construct a theoretical construct</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.470" end="00:02:29.890" style="s2">well what you do is you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.030" end="00:02:32.170" style="s2">make the most plausible construct you</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.890" end="00:02:33.820" style="s2">can see what do I mean by plausibility I</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.170" end="00:02:36.010" style="s2">want a theoretical construct that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.820" end="00:02:37.990" style="s2">holds good promise that it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.010" end="00:02:41.020" style="s2">predict where I&#39;m going to find good</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.990" end="00:02:43.410" style="s2">empirical evidence I want to I want a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.020" end="00:02:46.750" style="s2">construct that&#39;s going to help guide and</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.410" end="00:02:48.700" style="s2">constrain future empirical research so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.750" end="00:02:49.960" style="s2">need plausible constructs well how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.700" end="00:02:53.110" style="s2">come up with plausibility</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.960" end="00:02:54.580" style="s2">in general well I&#39;m going to indicate to</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.110" end="00:02:56.410" style="s2">you a model of plausibility that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.580" end="00:02:58.300" style="s2">working on with Leo Ferrara and this</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.410" end="00:03:00.640" style="s2">plausibility model looks something like</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.300" end="00:03:02.740" style="s2">this there&#39;s a couple things we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.640" end="00:03:04.120" style="s2">to try and increase the plausibility of</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.740" end="00:03:06.220" style="s2">our constructs the first thing we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.120" end="00:03:08.260" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re trying to get convergence</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.220" end="00:03:11.020" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to get how the various</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.260" end="00:03:12.580" style="s2">disciplines various theoretical lines of</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.020" end="00:03:15.520" style="s2">argument various empirical lines of</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.580" end="00:03:18.010" style="s2">research all converge on a shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.520" end="00:03:20.110" style="s2">conclusion why do we do that why does</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.010" end="00:03:21.340" style="s2">that matter because when you get</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.110" end="00:03:24.100" style="s2">convergence you increased</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.340" end="00:03:27.190" style="s2">trustworthiness trustworthiness is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.100" end="00:03:29.980" style="s2">is the conclusion that your construct</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.190" end="00:03:31.989" style="s2">has not been produced by bias look I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.980" end="00:03:33.340" style="s2">look at the book but in order to make</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.989" end="00:03:36.220" style="s2">sure that the book is really there that</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.340" end="00:03:37.720" style="s2">I can trust my perception I also reach</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.220" end="00:03:40.270" style="s2">out and touch this book on neural</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.720" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">computing because if both my sight and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.270" end="00:03:45.580" style="s2">my touch converge on this it&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:47.080" style="s2">likely that I&#39;m just hallucinating the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.580" end="00:03:49.269" style="s2">book that it&#39;s just being produced by</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.080" end="00:03:51.370" style="s2">bias it&#39;s much more likely that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.269" end="00:03:54.040" style="s2">something really there now is it perfect</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.370" end="00:03:56.470" style="s2">no but it increases the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.040" end="00:03:59.019" style="s2">the conclusion here that is resulting is</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.470" end="00:04:02.500" style="s2">not due from any by any single line of</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.019" end="00:04:05.190" style="s2">bias but from something really there but</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.500" end="00:04:08.290" style="s2">I want something more than convergence</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:11.350" style="s2">because what I want is I want to help</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.290" end="00:04:13.630" style="s2">afford insight I want to indicate new</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.350" end="00:04:15.730" style="s2">ways of thinking help people in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.630" end="00:04:18.010" style="s2">various disciplines to solve problems to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.730" end="00:04:21.010" style="s2">open up new lines of research I need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.010" end="00:04:23.410" style="s2">promise insight so one of the things my</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.010" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2">constructs have to do right is they not</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.410" end="00:04:27.070" style="s2">only have to have convergence for</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.070" end="00:04:32.500" style="s2">my constructs have to right be elegant</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:35.380" style="s2">in the sense that I can use the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.500" end="00:04:39.430" style="s2">construct in many different situations</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.380" end="00:04:41.560" style="s2">so this is a highly powerful or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.430" end="00:04:44.590" style="s2">insightful construct because I can take</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.560" end="00:04:47.560" style="s2">it here and frame and solve problems I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.590" end="00:04:49.570" style="s2">couldn&#39;t solve before here here here and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.560" end="00:04:51.370" style="s2">if the various disciplines can share</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.570" end="00:04:54.130" style="s2">this construct this is one a powerful</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.370" end="00:04:57.670" style="s2">way of affording synoptic integration</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.130" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">and I want a balance between these the</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.670" end="00:05:02.260" style="s2">more I&#39;m trying to transform the field</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:04.870" style="s2">with my insight the more I need to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.260" end="00:05:07.060" style="s2">guarantee or at least assure myself that</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.870" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">my construct has high trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.060" end="00:05:12.760" style="s2">because if I do this without ruling bias</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:15.760" style="s2">I get weirdness I get conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.760" end="00:05:18.880" style="s2">theories I get fantasy I get craziness</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.760" end="00:05:20.920" style="s2">right but if I have a lot of convergence</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.880" end="00:05:23.140" style="s2">a lot of trustworthiness with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.920" end="00:05:25.240" style="s2">insight then I get triviality I get what</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.140" end="00:05:27.220" style="s2">is obvious what everybody already knows</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.240" end="00:05:29.020" style="s2">and that&#39;s also not scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.220" end="00:05:31.660" style="s2">useful but if I can get something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.020" end="00:05:33.970" style="s2">highly convergent and highly elegant in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.660" end="00:05:35.650" style="s2">this manner then has a high degree of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.970" end="00:05:38.260" style="s2">plausibility then I have something</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.650" end="00:05:41.020" style="s2">powerful potentially profoundly powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.260" end="00:05:43.980" style="s2">so cognitive science is about creating</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.020" end="00:05:43.980" style="s2">these constructs</p>
