<p begin="00:00:01.280" end="00:00:04.080" style="s2">all right i think this is officially one</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.800" end="00:00:05.520" style="s2">of our board meetings but i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.080" end="00:00:08.320" style="s2">they&#39;re melding into each other</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.520" end="00:00:10.160" style="s2">so today we were meeting to discuss our</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.320" end="00:00:11.360" style="s2">individual visions and missions for</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.160" end="00:00:14.400" style="s2">together tech</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.360" end="00:00:15.759" style="s2">and see about creating a common one</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.400" end="00:00:18.320" style="s2">so we&#39;re all working towards the same</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.759" end="00:00:21.119" style="s2">thing for together tech i know we had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.320" end="00:00:22.560" style="s2">document last week again my</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.119" end="00:00:24.880" style="s2">my computer i can no longer copy and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.560" end="00:00:26.240" style="s2">paste things so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.880" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">trying to figure out workarounds with</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.240" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">other devices but if somebody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">put that up as a screen share</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.040" end="00:00:37.360" style="s2">and uh we can i have mine written out on</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.880" end="00:00:40.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.360" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">very technological sticky note here</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.640" end="00:00:44.559" style="s2">my vision and mission so any anyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">wants to start sharing theirs or i can</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.559" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">share mine</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.000" end="00:00:59.760" style="s2">i can pull it up if no one else has</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.239" end="00:01:01.520" style="s2">well you&#39;re pulling that up and sharing</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.760" end="00:01:03.359" style="s2">it i can share just</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.520" end="00:01:04.720" style="s2">the vision i have written here is</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.359" end="00:01:06.000" style="s2">creating the tools slash</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.720" end="00:01:08.320" style="s2">infrastructure needed for</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.000" end="00:01:12.080" style="s2">self-sufficiency of individuals</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.320" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">to society</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.080" end="00:01:14.400" style="s2">i guess i should have asked whether</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:15.759" style="s2">we&#39;re doing mission revision first</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.400" end="00:01:21.040" style="s2">perfect awesome</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.759" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">probably vision so was that your vision</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.040" end="00:01:23.920" style="s2">yeah that was the vision</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.400" end="00:01:28.479" style="s2">and then mission was other versions of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.799" end="00:01:30.560" style="s2">why i put like playing it creating new</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.479" end="00:01:33.280" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.560" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">solo to cooperative basically the same</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.280" end="00:01:35.920" style="s2">version</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:37.280" style="s2">of what it was a year ago which is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.920" end="00:01:38.960" style="s2">it needs to be fun what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.280" end="00:01:41.600" style="s2">whatever path we&#39;re doing to get there</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.960" end="00:01:42.000" style="s2">diverse options and ways to get there</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.600" end="00:01:43.920" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.000" end="00:01:45.759" style="s2">um whatever we&#39;re creating is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.920" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">trustworthy to the masses</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.759" end="00:01:49.360" style="s2">based on the fact that it was created</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:50.079" style="s2">together so it was kind of values but</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.360" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">also mission</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.079" end="00:01:55.840" style="s2">was fun diverse and trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.680" end="00:02:04.399" style="s2">cool uh i can i can</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.799" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">tackle next um but i think that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.399" end="00:02:08.560" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">by the way um i had several visions</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.560" end="00:02:13.760" style="s2">uh kind of statements um</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">i think you suggested to start out with</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.760" end="00:02:17.360" style="s2">the world so</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:19.040" style="s2">a world where game b is more common than</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.360" end="00:02:21.040" style="s2">game a now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.040" end="00:02:22.800" style="s2">awfully broad and probably too broad for</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.040" end="00:02:25.520" style="s2">this project</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.800" end="00:02:26.640" style="s2">um and actually i was starting to think</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.520" end="00:02:28.879" style="s2">in doing these</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.640" end="00:02:30.959" style="s2">that i got confused again on whether</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.879" end="00:02:33.040" style="s2">we&#39;re doing it for just</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.959" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">so i think this is for together tech but</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.040" end="00:02:35.680" style="s2">we also need to discuss that we need a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:39.120" style="s2">separate one</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.680" end="00:02:42.400" style="s2">or combined for the um</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.120" end="00:02:45.440" style="s2">the fundraising game a projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.400" end="00:02:49.840" style="s2">right and and so maybe there&#39;s two but</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.440" end="00:02:52.000" style="s2">one kind of is supersedes the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.840" end="00:02:54.160" style="s2">uh so and i thought another way phrasing</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.000" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">is a a world where ideas that increase</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.160" end="00:02:57.519" style="s2">omni when</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:59.680" style="s2">solutions benefit from and contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.519" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">a commons of tools knowledge mentoring</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.680" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">and funding</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:08.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very long and then i like that one</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">and then a little bit too technical for</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.000" end="00:03:11.200" style="s2">a vision</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">statement but or too specific but a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.200" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">world where 99.99</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:17.280" style="s2">of people have a personal quality of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:19.680" style="s2">life score above 90 percent</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.280" end="00:03:21.280" style="s2">and the person equality of a life score</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.680" end="00:03:24.799" style="s2">is not defined yet</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.280" end="00:03:27.040" style="s2">i just made that up but um</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.799" end="00:03:29.200" style="s2">is some effect of kind of how they</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.040" end="00:03:30.720" style="s2">measure happiness or satisfaction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.200" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">some of the things you</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.720" end="00:03:34.159" style="s2">you take a look and you see whether your</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:36.080" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.159" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">would you say that you know over the</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.080" end="00:03:41.200" style="s2">past year or so that that you are set</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:42.080" style="s2">how satisfied are you in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.200" end="00:03:44.080" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.080" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">either look to see that go up but but i</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.080" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">was thinking in general have people say</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:49.840" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:53.840" style="s2">uh you know out of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.840" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">unit x unit 100 satisfied where are you</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.840" end="00:03:59.680" style="s2">um and i&#39;d say a majority of people</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">right now are probably below 50.</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.680" end="00:04:03.280" style="s2">so that would be a huge improvement</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:04.400" style="s2">anyway so those are three ideas i just</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.280" end="00:04:08.000" style="s2">want to throw out</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.400" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">and then for a mission um</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.000" end="00:04:11.360" style="s2">encourage and facilitate the following</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:14.159" style="s2">benefits for omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.360" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">ideas so knowledge commons digital tools</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:17.759" style="s2">software infrastructure</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:19.600" style="s2">and then mentoring and fundraising so</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.759" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a longer way of saying what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">second bullet point had in there</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:29.199" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">so those were my ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.199" end="00:04:33.759" style="s2">cool i like those um mine i still</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">need to probably go through a couple</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.759" end="00:04:36.880" style="s2">passes i&#39;m trying to hash out the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:38.240" style="s2">wording so i just threw some stuff on a</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.880" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">page that i knew was in the right</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.240" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:45.919" style="s2">and tried to to wordsmith it a bit um</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.639" style="s2">so my my vision the two that i have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.919" end="00:04:48.560" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.639" end="00:04:50.479" style="s2">i think all along the ones of the others</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.560" end="00:04:51.360" style="s2">are a world where important technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.479" end="00:04:52.639" style="s2">of all types</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.360" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">have a place for safe and proven</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.639" end="00:04:56.160" style="s2">services funding etc</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:04:57.680" style="s2">and then a world where omni wind</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.160" end="00:04:59.280" style="s2">projects can meaningfully compete and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.680" end="00:05:03.120" style="s2">build products</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.280" end="00:05:06.479" style="s2">um i do sort of like the middle one</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.120" end="00:05:08.720" style="s2">of bentley&#39;s i think it gets a good</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.479" end="00:05:10.240" style="s2">sort of it covers a lot of the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.720" end="00:05:13.600" style="s2">that we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.240" end="00:05:14.000" style="s2">do um for the mission i had quite a few</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.600" end="00:05:17.360" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.000" end="00:05:18.400" style="s2">um the one that i think requires a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.360" end="00:05:20.960" style="s2">of work but i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.400" end="00:05:21.600" style="s2">sort of also gets the general point</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.960" end="00:05:23.520" style="s2">across</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.600" end="00:05:25.280" style="s2">is to behave like a multinational sort</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.520" end="00:05:27.440" style="s2">of holding company corporation</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.280" end="00:05:28.960" style="s2">aligned around core values so where</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.440" end="00:05:29.280" style="s2">profit is important but it&#39;s not number</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.960" end="00:05:31.039" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.280" end="00:05:33.600" style="s2">unlike a lot of the other companies that</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.039" end="00:05:34.960" style="s2">it would be technically competing with</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.600" end="00:05:36.720" style="s2">um and then to provide thought</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.960" end="00:05:38.160" style="s2">leadership on appropriate topics so</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.720" end="00:05:41.039" style="s2">things that those sort of projects</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">would need um to manage coach build or</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.039" end="00:05:43.199" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:44.800" style="s2">uh otherwise assist with relevant</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.199" end="00:05:46.400" style="s2">technology projects</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.800" end="00:05:48.080" style="s2">and then have it sort of split out into</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.400" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">the not for for profits it could be</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.080" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">anything important</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.479" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">so those were the two visions not</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">properly split apart</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:33.680" style="s2">and then out the mission is</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:39.039" style="s2">gonna be interesting to try to paste uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.479" end="00:08:42.320" style="s2">you know kind of grab the</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.039" end="00:08:45.440" style="s2">more important ones i think and</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.320" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">did matush have a vision in mission i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.440" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">guessing</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">the grand vision is to bring post</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:54.080" style="s2">scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:56.399" style="s2">uh finally to the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.080" end="00:08:58.560" style="s2">i wanted to keep it very short so post</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.399" end="00:09:01.760" style="s2">scarcity is</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.560" end="00:09:05.040" style="s2">the keyword here and i guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.760" end="00:09:07.680" style="s2">yeah the the traditional phrasing for a</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.040" end="00:09:10.320" style="s2">vision is to say it already exists</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.680" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">so and so bringing would be the mission</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.320" end="00:09:14.480" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">um a post-scarcity world i guess would</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:17.120" style="s2">be it right</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:25.040" style="s2">for that vision i didn&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.640" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">good enough way to say uh post scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.040" end="00:09:30.399" style="s2">as in</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">resources physical stuff and mindsets</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.399" end="00:09:33.680" style="s2">of the people because these are two</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:36.480" style="s2">things that are actually important and</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.680" end="00:09:38.720" style="s2">they are not exactly the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.480" end="00:09:40.480" style="s2">and for the mission uh pretty much what</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.720" end="00:09:43.839" style="s2">it&#39;s what is already there</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.480" end="00:09:47.290" style="s2">with one addition being</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.839" end="00:09:48.560" style="s2">supporting and encouraging local</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.290" end="00:09:52.480" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.560" end="00:09:55.760" style="s2">not villages but local communities to</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.480" end="00:09:59.120" style="s2">um arise and uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.760" end="00:10:00.399" style="s2">exist and yeah something that mentions</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.120" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">local communities as</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.399" end="00:10:05.839" style="s2">a very important thing for the future</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.959" end="00:10:24.640" style="s2">um yeah so how does that</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.079" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">so uh i guess we heard everyone who was</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.640" end="00:10:29.839" style="s2">assigned homework</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">um how do people</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.839" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">feel about that i don&#39;t know open</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.880" end="00:10:39.839" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing that was said that i</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.079" end="00:10:40.800" style="s2">disagree with like nothing that&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.839" end="00:10:44.959" style="s2">that i&#39;m like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.800" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">is going to hurt what i had in mind um</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.959" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">which is good none of them contradict</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:48.640" style="s2">each other and we all have a slightly</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">different spin</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.640" end="00:10:54.800" style="s2">on what that like</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:56.800" style="s2">best omni-wind future is right like</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">it&#39;s something we would</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.519" end="00:11:13.680" style="s2">have people themselves giving that</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.279" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">we might trust each other right but we</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.440" end="00:11:47.760" style="s2">are not necessarily going to trust</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:49.040" style="s2">somebody else coming in</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.760" end="00:11:51.680" style="s2">or someone else coming is necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.040" end="00:11:54.079" style="s2">going to trust us having easy ways for</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.680" end="00:11:57.519" style="s2">trust to be built on projects</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.079" end="00:11:58.560" style="s2">and with individuals is fun diverse and</p>

<p begin="00:12:24.320" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">uh and then a consumer</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.920" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">to make it sort of obvious hey if</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">anybody is allied with</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">you know this group here&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:34.560" style="s2">means here&#39;s why you can trust it</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.040" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">trust is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.680" end="00:12:43.279" style="s2">specific enough because there are you</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">can have trust in something because you</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.279" end="00:12:46.160" style="s2">have faith in it and you can have trust</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:47.760" style="s2">in something because you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.160" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">need to trust it because it&#39;s fully</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.760" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.839" end="00:12:56.800" style="s2">um and i&#39;d prefer the latter</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.639" end="00:12:58.320" style="s2">yeah i mean when i say trust i it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.800" end="00:12:59.360" style="s2">sort of always break that down into</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.320" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">character and</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.360" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">competence for character you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">like you trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:05.600" style="s2">them that they aren&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">sketchy and sort of have ulterior</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.600" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">motives</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">and then character like they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">able to do what you&#39;re trusting them to</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:14.160" style="s2">do not just that they&#39;d actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:15.519" style="s2">and so it would need to be both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.160" end="00:13:17.040" style="s2">that right it would be like the</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.519" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">character of</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.040" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">the the organization um you know that if</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.079" end="00:13:23.040" style="s2">they say that they&#39;re not for profit you</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:23.680" style="s2">know that it&#39;s omni win that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.040" end="00:13:25.440" style="s2">actually that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.680" end="00:13:26.959" style="s2">but then also they&#39;re able to go out</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.440" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">there and compete in the world and</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.959" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">actually go</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:32.720" style="s2">toe-to-toe with the organizations that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">will end up being their you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.720" end="00:13:36.079" style="s2">their competition um and actually you</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:38.320" style="s2">know being able to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.079" end="00:13:40.079" style="s2">like that&#39;s where i think the funding</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.320" end="00:13:42.240" style="s2">issue gets really weird is</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:44.000" style="s2">it in a lot of ways it needs to behave</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.240" end="00:13:46.720" style="s2">like a game a</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.000" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">sort of fairly aggressive company but</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.720" end="00:13:50.880" style="s2">without profit being the number what</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:52.000" style="s2">one motive like profits just to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.880" end="00:13:54.880" style="s2">lights on but if</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.000" end="00:13:55.519" style="s2">i think if it&#39;s not being for lack of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.880" end="00:13:58.880" style="s2">better term</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.519" end="00:14:02.320" style="s2">aggressive then it ends up losing out</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.880" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">yeah i guess i i think that you can be</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.320" end="00:14:07.600" style="s2">competent and um</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.920" end="00:14:11.440" style="s2">and have character and that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.160" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">that&#39;s still a separate</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.440" end="00:14:15.519" style="s2">thing than whether you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.399" style="s2">transparent</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.519" end="00:14:20.240" style="s2">right yeah so yeah i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.399" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">transparency is kind of needed for both</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.240" end="00:14:22.639" style="s2">sides</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:27.040" style="s2">um welcome steve if you uh want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.839" end="00:14:28.240" style="s2">contribute you can unmute just keep</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.040" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">yourself muted</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.240" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">in between sharing so that we don&#39;t hear</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:34.399" style="s2">the background noise</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:35.680" style="s2">i believe you should be able to unmute</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.399" end="00:14:38.000" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">if not type it in the box and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.000" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">uh yeah for the idea of profit</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">the other version and maybe there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:50.079" style="s2">different options but</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:51.760" style="s2">you&#39;re either profit or purpose so if</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.079" end="00:14:54.720" style="s2">you&#39;re in it for purpose</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.760" end="00:14:56.000" style="s2">then your first is your mission right if</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.720" end="00:14:57.199" style="s2">you&#39;re a transportation company it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.000" end="00:14:59.440" style="s2">transportation if your</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.199" end="00:15:00.720" style="s2">communication company it&#39;s communication</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.440" end="00:15:03.040" style="s2">that all companies have</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.720" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">profit first but they have to do um</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.040" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">purpose enough to</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:10.320" style="s2">to stay in business hopefully we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:12.160" style="s2">flipping that we&#39;re doing purpose</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.320" end="00:15:13.920" style="s2">to the biggest one and like yeah we have</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.160" end="00:15:16.480" style="s2">to be profitable enough</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.920" end="00:15:17.600" style="s2">in order to be able to stay in business</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.480" end="00:15:19.519" style="s2">and and flipping</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.600" end="00:15:20.959" style="s2">flipping that but what that is for each</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.519" end="00:15:21.839" style="s2">individual project is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.959" end="00:15:25.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.839" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">is it you know in wikilection and reason</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.040" end="00:15:28.399" style="s2">score is it helping people make sense</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">and with trustworthy information that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.399" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">they can use how much is it being used</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:36.079" style="s2">what would make it even better</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.079" end="00:15:40.160" style="s2">when it came to that i um sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:41.680" style="s2">was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.160" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">especially for me because i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.680" end="00:15:44.959" style="s2">important to sort of say like</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">profit is important but you can&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.959" end="00:15:48.639" style="s2">into the same trap as</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.759" style="s2">gamey companies and so i came up with</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.639" end="00:15:52.079" style="s2">the sort of like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:52.959" style="s2">the priority list where the acronym is</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.079" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">vip</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.959" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">number one is values which i think that</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">that that&#39;s something that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:00.000" style="s2">separate to mission</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:01.199" style="s2">and vision it&#39;s like the specific the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.000" end="00:16:03.680" style="s2">list of things that will always be</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.199" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">trying to improve and always</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.680" end="00:16:07.440" style="s2">um be taking into account so the values</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">are number one</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.959" style="s2">and then next is improvement like</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">improving the world</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.959" end="00:16:15.120" style="s2">and like improving things for people and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:16.000" style="s2">for the environment and for animals and</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.120" end="00:16:17.920" style="s2">for everything else</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.000" end="00:16:19.600" style="s2">and then third is profit whereas like to</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.920" end="00:16:21.600" style="s2">be able to keep the lights on to be able</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.600" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">to you know act like a company</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.600" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">but never before the other two</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">so profit is a business variable instead</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">of the goal right the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.880" style="s2">values and what we know but profit is</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">one of the variables</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.880" end="00:16:40.399" style="s2">of the life of the company right and</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:41.759" style="s2">it&#39;s important enough that like</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.399" end="00:16:43.680" style="s2">because of course the more money the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.759" end="00:16:45.600" style="s2">organization has it can pay its staff</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.680" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">it can you know actually compete in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.600" end="00:16:49.199" style="s2">world arena with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:51.600" style="s2">the challenges it will eventually have</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.199" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">both in legal and otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.600" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">um yeah like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.959" end="00:17:02.959" style="s2">and definitely open to ideas there but</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.680" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">that was sort of like i</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.959" end="00:17:06.160" style="s2">was trying to figure out a way to sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:08.400" style="s2">of say like hey it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.160" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">sort of of like with the part where it</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.400" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">needs to behave</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:13.919" style="s2">like a multinational corporation</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:15.919" style="s2">like in the ways you know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.919" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">outlying a bunch of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.919" end="00:17:20.880" style="s2">similar products and and organizations</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.400" style="s2">towards the same goal</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.880" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">but with the unique difference being</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.400" end="00:17:25.919" style="s2">that goal isn&#39;t just making money</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.760" style="s2">and while money is important it can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.919" end="00:17:29.120" style="s2">come at the expense of the whole reason</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.760" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">that we&#39;re doing this because how was it</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.120" end="00:17:32.799" style="s2">actually different from</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:33.520" style="s2">a game a multinational corporation if</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.799" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">profit</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.520" end="00:17:37.600" style="s2">sneaks into you know spot number one at</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:39.840" style="s2">that point it&#39;s not because that</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.600" end="00:17:41.520" style="s2">has the same issues with profit being</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.840" end="00:17:44.960" style="s2">your sole motive</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.520" end="00:17:46.240" style="s2">yeah and you meant um yeah i wonder if</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.960" end="00:17:48.799" style="s2">there&#39;s a better word than</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.240" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">profit because like you mentioned paying</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.799" end="00:17:53.919" style="s2">your salaries but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:56.799" style="s2">profit true uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.919" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">like in this case i guess likely revenue</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.799" end="00:18:00.559" style="s2">although i do also mean profit because</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:02.400" style="s2">at the end of the day if you have profit</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.559" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">above your expenses where</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.400" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">you know staff wages are an expense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:07.679" style="s2">also profits you say hey</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:09.200" style="s2">you know we spent this much on</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.679" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">infrastructure this much on wages we</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.200" end="00:18:12.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">this much money left over now the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.640" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">organization can grow it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">you know possibly acquire other</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:18.559" style="s2">companies it can buy real estate if it</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">wants like</p>

<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:19:02.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s is like it&#39;s keeping that in</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.679" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">in our metric as opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.720" end="00:19:05.440" style="s2">oh well if we keep this and we have an</p>

<p begin="00:19:05.440" end="00:19:10.400" style="s2">means we have you know like</p>

<p begin="00:19:10.400" end="00:19:13.919" style="s2">the rest right i think part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.200" end="00:19:16.480" style="s2">trying to</p>

<p begin="00:19:21.600" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">expense of the other thing so values are</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.360" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">always number one</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:27.679" style="s2">the value is omni-win and the value is</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.679" end="00:19:30.960" style="s2">then your goal is always to make more</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">money than you&#39;re spending</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.960" end="00:19:34.480" style="s2">but if you only ever you know stick to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">your values and</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.480" end="00:19:38.000" style="s2">improve the world and you don&#39;t make a</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">profit then that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.000" end="00:19:41.600" style="s2">because you you stuck to your first two</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.000" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">but profit is still important</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.600" end="00:19:46.880" style="s2">which is amazing and i i because i</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">didn&#39;t do the homework properly</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.880" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">i&#39;m the only one who did values right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:53.520" style="s2">the question is because even my three</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">values right that i</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.520" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">included fun diversity and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:01.600" style="s2">uh trust and trust what&#39;s first what</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:03.840" style="s2">second one&#39;s third</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.600" end="00:20:05.200" style="s2">right to me well trustworthiness is</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.840" end="00:20:06.559" style="s2">pretty damn important</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.200" end="00:20:07.679" style="s2">but if i&#39;m not having fun i&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.559" end="00:20:08.720" style="s2">be hanging out here right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.679" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">individually fun</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.720" end="00:20:11.840" style="s2">is pretty important but only for making</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:13.679" style="s2">things that are trustworthy and</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.840" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">diversity is about making sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.679" end="00:20:18.240" style="s2">it&#39;s fun enough for most people right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:20.480" style="s2">that&#39;s just my own values forget about</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.240" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">once we include our values and all of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.480" end="00:20:22.640" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">what does it mean don&#39;t live those</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.640" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">values first and in what order because</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:31.440" style="s2">whichever one we&#39;re maximizing for</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.880" style="s2">like there&#39;s if we have the same value</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.440" end="00:20:34.559" style="s2">we know which one&#39;s first and second and</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.880" end="00:20:36.159" style="s2">third it&#39;s a lot easier to rank that</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.559" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">at the same time then we&#39;re getting into</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.159" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">utopian territory</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:41.280" style="s2">of our maximizing for the top one or two</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:44.159" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.280" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">as opposed to we actually can have</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.159" end="00:20:49.360" style="s2">different values</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:51.280" style="s2">maximize for different ones and because</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.360" end="00:20:53.520" style="s2">we are holding strong in that right</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.280" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">jubilee stands for trustworthiness</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.520" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">and and whatever those other fun and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:20:59.280" style="s2">diversity</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.320" style="s2">and maybe adult stands for justice and</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.280" end="00:21:03.039" style="s2">you know like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.320" end="00:21:04.559" style="s2">that we have those different values but</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.039" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be conflict</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.559" end="00:21:09.520" style="s2">in not having like arrange them</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:11.120" style="s2">ourselves even right and not knowing</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.520" end="00:21:13.919" style="s2">what our conflicts are in value</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.120" end="00:21:15.200" style="s2">our values are in conflict right i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.919" end="00:21:17.120" style="s2">there&#39;s also like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.200" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">there&#39;s things that we like that we want</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.120" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">to have happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">like for it to be fun but i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">that that&#39;s a value and like things like</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">transparency</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:27.679" style="s2">you need to be transparent but i think</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">you you sort of need to be transparent</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.679" end="00:21:29.760" style="s2">all like</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:31.520" style="s2">that touches all the aspects so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.760" end="00:21:32.159" style="s2">an avenue of how you can show that</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.520" end="00:21:35.440" style="s2">you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.159" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">your your values but to me the values</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.440" end="00:21:37.919" style="s2">are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:39.840" style="s2">the things that as you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.919" end="00:21:41.919" style="s2">improve the world you know just itself</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.840" end="00:21:43.360" style="s2">and for people and all those things</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.919" end="00:21:44.880" style="s2">and trying to make sure that you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.360" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">enough profit to keep the lights on and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.880" end="00:21:49.039" style="s2">you have some options</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.679" end="00:21:50.640" style="s2">they&#39;re in that order for a reason</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.039" end="00:21:51.679" style="s2">values are always number one so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.640" end="00:21:54.720" style="s2">something that like</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.679" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">you know omni win is i think and obvious</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.720" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">one i think we&#39;re all on</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:59.280" style="s2">the same page where it&#39;s okay so</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">everything that we do has to be as omni</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.280" end="00:22:02.159" style="s2">when as possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">yeah but then again there&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.159" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">what i mean omni win for who for</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">trade-offs for there&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:09.039" style="s2">always be i think there is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">about saying that each individual</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.039" end="00:22:12.880" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.559" end="00:22:14.240" style="s2">has its own values that are transparent</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.880" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">and they&#39;re transparent in which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.240" end="00:22:16.960" style="s2">their first their second and their third</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:17.440" style="s2">because they have to be even if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.960" end="00:22:19.120" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.440" end="00:22:20.559" style="s2">fully living that out in the world right</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.120" end="00:22:22.000" style="s2">we&#39;re going to try to have have</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.559" end="00:22:23.760" style="s2">transparency is number one we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.000" end="00:22:25.520" style="s2">to try to do this</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.760" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">and as long as that&#39;s open and</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.520" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">transparent then people can chew</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:32.960" style="s2">then there isn&#39;t an overarching</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:34.880" style="s2">we need our value together text values</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.960" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">to be as open as possible</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.880" end="00:22:39.280" style="s2">so that those projects can be as as</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.799" style="s2">different as possible and see which ones</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.280" end="00:22:43.039" style="s2">play out where do people want to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.799" end="00:22:44.880" style="s2">where what works what it&#39;s like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.039" end="00:22:45.919" style="s2">all the transparency ones flopped for</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">whatever reason even</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.919" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">though we really held that as a high</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">value why</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">why is that that the case and be able to</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:53.919" style="s2">play in that</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">so we could leave it it&#39;s just values</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.919" end="00:22:57.120" style="s2">are number one without necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">seeing what those values are</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.120" end="00:23:00.480" style="s2">omni-win being the number one one but</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:02.240" style="s2">even that is going to come up against</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.480" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">conflict</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.240" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">and trump to me that&#39;s right where</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">improvement</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">comes in because it can be hard to get</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:11.840" style="s2">stuck in the perfection thing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">i&#39;m always about progress over</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.840" end="00:23:16.080" style="s2">perfection that was kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:18.400" style="s2">improvement was about it&#39;s like trying</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.080" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">to take steps we can&#39;t get it perfect</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.400" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s better than what it is now cool</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:24.640" style="s2">if it&#39;s better like in the you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:27.039" style="s2">it aligns with our values it might not</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.640" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">be perfect but it it&#39;s moving our values</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.039" end="00:23:29.760" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:31.679" style="s2">that&#39;s the most important thing like</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.760" end="00:23:33.440" style="s2">when we&#39;re actually taking action</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:34.880" style="s2">and i think you&#39;re right that projects</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.440" end="00:23:38.000" style="s2">will have their own</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.880" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">their own values right like if if</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.000" end="00:23:41.600" style="s2">wikilection and reason score right have</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.360" style="s2">something around sense making</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.600" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">well odds are together tech probably</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.360" end="00:23:47.440" style="s2">won&#39;t have that it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.960" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">it will support projects that might have</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.440" end="00:23:50.640" style="s2">varying</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">levels i think part of what the values</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.640" end="00:23:54.799" style="s2">need to do is</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">identify who we don&#39;t work with like</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.799" end="00:23:58.080" style="s2">what are</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:59.919" style="s2">the the the things where we say hey this</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.080" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">project sounds interesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.919" end="00:24:03.440" style="s2">but you know or possibly it&#39;s profitable</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.520" style="s2">and it will help us keep keep lights on</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.440" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">but we aren&#39;t interested in working with</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.520" end="00:24:09.039" style="s2">them because</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">you know they make their money through</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">this way and that violates our values so</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">no we can&#39;t work together</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.240" end="00:24:17.120" style="s2">and that is i think one of the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">challenges of figuring out where</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.120" end="00:24:23.600" style="s2">projects differ from</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.840" end="00:24:26.080" style="s2">together tech i think in the long run</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.600" end="00:24:28.159" style="s2">if we&#39;re if we&#39;re talking about the so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.080" end="00:24:29.760" style="s2">we have the two projects one is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.159" end="00:24:31.520" style="s2">kind of i guess we&#39;ll call the funding</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.760" end="00:24:32.000" style="s2">project maybe or something that project</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.520" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">that&#39;s used</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.000" end="00:24:35.600" style="s2">to fund other projects to do game a to</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:38.880" style="s2">fund game b</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.600" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">that one i think you might have profit</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.880" end="00:24:41.919" style="s2">as a value</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.000" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">if it&#39;s the understanding that profit</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.919" end="00:24:47.760" style="s2">means the funds that you send</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:48.640" style="s2">to together tech but together tech</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.760" end="00:24:51.919" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.640" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think profit should be a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.919" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.080" end="00:25:02.880" style="s2">because all funds should be reinvested</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.240" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s what i like i fully</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:07.520" style="s2">admit that profit is not the ideal world</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:08.880" style="s2">the ideal word there the the end goal is</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.520" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">though that i think it needs to behave</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.880" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">like a profit-seeking company in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.760" style="s2">of ways</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">so that it has extra money that i can</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.760" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">throw around</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">because in the end i would like it to</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">kind of be a co-op</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:21.520" style="s2">venture capital fund where we can say</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">instead of just hey</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.520" end="00:25:25.120" style="s2">wiki election reason score i&#39;ll throw</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">you know a little bit of money you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.120" end="00:25:29.760" style="s2">you you&#39;re away for funding</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">if there&#39;s actually enough money you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.760" end="00:25:32.720" style="s2">know for example during</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:34.480" style="s2">the pandemic when some businesses are</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.720" end="00:25:36.080" style="s2">going under we can say hey</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.480" end="00:25:38.320" style="s2">these ones sound interesting they align</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.080" end="00:25:39.600" style="s2">with our values and they can help us you</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.320" end="00:25:42.640" style="s2">know fund future projects</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:45.679" style="s2">let&#39;s buy those companies so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.640" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">let&#39;s for now change it it&#39;s a perfect</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.679" end="00:25:49.679" style="s2">word but let&#39;s use revenue</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:51.440" style="s2">because nothing you&#39;ve said is profit</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.679" end="00:25:53.919" style="s2">it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.440" end="00:25:55.039" style="s2">i just that by the definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.919" end="00:25:58.000" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.039" end="00:26:00.400" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think people use the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.000" end="00:26:04.080" style="s2">definition the same way you have</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.400" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">um and to be clear we&#39;re doing this this</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.080" end="00:26:07.760" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing is for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:09.360" style="s2">not for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.760" end="00:26:11.039" style="s2">the profit driven ones but it&#39;s good to</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.360" end="00:26:12.480" style="s2">keep bringing them in here and our own</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.039" end="00:26:14.320" style="s2">individual projects to see that</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.480" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">different umbrella right that that</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.320" end="00:26:17.840" style="s2">that&#39;s part of having the value</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">structure it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.840" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">profitability in that is the whole point</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:22.559" style="s2">of your that purpose right that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:23.679" style="s2">you guys are kind of not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.559" end="00:26:27.039" style="s2">concentrating on</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:28.720" style="s2">your real your real projects in order to</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.039" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">put some time and energy towards that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.720" end="00:26:31.679" style="s2">one so it&#39;s profitable in your own lives</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.679" end="00:26:35.840" style="s2">possibly for together tech that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:37.679" style="s2">different but it&#39;s transparent</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.840" end="00:26:38.880" style="s2">i mean it&#39;s like that&#39;s the purpose of</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.679" end="00:26:41.200" style="s2">this project</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.880" end="00:26:41.919" style="s2">is to do that when there&#39;s projects in</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.200" end="00:26:43.279" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.919" end="00:26:45.039" style="s2">that have like hey we&#39;re not making</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.279" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">enough money but this one is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.039" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">a profit driven one it&#39;s going to drive</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.400" style="s2">profit for the rest of them</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:53.039" style="s2">and having it be possibly insulated in</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.400" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">that way so it is trying to make profit</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.039" end="00:26:57.279" style="s2">for the rest of it but it&#39;s also being</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:58.559" style="s2">fed with like we all still own it we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.279" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">still part of it and so we&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.559" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:04.799" style="s2">uber profitable when it causes a</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">problem for the community right okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.799" end="00:27:07.440" style="s2">well now we can&#39;t afford it</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">your guys is what you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.440" end="00:27:10.559" style="s2">different because it&#39;s not for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">community it&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.559" end="00:27:13.039" style="s2">the outside</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:22.640" style="s2">yeah so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:26.640" style="s2">uh yeah just separate them what would</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.360" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">you say kind of did you say an</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.640" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">accelerator</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:31.760" style="s2">um incubator</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.600" end="00:27:35.919" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:40.559" style="s2">great accelerate</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:44.799" style="s2">i&#39;m just want to write that down before</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:46.640" style="s2">i forgot yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.799" end="00:27:48.000" style="s2">i think in a lot of ways that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.640" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">the role that together tech is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.000" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">play is as</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:52.640" style="s2">an incubator for kind of all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:54.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.640" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">yeah i guess the funding project is</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.960" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">still just to get the funding</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:03.840" style="s2">and but the the yeah the um</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.960" end="00:28:09.279" style="s2">yeah you&#39;re right so we just have one</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.480" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">goal</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.279" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">to provide funding for game v project i</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:16.080" style="s2">mean there might be some other things</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">do without without ruining the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.080" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:20.640" style="s2">how do you say harmlessly provide</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.919" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">so we are not going to ever have like</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.840" end="00:28:28.840" style="s2">piracy division</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:31.520" style="s2">in together a water division</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.840" end="00:28:32.960" style="s2">piracy piracy division pirates are</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.520" end="00:28:36.000" style="s2">pretty cool i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.960" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">what parents are like ah although um all</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.000" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">things considered they do</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">some harm to the you know world</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">well yeah so i there i i would not rule</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">out the chance that there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.840" end="00:28:52.480" style="s2">forms of piracy that is an omni win</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:53.760" style="s2">but in general yeah and i think omni win</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.480" end="00:28:55.679" style="s2">is always going to be a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.760" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">misnomer because like there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.679" end="00:28:59.039" style="s2">actively like</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:29:00.480" style="s2">their goal is to be above others they</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.039" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to win as a part of omni</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.480" end="00:29:04.559" style="s2">win</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.200" style="s2">well yes well they will be hurt by it</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.559" end="00:29:06.880" style="s2">you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.200" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">say that that&#39;s giving them an</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.880" end="00:29:11.200" style="s2">opportunity for mental growth</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.120" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">emotional growth or unless you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.200" end="00:29:14.880" style="s2">benefiting them they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:15.840" style="s2">being benefited in the group of everyone</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.880" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">they just don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.840" end="00:29:18.880" style="s2">benefited in the group of like person</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:20.320" style="s2">who thinks they&#39;re better and should be</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.880" end="00:29:21.760" style="s2">doing better off and have you know a</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.320" end="00:29:24.240" style="s2">thousand times more well</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.760" end="00:29:26.000" style="s2">like yeah well i mean yeah if they if</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.240" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">they come to an emotional breakdown and</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.000" end="00:29:28.000" style="s2">realize that wealth was not a good goal</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:31.120" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.000" end="00:29:34.159" style="s2">then they benefited but yeah uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.120" end="00:29:35.520" style="s2">yeah we we won&#39;t unfortunately full omni</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.159" end="00:29:38.480" style="s2">win is not</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.520" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">is probably not an achievable goal but</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.480" end="00:29:43.440" style="s2">as much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:46.240" style="s2">cool yeah i think the a big part of this</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.440" end="00:29:46.720" style="s2">is figuring out what together tech</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.240" end="00:29:49.919" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.720" end="00:29:51.840" style="s2">is because that&#39;s a big part of like</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.919" end="00:29:53.120" style="s2">the marketing for these different</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.840" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">profitable like</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.120" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">funding projects a part of how they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:58.320" style="s2">be marketed</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:00.159" style="s2">is hey x percent of our profit goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.320" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">towards this</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.159" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">thing um</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:06.080" style="s2">which you know may or may not end up</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:08.159" style="s2">being important but like it is an</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.080" end="00:30:09.600" style="s2">important aspect of the project that</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.159" end="00:30:11.279" style="s2">would probably be at you know at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.600" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">very least get a prominent spot on the</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.279" end="00:30:13.600" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.000" end="00:30:16.000" style="s2">not necessarily be in all of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.600" end="00:30:19.120" style="s2">marketing materials but like</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.000" end="00:30:23.760" style="s2">that would be one of the unique aspects</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.120" end="00:30:25.840" style="s2">and i think like if the</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:27.679" style="s2">like you know the cooperative enterprise</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.840" end="00:30:29.520" style="s2">takes off you might end up with other</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.679" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">projects wanting to do similar things</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.520" end="00:30:31.679" style="s2">where you know it might not be the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">percentage</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.679" end="00:30:35.360" style="s2">but honestly if a for-profit project</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:36.000" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t harmful wanted to give us 10</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.360" end="00:30:39.039" style="s2">percent of their</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.000" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">profit cool still money still going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.039" end="00:30:41.919" style="s2">help if we had you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.720" end="00:30:46.320" style="s2">more of them and then i think that in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.240" end="00:30:47.840" style="s2">the end together tech ends up providing</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.320" end="00:30:49.760" style="s2">a list of hey here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.840" end="00:30:51.279" style="s2">the projects that we&#39;re either working</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.760" end="00:30:52.960" style="s2">with as you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.279" end="00:30:54.320" style="s2">we own them or we&#39;re just working</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.960" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">together or</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.320" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">they&#39;re actually helping fund us they</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">don&#39;t own us</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">but they&#39;re helping to you know fund</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:03.679" style="s2">some money and here&#39;s the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:04.880" style="s2">profit that they&#39;re giving that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.679" end="00:31:06.960" style="s2">thing to sort of say</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.880" end="00:31:08.240" style="s2">like to offer just a basic list on</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.960" end="00:31:09.519" style="s2">here&#39;s the companies that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.240" end="00:31:11.120" style="s2">wanting to support us</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.519" end="00:31:13.279" style="s2">you can support them and that does help</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.120" end="00:31:14.960" style="s2">us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.279" end="00:31:17.039" style="s2">i wonder if now would be a good time for</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">us to kind of narrow down and</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.039" end="00:31:20.080" style="s2">choose a vision because we could get</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">bogged down in the mission</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.080" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">um right totally um</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">uh so</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:33.279" style="s2">i like this concept but i don&#39;t like the</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.679" end="00:31:35.279" style="s2">way it&#39;s sorted the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.279" end="00:31:37.200" style="s2">a world where 99 percent of people</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.279" end="00:31:40.399" style="s2">because vision statements</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:40.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t intended to be kind of numerical</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:43.600" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.960" end="00:31:44.240" style="s2">yeah i feel like that&#39;s maybe a mission</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.600" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.240" end="00:31:48.480" style="s2">one of the missions is to provide a</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">quality of life score above 90</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.480" end="00:31:53.360" style="s2">to 99.99 of people yeah i mean the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">only real difference between the mission</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">and vision is</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:32:00.399" style="s2">whether it&#39;s past tense or future times</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:03.440" style="s2">um yeah so we could but</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.399" end="00:32:06.000" style="s2">but i but i like the idea and</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.440" end="00:32:07.679" style="s2">um i i was thinking about a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.000" end="00:32:10.720" style="s2">post-scarcity world</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.679" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">is good and short i&#39;m just wondering</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.720" end="00:32:15.840" style="s2">does post-scarcity um</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">say what we want to accomplish</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.760" end="00:32:23.760" style="s2">like i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible but</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.679" style="s2">let&#39;s say we had a post-scarcity world</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.760" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">where people were still unhappy for</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.679" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">another reason right would that be</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:34.320" style="s2">something we&#39;d want</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:35.679" style="s2">like people will always be unhappy about</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.320" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">some reason or another</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.679" end="00:32:39.360" style="s2">and some people are going to be unhappy</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.360" end="00:32:45.200" style="s2">not having the original of mona lisa</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">let me let me be clear a majority of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.200" end="00:32:48.880" style="s2">people are majority of the time</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:52.000" style="s2">unhappy which probably isn&#39;t even today</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.880" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">so i&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.000" end="00:32:56.799" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t take i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:58.799" style="s2">that statement takes into account</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.799" end="00:33:01.039" style="s2">i mean what&#39;s it matter having post</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.799" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">scarcity if everyone is miserable every</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.039" end="00:33:05.279" style="s2">minute of every day</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:05.919" style="s2">right which may not be possible because</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.279" end="00:33:08.640" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.919" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">your mindset is post-scarcity as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.640" end="00:33:13.120" style="s2">but i&#39;m just saying that</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:14.080" style="s2">scarcity still seems it&#39;s a it&#39;s a means</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.120" end="00:33:16.880" style="s2">to an end</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.080" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">what&#39;s the end as opposed to the means</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.880" end="00:33:22.159" style="s2">unless it is an</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:26.080" style="s2">end are you wrong uh and i don&#39;t have it</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.159" end="00:33:29.039" style="s2">with me right now or maybe i will um</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.080" end="00:33:30.640" style="s2">something along the lines of uh postcard</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.039" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">post scarcity uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.640" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">meaning exactly uh that people do not</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:37.600" style="s2">have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">worry about basic necessities like food</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.600" end="00:33:41.360" style="s2">water</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:44.240" style="s2">shelter and the basic stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.360" end="00:33:45.279" style="s2">and that way what it&#39;s going to cause is</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.240" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.279" end="00:33:50.640" style="s2">release uh the time energy and</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">creativity of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.640" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">no longer have to spend like</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">eight hours a day uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:04.000" style="s2">working to just get the basics</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:05.600" style="s2">like food and shelter i guess it depends</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.000" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">on what you include in basics</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.600" end="00:34:08.960" style="s2">because if you include</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.520" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">yeah i guess i could still see a world</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.359" end="00:34:17.040" style="s2">where you could include the basics but</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:18.639" style="s2">it&#39;d still be a pretty crappy world</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.040" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">another so i&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.639" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">vision we want</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:26.240" style="s2">i think yeah i think getting into</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">post-scarcity also has the same issue</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.240" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">that like anti-rivalrous</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">and anti whatever the other one is right</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:33.520" style="s2">brazil</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:35.440" style="s2">like that it&#39;s against something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.520" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">like scarcity and then we got past it as</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.440" end="00:34:40.240" style="s2">opposed to</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:42.159" style="s2">there&#39;s a a big quality of post scarcity</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.240" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">that we can be living now in fact we are</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.159" end="00:34:43.839" style="s2">living it with these meetings right</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:45.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.839" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">is already omni win because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.760" end="00:34:50.000" style="s2">right if you succeed as much as it might</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:52.320" style="s2">feel like that costs me something it</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.000" end="00:34:55.040" style="s2">doesn&#39;t actually cost me something</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.320" end="00:34:55.760" style="s2">it&#39;s benefiting me and so we&#39;re already</p>

<p begin="00:34:55.760" end="00:34:58.800" style="s2">post-scarcity mindset within a scarce</p>

<p begin="00:34:58.800" end="00:35:04.800" style="s2">that there is something</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.839" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">right what we&#39;re looking for is that um</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.800" end="00:35:06.720" style="s2">and i</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.359" end="00:35:08.720" style="s2">forget what the word is bentley you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.720" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">used it before of like</p>

<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">uh like it&#39;s not happiness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.119" end="00:35:18.480" style="s2">something else satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:20.400" style="s2">satisfaction like that people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.480" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">satisfied with their life</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.400" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">and not in a way that we can gain not in</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:25.119" style="s2">a way where it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:26.400" style="s2">oh we&#39;re just gonna add five points to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.119" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">that because we want our numbers to go</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.400" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">up this year right</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.760" style="s2">like in a way that it&#39;s like no are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">more satisfied than last year</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.760" end="00:35:35.440" style="s2">what would make you even more satisfied</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.640" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine like my utopian vision</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.440" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">of a world</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.640" end="00:35:39.119" style="s2">we live it now i&#39;m like well i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:41.359" style="s2">even know what to look like in a year</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.119" end="00:35:43.119" style="s2">how would i be more satisfied than this</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.359" end="00:35:44.480" style="s2">whereas post-scarcity isn&#39;t because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.119" end="00:35:47.760" style="s2">like you get there and then you</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.480" end="00:35:50.480" style="s2">arrived as opposed to we can live it now</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.760" end="00:35:52.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s always improving and</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.480" end="00:35:54.240" style="s2">satisfaction is kind of that thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.640" end="00:35:55.839" style="s2">you can&#39;t be satisfied if your life</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.240" end="00:35:58.880" style="s2">isn&#39;t like at least a little bit getting</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.839" end="00:36:00.960" style="s2">better or you&#39;re getting more</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.880" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">deeperly satisfied with what you do have</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.960" end="00:36:05.680" style="s2">but it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:06.400" style="s2">personal thing so even shorter way of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.680" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">saying this</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.400" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">though it&#39;s also more vague</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:17.119" style="s2">is replacing motivation of the people</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:20.160" style="s2">uh from currently in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.119" end="00:36:23.200" style="s2">world of scarcity it&#39;s fear mostly</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.160" end="00:36:26.720" style="s2">uh fear and oppression and violence</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.200" end="00:36:30.160" style="s2">built within this uh the system we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.720" end="00:36:32.480" style="s2">so replacing fear with for the lack of</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.160" end="00:36:33.200" style="s2">better no actually that&#39;s the best word</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.480" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.200" end="00:36:40.480" style="s2">fear with love love is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">signifies openness and um doing stuff</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.480" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:46.720" style="s2">and um not being</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.960" end="00:36:51.119" style="s2">forced to do stuff just the you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">opposition</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.119" end="00:36:55.440" style="s2">the current system is sphere based and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">the system you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.440" end="00:36:59.920" style="s2">uh is love based basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.440" end="00:37:04.800" style="s2">i love it because it is so simple and</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.040" end="00:37:06.640" style="s2">yet we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.800" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">erase it all we&#39;ll just put love for our</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.640" end="00:37:11.599" style="s2">vision and it&#39;s like so true</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:13.280" style="s2">and also been co-opted so much that it</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.599" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work then when you try to define</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.280" end="00:37:17.040" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">and you know make the details</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.040" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">uh more explicit that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.079" style="s2">difficult</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:24.800" style="s2">but still post scarcity means you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.079" end="00:37:26.400" style="s2">have to fear</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.800" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">that next day you are not going to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.400" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">a shelter over your head because uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:35.200" style="s2">a bank will take it or you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">food because you don&#39;t earn enough or</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.200" end="00:37:37.839" style="s2">stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:45.839" style="s2">yeah i like that i like where it&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.240" end="00:37:47.359" style="s2">um and these things don&#39;t have to change</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.839" end="00:37:48.839" style="s2">but just to note a few things we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.359" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">still talking about what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.839" end="00:37:53.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t and then i have a concern with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:55.359" style="s2">word love because i don&#39;t think if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.520" end="00:37:58.000" style="s2">talk to the average person on the street</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.359" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">they would say that love is open</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.000" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">um just because it&#39;s understood never</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">used words</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:06.320" style="s2">yeah i think confusing i think we also</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">might be trying to like encompass</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.320" end="00:38:10.160" style="s2">everything whereas i think a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:11.760" style="s2">problems will actually be solved</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.160" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">will be solved by the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.760" end="00:38:15.440" style="s2">projects and really we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:16.640" style="s2">empower projects to be able to make the</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.440" end="00:38:17.920" style="s2">meaningful changes in the world that</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.640" end="00:38:20.079" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to so yeah we could go</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.920" end="00:38:23.119" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.079" end="00:38:24.560" style="s2">this item two where the this things is</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.119" end="00:38:25.680" style="s2">just to make sure that the omni win</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.560" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.680" end="00:38:29.839" style="s2">and we could not use omni-win but</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:32.640" style="s2">whatever these projects are</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.839" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">are happening and that&#39;s the vision and</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.640" end="00:38:35.760" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:36.720" style="s2">that we actually achieve the game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.760" end="00:38:38.160" style="s2">the one that i like</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.720" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">the most because i think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.160" end="00:38:41.280" style="s2">that&#39;s the truest to what together tech</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:42.960" style="s2">is trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.280" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">and then like if together tech you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.960" end="00:38:48.720" style="s2">helps enable wikilection and</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:49.440" style="s2">and reason score and um we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.720" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">the name of</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.440" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">matushes uh hyperlocals</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">thank you and all these other projects</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:38:58.160" style="s2">they&#39;ll each have their own vision and</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:00.160" style="s2">their own mission</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.160" end="00:39:02.000" style="s2">that i think you know will hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.160" end="00:39:04.079" style="s2">help enable a post-scarce</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.000" end="00:39:05.520" style="s2">scarcity world and increase satisfaction</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.079" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">all these things but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.520" end="00:39:08.640" style="s2">up to those all that that we&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">doing is helping</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.640" end="00:39:12.960" style="s2">align all those projects to be like we</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:14.560" style="s2">want you to succeed or fail based on</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.960" end="00:39:15.839" style="s2">your project itself and not because the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.560" end="00:39:17.680" style="s2">world isn&#39;t set up</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.839" end="00:39:20.000" style="s2">for your kind of a not-for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.680" end="00:39:21.200" style="s2">omni-win you know community-based</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.000" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.200" end="00:39:25.440" style="s2">yeah i like it because it also like what</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">we said about values earlier right like</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.440" end="00:39:29.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like your</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:31.040" style="s2">individual project can pass can fail can</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.280" end="00:39:32.240" style="s2">try new things can have fun can be a</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.040" end="00:39:33.680" style="s2">fascist or</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.240" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">maybe not fascist but you know like you</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.680" end="00:39:37.680" style="s2">could you can play within that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">and but together tech is here to have</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.680" end="00:39:41.599" style="s2">the arena here to do</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:43.280" style="s2">the the coordination between the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.599" end="00:39:44.800" style="s2">projects and then yes we might figure</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.280" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">out a way to also create them ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.800" end="00:39:46.960" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:51.119" style="s2">you just adding to this we just said we</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.599" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">can take everything else away</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.119" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">i&#39;m just re i&#39;m just rephrasing it uh</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.480" end="00:40:06.079" style="s2">yeah i i think that&#39;s good the um</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.800" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">the problem is that we&#39;re we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.079" end="00:40:10.800" style="s2">mentioning omni one in here</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.839" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">or yeah things like omni win game b i</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.800" end="00:40:13.920" style="s2">think that&#39;s the sticking point i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">the second one is the closest but</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.920" end="00:40:16.160" style="s2">there&#39;s that key</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:18.079" style="s2">thing that we still have to define</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.160" end="00:40:18.720" style="s2">whether it&#39;s game b or omni win or you</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.079" end="00:40:21.599" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.720" end="00:40:24.319" style="s2">world changing or whatever phrase we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.599" end="00:40:25.680" style="s2">i think that&#39;s really the because then</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.319" end="00:40:27.680" style="s2">we&#39;ll put love in there which was our</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.680" end="00:40:31.440" style="s2">other problem</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.680" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">um which might be the solution but also</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.440" end="00:40:34.560" style="s2">the interesting thing about using game b</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">rather than the other terms is it</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.560" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">is still very nebulous and we could use</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">it as a placeholder and replace it later</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:42.240" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.040" end="00:40:46.160" style="s2">yeah i like it because it also it kind</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.560" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">of encompasses exactly what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.160" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">like if you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:53.599" style="s2">12 values that an ideal organization has</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:55.359" style="s2">but you have 10 of those values or you</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.599" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">have three of those values really really</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.359" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">strongly that&#39;s more game b than what we</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:40:59.760" style="s2">got going on</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.520" style="s2">and so it&#39;s more omni-win and it&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.760" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">in that direction and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.520" end="00:41:04.880" style="s2">so i wonder if then the vision just</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:06.000" style="s2">mentions the values like if it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.880" end="00:41:09.200" style="s2">you know to help support</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.000" end="00:41:10.720" style="s2">projects that move the you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.200" end="00:41:12.800" style="s2">together tech values forward in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.720" end="00:41:15.760" style="s2">meaningful way or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:17.280" style="s2">like that and then as we hash out the</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.760" end="00:41:19.119" style="s2">list of values because that&#39;s really i</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.280" end="00:41:20.079" style="s2">think what it&#39;s all about if omni 1 ends</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.119" end="00:41:21.680" style="s2">up being a value</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.079" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">cool then that&#39;s one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.680" end="00:41:24.800" style="s2">we&#39;re always trying to improve</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.880" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">there&#39;s i and if the evolve is using</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.000" end="00:41:32.079" style="s2">can be just because it&#39;s a nebulous and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">like hotly contested</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.079" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">and i don&#39;t even want that to be a part</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">of the conversation we&#39;re trying to have</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:40.160" style="s2">like our own</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">version of what we think game b might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.160" end="00:41:43.760" style="s2">but knowing that like</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:45.119" style="s2">people in game b won&#39;t like that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.760" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">using that label because well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.119" end="00:41:47.839" style="s2">omni-win but it&#39;s not this particular</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">kind of omni one that was in this</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.839" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.200" end="00:41:55.359" style="s2">how if we just say blank that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.079" end="00:41:57.440" style="s2">the most honest thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.359" end="00:41:58.720" style="s2">that we can do right now which is what</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.440" end="00:42:02.319" style="s2">game b stands for</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.720" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">so there is like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.319" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">it is exactly that as long as we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.040" style="s2">saying our version is the one and only</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.040" end="00:42:11.920" style="s2">it is game b it&#39;s like game b projects</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">omni wind having the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.920" end="00:42:15.760" style="s2">project aligned with our values</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.319" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">that way we don&#39;t have to define what it</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.160" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:31.280" style="s2">we&#39;ll put b ish blank flash game b</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:31.839" style="s2">and we could find this later are we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.280" end="00:42:35.200" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.839" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">good with this um</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.200" end="00:42:39.359" style="s2">i mean i kind of like the last half of</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">yours where it&#39;s more specific</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.359" end="00:42:43.040" style="s2">whereas like we&#39;re able to benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:44.800" style="s2">and contribute to a comment of tools</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.040" end="00:42:46.720" style="s2">knowledge measuring and</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.800" end="00:42:48.560" style="s2">and and funding because i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.720" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">pretty encompassing</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.560" end="00:42:53.040" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s enough that it&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">longer than you want a vision statement</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.040" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">is it right but if we have that in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.280" end="00:42:59.359" style="s2">mission i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.400" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">yeah i mean i i like that i think it</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.720" end="00:43:06.400" style="s2">still needs some</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:08.880" style="s2">finagling but overall that&#39;s by far the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.400" end="00:43:11.280" style="s2">closest that we&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.880" end="00:43:14.400" style="s2">what do you think my douche is it too</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:17.760" style="s2">far away from your vision</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.400" end="00:43:22.319" style="s2">no it&#39;s it&#39;s fine i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.760" end="00:43:25.359" style="s2">um it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.319" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">i was just thinking about it uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.359" end="00:43:27.839" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.720" end="00:43:34.240" style="s2">and uh no people in game b</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.760" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">won&#39;t object to us uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.240" end="00:43:38.000" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">using this uh too much because after all</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.000" end="00:43:42.960" style="s2">we are game b</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:44.800" style="s2">as well so we are two grain b people</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.960" end="00:43:46.400" style="s2">my only concern is that we&#39;re because</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.800" end="00:43:48.319" style="s2">we&#39;re actually trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.400" end="00:43:49.520" style="s2">have you know effectively an</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.319" end="00:43:51.119" style="s2">organization</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.520" end="00:43:53.040" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna kind of having to start</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.119" end="00:43:54.720" style="s2">almost you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.040" end="00:43:56.640" style="s2">carving things in stone not actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.720" end="00:43:58.160" style="s2">stone but like actually putting pen to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.640" end="00:43:59.440" style="s2">paper and saying these are the values</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.160" end="00:44:02.079" style="s2">that we&#39;re going to operate</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.440" end="00:44:03.599" style="s2">and just as soon as you connect these</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.079" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">values to game b</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.599" end="00:44:06.960" style="s2">in my experience there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:08.480" style="s2">disagreement on like oh well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.960" end="00:44:09.119" style="s2">game d well that&#39;s kind of game b but</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.480" end="00:44:12.160" style="s2">not game b</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.119" end="00:44:14.240" style="s2">enough that&#39;s what uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.160" end="00:44:15.920" style="s2">beauty of it all though is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.240" end="00:44:17.599" style="s2">nebulous and that you can&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.920" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">pin it down and yet other people are</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.599" end="00:44:22.160" style="s2">like that&#39;s not game b this is game b</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">is the beauty of it the only thing you</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.160" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">need to be indoctrinated into</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:26.960" style="s2">the only thing jubilee not to to</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">adriel&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.960" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">although i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:33.839" style="s2">stopping point at this point is that</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:36.079" style="s2">once we start we&#39;re gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.839" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">solidify it some um</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.079" end="00:44:43.280" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s when the game be um</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">yeah no no i i i i i think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.280" end="00:44:48.839" style="s2">you can&#39;t say that&#39;s what it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:50.800" style="s2">it gave me is like omni-win infinite</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.839" end="00:44:54.480" style="s2">game</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.800" end="00:44:56.480" style="s2">and so if it&#39;s if it&#39;s more omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.480" end="00:44:58.319" style="s2">and more infinite so therefore it uses</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.480" end="00:45:00.319" style="s2">the resources more in alignment with</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.319" end="00:45:02.240" style="s2">what nature does and more people win</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.319" end="00:45:03.040" style="s2">from it then it&#39;s closer to game b than</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.240" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">game a</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.040" end="00:45:07.680" style="s2">but is it easier to say game b or to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:09.119" style="s2">omni win and infinite</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.680" end="00:45:10.640" style="s2">and are those the things because just</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.119" end="00:45:11.920" style="s2">like with the values we might agree that</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.640" end="00:45:14.000" style="s2">values are important</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.920" end="00:45:15.200" style="s2">but not which value is the highest</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:16.240" style="s2">that&#39;s this the</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.200" end="00:45:18.960" style="s2">everyone has a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.240" end="00:45:20.400" style="s2">version of game b is game b</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.960" end="00:45:22.160" style="s2">like it&#39;s like right we don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.400" end="00:45:23.920" style="s2">have one foundational these are all the</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.680" style="s2">values and they&#39;re in this order</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.920" end="00:45:27.680" style="s2">it&#39;s about everyone having a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.680" end="00:45:30.720" style="s2">beautiful future that is omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">my omni win play my game my way please</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.720" end="00:45:34.240" style="s2">if we&#39;re talking about values i wonder</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">if we just kind of switch the order and</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.240" end="00:45:36.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:38.560" style="s2">a world where abundant resources are</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.560" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">available to projects that align with</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.560" end="00:45:41.200" style="s2">our values</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.440" end="00:45:47.119" style="s2">because like this all whether it&#39;s game</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.680" end="00:45:48.720" style="s2">b or omni winner this</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.119" end="00:45:50.800" style="s2">we need to define that list of values</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.720" end="00:45:53.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s what everything is based on</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.800" end="00:45:54.800" style="s2">like that sort of whether it&#39;s game b or</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.200" end="00:45:56.880" style="s2">not and whether or not some people agree</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.800" end="00:45:59.280" style="s2">if that&#39;s game b or not or or game b</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.880" end="00:46:01.200" style="s2">enough like all that we&#39;re really saying</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.280" end="00:46:04.000" style="s2">is that this is our take on like</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.200" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">here&#39;s what game b could be we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.000" end="00:46:06.800" style="s2">saying it is</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:08.319" style="s2">because you know we yeah there&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.800" end="00:46:09.040" style="s2">a possibility that we&#39;re wrong and that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.319" end="00:46:11.599" style="s2">omni when</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.040" end="00:46:12.560" style="s2">we have a slight a slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.599" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">version of it</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.560" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">in the end that we&#39;re always like what</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">this group decides on the values are</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:20.319" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s going to drive everything</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.560" end="00:46:23.839" style="s2">at some point i&#39;m going to propose not</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.160" end="00:46:27.200" style="s2">using game v but rather</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.839" end="00:46:30.960" style="s2">more uh super set of game b is</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.200" end="00:46:32.960" style="s2">non-game a and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.960" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">they&#39;re not going to they can&#39;t object</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.960" end="00:46:36.640" style="s2">to that right</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">well yeah the the only problem is then</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.640" end="00:46:38.800" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re also defining by what it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.800" end="00:46:44.000" style="s2">but that&#39;s not that&#39;s a small knit um</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.480" end="00:46:49.760" style="s2">so if we&#39;re trying like the the wording</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.319" end="00:46:51.680" style="s2">that i think might make sense is</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.760" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">a world where abundant resources are</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.680" end="00:46:55.920" style="s2">available oh that&#39;s what you said</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">two projects and then we can decide how</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.920" end="00:46:58.640" style="s2">to word it there but i think it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:00.560" style="s2">two projects that align with</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.640" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">together tech values or our values or</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.560" end="00:47:03.359" style="s2">however you want to phrase it</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:07.280" style="s2">but to be serious omni-winners for me is</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.040" end="00:47:10.640" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.280" end="00:47:12.880" style="s2">the best description same here if i had</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.640" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">to pick a term i&#39;d pick on me one</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.880" end="00:47:17.119" style="s2">but i i do sort of like keeping it</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">somewhat open so that</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.119" end="00:47:20.160" style="s2">the value list that we can just tweak</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:21.200" style="s2">that as we go and i think the omni one</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.160" end="00:47:23.119" style="s2">is going to be</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.200" end="00:47:24.559" style="s2">quite possibly the number one value or</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.119" end="00:47:27.440" style="s2">at least you know highly</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.559" end="00:47:28.960" style="s2">rep represented with whatever words end</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.440" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">up being used</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.960" end="00:47:31.200" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.119" end="00:47:39.760" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s use that</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">sure i&#39;m comfortable with that um we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.760" end="00:47:43.839" style="s2">just italicize it to say</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.319" end="00:47:47.839" style="s2">and by the way actually the link the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:49.359" style="s2">definition we</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.839" end="00:47:51.520" style="s2">we really have to have a talk about</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.359" end="00:47:55.200" style="s2">terminology at some point in this</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.520" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">group the definition for omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.200" end="00:47:58.400" style="s2">is not useful</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.280" end="00:48:04.839" style="s2">or at least the one the one on the game</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.119" end="00:48:08.960" style="s2">b library</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.839" end="00:48:10.720" style="s2">um or anything i&#39;ve ever heard anyone</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.960" end="00:48:12.160" style="s2">say except for the words omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.720" end="00:48:14.000" style="s2">actually mean it unless you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.160" end="00:48:15.920" style="s2">what the word omni means</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.000" end="00:48:17.680" style="s2">okay so when we explain it i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.960" style="s2">just any process</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.680" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">to where every being</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.960" end="00:48:27.440" style="s2">wins there&#39;s benefits and not even human</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:28.640" style="s2">we can decide whether it&#39;s human or just</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.440" end="00:48:30.240" style="s2">just just human or</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.640" end="00:48:32.000" style="s2">animals and that&#39;s why you say being i</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.240" end="00:48:34.160" style="s2">saw a great definition somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.000" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">but i was actually kind of disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.160" end="00:48:36.640" style="s2">at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.800" end="00:48:42.640" style="s2">um that&#39;s so that&#39;s my rant for today</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.800" end="00:48:44.640" style="s2">welcome to bentley&#39;s rants yeah i do</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.640" end="00:48:48.079" style="s2">definitely agree that at some point</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.640" end="00:48:49.119" style="s2">even like if we&#39;re sort of intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.079" end="00:48:50.800" style="s2">taking a step</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.119" end="00:48:52.720" style="s2">outside of game b saying like when we</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.800" end="00:48:55.040" style="s2">say omni and here&#39;s what we mean for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.720" end="00:48:56.079" style="s2">purposes of this project</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.040" end="00:48:58.319" style="s2">just because yeah i think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.079" end="00:48:59.760" style="s2">to have some sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.319" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">aligned thing and i agree that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.760" end="00:49:04.240" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t only be humans animals just</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:05.839" style="s2">the environment itself</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.240" end="00:49:09.520" style="s2">however it&#39;s going to be all sentient</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.839" end="00:49:12.400" style="s2">beings to look after animals if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.520" end="00:49:12.880" style="s2">also eating non-vegan and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.400" end="00:49:15.599" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.880" end="00:49:16.160" style="s2">doing those like are we left of a food</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.599" end="00:49:17.599" style="s2">delivery</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.160" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">place that&#39;s offering eggs and milk</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.599" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">because that&#39;s not looking it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">definitely not omni went into the</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:23.359" style="s2">chicken and cows right</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:24.960" style="s2">but like it it is if they have a better</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.359" end="00:49:29.119" style="s2">life than they would otherwise right</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:31.440" style="s2">if it&#39;s free range that&#39;s absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.119" end="00:49:32.400" style="s2">an improvement i think this is you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.440" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">progress over</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.400" end="00:49:36.079" style="s2">perfection and that is part of it though</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">right is well</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">um like is a horrible chicken&#39;s life</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:43.440" style="s2">worth more than zero chickens lives</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:46.160" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.440" end="00:49:48.079" style="s2">is it bad you know like is bad chicken</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.160" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">prison worse than not being alive at all</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.079" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">and like we have to decide for the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:52.640" style="s2">chickens and anyway</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:55.280" style="s2">let&#39;s have it there for all beans but</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.640" end="00:49:57.040" style="s2">also maybe we could make it clear that</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.280" end="00:49:58.319" style="s2">human beings have to be the first ones</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.040" end="00:50:01.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.319" end="00:50:02.079" style="s2">like i would love the world to be vegan</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.040" end="00:50:04.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not happening</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.079" end="00:50:05.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t even want to be vegan there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.240" end="00:50:08.000" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.680" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s not like humans need to</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.000" end="00:50:11.359" style="s2">feel like they&#39;re cared for and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:12.880" style="s2">have abundant lives before they can ever</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.359" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">think of getting there and so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">even if you care about animals the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:17.359" style="s2">planet humans being first is getting</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">there but</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.359" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">yeah i think a lot of that just comes</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.200" end="00:50:21.680" style="s2">down to the like not increasing harm</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:23.839" style="s2">yeah i think that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.680" end="00:50:24.800" style="s2">seeking perfection because i mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.839" end="00:50:26.720" style="s2">the same thing like</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.800" end="00:50:28.559" style="s2">if we end up doing business with a group</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.720" end="00:50:30.559" style="s2">that has you know it&#39;s improved it but</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.559" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">it still has slavery right like it&#39;s cut</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.559" end="00:50:34.800" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:36.319" style="s2">number of slaves needed by 90 percent</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.800" end="00:50:38.240" style="s2">well but they&#39;re still slaves okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.319" end="00:50:40.000" style="s2">but it&#39;s a 90 improvement</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.240" end="00:50:41.520" style="s2">what do we do there i personally would</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.000" end="00:50:42.319" style="s2">say go ahead because that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.520" end="00:50:44.240" style="s2">improvement you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.319" end="00:50:46.079" style="s2">the 90 percent of slaves you just freed</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.240" end="00:50:48.079" style="s2">the world&#39;s better for them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.079" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">yeah yeah that improvement but still</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:54.559" style="s2">technically bad for</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">you know the 10 still there</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.559" end="00:50:58.880" style="s2">i think the same thing with you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">animals and all that it&#39;s just like</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.880" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">you have your values and you&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:04.079" style="s2">trying to move towards improvement</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.559" end="00:51:08.559" style="s2">yeah so that&#39;s so next i need to come up</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">with a definition for romney one and i</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.559" end="00:51:14.720" style="s2">put pro on the win just to give us</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:16.079" style="s2">an out the b down the street doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.720" end="00:51:19.680" style="s2">benefit from your project</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.079" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">so i&#39;m not gonna fund it um</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.680" end="00:51:23.119" style="s2">or the flies that i killed in the fly</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:26.880" style="s2">trap today that&#39;s not very nice</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.119" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">um anyways</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.880" end="00:51:31.920" style="s2">so yeah i think um i like that</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:36.640" style="s2">and then we can we can workshop this bit</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.559" end="00:51:39.839" style="s2">a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.640" end="00:51:41.440" style="s2">um says our vision</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.839" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely what we&#39;re looking to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.440" end="00:51:43.920" style="s2">is create</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.240" end="00:51:48.839" style="s2">abundant resources for our projects for</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.880" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.839" end="00:51:54.559" style="s2">yeah we are our projects at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.000" style="s2">but yeah</p>

<p begin="00:51:58.079" end="00:52:00.800" style="s2">levels that</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:02.720" style="s2">i think we&#39;d like to end up doing to</p>

<p begin="00:57:33.520" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">i mean if they have a good idea is a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">good idea it doesn&#39;t matter where it</p>

<p begin="00:57:47.760" end="00:57:52.319" style="s2">and what they think makes sense with</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.599" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">what they believe together tech to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.319" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">with what they&#39;ve seen so far</p>
