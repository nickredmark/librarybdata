<p begin="00:01:42.509" end="00:01:50.610" style="s2">teacher was Francisco Varela was an</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.399" end="00:01:53.549" style="s2">important neuroscientist who try to</p>

<p begin="00:02:08.489" end="00:02:16.380" style="s2">by him in a very um</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.390" end="00:02:21.780" style="s2">solid and profound way he was a very in</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.380" end="00:02:28.170" style="s2">love with meditation and after through</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.780" end="00:02:30.020" style="s2">em I I get into Tibetan Buddhism to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.170" end="00:02:36.570" style="s2">understand meditation and study with</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.020" end="00:02:40.739" style="s2">different teacher and 15 years ago 17</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.570" end="00:02:46.220" style="s2">years ago I thought that we need to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.739" end="00:02:51.690" style="s2">to to give transmission of meditation</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.220" end="00:02:58.680" style="s2">not only inside of Buddhist but more</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.690" end="00:03:01.050" style="s2">broad way more broad and yes and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.680" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">consider your school to be like secular</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.050" end="00:03:07.290" style="s2">rather than religious or is that a bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">way of putting it I wasn&#39;t the problem i</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.290" end="00:03:17.390" style="s2">RI i ad but i found that it&#39;s difficult</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:20.190" style="s2">to really see it from outside but</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.390" end="00:03:25.590" style="s2">seventeen years ago there was very few</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.190" end="00:03:29.250" style="s2">meditation in many buddhist center some</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.590" end="00:03:31.950" style="s2">people think that you have meditation</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.250" end="00:03:33.480" style="s2">inside of the religious and when you put</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.950" end="00:03:37.890" style="s2">it outside you meet it you make</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.480" end="00:03:39.299" style="s2">meditation lighter more sample for</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.890" end="00:03:41.730" style="s2">people who don&#39;t have the courage to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.299" end="00:03:46.290" style="s2">engage into buddhism that was not at all</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.730" end="00:03:49.920" style="s2">my experience i was very i I saw that</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.290" end="00:03:52.400" style="s2">there was few and we took a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.920" end="00:03:55.620" style="s2">that with Francisco was very</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.400" end="00:03:57.870" style="s2">disappointed himself by the fact that in</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.620" end="00:04:04.110" style="s2">Buddhist people get into a religious</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.870" end="00:04:12.000" style="s2">idea of devotion and and believing guru</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.110" end="00:04:17.430" style="s2">and many things that didn&#39;t allow them</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.000" end="00:04:20.190" style="s2">to go already into the profanity of</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.430" end="00:04:21.900" style="s2">meditation yeah perhaps we can say the</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.190" end="00:04:24.930" style="s2">opposite is true that it&#39;s much much</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.900" end="00:04:27.509" style="s2">harder to practice meditation</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.930" end="00:04:30.210" style="s2">in the middle of Paris or in your busy</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.509" end="00:04:33.449" style="s2">life and I will not say is yeah I will</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.210" end="00:04:36.270" style="s2">say but for me the decision was to try</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.449" end="00:04:38.639" style="s2">to be faithful to the artisans of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.270" end="00:04:40.740" style="s2">meditations that I found that was the</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.639" end="00:04:44.340" style="s2">words of problem and that was one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.740" end="00:04:48.419" style="s2">things I I was I thought we have to go</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.340" end="00:04:53.400" style="s2">into present in meditation in a larger</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.419" end="00:04:56.910" style="s2">way but also the situation came because</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.400" end="00:04:59.400" style="s2">I saw that there was a particle into</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.910" end="00:05:03.270" style="s2">schools that I knew of Tibetan Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.400" end="00:05:08.610" style="s2">in also school a lot of corruption I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.270" end="00:05:14.070" style="s2">a very I was in great pain to see a so</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.610" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">much correction power manipulation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.070" end="00:05:25.229" style="s2">sex and money not say not telling the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:29.789" style="s2">truth gift fight of power and i found i</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.229" end="00:05:34.889" style="s2">i something was not true and it was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.789" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">time of great great pain for me so at</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.889" end="00:05:43.400" style="s2">this time i&#39;d ready to open meditation</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:46.409" style="s2">in a large way to go into - so with i</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.400" end="00:05:49.409" style="s2">still presenting and we still studying</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.409" end="00:05:52.550" style="s2">buddhist but not in a religious way but</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.409" end="00:05:56.250" style="s2">we go back to the text we&#39;ll go back to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.550" end="00:05:59.370" style="s2">tibetan chinese sanskrit and we we</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.250" end="00:06:02.430" style="s2">question the text we try to be more like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.370" end="00:06:09.750" style="s2">we call in waste paramagnetic we try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.430" end="00:06:13.050" style="s2">have to not take the text as something</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.750" end="00:06:17.250" style="s2">fixed but more some things that ask to</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.050" end="00:06:20.550" style="s2">be a read and interpret in relation to</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.250" end="00:06:21.659" style="s2">all the text or the knowledge yeah and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.550" end="00:06:23.699" style="s2">forgot to mention</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.659" end="00:06:25.770" style="s2">Fabrice that you&#39;re a philosopher as</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.699" end="00:06:30.570" style="s2">well and you studied a lot of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.770" end="00:06:32.699" style="s2">and perhaps that informs your Western</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.570" end="00:06:35.849" style="s2">philosophy and perhaps that I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.699" end="00:06:39.150" style="s2">that informs how how you look at</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.849" end="00:06:50.650" style="s2">Buddhist texts and and reinterpret them</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.150" end="00:06:54.250" style="s2">yes because either as Westerners feel if</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.650" end="00:07:00.130" style="s2">Western philosophy very intensively I</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.250" end="00:07:02.380" style="s2">did a PhD in La Sorbonne but more in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.130" end="00:07:03.130" style="s2">more deep way I found that that is very</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.380" end="00:07:06.130" style="s2">strange</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.130" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">when you are Westerners to go into by</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.130" end="00:07:16.090" style="s2">example Buddhist and just forget about</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:18.220" style="s2">knowledge of the West one - I was very I</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.090" end="00:07:21.910" style="s2">was more and more struck by the fact</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.220" end="00:07:23.560" style="s2">that erm many people talk about Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.910" end="00:07:25.870" style="s2">but in fact when you know Western</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.560" end="00:07:28.419" style="s2">philosophy you realized they just talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.870" end="00:07:32.139" style="s2">about Western philosophy without knowing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.419" end="00:07:34.720" style="s2">it by many people think they talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.139" end="00:07:37.449" style="s2">Buddhists so just talking about a candle</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.720" end="00:07:39.759" style="s2">first choice young Stacie&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.449" end="00:07:42.340" style="s2">Epicure I don&#39;t occur in ISM yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.759" end="00:07:44.320" style="s2">remember you saying that before that a</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.340" end="00:07:47.250" style="s2">lot of the Buddhism in the West is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.320" end="00:07:50.260" style="s2">kind of epicureanism and stoicism yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.250" end="00:07:52.030" style="s2">using Buddhist sort of terminology but</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.260" end="00:07:54.250" style="s2">but yes but they haven&#39;t really got to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.030" end="00:07:56.020" style="s2">the depth of the truth by example</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.250" end="00:07:59.050" style="s2">everybody took that put the Buddhist now</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.020" end="00:08:02.139" style="s2">is a impermanence you say that interment</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.050" end="00:08:06.520" style="s2">permanencia so that for that is almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.139" end="00:08:11.500" style="s2">the basic level that everybody agree but</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.520" end="00:08:15.849" style="s2">honestly is so simple to believe the</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.500" end="00:08:19.560" style="s2">idea of impermanence is is not so</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.849" end="00:08:23.590" style="s2">general in making particle Buddhists and</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.560" end="00:08:26.080" style="s2">and commoners is a definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.590" end="00:08:29.080" style="s2">nature of reality you make a statement</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.080" end="00:08:31.270" style="s2">about reality to be impermanence that</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.080" end="00:08:34.450" style="s2">not at all the point of view of Buddhist</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.270" end="00:08:36.419" style="s2">would never is a metaphysic we try to</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.450" end="00:08:39.219" style="s2">say what is reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.419" end="00:08:41.890" style="s2">Buddhism is more kind of practice and</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.219" end="00:08:46.930" style="s2">the knowledge of Buddhists is more way</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.890" end="00:08:49.779" style="s2">to help you to see more clearly you own</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.930" end="00:08:51.350" style="s2">relation to reality right they not have</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.779" end="00:08:55.830" style="s2">this kind of object</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.350" end="00:08:57.480" style="s2">mmm can I just try to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.830" end="00:08:59.130" style="s2">Buddhist or do you mean it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.480" end="00:09:02.100" style="s2">idea of impermanence or something like</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.130" end="00:09:05.070" style="s2">that is is not some kind of description</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.100" end="00:09:07.560" style="s2">of reality it&#39;s it&#39;s one sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.070" end="00:09:10.490" style="s2">to work with one kind of it&#39;s a process</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.560" end="00:09:15.060" style="s2">of trying to understand yes so yes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.490" end="00:09:18.200" style="s2">is a process is the way to shunt you</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.060" end="00:09:21.690" style="s2">mind but we make Buddhist like a</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.570" end="00:19:09.510" style="s2">go back to something more deep into the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.150" end="00:19:12.600" style="s2">level of meditation and the book had a</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.510" end="00:19:15.870" style="s2">very strong impact in France it was one</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.600" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">of the book who sells the most so yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.870" end="00:19:22.800" style="s2">could be shit five or six years ago I</p>

<p begin="00:19:22.800" end="00:19:28.500" style="s2">I tell you tell you why the title speaks</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.930" end="00:19:32.820" style="s2">to me because well I&#39;m an English person</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.500" end="00:19:36.810" style="s2">living in France and there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.820" end="00:19:39.630" style="s2">about anglo-saxon mentality that gets</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.810" end="00:19:42.750" style="s2">very hyper sight psychological about</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.630" end="00:19:47.610" style="s2">everything and there&#39;s also this as you</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.750" end="00:19:50.520" style="s2">say this kind of marketing approach to</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.610" end="00:19:54.330" style="s2">life so when I so so one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.520" end="00:19:57.390" style="s2">love about being here is something about</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.330" end="00:20:00.840" style="s2">the French spirit that that that has</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.390" end="00:20:08.510" style="s2">that that quality of not giving a fuck</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.840" end="00:20:08.510" style="s2">if that makes any sense yes yeah yes so</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.570" end="00:20:19.110" style="s2">so was the book had a very strong impact</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.760" end="00:20:22.110" style="s2">and because people are suffering a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.110" end="00:20:26.550" style="s2">by this approach of having to manage</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.110" end="00:20:31.140" style="s2">themselves you know you found in many in</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.550" end="00:20:35.130" style="s2">many place people are doing burn out the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.140" end="00:20:37.920" style="s2">over stress and the only message of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.130" end="00:20:43.890" style="s2">is your food you should manage yourself</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.920" end="00:20:49.500" style="s2">better and I try to to show that is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.890" end="00:20:55.710" style="s2">true is people are they just suffer from</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.500" end="00:20:57.930" style="s2">a very ant approach of a flaw is trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.710" end="00:21:00.360" style="s2">them from and very hard and and</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.930" end="00:21:03.000" style="s2">themselves now who&#39;s the out of themself</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.360" end="00:21:05.210" style="s2">they don&#39;t like that people don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.000" end="00:21:08.910" style="s2">themselves because they are integrate</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.210" end="00:21:12.180" style="s2">this politically social vision that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.910" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">never do enough could say the mantra of</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.180" end="00:21:20.370" style="s2">our time is you don&#39;t you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:21.000" style="s2">enough are you you little now you listen</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.370" end="00:21:24.060" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.000" end="00:21:26.910" style="s2">but have you done enough no no and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.060" end="00:21:32.760" style="s2">create a doubt no yes that&#39;s true and</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.910" end="00:21:37.920" style="s2">you should do more and being means doing</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.760" end="00:21:41.960" style="s2">more being more efficient and this that</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.920" end="00:21:45.090" style="s2">is like is very person that truly</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.960" end="00:21:47.610" style="s2">destroy yourself and I find is important</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.090" end="00:21:50.390" style="s2">because we can&#39;t there is a tendency</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.610" end="00:21:52.920" style="s2">that when we talk about meditation</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.390" end="00:21:55.560" style="s2">spirituality and so on we have a</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.920" end="00:21:59.480" style="s2">tendency to think that everything is in</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.560" end="00:22:02.100" style="s2">your own mind but that is really weak</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.480" end="00:22:04.680" style="s2">because there is also violence in our</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.100" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">times and it&#39;s very important to be able</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.680" end="00:22:13.560" style="s2">to name it to name what is the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:17.190" style="s2">of our time the violence of our area and</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.560" end="00:22:20.150" style="s2">I must say that my great inspiration in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.190" end="00:22:25.320" style="s2">all that was Shogun Trungpa Rinpoche</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.150" end="00:22:27.420" style="s2">really is in really is very great source</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.320" end="00:22:30.630" style="s2">of influence and because comparing</p>

<p begin="00:23:23.490" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">a present while destroying and is what</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.210" end="00:23:30.240" style="s2">he calls the Setting Sun mortality who</p>

<p begin="00:23:36.570" end="00:23:46.710" style="s2">also is a mentality of trying to go to</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.760" end="00:23:48.420" style="s2">find comfort in every situation and try</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.710" end="00:23:53.220" style="s2">meditation was not trying to find</p>

<p begin="00:24:00.030" end="00:24:06.929" style="s2">key and for me even if I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.080" end="00:24:09.900" style="s2">necessarily use the same word I found</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.929" end="00:24:13.370" style="s2">that a great inspiration that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.900" end="00:24:17.220" style="s2">think historically what creates the</p>

<p begin="00:24:20.130" end="00:24:25.890" style="s2">to our time when you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.710" end="00:24:27.450" style="s2">Buddha the first thing that one of the</p>

<p begin="00:24:27.450" end="00:24:34.830" style="s2">start to teach meditation we start to</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.330" end="00:24:37.950" style="s2">have a very strong analyze of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.830" end="00:24:41.370" style="s2">society where he was living in we start</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.950" end="00:24:45.300" style="s2">to say all strike on the whole structure</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.370" end="00:24:49.770" style="s2">of our society is wrong because the</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.300" end="00:24:52.710" style="s2">whole idea of of caste system yes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.770" end="00:24:54.630" style="s2">wrong and separation between man and</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.710" end="00:24:56.490" style="s2">woman and woman can have known no</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.630" end="00:25:00.000" style="s2">possibility to go into the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.490" end="00:25:01.980" style="s2">world is wrong so it&#39;s very strong that</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.000" end="00:25:06.809" style="s2">we make now an image of Buddha of some</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.980" end="00:25:09.300" style="s2">say of someone with pure and livid read</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.809" end="00:25:13.380" style="s2">the world and when you see his life he</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.300" end="00:25:16.620" style="s2">was very engaged in to analyzing what</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.380" end="00:25:20.040" style="s2">prevent life to flourish and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.620" end="00:25:22.320" style="s2">what prevent life to flourish today that</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.040" end="00:25:23.910" style="s2">from the point of view of meditation I</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:27.300" style="s2">think that the key point and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.910" end="00:25:31.490" style="s2">prevent life is his idea that we have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.300" end="00:25:38.100" style="s2">be a tool to manage everything to be can</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.490" end="00:25:40.870" style="s2">to me and all that is based on kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.100" end="00:25:44.080" style="s2">heartridge toward life</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.870" end="00:25:47.340" style="s2">all this teacher of meditation now all</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.080" end="00:25:52.600" style="s2">this application of meditation they just</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.340" end="00:25:55.000" style="s2">based on kind of hatred toward life yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.600" end="00:25:58.090" style="s2">the contrary of Ettrick toward logic</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.000" end="00:26:00.460" style="s2">yeah and and and if if we&#39;re talking</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.460" end="00:26:09.850" style="s2">also extremely inspired by him I think I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.770" end="00:26:13.360" style="s2">think that for me he was the most</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.850" end="00:26:18.600" style="s2">authentic teacher you know in in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.360" end="00:26:21.520" style="s2">West and and his and and his example</p>

<p begin="00:26:21.520" end="00:26:28.510" style="s2">situation right yes not not not some</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.149" end="00:26:37.539" style="s2">kind of you know escape from from from</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.510" end="00:26:39.850" style="s2">reality yes he was yes he was able to go</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.539" end="00:26:42.309" style="s2">into the negativity of the world to try</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.850" end="00:26:47.500" style="s2">to transmute the negativity and he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.309" end="00:26:48.309" style="s2">not the kind of this kind of naive light</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.500" end="00:26:51.640" style="s2">love</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.520" end="00:27:00.850" style="s2">seems like today a tantric teacher is</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.299" end="00:27:02.620" style="s2">something that he can&#39;t be a public</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.850" end="00:27:05.860" style="s2">thing because it&#39;s too alive and because</p>

<p begin="00:39:30.280" end="00:39:36.200" style="s2">everybody realize how difficult is just</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.860" end="00:39:40.820" style="s2">to know what we feel to be in contact</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.200" end="00:39:43.880" style="s2">with what we experiment we are even if</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.820" end="00:39:47.180" style="s2">we are at home all day long is very</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.880" end="00:39:50.480" style="s2">difficult to cut from information that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.180" end="00:39:55.150" style="s2">don&#39;t tell us very much and to go into a</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.480" end="00:40:00.140" style="s2">deeper feeling that gave us strength and</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.150" end="00:40:01.970" style="s2">be a way to to to true I remember the</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.140" end="00:40:03.590" style="s2">word I was looking for bill done it was</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.970" end="00:40:05.030" style="s2">called bill dung it was a German word</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.590" end="00:40:07.100" style="s2">and it was something about becoming a</p>

<p begin="00:40:07.100" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">about this yes and so true medication</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.970" end="00:40:18.440" style="s2">that concludes our relation we have with</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:22.520" style="s2">art because odd is not just something we</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.440" end="00:40:24.980" style="s2">have to understand something a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.520" end="00:40:28.840" style="s2">people but is an experience so by</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.980" end="00:40:32.450" style="s2">example one thing I do often is I do</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.840" end="00:40:35.510" style="s2">meditation in middle of concert I did</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.450" end="00:40:42.770" style="s2">that in Opera Bastille in the Great Oak</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.510" end="00:40:45.050" style="s2">Island at best the last October someone</p>

<p begin="00:40:47.810" end="00:40:53.690" style="s2">we ask people what they expense and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.050" end="00:40:55.610" style="s2">and there are completely surprised and</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.690" end="00:40:57.860" style="s2">shocked yeah was buying doing five</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.610" end="00:40:58.730" style="s2">minutes of meditation the ear music like</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.860" end="00:41:01.910" style="s2">they never</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.730" end="00:41:06.619" style="s2">earned because in our times people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.910" end="00:41:10.910" style="s2">get trained to to listen to to listen to</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.619" end="00:41:13.820" style="s2">feel to feel and we are very into</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.910" end="00:41:18.470" style="s2">concept very abstract and very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.820" end="00:41:20.660" style="s2">for us to learn what means the senses</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.470" end="00:41:24.320" style="s2">Sensibility you know when you go to at</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.660" end="00:41:27.320" style="s2">school from all years never you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.320" end="00:41:30.530" style="s2">class when you learn how to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.320" end="00:41:35.089" style="s2">Google Oh to go deeper into what means</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.530" end="00:41:37.250" style="s2">feeling so meditation so we do we do</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.089" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">many thing about art in our school of</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.250" end="00:41:41.270" style="s2">meditation yeah and that&#39;s what I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:44.960" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s what I think is so unique</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.270" end="00:41:47.810" style="s2">about yes which in venture school we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:50.660" style="s2">go to me and make meditation with</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.810" end="00:41:53.859" style="s2">panting to have another relation to</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.660" end="00:41:56.630" style="s2">panting we could ask that with music and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.859" end="00:41:59.210" style="s2">we could have that so we have class</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.630" end="00:42:02.750" style="s2">sometimes with many different thing we</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.210" end="00:42:07.730" style="s2">had a class on Beethoven lately and we</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.750" end="00:42:09.470" style="s2">were trying to to go deeper into into</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.730" end="00:42:13.819" style="s2">Beethoven I must say that in philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.470" end="00:42:15.319" style="s2">I was very much marked by film energy I</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.819" end="00:42:16.940" style="s2">found that there was a lot of link</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.319" end="00:42:19.880" style="s2">between phenomenology and meditation</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.940" end="00:42:22.339" style="s2">phenomenology was this idea that start</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.880" end="00:42:25.760" style="s2">at the beginning of the 20th centuries -</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.339" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">maybe not good not make philosophy a way</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.760" end="00:42:32.359" style="s2">to elaborate concept but more into</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:35.300" style="s2">describing experience describing the</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.359" end="00:42:37.880" style="s2">relation you have to phenomena so what</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.300" end="00:42:40.730" style="s2">do you see what do you feel when you</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.880" end="00:42:41.990" style="s2">listen music when you meet someone when</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.730" end="00:42:44.030" style="s2">you have a thought when you have</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.990" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">imagination going to more into</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.030" end="00:42:49.609" style="s2">describing and there is a lot of link</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:52.369" style="s2">between meditation and phenomenology so</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.609" end="00:42:55.250" style="s2">that was that was is one of the key and</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.369" end="00:42:57.680" style="s2">the other thing you teaches is poetry -</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.250" end="00:42:59.390" style="s2">right I know that you&#39;ve you&#39;ve taught</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.680" end="00:43:02.420" style="s2">me a few things about about modern</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.390" end="00:43:05.839" style="s2">poetry and and why do you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.420" end="00:43:09.650" style="s2">that&#39;s so important and why is it so</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.839" end="00:43:11.660" style="s2">absent from you know I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.650" end="00:43:12.520" style="s2">that&#39;s another reason why I think what</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.660" end="00:43:14.290" style="s2">you&#39;re doing is so</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.520" end="00:43:18.010" style="s2">Gordon is I think that people people</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.290" end="00:43:21.400" style="s2">have this sort of very anti poetic</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.010" end="00:43:23.830" style="s2">spirit today it&#39;s I could torture is so</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.400" end="00:43:30.100" style="s2">important our relation to poetry to</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.830" end="00:43:32.590" style="s2">music to out is cultural aesthetic first</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.100" end="00:43:36.040" style="s2">is culture that means you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.590" end="00:43:38.440" style="s2">character I have no interest in to</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.040" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">character I&#39;m not reading poetry to have</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.440" end="00:43:45.580" style="s2">character i wit poetry to go into a</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:46.170" style="s2">deeper relation to my own life and to</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.170" end="00:43:54.540" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know any great poet who</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.780" end="00:43:59.650" style="s2">write poetry as a fact of character my</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.540" end="00:44:03.400" style="s2">appropriate since the since the oldest</p>

<p begin="00:44:03.400" end="00:44:07.840" style="s2">poetry came in the West the me to</p>

<p begin="00:54:10.510" end="00:54:14.830" style="s2">just is more deep question that we</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.720" end="00:54:17.320" style="s2">thought</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.830" end="00:54:20.140" style="s2">you could say that the way the roman</p>

<p begin="00:54:45.970" end="00:54:50.440" style="s2">a new approach so so that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.490" end="00:54:52.840" style="s2">doing that&#39;s what your mission is in a</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.440" end="00:54:55.240" style="s2">way it&#39;s translation yeah translation is</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.840" end="00:54:58.450" style="s2">not just translation is it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.240" end="00:55:01.390" style="s2">you that you put your text put on google</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.450" end="00:55:04.480" style="s2">translation and having an oscillation is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.390" end="00:55:07.000" style="s2">how you are how you read things you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.480" end="00:55:09.580" style="s2">when people have decided that meditation</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.000" end="00:55:12.570" style="s2">will be called mindfulness but with</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.580" end="00:55:15.430" style="s2">translations that create a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.570" end="00:55:17.980" style="s2">decision it&#39;s a very deep decision and</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.430" end="00:55:20.050" style="s2">maybe that was a great mistake to call</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.980" end="00:55:21.880" style="s2">meditation - oh yeah I talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.050" end="00:55:26.680" style="s2">yeah talk about that that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.880" end="00:55:29.320" style="s2">yeah why mindfulness is just mind and</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.680" end="00:55:31.120" style="s2">maybe meditation is not about so much</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.320" end="00:55:35.140" style="s2">about mind maybe meditation is about</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.120" end="00:55:37.180" style="s2">body hmm fashion is about heart maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.140" end="00:55:40.000" style="s2">make dashing should have be called</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.180" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">heartfulness because maybe the word</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.000" end="00:55:44.740" style="s2">originally was mind heart or something</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">like that you know in tibetan or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.740" end="00:55:48.540" style="s2">in tibet meditation meditation have</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:52.470" style="s2">nothing to do with mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.540" end="00:55:55.030" style="s2">meditation is is very different</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.470" end="00:55:56.800" style="s2">amelioration or something like that is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.030" end="00:55:58.600" style="s2">word that people use sometimes being</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.800" end="00:56:01.030" style="s2">familiar with your being interested</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.600" end="00:56:08.350" style="s2">yourself yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.030" end="00:56:11.590" style="s2">so mindfulness is not is not bad but</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.350" end="00:56:13.300" style="s2">it&#39;s just by doing this translation you</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.590" end="00:56:15.990" style="s2">have create an understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.300" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">meditation that you could question</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.990" end="00:56:22.240" style="s2">awareness could have been another</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:25.720" style="s2">approach which personally I found more</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.240" end="00:56:30.310" style="s2">more profound awareness is more profound</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.720" end="00:56:31.359" style="s2">then mindfulness or awareness I I know</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.310" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">how you pronounce it</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.359" end="00:56:39.400" style="s2">he W II have so much resonance and is</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:46.900" style="s2">the word that you find in American</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.400" end="00:56:49.330" style="s2">poetry and and awareness is I found i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.900" end="00:56:51.520" style="s2">a found that is amazing</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.330" end="00:56:53.170" style="s2">they&#39;re all the resonance of awareness I</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.520" end="00:56:56.440" style="s2">will would have been very interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.170" end="00:56:58.630" style="s2">call meditation awareness awareness</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.440" end="00:57:00.880" style="s2">practice it will be completely different</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.630" end="00:57:06.220" style="s2">to mindfulness practice awareness</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.880" end="00:57:08.020" style="s2">practice yeah and so you that is just</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.220" end="00:57:10.900" style="s2">one example we could take counted but</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.020" end="00:57:14.020" style="s2">you just see that by doing a choice of</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.900" end="00:57:18.190" style="s2">one translation you have an</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.020" end="00:57:22.630" style="s2">interpretation that could really close</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.190" end="00:57:24.099" style="s2">something yeah well it seems like also</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.630" end="00:57:26.680" style="s2">the the history of Buddhism in the West</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.099" end="00:57:29.740" style="s2">is very young so certain terms certain</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.680" end="00:57:34.330" style="s2">ideas stick in another other ones oh you</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.740" end="00:57:37.060" style="s2">know don&#39;t and no I think I will say the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.330" end="00:57:38.980" style="s2">problem is not that is so much so few</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.060" end="00:57:41.800" style="s2">time because I think we were much more</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.980" end="00:57:44.490" style="s2">open twenty or thirty years ago so</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.800" end="00:57:52.050" style="s2">quantities we translating Buddhist and</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.490" end="00:57:57.810" style="s2">meditation to put it in the box of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.050" end="00:58:01.830" style="s2">whole idea of management and there is</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.810" end="00:58:05.980" style="s2">mindfulness come more fit more into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.830" end="00:58:09.670" style="s2">box of Management at awareness because</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.980" end="00:58:12.070" style="s2">you you can&#39;t go to business world and</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.670" end="00:58:14.230" style="s2">say to people you have to work more and</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.070" end="00:58:15.880" style="s2">do some mindfulness to be more efficient</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.230" end="00:58:18.040" style="s2">you can&#39;t say to people you do</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.880" end="00:58:22.030" style="s2">heartfulness awareness to be more</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.040" end="00:58:24.420" style="s2">efficient so it will not work so so this</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.030" end="00:58:29.890" style="s2">is a term that can be easily manipulated</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.420" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">right is where he was promoted and and</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.890" end="00:58:36.820" style="s2">and by translating this way we make we</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:38.260" style="s2">our own people understand and some</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.820" end="00:58:39.220" style="s2">people and but at some time we lose</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.260" end="00:58:42.690" style="s2">something will</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.220" end="00:58:48.160" style="s2">something of the of the extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.690" end="00:58:50.800" style="s2">power of the situation have you been</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.160" end="00:58:53.320" style="s2">thinking about how the world is going to</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.800" end="00:58:56.950" style="s2">be different after this pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.320" end="00:59:01.300" style="s2">what what&#39;s happening now and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.950" end="00:59:03.940" style="s2">what&#39;s going on much for or or is it is</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.300" end="00:59:06.400" style="s2">it almost not too early to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.940" end="00:59:10.630" style="s2">that sort of thing I know I think yes I</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.400" end="00:59:13.390" style="s2">think is I don&#39;t know yeah I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.630" end="00:59:16.420" style="s2">surprised all these people who think</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.390" end="00:59:24.730" style="s2">they know people know so many things i</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.420" end="00:59:28.960" style="s2">feel i as a i was engaging to meditation</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.730" end="00:59:30.970" style="s2">i think the question is what do we what</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.960" end="00:59:34.000" style="s2">do we living in this situation i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.970" end="00:59:38.080" style="s2">it&#39;s not so easy to understand what is</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.000" end="00:59:40.630" style="s2">happening to us and i find before trying</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.080" end="00:59:42.490" style="s2">to know what will happen in the future</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.630" end="00:59:46.270" style="s2">would be good to know what is happening</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.490" end="00:59:47.920" style="s2">in the present and i found that is very</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.270" end="00:59:52.920" style="s2">difficult to understand what is i think</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.920" end="00:59:57.070" style="s2">now and as a philosopher I know that</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.920" end="01:00:01.150" style="s2">philosophy is not about just make</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.070" end="01:00:05.220" style="s2">commentary of actuality yeah on news but</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.150" end="01:00:08.160" style="s2">philosophy take your time to see what</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.220" end="01:00:11.410" style="s2">beyond what you see</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.160" end="01:00:13.240" style="s2">and I think it is because we can make a</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.410" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">lot of vulgar pronouncements about</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.240" end="01:00:20.650" style="s2">reality I&#39;m working on that very</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:23.740" style="s2">intensively I&#39;m working to try to be at</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.650" end="01:00:26.220" style="s2">the level of what is happening mm-hmm of</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.740" end="01:00:31.750" style="s2">my meditation and in terms of philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.220" end="01:00:35.050" style="s2">yeah but I think is more is more work</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.750" end="01:00:39.700" style="s2">how you are you you you be at the level</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.050" end="01:00:43.510" style="s2">of the situation are you you are you but</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.700" end="01:00:47.190" style="s2">we miss a lot of knowledge that we were</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.510" end="01:00:50.930" style="s2">going to have soon in the future but</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.190" end="01:00:54.220" style="s2">able to understand more clearly but</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.930" end="01:00:58.839" style="s2">I would say and maybe we can close</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.220" end="01:01:02.710" style="s2">discussion on that I but at some time I</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.839" end="01:01:05.390" style="s2">meditation helped me to be in kind of</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.710" end="01:01:07.910" style="s2">insecurity and not be afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.390" end="01:01:11.059" style="s2">insecurity you know by accepting</p>

<p begin="01:02:04.940" end="01:02:10.640" style="s2">meditation and it was a lot all of them</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.640" end="01:02:12.710" style="s2">was to how to be in contact with what we</p>

<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:22.539" style="s2">fear because this true this kind of fear</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.710" end="01:02:26.210" style="s2">that week we found the strength to face</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.539" end="01:02:29.690" style="s2">the situation and so that was actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.210" end="01:02:34.000" style="s2">one of the one of the key point and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.690" end="01:02:38.539" style="s2">second point is how to having some OOP</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.000" end="01:02:42.920" style="s2">the time of intense suffering yeah could</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.539" end="01:02:45.859" style="s2">we find hope and hope as a project for</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.920" end="01:02:48.470" style="s2">future reality is we&#39;re not interesting</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.859" end="01:02:50.569" style="s2">that to have planned because I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.470" end="01:02:52.730" style="s2">like what Backson the French philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.569" end="01:02:54.770" style="s2">of the beginning of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.730" end="01:02:59.119" style="s2">Backson which said the future is not</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.770" end="01:03:03.140" style="s2">existing in the present but the this</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.119" end="01:03:06.890" style="s2">time is the creation of new</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.140" end="01:03:09.710" style="s2">all the time so nobody we know the</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.890" end="01:03:11.810" style="s2">pandemic will have this effect we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.710" end="01:03:15.410" style="s2">know what will happen and it&#39;s better to</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.810" end="01:03:18.010" style="s2">be open to possibilities that exist that</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.410" end="01:03:23.510" style="s2">to just try to put reality in our box</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.010" end="01:03:29.050" style="s2">and so that that the second point is is</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.510" end="01:03:31.610" style="s2">is is a ring this openness and OOP OOP</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.050" end="01:03:33.800" style="s2">too is not to pry like that instead of</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.610" end="01:03:36.500" style="s2">hope being you know trying to create</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.800" end="01:03:37.190" style="s2">some kind of utopia a better world in</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.500" end="01:03:39.440" style="s2">the future</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.190" end="01:03:42.920" style="s2">hope is a kind of openness towards</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.440" end="01:03:44.030" style="s2">reality that you know I like very much</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.920" end="01:03:49.700" style="s2">to understand OOP</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.030" end="01:03:52.880" style="s2">to go into account some people asked</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.700" end="01:03:55.010" style="s2">count what will be the future that there</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.880" end="01:03:59.930" style="s2">will be a good future or bad future and</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.010" end="01:04:03.670" style="s2">concepts we can&#39;t know because no man</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.930" end="01:04:06.200" style="s2">could have a relation to all or</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.670" end="01:04:08.660" style="s2">everything that happens in a completely</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.200" end="01:04:11.090" style="s2">objective way because we are part of</p>

<p begin="01:04:11.090" end="01:04:16.460" style="s2">so he said we nobody can know if the</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.850" end="01:04:20.270" style="s2">future will be good or bad better or</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.460" end="01:04:23.390" style="s2">worse but one thing as human beings we</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.270" end="01:04:27.710" style="s2">all have the the the desire the</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.390" end="01:04:31.400" style="s2">aspiration that the future will will be</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.710" end="01:04:34.280" style="s2">better that some some more peaceful and</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.400" end="01:04:39.550" style="s2">more loving one will will will be so a</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.280" end="01:04:43.760" style="s2">fan oop is a way to lessen our own</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.550" end="01:04:47.540" style="s2">aspiration that something will come from</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.760" end="01:04:51.140" style="s2">this situation that will will be helpful</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.540" end="01:04:55.640" style="s2">and this aspiration is not in the future</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.140" end="01:04:58.460" style="s2">hope is in reality and by contacting</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.640" end="01:05:03.590" style="s2">this Pope I feel more trust and</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.460" end="01:05:06.350" style="s2">confidence and I have more confidence to</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.590" end="01:05:08.840" style="s2">to see how I can help the world I am NOT</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.350" end="01:05:10.970" style="s2">just when I have Autopia I&#39;m waiting</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.840" end="01:05:13.400" style="s2">that all the people do doing things and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.970" end="01:05:15.920" style="s2">get pissed off when things don&#39;t happen</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.400" end="01:05:16.700" style="s2">the way I want when I go into this</p>

<p begin="01:05:16.700" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">of all that I&#39;m talking this aspiration</p>

<p begin="01:05:41.150" end="01:05:48.349" style="s2">important and the third third thing so</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.770" end="01:05:53.119" style="s2">how to work with crisis and not afraid</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.349" end="01:05:55.820" style="s2">of uncertainty to finding hope in in a</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.119" end="01:06:02.119" style="s2">new way like aspiration and the third</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.820" end="01:06:05.180" style="s2">way is we are free in a painful way in</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.119" end="01:06:08.180" style="s2">one sense but we feel sometime in this</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.180" end="01:06:10.490" style="s2">situation that we are not free that we</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.180" end="01:06:15.010" style="s2">are completely trapped by the reality</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.490" end="01:06:18.710" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s interesting to to to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.010" end="01:06:22.790" style="s2">what I learned from philosophy the 20th</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.710" end="01:06:24.740" style="s2">century&#39;s philosophy is is we are put in</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.790" end="01:06:27.260" style="s2">the world we have no choice we have to</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.740" end="01:06:32.210" style="s2">desire throne in the world I ever</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.260" end="01:06:35.540" style="s2">fainted Heidegger or I began some talk a</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.210" end="01:06:38.900" style="s2">lot about freedom that we we have no</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.540" end="01:06:41.089" style="s2">choice we we are free because we have no</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.900" end="01:06:43.579" style="s2">choice to make something of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.089" end="01:06:44.119" style="s2">situation and I find this ventures into</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.579" end="01:06:46.910" style="s2">too</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.119" end="01:06:49.160" style="s2">I&#39;m not free because I can do whatever I</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.910" end="01:06:52.130" style="s2">want I&#39;m free because I have no other</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.160" end="01:06:57.140" style="s2">choice to respond to the reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.130" end="01:06:59.000" style="s2">great I am NOT free it is just what</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.140" end="01:07:01.910" style="s2">thought could move as far how you say</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.000" end="01:07:03.650" style="s2">movies for bad faith is bad faith but</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.910" end="01:07:05.859" style="s2">you said that but yeah you can say bad</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.650" end="01:07:13.359" style="s2">faith in English you can say that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.859" end="01:07:16.369" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of this kind of is a lie</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.359" end="01:07:19.579" style="s2">mmm-hmm it&#39;s a lie you you you try to</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.369" end="01:07:21.800" style="s2">pretend that you you can&#39;t do you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.579" end="01:07:25.250" style="s2">free because of the situation but we</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.800" end="01:07:29.329" style="s2">have free to do something to change of</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.250" end="01:07:32.930" style="s2">you to and to make a choice and</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.329" end="01:07:35.569" style="s2">that is why what meditation helped me to</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.930" end="01:07:39.019" style="s2">to be in contact with not afraid of</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.569" end="01:07:50.959" style="s2">uncertainty and finding way to overcome</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.019" end="01:07:53.390" style="s2">crisis and what and what I said hope is</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.959" end="01:07:56.180" style="s2">finding our inner inspiration and</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.390" end="01:08:00.999" style="s2">knowing that whatever I do I have to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.180" end="01:08:04.400" style="s2">make choice and this choice is and</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.999" end="01:08:06.200" style="s2">that&#39;s what Victor Frankel&#39;s discovered</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.400" end="01:08:08.989" style="s2">right when he was in the concentration</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.200" end="01:08:11.509" style="s2">camp yes and to freedom to make a choice</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.989" end="01:08:14.749" style="s2">you have to make if you understand what</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.509" end="01:08:19.849" style="s2">I&#39;m saying about crisis about hope and</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.749" end="01:08:21.889" style="s2">about freedom you see that this tree to</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.849" end="01:08:25.159" style="s2">be in contact with them you have to</p>
