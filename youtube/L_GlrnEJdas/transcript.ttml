<p begin="00:01:37.909" end="00:01:41.750" style="s2">scheduled I thought we would run through</p>

<p begin="00:01:41.750" end="00:01:46.760" style="s2">what is happening in the world right now</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.500" end="00:03:11.510" style="s2">good book in and of itself but actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">a really nice manual introduction to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.510" end="00:03:16.670" style="s2">logic so if you get a chance you should</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:18.020" style="s2">take a look at that so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.670" end="00:03:21.080" style="s2">reasons why I decided to write the book</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.020" end="00:03:23.570" style="s2">was I was doing my PhD at York</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.080" end="00:03:27.020" style="s2">University around the time when Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.570" end="00:03:29.540" style="s2">started to really ascend to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.020" end="00:03:31.970" style="s2">stratosphere of fame and like a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.540" end="00:03:33.350" style="s2">people in Toronto at the time who were</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.970" end="00:03:35.420" style="s2">also involved in academic intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.350" end="00:03:38.240" style="s2">circles I was really surprised by this</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.420" end="00:03:40.130" style="s2">right you&#39;re kind of used to writing</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.240" end="00:03:41.600" style="s2">obscure academic articles and having</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.130" end="00:03:43.700" style="s2">them be read by two or three hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.600" end="00:03:45.260" style="s2">people and every now and then you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.700" end="00:03:46.970" style="s2">some people appear on the CBC to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.260" end="00:03:48.800" style="s2">about their area of expertise but</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.970" end="00:03:50.930" style="s2">nowhere near the kind of attention this</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.800" end="00:03:53.300" style="s2">figure was getting a major outlets like</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.930" end="00:03:55.460" style="s2">the National Review or CBC or Channel</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.300" end="00:03:57.680" style="s2">four and the United Kingdom and so like</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.460" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">a lot of people I was just intrigued to</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:01.490" style="s2">figure out what his work was about and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:03.950" style="s2">in particular since I kind of broadly</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.490" end="00:04:06.230" style="s2">associate with a left liberal political</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.950" end="00:04:08.420" style="s2">tradition arguing for social</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.230" end="00:04:10.250" style="s2">redistribution of wealth and so on I</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.420" end="00:04:12.380" style="s2">wanted to see what all the furor was</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.250" end="00:04:14.360" style="s2">about on that angle as well and when I</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.380" end="00:04:17.180" style="s2">went through maps of meaning for the</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.360" end="00:04:19.100" style="s2">first time in 2017 about mid 2017 right</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.180" end="00:04:21.739" style="s2">after I finished my degree what really</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.100" end="00:04:23.960" style="s2">struck me was how much continents there</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.739" end="00:04:28.100" style="s2">was between Peterson&#39;s own account of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.960" end="00:04:30.680" style="s2">modernity and a lot of the more overtly</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.100" end="00:04:32.060" style="s2">reactionary critiques of modern life</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.680" end="00:04:33.410" style="s2">that you found in many of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.060" end="00:04:35.540" style="s2">theoretical figures that he drew upon</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:38.660" style="s2">people like Friedrich Nietzsche Carl</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.540" end="00:04:42.290" style="s2">Jung or Martin Heidegger and what</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.660" end="00:04:43.370" style="s2">surprised me was actually how little</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.290" end="00:04:45.410" style="s2">deviation there actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.370" end="00:04:47.410" style="s2">was in his own Academy identity and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.410" end="00:04:50.150" style="s2">lot of what these figures were saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.410" end="00:04:51.650" style="s2">there were some novel innovations that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.150" end="00:04:54.139" style="s2">he made certainly psychologically and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.650" end="00:04:55.490" style="s2">bring them up to date using you know the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.139" end="00:04:58.400" style="s2">best kind of scientific literature that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.490" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">was available in the 1990s but there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.400" end="00:05:01.550" style="s2">nothing that Peterson was really arguing</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:02.510" style="s2">against modern life</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.550" end="00:05:04.370" style="s2">or for that matter against the</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.510" end="00:05:06.590" style="s2">contemporary left that would have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.370" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">obscure - Heidegger or even someone like</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.590" end="00:05:10.970" style="s2">Nietzsche and this made me start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:14.300" style="s2">think that there might be space to</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.970" end="00:05:17.000" style="s2">develop a left-wing critique of Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.300" end="00:05:19.070" style="s2">that resembled many of the left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.000" end="00:05:21.620" style="s2">critiques that were developed of these</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.070" end="00:05:23.330" style="s2">figures at earlier points particularly</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.620" end="00:05:25.789" style="s2">in the back of my mind Adorno&#39;s critique</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.330" end="00:05:28.220" style="s2">of Heidegger came to mine Adorno</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.789" end="00:05:29.690" style="s2">famously castigated Heidegger for saying</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.220" end="00:05:31.520" style="s2">that you think modern life is rubbish</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.690" end="00:05:33.800" style="s2">and it&#39;s all the faults of Technology</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.520" end="00:05:35.090" style="s2">and cultural changes but nowhere do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.800" end="00:05:37.430" style="s2">really speak that much about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.090" end="00:05:39.110" style="s2">influence of capital moderns machinery</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.430" end="00:05:40.669" style="s2">in modern media and so on and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.110" end="00:05:44.240" style="s2">everything kind of operates at this</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.669" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">highly idealized level and so that was</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.240" end="00:05:48.919" style="s2">the genesis of the book back in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:50.360" style="s2">where I just started to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.919" end="00:05:52.340" style="s2">few different ideas of what it was that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.360" end="00:05:54.950" style="s2">I wanted to say on this point did a deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.340" end="00:05:58.250" style="s2">dive into a lot of Peterson&#39;s writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.950" end="00:06:00.500" style="s2">and the writing around him I started to</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.250" end="00:06:02.450" style="s2">publish a series of articles for small</p>

<p begin="00:06:10.940" end="00:06:14.449" style="s2">really surprised me was people were very</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.340" end="00:06:16.849" style="s2">receptive to this there was a real</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.849" end="00:06:20.870" style="s2">of his work from a left-wing perspective</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.190" end="00:06:31.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t want to do this alone since I</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.720" end="00:06:34.190" style="s2">certainly don&#39;t have the area of</p>

<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:40.490" style="s2">is why our other co-authors got on board</p>

<p begin="00:07:18.690" end="00:07:22.889" style="s2">criticisms of their work but one of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.910" end="00:07:24.330" style="s2">things that I said is that I believe</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.889" end="00:07:27.950" style="s2">that Peterson is right that in many</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.330" end="00:07:32.580" style="s2">senses Modern Life does have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.950" end="00:07:34.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a great sense of desolation and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.580" end="00:07:37.460" style="s2">people feel a tremendous lack of meaning</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.530" end="00:07:40.680" style="s2">and modern and now postmodern life that</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.460" end="00:07:43.110" style="s2">we need to find solution for the problem</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.680" end="00:07:44.639" style="s2">that I had with Peterson of course was</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.110" end="00:07:46.530" style="s2">that much like Heidegger and Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.639" end="00:07:48.870" style="s2">of your know where does he actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.530" end="00:07:51.060" style="s2">account for how capital might play a</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.870" end="00:07:54.990" style="s2">role in generating this sense of enemy</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.060" end="00:07:56.580" style="s2">and the sense of meaninglessness and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.990" end="00:07:58.380" style="s2">think it&#39;s actually extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.580" end="00:08:00.690" style="s2">to take note of this since as far back</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.380" end="00:08:02.220" style="s2">as Marx and Engels writing in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.690" end="00:08:04.110" style="s2">Communist Manifesto where they pointed</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.220" end="00:08:06.000" style="s2">out that under capitalist conditions all</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.110" end="00:08:08.250" style="s2">that is solid melts into the air people</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.000" end="00:08:10.020" style="s2">were away about how traditionalist and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.250" end="00:08:12.510" style="s2">sacred forms of life were being</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.020" end="00:08:14.580" style="s2">absolutely corroded by processes of</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.510" end="00:08:16.350" style="s2">industrialization and capitalization and</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.580" end="00:08:19.530" style="s2">that this was more to remake the world</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.350" end="00:08:22.169" style="s2">in many ways for the better but also in</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.530" end="00:08:24.000" style="s2">many ways for the worst because people</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.169" end="00:08:26.100" style="s2">would now not have a sense of stability</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.000" end="00:08:28.260" style="s2">on which so many of us depend for our</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.100" end="00:08:30.539" style="s2">sources of self and that earlier</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.260" end="00:08:32.700" style="s2">generations were more easily able to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.539" end="00:08:34.979" style="s2">avail themselves than people in</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.700" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">modernity and now post modernity and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.979" end="00:08:38.870" style="s2">other thing that I criticized Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:42.000" style="s2">for was on a more constructive dimension</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.870" end="00:08:44.370" style="s2">arguing that he likes to characterize</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.000" end="00:08:46.700" style="s2">himself variously as kind of classical</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.370" end="00:08:49.170" style="s2">liberal I think even more correctly</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.700" end="00:08:51.330" style="s2">situated as what sometimes called an</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.170" end="00:08:52.589" style="s2">ordered Liberty conservative which has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.330" end="00:08:55.980" style="s2">tradition going back to people like</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.589" end="00:08:57.900" style="s2">Edmund Burke and I said I actually don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.980" end="00:09:00.540" style="s2">think this kind of ordered Liberty</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:02.820" style="s2">approach to liberalism and freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.540" end="00:09:05.580" style="s2">equality is appropriate what I actually</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.820" end="00:09:08.070" style="s2">think that we need to do is establish</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.580" end="00:09:10.680" style="s2">something like a rosy and liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.070" end="00:09:12.360" style="s2">socialist state where we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.680" end="00:09:14.040" style="s2">don&#39;t talk about meritocracy or</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.360" end="00:09:15.839" style="s2">hierarchies of competence without</p>

<p begin="00:09:19.050" end="00:09:22.560" style="s2">something like the difference principle</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.220" end="00:09:24.600" style="s2">or another egalitarian principle of</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.560" end="00:09:26.850" style="s2">distribution and one of the things I</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.600" end="00:09:28.560" style="s2">point out is that nowhere and is lengthy</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.850" end="00:09:30.720" style="s2">screeds about competence hierarchies</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.560" end="00:09:32.130" style="s2">does he anywhere talk about the fact</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.720" end="00:09:34.830" style="s2">that for many contemporary liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.130" end="00:09:37.410" style="s2">authors you can&#39;t just have unbridled</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.830" end="00:09:38.910" style="s2">capitalism liberalism actually demands a</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.410" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">very serious redistribution of wealth</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.410" end="00:09:47.880" style="s2">to actually call yourself a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.820" end="00:09:50.040" style="s2">state and I put a little bit of pressure</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.880" end="00:09:52.110" style="s2">on him in that respect at the end of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.040" end="00:09:53.310" style="s2">book but I&#39;m almost out of time so</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.110" end="00:09:55.620" style="s2">people want to ask questions about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.310" end="00:10:05.760" style="s2">I&#39;ll be happy to take that they draw so</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.620" end="00:10:09.750" style="s2">I think it&#39;s Conrad&#39;s to yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.760" end="00:10:12.209" style="s2">interesting about what not said about</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.750" end="00:10:14.730" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s liberalism because that</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.209" end="00:10:16.470" style="s2">became you know sort of from a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.730" end="00:10:20.279" style="s2">standpoint a significant point of</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.470" end="00:10:21.959" style="s2">investigation for me but you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.279" end="00:10:23.820" style="s2">I think what intrigued me about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.959" end="00:10:26.730" style="s2">project is the fact that responses to</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.820" end="00:10:29.459" style="s2">Jordan Peterson or so totally divisive</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.730" end="00:10:32.400" style="s2">right so in one side you see him</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.459" end="00:10:34.920" style="s2">portrayed as you know an unrepentant</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.400" end="00:10:36.540" style="s2">chauvinist if not fascist who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.920" end="00:10:38.610" style="s2">evolutionarily tinged self-help</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.540" end="00:10:41.220" style="s2">philosophy reprises the worst prejudices</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.610" end="00:10:42.839" style="s2">of Carl Jung pseudo-scientific mysticism</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.220" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">and the other often you see him</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.839" end="00:10:46.050" style="s2">portrayed as a benign liberal</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:49.260" style="s2">conservative whose calls for men and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.050" end="00:10:50.820" style="s2">women who like to toughen up represents</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.260" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">a welcomed corrective to decades of</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.820" end="00:10:55.740" style="s2">overstretching by meddlesome</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.800" end="00:10:57.240" style="s2">progressives and I think that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.740" end="00:10:59.339" style="s2">interesting about this is that you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.240" end="00:11:02.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a certain truth to both of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.339" end="00:11:04.380" style="s2">these images what I&#39;ll referred to as</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.100" end="00:11:07.020" style="s2">sort of the exoteric and esoteric images</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.380" end="00:11:09.810" style="s2">of Peterson I mean twelve rules for life</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.020" end="00:11:11.850" style="s2">has sold three million copies so I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.810" end="00:11:13.709" style="s2">it&#39;s safe to say that not every robot is</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.850" end="00:11:16.860" style="s2">you know marching out of tiki torches</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.709" end="00:11:18.390" style="s2">throwing Zeke Hales but you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.860" end="00:11:21.450" style="s2">it&#39;s similarly it would be also</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.390" end="00:11:23.010" style="s2">disingenuous to say that Peterson&#39;s only</p>

<p begin="00:11:26.070" end="00:11:29.580" style="s2">happy about really because if that were</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.290" end="00:11:31.110" style="s2">the case he would have never become a</p>

<p begin="00:11:31.110" end="00:11:34.770" style="s2">of Toronto he never would have been</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.770" end="00:11:37.890" style="s2">way was and he never would have</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.890" end="00:11:45.000" style="s2">right but in my account actually Zone in</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.709" end="00:11:47.010" style="s2">on an interesting episode that occurred</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.000" end="00:11:48.029" style="s2">I discuss a lot of things throughout my</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.010" end="00:11:51.330" style="s2">part of the book but I&#39;m just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.029" end="00:11:53.130" style="s2">focus on this a bit I discuss something</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.330" end="00:11:54.860" style="s2">that happened at at Lafayette College</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.130" end="00:12:00.890" style="s2">and there was an interesting question</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.860" end="00:12:02.940" style="s2">Peterson was posed about race and IQ and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.890" end="00:12:04.980" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not here to try to crucify</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.940" end="00:12:06.360" style="s2">Peterson for you know violating the</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.980" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">tenants of political correctness but I</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.360" end="00:12:09.899" style="s2">actually think it&#39;s important in terms</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">of clarifying his larger sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.899" end="00:12:14.250" style="s2">ideology so when he&#39;s asked a question</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:16.920" style="s2">about the fact that certain races have</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.250" end="00:12:20.010" style="s2">different IQs and what he thinks about</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.920" end="00:12:21.510" style="s2">the validity of the science Peterson at</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.010" end="00:12:23.160" style="s2">first sort of hesitates he says you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.510" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">I don&#39;t like answering this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.160" end="00:12:25.290" style="s2">question because it means you&#39;ll get you</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:28.410" style="s2">get killed</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.290" end="00:12:33.450" style="s2">right but of course Peterson being</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.410" end="00:12:34.620" style="s2">Peterson he does give a response and you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.450" end="00:12:37.200" style="s2">know there&#39;s a kind of misdirection</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.620" end="00:12:39.870" style="s2">that&#39;s involved in his response because</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.200" end="00:12:42.450" style="s2">this is very characteristically Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.870" end="00:12:44.399" style="s2">he sort of digresses into a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.450" end="00:12:46.980" style="s2">about the public misapprehension of</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.399" end="00:12:48.570" style="s2">statistics so he points out that often</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.980" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">when we read statistics what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.570" end="00:12:52.440" style="s2">understand is what he calls the tale</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:55.230" style="s2">problem right so the way that if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.440" end="00:12:58.260" style="s2">take even one standard deviation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.230" end="00:13:00.779" style="s2">difference in IQ right so Ashkenazi Jews</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.260" end="00:13:02.520" style="s2">for example one standard deviation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.779" end="00:13:03.000" style="s2">difference in terms of IQ higher than</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.520" end="00:13:06.660" style="s2">other groups</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.000" end="00:13:08.100" style="s2">this will really manifest extremely at</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.660" end="00:13:10.709" style="s2">the high end of the spectrum so it&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.100" end="00:13:13.200" style="s2">a lot of Ashkenazi geniuses you know and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.709" end="00:13:16.170" style="s2">then he talks about how you know even</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.200" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">the US military won&#39;t hire individuals</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.170" end="00:13:21.209" style="s2">with IQs under 83 which is about 10% of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:23.370" style="s2">the population in sites this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.209" end="00:13:24.690" style="s2">evidence that you know as a society we</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.370" end="00:13:27.480" style="s2">need to sort of find something to do</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.690" end="00:13:29.610" style="s2">with these people now it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.480" end="00:13:31.500" style="s2">right because in this lecture questions</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.610" end="00:13:33.300" style="s2">about IQ being a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.500" end="00:13:35.940" style="s2">socialization or mostly swept under the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.300" end="00:13:37.890" style="s2">rug on the grounds that IQ is the best</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.940" end="00:13:39.750" style="s2">thing we have right</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.890" end="00:13:43.010" style="s2">but then at the end you see this very</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.750" end="00:13:45.120" style="s2">very characteristic move by Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.010" end="00:13:48.269" style="s2">which is that you know having said all</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.120" end="00:13:50.250" style="s2">of this you know he says that you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.269" end="00:13:51.450" style="s2">but just because people have different</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.250" end="00:13:53.700" style="s2">IQs doesn&#39;t mean that they have a</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.450" end="00:13:57.060" style="s2">different intrinsic value as human</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.700" end="00:13:58.709" style="s2">beings um and I think if we examine this</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.060" end="00:14:01.050" style="s2">it can help us really get to the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.709" end="00:14:03.860" style="s2">of Peterson&#39;s views Peterson describes</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.050" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">himself as a classical British liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.860" end="00:14:09.149" style="s2">but if we&#39;re gonna you know quibble with</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">this characterization one thing we can</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.149" end="00:14:12.540" style="s2">say is that you know within the liberal</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:13.980" style="s2">tradition there&#39;s a sort of qualified</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.540" end="00:14:15.510" style="s2">focus on the importance of a Galit</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.980" end="00:14:18.450" style="s2">arianism right you see this in mill</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.510" end="00:14:20.130" style="s2">Smith etc even Thomas Hobbes thought</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.450" end="00:14:22.529" style="s2">everyone basically had the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.130" end="00:14:24.060" style="s2">kill each other which judge by Peters&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.529" end="00:14:28.769" style="s2">rep Peterson&#39;s reference to the military</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.060" end="00:14:29.850" style="s2">he might be skeptical though but really</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.769" end="00:14:31.920" style="s2">if you look at Peterson&#39;s views</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.850" end="00:14:33.089" style="s2">egalitarianism you know hints it well we</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.920" end="00:14:37.170" style="s2">could say you know liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.089" end="00:14:38.670" style="s2">egalitarianism these sort of ideas for</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.170" end="00:14:40.920" style="s2">him they don&#39;t speak to the ontological</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.670" end="00:14:42.630" style="s2">structure of reality right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.920" end="00:14:45.570" style="s2">really just kind of fictions I&#39;ll be it</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.630" end="00:14:47.100" style="s2">important ones right and if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.570" end="00:14:49.740" style="s2">understand this kind of disarticulation</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.100" end="00:14:53.070" style="s2">I think we have to look at how you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.740" end="00:14:55.200" style="s2">you you said that you know I&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.070" end="00:14:59.100" style="s2">inveterate Democrat but I believe nature</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.200" end="00:15:01.290" style="s2">is aristocratic and esoteric so for</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.100" end="00:15:02.430" style="s2">Peterson nature which is there&#39;s a sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.290" end="00:15:05.610" style="s2">of structural affiliation with the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.430" end="00:15:07.230" style="s2">unconscious is largely at ARCIC right</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.610" end="00:15:08.880" style="s2">and we see this in the first chapter of</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.230" end="00:15:10.410" style="s2">12 the rules for life stand up straight</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.880" end="00:15:13.649" style="s2">with your shoulders back for example</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.410" end="00:15:16.050" style="s2">when he says it&#39;s a winner it&#39;s winner</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.649" end="00:15:18.149" style="s2">take all in the lobster world just as it</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.050" end="00:15:19.709" style="s2">is in human societies for the top one</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.149" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">percent have as much loot as the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.709" end="00:15:24.149" style="s2">50% and were the richest 85 people have</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:27.630" style="s2">as much as the bottom three and a half</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.149" end="00:15:29.790" style="s2">billion and for Peterson this affords</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.630" end="00:15:32.520" style="s2">proof of how prices law holds in nature</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.790" end="00:15:35.910" style="s2">dictating differential production or the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.520" end="00:15:37.529" style="s2">necessity of differential production now</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.910" end="00:15:39.750" style="s2">this has an implication for how Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.529" end="00:15:41.610" style="s2">perceives capitalism because in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.750" end="00:15:43.709" style="s2">certain way Peterson doesn&#39;t support</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.610" end="00:15:45.329" style="s2">capitalism in spite of its inequality he</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.709" end="00:15:47.370" style="s2">supports it because of its inequality</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.329" end="00:15:50.220" style="s2">now he would never say of course I like</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.370" end="00:15:51.690" style="s2">inequality but the point here is that in</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.220" end="00:15:53.570" style="s2">Peterson system if</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.690" end="00:15:56.640" style="s2">you attempt to diverge from this</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.570" end="00:15:58.320" style="s2">naturalized inequality you know what can</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.640" end="00:16:00.960" style="s2">happen very easily is that you lapse</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.320" end="00:16:03.630" style="s2">into totalitarianism right and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.960" end="00:16:06.210" style="s2">totalitarianism this sort of is in turn</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.630" end="00:16:08.580" style="s2">feminized due to its relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.210" end="00:16:10.920" style="s2">you know left side of the brain matter</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.580" end="00:16:12.510" style="s2">archetype of feminine chaos devouring</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.920" end="00:16:15.630" style="s2">mother and so on if we really get into</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.510" end="00:16:16.950" style="s2">the structure of Peterson&#39;s work but but</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.630" end="00:16:19.230" style="s2">I think this really gets to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.950" end="00:16:21.480" style="s2">of it right which is because if you</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.230" end="00:16:23.850" style="s2">don&#39;t by the way that he marries you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.480" end="00:16:26.010" style="s2">mean archetypal archetypal structures to</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.850" end="00:16:27.980" style="s2">evolutionary psychology which is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.010" end="00:16:31.290" style="s2">rickety intellectual edifice to be sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.980" end="00:16:34.290" style="s2">none of it really holds water right so</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.290" end="00:16:36.390" style="s2">he&#39;ll for example like heel heel site</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.290" end="00:16:37.980" style="s2">it&#39;s often a very dubious study by</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.390" end="00:16:40.590" style="s2">student Giri</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.980" end="00:16:42.480" style="s2">that shows how women and gender equal</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.590" end="00:16:44.850" style="s2">nations relatively gender equal nations</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.480" end="00:16:49.590" style="s2">like in Scandinavia are less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.850" end="00:16:51.330" style="s2">study STEM fields and you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.590" end="00:16:52.680" style="s2">thing is even if that even if that were</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.330" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.680" end="00:16:57.600" style="s2">Peterson draws a sort of peculiar</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:16:59.640" style="s2">conclusion from this which is that you</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.600" end="00:17:01.140" style="s2">know this owns two inherent biological</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.640" end="00:17:04.620" style="s2">differences and that the biological</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.140" end="00:17:05.910" style="s2">basis of this is crystal clear this sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.620" end="00:17:07.589" style="s2">of thing would only make sense if you</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.910" end="00:17:10.260" style="s2">accepted the idea that Sweden or Norway</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.589" end="00:17:11.699" style="s2">or so gender equalized that the only</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.260" end="00:17:14.699" style="s2">deviation interest in STEM fields</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.699" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">between men and women you know that they</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.699" end="00:17:20.069" style="s2">have to reflect biological substructures</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:21.360" style="s2">but this is kind of an odd conclusion to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.069" end="00:17:23.339" style="s2">reach given that there were very few</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.360" end="00:17:28.530" style="s2">women doing stem even in these countries</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.339" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">fifty years ago um and so I think again</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.530" end="00:17:31.860" style="s2">we see this I&#39;m just being very</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:33.450" style="s2">schematic here you know I know maybe in</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.860" end="00:17:35.130" style="s2">the questions we can elaborate a little</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.450" end="00:17:36.540" style="s2">bit but I think you know you have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.130" end="00:17:39.030" style="s2">sort of understand this conscious</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.540" end="00:17:42.030" style="s2">unconscious exoteric esoteric divide and</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.030" end="00:17:43.830" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work and I think this actual</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.030" end="00:17:45.840" style="s2">division between a kind of exoteric</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.830" end="00:17:47.790" style="s2">embrace of liberalism and an esoteric</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.340" end="00:18:09.750" style="s2">we could say that the alt-right is kind</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.340" end="00:18:25.260" style="s2">for a POC recei can we really blame some</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.010" end="00:18:26.580" style="s2">of his followers for taking pic taking</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.260" end="00:18:30.540" style="s2">his ideas to what seems to be their</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.580" end="00:18:32.790" style="s2">apotheosis if individuals such as those</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.540" end="00:18:33.390" style="s2">in the alt right or Peterson shadow this</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.790" end="00:18:38.550" style="s2">much is clear</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.390" end="00:18:51.050" style="s2">he casts a long shadow over them - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.550" end="00:18:51.050" style="s2">that&#39;s my presentation my my section was</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.170" end="00:19:00.360" style="s2">from a more family assistance standpoint</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.960" end="00:19:02.730" style="s2">and also at the very end I kind of tried</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.360" end="00:19:05.610" style="s2">to point out Peterson&#39;s hypocracy when</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.730" end="00:19:08.750" style="s2">talking about women&#39;s issues and</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.610" end="00:19:10.920" style="s2">especially like us like of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.750" end="00:19:12.870" style="s2">activities that have okayed right for</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.920" end="00:19:16.770" style="s2">than a transparent of women in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.870" end="00:19:19.410" style="s2">society the reason why like I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.770" end="00:19:22.320" style="s2">Canadian right and I knew very little</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.410" end="00:19:25.740" style="s2">about Pedersen by the time math kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.320" end="00:19:28.730" style="s2">started to to dwell into his thought but</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.740" end="00:19:32.130" style="s2">one of the reasons I made a difference I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.730" end="00:19:36.840" style="s2">decided to go into these was because</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.130" end="00:19:43.650" style="s2">when I start engaging with Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:48.210" style="s2">public yeah like his interviews etc like</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.650" end="00:19:51.750" style="s2">what I saw was a very similar way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.210" end="00:19:55.650" style="s2">talking about feminism against feminism</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.750" end="00:19:57.690" style="s2">of course then the very similar what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.650" end="00:20:00.120" style="s2">will see in Mexico for example when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.690" end="00:20:04.100" style="s2">from from very conservative and</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.120" end="00:20:07.680" style="s2">reactionary people there so what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.100" end="00:20:11.280" style="s2">interested me was why is it like right</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.680" end="00:20:13.590" style="s2">like what&#39;s happening or what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.280" end="00:20:16.039" style="s2">right about these issues that people</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.590" end="00:20:21.499" style="s2">from very dissimilar backgrounds</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.039" end="00:20:25.929" style="s2">like kind of pink semen in similar ways</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.499" end="00:20:30.529" style="s2">right about feminism so that was like my</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.929" end="00:20:34.070" style="s2">motivation and what I wrote was</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.529" end="00:20:36.769" style="s2">basically like first or my my section is</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.070" end="00:20:40.659" style="s2">divided in four points first I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.769" end="00:20:48.229" style="s2">address his anti-semitism how he</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.659" end="00:20:51.440" style="s2">basically hides this truly anti-feminist</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.229" end="00:20:54.470" style="s2">position by saying that he&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.440" end="00:20:56.659" style="s2">against radical feminism so I tried to</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.470" end="00:20:59.389" style="s2">dwell a little bit on how that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.659" end="00:21:00.769" style="s2">true he&#39;s actually an anti-feminist just</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.389" end="00:21:02.779" style="s2">in disguise</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.769" end="00:21:04.700" style="s2">the second part of like it&#39;s like my</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.779" end="00:21:07.970" style="s2">second point I made was about how he</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.700" end="00:21:09.859" style="s2">uses tyranny and he confers feminism</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.970" end="00:21:16.460" style="s2">with tyranny right and he come first</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.859" end="00:21:18.169" style="s2">like some of the like conquest like all</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.460" end="00:21:20.720" style="s2">sorts of families have done over the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.169" end="00:21:26.149" style="s2">years with basically tyranny so when I</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.720" end="00:21:28.429" style="s2">said there was firstly that it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.149" end="00:21:31.190" style="s2">a word a weird critique the one that he</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.429" end="00:21:34.129" style="s2">makes because he kind of says the third</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.190" end="00:21:36.349" style="s2">aesthetic tyrants right and sometimes or</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.129" end="00:21:38.119" style="s2">implies that families are tires because</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.349" end="00:21:42.409" style="s2">the problem my problem with Arizona at</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.119" end="00:21:44.570" style="s2">least he said he is clearly not so you</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.409" end="00:21:47.690" style="s2">can draw some constant like some</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.570" end="00:21:50.239" style="s2">conclusions from his thought but also at</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.690" end="00:21:52.429" style="s2">the same time he could like these stunts</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.239" end="00:21:54.229" style="s2">himself by saying oh I didn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.429" end="00:21:57.499" style="s2">right like he kind of bleeds you in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.229" end="00:22:00.529" style="s2">way or that&#39;s my the way I see it and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.499" end="00:22:02.779" style="s2">think I&#39;ve heard been like express a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.529" end="00:22:05.059" style="s2">sentiment at some point and elsewhere I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.779" end="00:22:07.460" style="s2">like he kind of points somewhere but</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.059" end="00:22:10.909" style="s2">when you go there he says oh no I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.460" end="00:22:13.820" style="s2">really pointing there right so but when</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.909" end="00:22:16.580" style="s2">I say that or reading other or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.820" end="00:22:19.399" style="s2">like other text other he sticks like</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.580" end="00:22:21.289" style="s2">what I see is he kind of talks of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.399" end="00:22:23.269" style="s2">tyranny in the sense of like a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.289" end="00:22:25.669" style="s2">government almost like a government</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.269" end="00:22:26.659" style="s2">apparatus right it&#39;s not run from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.669" end="00:22:29.499" style="s2">government of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.659" end="00:22:31.609" style="s2">for that it&#39;s like almost like that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.499" end="00:22:34.039" style="s2">social justice movements including</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.609" end="00:22:38.090" style="s2">feminism there right like I have this</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.039" end="00:22:41.389" style="s2">very tyrannical like or operated in like</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.090" end="00:22:43.940" style="s2">this like mechanism of tyranny right so</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.389" end="00:22:45.619" style="s2">I criticize that very saying wife to</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.940" end="00:22:48.049" style="s2">think he&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.619" end="00:22:50.210" style="s2">my third critique has to do with like</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.049" end="00:22:56.330" style="s2">hierarchy as a as Conrad and Matt</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.210" end="00:22:59.479" style="s2">already mentioned right how like when he</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.330" end="00:23:01.580" style="s2">speaks of like hierarchies in right of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.479" end="00:23:06.229" style="s2">course when it has to do with gender and</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.580" end="00:23:09.259" style="s2">sex like he mentally means leaves us</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.229" end="00:23:13.460" style="s2">like in a lot of ways my first issue was</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.259" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">at he says that was like biology like</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.460" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">evolutionary biology for example</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.109" end="00:23:24.499" style="s2">basically says right how like males tend</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.580" end="00:23:26.119" style="s2">to be the way pillars of characterized</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.499" end="00:23:28.879" style="s2">them right or top of the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.119" end="00:23:31.099" style="s2">because of their sex traits and what</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.879" end="00:23:32.779" style="s2">idea was these beauties because actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.099" end="00:23:35.419" style="s2">there&#39;s no consensus in evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.779" end="00:23:38.450" style="s2">biology about these hypotheses right it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.419" end="00:23:40.700" style="s2">is remain a hypothesis and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.450" end="00:23:42.529" style="s2">true and finally what I wanted to point</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.700" end="00:23:46.029" style="s2">out is that hypocracy right because</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.529" end="00:23:48.409" style="s2">Peterson like kind of is against this</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.029" end="00:23:51.049" style="s2">victimization culture like oh you</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.409" end="00:23:52.729" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be a big team like this is the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.049" end="00:23:54.999" style="s2">whole problem with feminists right like</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.729" end="00:23:58.249" style="s2">they wanna frame themselves as victims</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.999" end="00:24:00.529" style="s2">this is wrong because you have to like</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.249" end="00:24:03.289" style="s2">what he says facing it right like make</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.529" end="00:24:05.029" style="s2">your bed and just uh procreate like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.289" end="00:24:07.070" style="s2">don&#39;t take responsibility of yourself</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.029" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">right so I pointed out how this is where</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.070" end="00:24:13.940" style="s2">you have a critical because when he</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:16.849" style="s2">talks about the effects that what he</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.940" end="00:24:21.769" style="s2">sees feminists have done to men he</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.849" end="00:24:24.710" style="s2">certainly speaks of men in a very like</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.769" end="00:24:27.139" style="s2">from I think men were the victims right</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.710" end="00:24:30.649" style="s2">the victims of these bad feminist and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.139" end="00:24:32.599" style="s2">like look at all these like sad men</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.649" end="00:24:34.639" style="s2">right like most of what happened is not</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.599" end="00:24:37.759" style="s2">only what Matt said right like modernity</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.639" end="00:24:40.710" style="s2">and he&#39;s like the problems with</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.759" end="00:24:42.809" style="s2">capitalism etcetera but it to me see</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.710" end="00:24:46.649" style="s2">that he also plays of course what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.809" end="00:24:48.690" style="s2">happening to men mostly to like it likes</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.649" end="00:24:51.960" style="s2">it already he pins it on feminism right</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.690" end="00:24:54.240" style="s2">so I wanted to address how he just is</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.960" end="00:24:56.940" style="s2">very selective on heustis brief him</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.240" end="00:24:59.580" style="s2">rhetoric when like denying these</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.940" end="00:25:02.640" style="s2">victimhood to women but he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.580" end="00:25:06.059" style="s2">willing to give this label to men so</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.640" end="00:25:11.940" style="s2">that was like those are like the general</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.059" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">things that I I talked in my section and</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.940" end="00:25:18.059" style="s2">I think Ben you&#39;re our last speaker last</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:24.360" style="s2">but not least is our set alright grades</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.059" end="00:25:29.460" style="s2">uh so I guess the way that I originally</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.360" end="00:25:32.070" style="s2">will actually in a way everything that</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.460" end="00:25:33.720" style="s2">I&#39;m doing right now is thanks to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.070" end="00:25:39.000" style="s2">Peterson so thank you for that dr.</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.720" end="00:25:44.159" style="s2">Peterson because a few years ago what I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.000" end="00:25:47.010" style="s2">was doing with my time was writing</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.159" end="00:25:50.309" style="s2">academic papers about philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.010" end="00:25:52.279" style="s2">logic which you know as matt said you</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.309" end="00:25:56.370" style="s2">don&#39;t really expect anybody to read and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.279" end="00:25:58.559" style="s2">and then also spending far too much of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.370" end="00:26:00.419" style="s2">my time arguing with members of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.559" end="00:26:05.730" style="s2">extended family who were fans of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.419" end="00:26:08.279" style="s2">Peterson and this has led me when when</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.730" end="00:26:10.710" style="s2">my friend Dan Lane is the editor of zero</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.279" end="00:26:15.149" style="s2">books was organizing a couple of years</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.710" end="00:26:17.460" style="s2">ago a conference it was it was called</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.149" end="00:26:20.549" style="s2">Jordan Peterson a conference in lieu of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.460" end="00:26:23.610" style="s2">a debate because Doug had invited</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.549" end="00:26:25.980" style="s2">Peterson to be on his zero books podcast</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.610" end="00:26:29.669" style="s2">and Peterson had initially taken the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.980" end="00:26:31.350" style="s2">invitation and then he realized that it</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.669" end="00:26:33.529" style="s2">was going to be ideologically hostile</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.350" end="00:26:37.559" style="s2">territory so he cancelled the interview</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.529" end="00:26:40.140" style="s2">about a couple weeks before going on Joe</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.559" end="00:26:41.669" style="s2">Rogan and Rogan said hey man why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.140" end="00:26:44.760" style="s2">you ever have a debate with one of these</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.669" end="00:26:47.190" style="s2">equality of outcome Marxist and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.760" end="00:26:51.809" style="s2">Peterson said oh because they don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.190" end="00:26:54.460" style="s2">to talk to me so so so Doug organized</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.809" end="00:26:56.530" style="s2">this conference and since I had its</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.460" end="00:26:59.200" style="s2">a lot of time thinking about Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.530" end="00:27:01.630" style="s2">just for the purpose of you know arguing</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.200" end="00:27:04.380" style="s2">with relatives of mine you know who were</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.630" end="00:27:08.560" style="s2">much more enamored with him that I am I</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.380" end="00:27:11.080" style="s2">I said hey I&#39;d like to you know I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.560" end="00:27:13.210" style="s2">submit an abstract the conference and he</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.080" end="00:27:15.010" style="s2">said actually I was thinking maybe you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.210" end="00:27:16.300" style="s2">like to write this other book for us and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.010" end="00:27:18.820" style="s2">he laid it you know he sort of pitched</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.300" end="00:27:20.590" style="s2">to me the idea of the first book that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.820" end="00:27:23.380" style="s2">wrote for them and everything&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.590" end="00:27:26.890" style="s2">followed from that but I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.380" end="00:27:30.760" style="s2">just briefly you know what you know some</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.890" end="00:27:32.230" style="s2">of I think one one way to start this</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.760" end="00:27:33.940" style="s2">would be to connect to something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.230" end="00:27:36.400" style="s2">already come up with both Conrad and</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.940" end="00:27:39.090" style="s2">Matt&#39;s presentations which is Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.400" end="00:27:42.330" style="s2">relationship to classical liberalism so</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.090" end="00:27:46.660" style="s2">to my you know my perspective on this</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.330" end="00:27:50.020" style="s2">since some thinkers like like you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.660" end="00:27:51.850" style="s2">cons David Hume were very much in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.020" end="00:27:53.650" style="s2">classical liberal tradition or certainly</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.850" end="00:27:56.710" style="s2">people who are academic interests of</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.650" end="00:28:00.660" style="s2">mine I&#39;ve taught class is about and so</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.710" end="00:28:04.300" style="s2">when I when I see anybody write say in</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.660" end="00:28:08.350" style="s2">2020 on a classical liberal I get very</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.300" end="00:28:10.060" style="s2">confused by that because my perspective</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.350" end="00:28:11.680" style="s2">is that it&#39;s not so much the Petersons</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.060" end="00:28:15.960" style="s2">he is a classical liberal or he isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.680" end="00:28:18.040" style="s2">classical liberal as the very idea that</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.960" end="00:28:19.810" style="s2">classical liberalism names a</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.040" end="00:28:22.720" style="s2">contemporary political position is</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.810" end="00:28:24.640" style="s2">slightly bizarre if you go back and look</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.720" end="00:28:27.490" style="s2">at the actual normative and political</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.640" end="00:28:29.350" style="s2">views of people like Locke or can&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.490" end="00:28:31.720" style="s2">bear are no resemblance to anything to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.350" end="00:28:35.110" style="s2">anybody like the libertarian centrist</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.720" end="00:28:37.980" style="s2">anybody thinks today in terms of a lot</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.110" end="00:28:43.270" style="s2">of their specific views on subjects like</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.980" end="00:28:45.340" style="s2">slavery and and race relations but they</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.270" end="00:28:48.400" style="s2">do bear some you know the resemblance</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.340" end="00:28:52.150" style="s2">that bear is one that&#39;s to every</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.400" end="00:28:53.860" style="s2">contemporary position and so on so on</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.150" end="00:28:55.690" style="s2">the one hand nobody as a classical</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.860" end="00:28:57.160" style="s2">liberal today any more than anybody as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.690" end="00:28:59.560" style="s2">young again we had or a member of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.160" end="00:29:01.860" style="s2">Jacobin Club today they&#39;re sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.560" end="00:29:04.930" style="s2">issues that define classical liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.860" end="00:29:06.040" style="s2">refer to a world that no longer exists</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.930" end="00:29:07.590" style="s2">in capitals were</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.040" end="00:29:10.450" style="s2">and out of feudalism and reacting to</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.590" end="00:29:13.080" style="s2">feudal institutions and church power and</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.450" end="00:29:15.730" style="s2">all of those things but on another level</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.080" end="00:29:17.500" style="s2">everybody today is a classical liberal</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.730" end="00:29:19.680" style="s2">the basic assumptions of classical</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.500" end="00:29:21.940" style="s2">liberalism are part of the DNA of</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.680" end="00:29:25.990" style="s2">everything from libertarianism to</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.940" end="00:29:27.520" style="s2">Buckley at conservativism to Marxism you</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.990" end="00:29:29.290" style="s2">know you can talk about a broad sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.520" end="00:29:31.090" style="s2">the philosophical liberalism like what</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.290" end="00:29:32.800" style="s2">we&#39;re all talks about you know which</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.090" end="00:29:36.220" style="s2">which sort of starts from the assumption</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.800" end="00:29:38.680" style="s2">that everybody has equal worth but</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.220" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a but you know that&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.680" end="00:29:42.910" style="s2">know but that&#39;s not specific to</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:46.870" style="s2">classical liberalism right that&#39;s even</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.910" end="00:29:50.800" style="s2">broader all right so so what do I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.870" end="00:29:52.690" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s political position is well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.800" end="00:29:54.250" style="s2">don&#39;t think is fascist right you know I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.690" end="00:29:57.070" style="s2">think that would be that&#39;ll be a silly</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.250" end="00:29:59.080" style="s2">thing to say but there&#39;s also I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.070" end="00:30:06.970" style="s2">for what my perspectives an equally</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.080" end="00:30:09.040" style="s2">silly home what I think is the equally</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.970" end="00:30:14.410" style="s2">fake so we think that that many people</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.040" end="00:30:16.840" style="s2">say is is Peterson as it&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.410" end="00:30:19.180" style="s2">you know it&#39;s a psychologist is a</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.840" end="00:30:20.680" style="s2">self-help author why are you you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.180" end="00:30:22.560" style="s2">giving him a hard time about his</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.680" end="00:30:25.690" style="s2">political or philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.560" end="00:30:27.340" style="s2">pronouncements because of course he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.690" end="00:30:29.710" style="s2">primarily famous because of his</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.340" end="00:30:31.780" style="s2">political pronouncements he originally</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.710" end="00:30:35.320" style="s2">rocketed to fame because of his crusade</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.780" end="00:30:37.650" style="s2">against c16 to add gender identity into</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.320" end="00:30:40.840" style="s2">Canada&#39;s pre-existing human rights law</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.650" end="00:30:44.440" style="s2">and he interpreted that in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.840" end="00:30:46.510" style="s2">I think extremely legally dubious you</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.440" end="00:30:49.660" style="s2">know I&#39;m I don&#39;t live in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.510" end="00:30:51.340" style="s2">themselves but myself but Matt assures</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.660" end="00:30:55.240" style="s2">me that there are that no one has been</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.340" end="00:31:00.190" style="s2">sent to a pronoun who like just yet but</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.240" end="00:31:02.620" style="s2">in any case uh he constantly talks even</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.190" end="00:31:06.510" style="s2">in his self-help book he talks a lot</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.620" end="00:31:09.100" style="s2">about so-called postmodern Marxism and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.510" end="00:31:12.310" style="s2">and these trends that he generally</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.100" end="00:31:14.890" style="s2">opposes and and I guess I&#39;d like in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.310" end="00:31:17.750" style="s2">last minute you know my remarks and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.890" end="00:31:20.300" style="s2">can get more into this in the Q&amp;A to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.750" end="00:31:21.800" style="s2">just a little bit more about that which</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.300" end="00:31:24.650" style="s2">of course takes us back to the overall</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.800" end="00:31:27.440" style="s2">issue of hierarchy right so and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.650" end="00:31:29.750" style="s2">this came up in in the chat right so is</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.440" end="00:31:31.880" style="s2">is Peterson make it a purely descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.750" end="00:31:33.110" style="s2">claim about hierarchy or is he also make</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.880" end="00:31:36.050" style="s2">an enormity of claim and I&#39;d say a</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.110" end="00:31:38.210" style="s2">little bit of each so his descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.050" end="00:31:41.870" style="s2">claim is that hierarchy is natural and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.210" end="00:31:45.560" style="s2">you know is natural and not and not</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.870" end="00:31:48.110" style="s2">social that it comes from it comes from</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.560" end="00:31:50.930" style="s2">our biology you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.110" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">embedded in these deep archetypes but</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.930" end="00:31:55.150" style="s2">then his normative claim is therefore</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:57.980" style="s2">when you try to mess with it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.150" end="00:32:00.020" style="s2">your that&#39;s that&#39;s just a misguided</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.980" end="00:32:06.020" style="s2">effort it&#39;s like try to make water flow</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.020" end="00:32:07.280" style="s2">up so then so then you so then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.020" end="00:32:09.530" style="s2">gonna lead to all kinds of bad results</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.280" end="00:32:11.090" style="s2">and as you try to you know quality of</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.530" end="00:32:12.740" style="s2">opportunity okay but as you try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.090" end="00:32:14.360" style="s2">enforce equality of outcome which we</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.740" end="00:32:18.730" style="s2">clearly associates with Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.360" end="00:32:22.220" style="s2">feminists etc you are by meddling with</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.730" end="00:32:25.040" style="s2">these things that are etched into the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.220" end="00:32:28.850" style="s2">firmament by trying to meddle with those</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.040" end="00:32:30.530" style="s2">you know you&#39;re on a straight road to to</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.850" end="00:32:32.650" style="s2">repression because when you try to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.530" end="00:32:35.300" style="s2">change human nature you can only end</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.650" end="00:32:36.560" style="s2">with with with the gulag right I mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.300" end="00:32:39.050" style="s2">this this isn&#39;t even really a character</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.560" end="00:32:40.670" style="s2">I mean the kind of says this I could</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.050" end="00:32:42.380" style="s2">point you to some specific videos where</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.670" end="00:32:44.090" style="s2">he kind of says this and I know I meant</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.380" end="00:32:47.540" style="s2">by seven minutes but I&#39;ll just I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.090" end="00:32:49.580" style="s2">wrap up on this point to circle back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.540" end="00:32:53.330" style="s2">the very first thing Peter said at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.580" end="00:32:55.580" style="s2">beginning about you know how in a way it</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.330" end="00:32:58.310" style="s2">seems sort of tone-deaf and of course in</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:33:00.710" style="s2">a way in a way to even you know talk</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.310" end="00:33:03.890" style="s2">about Peterson have feel symposium on</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.710" end="00:33:06.350" style="s2">Peterson as we&#39;re seeing everything that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.890" end="00:33:10.450" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing and I feel that too but in</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.350" end="00:33:16.430" style="s2">a way I feel the opposite that at a time</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.450" end="00:33:20.690" style="s2">when we&#39;re seeing a unprecedented level</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.430" end="00:33:24.140" style="s2">of civil unrest largely by impoverished</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.690" end="00:33:25.760" style="s2">people sparked by state violence I in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.140" end="00:33:28.820" style="s2">way I actually can&#39;t imagine a more</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.760" end="00:33:30.650" style="s2">relevant time to delve into the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.820" end="00:33:31.370" style="s2">whether existing social hierarchies are</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.650" end="00:33:34.220" style="s2">natural</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.370" end="00:33:36.470" style="s2">available or whether they&#39;re contingent</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.220" end="00:33:39.370" style="s2">and we&#39;d better off be better off doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.470" end="00:33:42.950" style="s2">at least without quite a few of them</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.370" end="00:33:45.070" style="s2">great Thank You Ben just to confirm for</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.950" end="00:33:47.240" style="s2">the the four speakers do we have you for</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.070" end="00:33:49.220" style="s2">like seventy five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.240" end="00:33:51.530" style="s2">or is it the hour that we have to head</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.220" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">out seventy five minutes is cool with me</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.530" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">bring us to five thirty yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:33:57.800" style="s2">fine good we usually go for an hour here</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:33:59.270" style="s2">but there looks like there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.800" end="00:34:02.840" style="s2">questions there speak more speakers than</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.270" end="00:34:05.030" style="s2">one so for the seven five minutes so a</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.840" end="00:34:07.309" style="s2">lot of questions the chatbox just a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.030" end="00:34:09.260" style="s2">things this will be recorded so if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.309" end="00:34:11.830" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be on camera just ask me</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.260" end="00:34:14.090" style="s2">to read it on your behalf and I will and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.830" end="00:34:16.820" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna have the heuristic you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.090" end="00:34:17.750" style="s2">have one follow-up question and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.820" end="00:34:20.120" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.750" end="00:34:22.429" style="s2">and I will climb the dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.120" end="00:34:25.040" style="s2">and kick you out of the zoom call if you</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.429" end="00:34:26.690" style="s2">break these protocols and just you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.040" end="00:34:27.980" style="s2">let&#39;s just be polite here cuz I know the</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.690" end="00:34:29.270" style="s2">Peterson gets trigger people get</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.980" end="00:34:32.810" style="s2">triggered on all sides of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.270" end="00:34:35.810" style="s2">when no when he comes up so for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.810" end="00:34:37.940" style="s2">first question max you&#39;ve got a question</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.810" end="00:34:41.090" style="s2">he had a bunch of plus ones about it if</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.940" end="00:34:47.090" style="s2">you can unmute yourself and read it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.090" end="00:34:49.460" style="s2">sure let me go back to it I asked a</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.090" end="00:34:52.010" style="s2">question regarding what Conrad said and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">the question is where does Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.010" end="00:34:56.830" style="s2">actually state that inequality is good</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:34:59.030" style="s2">or implies that he supports capped</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.830" end="00:35:01.880" style="s2">capitalism because it depends or</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.030" end="00:35:04.070" style="s2">reinforces inequality then I added that</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.880" end="00:35:06.200" style="s2">my take on it is that he&#39;s merely I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.070" end="00:35:09.200" style="s2">laying out what he believes are the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.200" end="00:35:11.630" style="s2">facts of inequality and not making a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.200" end="00:35:13.700" style="s2">value judgment about whether or not such</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.630" end="00:35:18.020" style="s2">facts are good or if he agrees with</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.700" end="00:35:20.300" style="s2">those facts rather he&#39;s at least my</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.020" end="00:35:25.370" style="s2">understanding of it simply laying it out</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.300" end="00:35:26.810" style="s2">as he perceives it uh yeah well you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.370" end="00:35:28.100" style="s2">I mean part of what we&#39;re doing here is</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.810" end="00:35:29.720" style="s2">trying to understand the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.100" end="00:35:31.130" style="s2">structure of Peterson&#39;s work right you</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.720" end="00:35:34.130" style="s2">know not not simply to extract</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.130" end="00:35:36.860" style="s2">quotations right you know I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.130" end="00:35:38.960" style="s2">that it&#39;s entirely inherent to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.860" end="00:35:40.430" style="s2">structure of what he&#39;s doing right that</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.960" end="00:35:43.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a normative aspect and this is</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.430" end="00:35:44.180" style="s2">what Ben was touching upon right because</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.280" end="00:35:45.150" style="s2">you know if you look at what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.180" end="00:35:48.119" style="s2">attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.150" end="00:35:52.020" style="s2">in maps of meaning right you know he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.119" end="00:35:53.369" style="s2">attempting to rationalize union</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.020" end="00:35:54.779" style="s2">archetypes right which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.369" end="00:35:57.390" style="s2">cosmology of gender if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.779" end="00:36:00.869" style="s2">psychoanalysis you know with respect to</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.390" end="00:36:02.339" style="s2">neurobiology right you know and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.869" end="00:36:05.299" style="s2">part it&#39;s partly this this tension</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.339" end="00:36:07.440" style="s2">between normative and and descriptive</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.299" end="00:36:08.760" style="s2">you know that allows Peterson to have</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.440" end="00:36:11.670" style="s2">eight questions about this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.760" end="00:36:13.529" style="s2">right but what&#39;s very very clear like</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.670" end="00:36:14.849" style="s2">like the thing is and I where I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.529" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">your question is interesting is I think</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.849" end="00:36:18.809" style="s2">that there&#39;s a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:21.990" style="s2">flexibility in Peterson&#39;s work it is</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.809" end="00:36:24.299" style="s2">true in terms of how we could improve</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.990" end="00:36:27.930" style="s2">the world right so when he uses these</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.299" end="00:36:29.369" style="s2">terms like for example you know equality</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.930" end="00:36:31.559" style="s2">of opportunity versus equality of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.369" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">outcome I mean like an in reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.559" end="00:36:34.410" style="s2">there&#39;s almost no one on the Left who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:36.240" style="s2">ever really defended equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.410" end="00:36:38.430" style="s2">all right even Karl Marx doesn&#39;t defend</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.240" end="00:36:40.140" style="s2">that right you know he criticizes class</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.430" end="00:36:41.369" style="s2">inequality specifically but acknowledges</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.140" end="00:36:43.230" style="s2">that people have you know different</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.369" end="00:36:44.700" style="s2">virtues and you know there are likely to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.230" end="00:36:48.150" style="s2">be hierarchies that emerge on that basis</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.700" end="00:36:52.440" style="s2">right so there&#39;s an amorphousness right</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.150" end="00:36:54.599" style="s2">with respect to this and so so again my</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.440" end="00:36:56.430" style="s2">point is what does it mean right a</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.599" end="00:36:58.950" style="s2">quality of opportunity versus equality</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.430" end="00:37:00.779" style="s2">of outcome right you know is our current</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.950" end="00:37:02.700" style="s2">system one that&#39;s defined by quality of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.779" end="00:37:04.529" style="s2">opportunity right I mean obviously if</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.700" end="00:37:06.329" style="s2">you&#39;re impoverished and in Africa you</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.529" end="00:37:08.160" style="s2">don&#39;t have a quality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.329" end="00:37:09.960" style="s2">right so he moves in this very very</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.160" end="00:37:17.400" style="s2">vague terrain but what is clear but is</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.960" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">work right is that you know the if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.400" end="00:37:22.230" style="s2">push hard against right if you push for</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:24.660" style="s2">what eat what he deigns very badly right</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.230" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">as a quality of outcome that this can</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.660" end="00:37:29.130" style="s2">lead to deeply dangerous results right</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:31.650" style="s2">and this is based on a naturalization of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.130" end="00:37:36.680" style="s2">inequality right so I believe you</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.650" end="00:37:43.400" style="s2">commented also that you said you said</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.680" end="00:37:45.690" style="s2">let&#39;s see here what was it here you said</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.400" end="00:37:46.859" style="s2">anyway you were you were commenting that</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.690" end="00:37:48.270" style="s2">it&#39;s not necessary someone was</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.859" end="00:37:50.069" style="s2">commenting that it&#39;s not necessarily him</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.270" end="00:37:52.470" style="s2">saying that that he&#39;s drawing on you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.069" end="00:37:53.730" style="s2">know other sources to say that right but</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.470" end="00:37:56.039" style="s2">the point is that he actually structures</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.730" end="00:37:58.950" style="s2">it philosophically right so because</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.039" end="00:38:00.329" style="s2">there&#39;s an ontological</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.950" end="00:38:02.040" style="s2">in a quality that&#39;s inherent to nature</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.329" end="00:38:03.359" style="s2">and I think the first chapter of 12</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.040" end="00:38:04.320" style="s2">rules for life is this most succinct</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.359" end="00:38:06.900" style="s2">statement of that though it&#39;s can be</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.320" end="00:38:08.790" style="s2">found elsewhere right we have to respect</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.900" end="00:38:10.380" style="s2">that inequality right and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.790" end="00:38:12.450" style="s2">develop systems of government that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.380" end="00:38:13.829" style="s2">representative with respect to it right</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.450" end="00:38:15.960" style="s2">and if we diverge too far from that</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.829" end="00:38:18.030" style="s2">right but there&#39;s potentially going to</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.960" end="00:38:20.130" style="s2">be very very dangerous and catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.030" end="00:38:21.690" style="s2">results right and that that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.130" end="00:38:23.820" style="s2">the structural role the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.690" end="00:38:25.619" style="s2">totalitarianism plays in his work right</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.820" end="00:38:27.119" style="s2">it&#39;s something that emerges right when</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.619" end="00:38:29.579" style="s2">you go too far in the direction of</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.119" end="00:38:31.020" style="s2">equality of outcome right you know and</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.579" end="00:38:33.510" style="s2">then it exerts this kind of crushing</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.020" end="00:38:35.560" style="s2">weight as a response to that does that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.510" end="00:38:38.990" style="s2">make sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.560" end="00:38:40.900" style="s2">yeah definitely but then my follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.990" end="00:38:44.090" style="s2">question would be if I&#39;m allowed that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.900" end="00:38:47.690" style="s2">don&#39;t really see in Peterson that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.090" end="00:38:49.940" style="s2">necessary conclusion that the only if</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.690" end="00:38:52.490" style="s2">you follow them logically they will take</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.940" end="00:38:55.540" style="s2">you necessarily to these extreme</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.490" end="00:38:57.650" style="s2">right-wing and destructive</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.540" end="00:38:59.890" style="s2">interpretations because precisely in</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.650" end="00:39:02.060" style="s2">maps of meaning at least it&#39;s what I</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.890" end="00:39:05.780" style="s2">understood when I read it and I consider</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.060" end="00:39:08.140" style="s2">myself a leftist is that me she she</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.780" end="00:39:10.910" style="s2">tries to lay out the structure that</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.140" end="00:39:12.850" style="s2">deletes the positive change in society</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.910" end="00:39:14.960" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what is contained within</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.850" end="00:39:17.840" style="s2">mythological and religious structures</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.960" end="00:39:19.940" style="s2">like this period of change he insists he</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.840" end="00:39:22.310" style="s2">insists on the idea that through</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.940" end="00:39:25.910" style="s2">changing yourself you can change society</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.310" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">and all that stuff but I didn&#39;t I really</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.910" end="00:39:31.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t see this idea that you shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:33.470" style="s2">try to change things it was closer to we</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.640" end="00:39:36.460" style="s2">should be serious and responsible and</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.470" end="00:39:38.840" style="s2">trying to change things because doing it</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.460" end="00:39:41.630" style="s2">prematurely or too quickly or without</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.840" end="00:39:45.110" style="s2">seriousness can lead to those kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.630" end="00:39:47.410" style="s2">distortions and so my main problem with</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.110" end="00:39:50.260" style="s2">it is that</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.410" end="00:39:52.260" style="s2">the he isn&#39;t really in my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.260" end="00:39:55.180" style="s2">he isn&#39;t really trying to justify</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.260" end="00:39:56.890" style="s2">inequalities in some ways doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.180" end="00:39:59.590" style="s2">precisely the opposite he&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.890" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">say if you want to change it then you</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.590" end="00:40:05.020" style="s2">have to be serious about it and that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:06.580" style="s2">really don&#39;t see how that&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.020" end="00:40:09.910" style="s2">like the interpretation that you were</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.580" end="00:40:12.670" style="s2">saying strikes me as being opposite to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.910" end="00:40:13.960" style="s2">what he&#39;s actually stating okay well the</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.670" end="00:40:17.980" style="s2">first thing to say is that I didn&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.960" end="00:40:20.080" style="s2">that you know that Peterson&#39;s positions</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.980" end="00:40:21.580" style="s2">are our far right or that you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.080" end="00:40:23.860" style="s2">reading Peterson will automatically lead</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.580" end="00:40:25.150" style="s2">you to them right you know I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.860" end="00:40:26.500" style="s2">very very important to Peterson&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.150" end="00:40:28.450" style="s2">that there&#39;s this tension right which I</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.500" end="00:40:30.670" style="s2">described right between an ontological</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.450" end="00:40:32.080" style="s2">ontological naturalization of inequality</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.670" end="00:40:35.230" style="s2">and a view that we should develop</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.080" end="00:40:36.820" style="s2">structures which are responsive to that</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.230" end="00:40:39.280" style="s2">and maybe can improve upon it in certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.820" end="00:40:41.950" style="s2">respects but are nevertheless limited</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.280" end="00:40:43.870" style="s2">ontologically right you know by this</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.950" end="00:40:45.820" style="s2">sort of deep dimension of his work right</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.870" end="00:40:49.720" style="s2">so I don&#39;t you know I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.820" end="00:40:51.430" style="s2">the most natural political position in</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.720" end="00:40:54.070" style="s2">terms of compatibility with Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.430" end="00:40:56.080" style="s2">work is a far-right position but what I</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.070" end="00:40:58.510" style="s2">was merely pointing out is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.080" end="00:41:00.550" style="s2">look at the particular ontological</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.510" end="00:41:02.080" style="s2">prominence right the Attar kkuk aspect</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.550" end="00:41:04.630" style="s2">of his work plays in terms of being the</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.080" end="00:41:06.220" style="s2">real reality that undergirds all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.630" end="00:41:08.440" style="s2">political formations and regulates them</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.220" end="00:41:09.520" style="s2">then you can start to understand why</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.440" end="00:41:11.770" style="s2">some people would view them as very</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.520" end="00:41:13.150" style="s2">sympathetic to that right or why certain</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.770" end="00:41:15.130" style="s2">people read his work might go in that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.150" end="00:41:17.140" style="s2">direction right you know that raises a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.130" end="00:41:20.050" style="s2">larger question about its complicity</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.140" end="00:41:22.600" style="s2">with those cultures right but in terms</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.050" end="00:41:23.770" style="s2">of your your other point about improving</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.600" end="00:41:28.540" style="s2">the world yeah I don&#39;t mean to suggest</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.770" end="00:41:30.580" style="s2">that Peterson totally out rules the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.540" end="00:41:32.140" style="s2">notion that we can improve things right</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.580" end="00:41:33.790" style="s2">I mean presumably if he says that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.140" end="00:41:35.650" style="s2">an advocate for equality of opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.790" end="00:41:39.280" style="s2">right you know that&#39;s one species of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.650" end="00:41:41.860" style="s2">equality that he supports right but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.280" end="00:41:44.170" style="s2">know what I&#39;m saying is that there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.860" end="00:41:45.850" style="s2">absolute limitations that are assigned</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.170" end="00:41:48.550" style="s2">to that in terms of what&#39;s possible and</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.850" end="00:41:51.190" style="s2">ultimately everything indexes back to a</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.550" end="00:41:52.840" style="s2">deep ontological intelligence a tion of</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.190" end="00:41:56.020" style="s2">inequality that&#39;s and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.840" end="00:41:57.370" style="s2">horizon of what&#39;s achievable right you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.020" end="00:42:00.190" style="s2">know and he says this very very</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.370" end="00:42:01.090" style="s2">succinctly time and time again right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.190" end="00:42:03.100" style="s2">know equality of</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.090" end="00:42:06.120" style="s2">whatever that means right because again</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.100" end="00:42:08.110" style="s2">it&#39;s extremely vague as an ocean right</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.120" end="00:42:09.940" style="s2">you know will lead to catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.110" end="00:42:13.330" style="s2">results well that&#39;s interesting too</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.940" end="00:42:16.390" style="s2">right because you know if we look at you</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.330" end="00:42:18.850" style="s2">know if we look at you know the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.390" end="00:42:21.610" style="s2">century you know we can debate you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.850" end="00:42:23.020" style="s2">the morality or you know the actions of</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.610" end="00:42:25.180" style="s2">states like the Soviet Union or China</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.020" end="00:42:27.730" style="s2">right but one thing that&#39;s very clear is</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.180" end="00:42:31.030" style="s2">that in a global perspective that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.730" end="00:42:32.710" style="s2">know often in order to change you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.030" end="00:42:34.270" style="s2">economic inequalities that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.710" end="00:42:35.950" style="s2">deeply embedded as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.270" end="00:42:37.800" style="s2">historical structures it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.950" end="00:42:40.480" style="s2">it&#39;s necessary to actually be radical</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.800" end="00:42:41.890" style="s2">right um you know and I would argue that</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.480" end="00:42:43.030" style="s2">in many respects that&#39;s the only way in</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.890" end="00:42:44.020" style="s2">which things are really accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.030" end="00:42:45.370" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.020" end="00:42:46.990" style="s2">you know like house with the French</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.370" end="00:42:48.430" style="s2">Revolution we could give an example and</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.990" end="00:42:50.890" style="s2">we might discuss the foundation of</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.430" end="00:42:52.660" style="s2">Petersons liberalism right and how that</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.890" end="00:42:54.070" style="s2">was manifested politically because it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.660" end="00:42:57.100" style="s2">wasn&#39;t necessarily peaceable which is</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.070" end="00:42:59.680" style="s2">another little irony right so again I</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.100" end="00:43:03.940" style="s2">think there&#39;s a real naivety right you</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.680" end="00:43:05.620" style="s2">know in terms of you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.940" end="00:43:07.750" style="s2">creating this sort of ontological</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.620" end="00:43:09.670" style="s2">affixed historically insensitive</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.750" end="00:43:12.010" style="s2">structure right and saying that all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.670" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">our political practice has to index that</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.010" end="00:43:16.600" style="s2">and function to some degree in</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:19.090" style="s2">accordance with it right now I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.600" end="00:43:24.730" style="s2">saying absolutely right but to some</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.090" end="00:43:29.620" style="s2">degree I just really quickly add on to</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.730" end="00:43:32.590" style="s2">that yeah so so I think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.620" end="00:43:36.850" style="s2">certainly true that that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.590" end="00:43:39.600" style="s2">Peterson says entails that that all</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.850" end="00:43:44.680" style="s2">forms of social change are impossible</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.600" end="00:43:48.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s clearly the case that he he</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.680" end="00:43:50.970" style="s2">goes out of his way constantly to</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.300" end="00:43:54.070" style="s2">attribute at least quite a bit of</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.970" end="00:43:57.550" style="s2">existing inequality and distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.070" end="00:43:58.960" style="s2">resources etc to natural sources so</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.550" end="00:44:01.960" style="s2">Marian gave an example about STEM fields</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.960" end="00:44:03.190" style="s2">earlier which actually I love that</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.960" end="00:44:05.770" style="s2">example especially because if you go</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.190" end="00:44:07.720" style="s2">back and look at the you know the way</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.770" end="00:44:09.400" style="s2">people talked about computer program in</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.720" end="00:44:12.520" style="s2">the mid 20th century it was largely seen</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.400" end="00:44:12.810" style="s2">as women&#39;s work you know and and then</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.520" end="00:44:14.670" style="s2">there was</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.810" end="00:44:18.110" style="s2">later you know shift their the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.670" end="00:44:21.390" style="s2">direction is pick a more prestigious but</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.110" end="00:44:23.670" style="s2">but certainly with with with large-scale</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.390" end="00:44:26.550" style="s2">economic inequalities he constantly</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.670" end="00:44:28.650" style="s2">makes remarks about like that that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.550" end="00:44:31.470" style="s2">of the main purposes for which he uses</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.650" end="00:44:33.990" style="s2">his favorite animal metaphors right that</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.470" end="00:44:35.790" style="s2">oh look at these lobsters you know some</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.990" end="00:44:37.410" style="s2">having much more territory and resources</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.790" end="00:44:39.570" style="s2">than others look at the ants you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.410" end="00:44:41.340" style="s2">and and how some of them are you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.570" end="00:44:42.840" style="s2">doing this work the other other others</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.340" end="00:44:45.450" style="s2">aren&#39;t well that&#39;s not because of</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.840" end="00:44:47.580" style="s2">capitalism and the west white men and</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.450" end="00:44:50.550" style="s2">you know he&#39;s very very very fond of</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.580" end="00:44:52.500" style="s2">this rhetorical strategy now I agree I</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.550" end="00:44:54.450" style="s2">think you could agree with a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.500" end="00:44:57.750" style="s2">larger scale things he says in maps</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.450" end="00:44:59.040" style="s2">edenia etc and and reject all of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.750" end="00:45:02.820" style="s2">right like I don&#39;t think it particularly</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.040" end="00:45:04.790" style="s2">flows from those sources he has to have</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.820" end="00:45:07.260" style="s2">that position after all Peterson himself</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.790" end="00:45:09.780" style="s2">recognizes that at least the specific</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.260" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">historical forms that hierarchy has</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.780" end="00:45:13.950" style="s2">taken have shifted right it is in his</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.860" style="s2">view for the better you know that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.950" end="00:45:18.930" style="s2">meritocratic etc so so you could</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.860" end="00:45:20.790" style="s2">certainly agree with a lot of his</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.930" end="00:45:22.950" style="s2">promises and think that further shifts</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.790" end="00:45:24.660" style="s2">are possible and desirable but I do</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.950" end="00:45:27.390" style="s2">think he&#39;s saying something more than</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.660" end="00:45:30.330" style="s2">just be careful and serious about it</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.390" end="00:45:31.710" style="s2">when you pursue pursue it because his</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.330" end="00:45:34.170" style="s2">particular quality bout coming</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.710" end="00:45:36.080" style="s2">particularly the way he creamed he ties</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.170" end="00:45:38.720" style="s2">that to his critique of extemporary left</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.080" end="00:45:42.530" style="s2">certainly implies that he thinks that</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.720" end="00:45:45.600" style="s2">Marxist feminists etc are demanding</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.530" end="00:45:48.930" style="s2">unreasonable forms of equality of</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.600" end="00:45:51.300" style="s2">outcome that that aren&#39;t that could only</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.930" end="00:45:53.160" style="s2">lead to disaster and if you make any</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.300" end="00:45:55.560" style="s2">input into attempt to create it given</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.160" end="00:45:57.510" style="s2">these extremely natural forms of</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.560" end="00:46:05.190" style="s2">inequality he sees at the base the human</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.510" end="00:46:08.390" style="s2">condition okay Nathan you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.190" end="00:46:08.390" style="s2">that got a lot of plus ones</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.270" end="00:46:18.890" style="s2">Nathan you we can hear you I think</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.430" end="00:46:38.349" style="s2">oh you we can&#39;t hear you you&#39;re one</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.349" end="00:46:39.670" style="s2">moment you hear me now yep good sorry</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.349" end="00:46:43.510" style="s2">about that thank you guys so much for</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.670" end="00:46:46.119" style="s2">coming on and been willing to present a</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.510" end="00:46:51.250" style="s2">nuanced critical point of view against</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.119" end="00:46:52.960" style="s2">Peterson so my question is that a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.250" end="00:46:55.960" style="s2">Peterson debate seems to hinge on</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.960" end="00:46:58.839" style="s2">whether a person senses that Peterson is</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.960" end="00:47:01.210" style="s2">either quote good behind all of his</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.839" end="00:47:04.029" style="s2">rhetoric and is at bottom seeking to</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.210" end="00:47:06.220" style="s2">explore and help people or whether his</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.029" end="00:47:08.049" style="s2">rhetoric is presenting a facade of good</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.220" end="00:47:13.089" style="s2">in order to smuggle in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.049" end="00:47:15.670" style="s2">reactionary or tired old views do you</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.089" end="00:47:17.170" style="s2">guys also get that same sense and I you</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.670" end="00:47:19.690" style="s2">know Ben you were saying that you have</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.170" end="00:47:23.230" style="s2">had a lot of discussions with people and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.690" end="00:47:26.020" style="s2">I I just gave up on them because it was</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.230" end="00:47:27.880" style="s2">either like yeah a Peterson is good or</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.020" end="00:47:30.309" style="s2">boohoo Peterson is bad like almost every</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.880" end="00:47:34.990" style="s2">single time I the nobody budged from</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.309" end="00:47:36.490" style="s2">their from their initial viewpoint so do</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.990" end="00:47:39.369" style="s2">you guys also get that same sense about</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.490" end="00:47:41.410" style="s2">the hinge do you yourselves parse him</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.369" end="00:47:42.970" style="s2">along those lines and how could we make</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.410" end="00:47:46.510" style="s2">a reasonable judgment about such a</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.970" end="00:47:50.890" style="s2">question yeah but just just real briefly</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.510" end="00:47:52.510" style="s2">that I&#39;ll throw to my co-authors I think</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.890" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">a lot of discussion is like that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.510" end="00:47:55.900" style="s2">certainly not the kind of discussion I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:47:57.640" style="s2">interested in I think that&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.900" end="00:48:00.099" style="s2">the least interesting question you could</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.640" end="00:48:02.760" style="s2">possibly ask about somebody whether they</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.099" end="00:48:05.890" style="s2">like are individually virtuous or not</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.760" end="00:48:09.130" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know if you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.890" end="00:48:11.710" style="s2">whether I think whether Peterson he</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.130" end="00:48:16.289" style="s2">clearly has some political views that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.710" end="00:48:19.809" style="s2">are at least in a very broad brush sense</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.289" end="00:48:21.910" style="s2">conservative right you know that he</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.809" end="00:48:24.700" style="s2">talks about a lot even in the self-help</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.910" end="00:48:25.750" style="s2">writings so he clearly has those views</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.700" end="00:48:27.160" style="s2">that&#39;s not necessarily the same as</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.750" end="00:48:29.950" style="s2">saying he has like an evil agenda</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.160" end="00:48:31.660" style="s2">smuggle them in or that everything he</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.950" end="00:48:32.950" style="s2">says about self-help is bad or that</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.660" end="00:48:34.630" style="s2">there aren&#39;t people who really benefit</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.950" end="00:48:37.090" style="s2">from it right I&#39;m certainly not</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.630" end="00:48:41.230" style="s2">interested in Peterson a or Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.090" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in okay he makes he has</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.230" end="00:48:45.670" style="s2">these specific ideas he makes these</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:48.100" style="s2">specific arguments are they convincing</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.670" end="00:48:49.600" style="s2">arguments are they good ideas or parts</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.100" end="00:48:54.400" style="s2">of them good other parts bad if so</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.600" end="00:48:57.640" style="s2">what&#39;s what can i I&#39;m all onto that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.400" end="00:49:01.480" style="s2">before just just to add directly to what</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.640" end="00:49:04.330" style="s2">you said there you mentioned you know at</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.480" end="00:49:06.130" style="s2">the beginning not you but I think Conrad</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.330" end="00:49:09.820" style="s2">at the beginning mentioned that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.130" end="00:49:11.200" style="s2">sold three million books and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.820" end="00:49:12.970" style="s2">you can go I can go to my local</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.200" end="00:49:14.320" style="s2">university and find fifteen or twenty</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.970" end="00:49:16.330" style="s2">people and have a really engaging</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.320" end="00:49:18.550" style="s2">conversation about these kind of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.330" end="00:49:20.710" style="s2">but these kind of ideas don&#39;t sell three</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.550" end="00:49:23.410" style="s2">million books so it feels to me like</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.710" end="00:49:26.980" style="s2">there&#39;s something else at work you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.410" end="00:49:29.200" style="s2">behind or beside or you know surrounding</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.980" end="00:49:31.090" style="s2">whatever it is that the philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.200" end="00:49:32.980" style="s2">framework maybe helps to give some</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.090" end="00:49:36.400" style="s2">legitimacy to what he&#39;s saying in in</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.980" end="00:49:37.510" style="s2">certain people&#39;s minds but that maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.400" end="00:49:40.210" style="s2">don&#39;t want to say there&#39;s something more</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.510" end="00:49:43.860" style="s2">going on but that that analysis doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.210" end="00:49:43.860" style="s2">exhaust the Peterson phenomenon</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.180" end="00:49:52.500" style="s2">Matt do you want to grab that yeah sure</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.950" end="00:49:53.609" style="s2">actually I suppose I should because one</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.500" end="00:49:57.270" style="s2">of the things that I wrote about was the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.609" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">question of authenticity and moral</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.270" end="00:50:01.440" style="s2">virtue and Peterson&#39;s work and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:02.850" style="s2">say this expressly in the book but I</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.440" end="00:50:04.470" style="s2">think that if you want to put it</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.850" end="00:50:06.300" style="s2">colloquially there&#39;s two stages that you</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.470" end="00:50:08.940" style="s2">have to go through to assess whether or</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.300" end="00:50:10.590" style="s2">not someone is a good person</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.940" end="00:50:12.330" style="s2">in the classical Brechtian sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.590" end="00:50:14.850" style="s2">world right and the one that I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.330" end="00:50:16.680" style="s2">interested in is the second which is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.850" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">one that been highlighted right so the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.680" end="00:50:20.369" style="s2">first stage that you have to ask which</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:22.350" style="s2">is one that Peterson&#39;s about devotes a</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.369" end="00:50:23.160" style="s2">great deal of time to analyzing</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.350" end="00:50:24.780" style="s2">since it&#39;s a more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.160" end="00:50:26.250" style="s2">psychological question is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.780" end="00:50:28.230" style="s2">authenticity of someone&#39;s moral</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.250" end="00:50:30.570" style="s2">viewpoint but do they actually believe</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.230" end="00:50:32.130" style="s2">what it is that they&#39;re saying are they</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.570" end="00:50:34.920" style="s2">committed to it and how committed are</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.130" end="00:50:36.960" style="s2">they to this right and in this respect</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.920" end="00:50:38.970" style="s2">you know authenticity has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.960" end="00:50:41.490" style="s2">virtues to it right we admire people who</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.970" end="00:50:42.690" style="s2">are authentically dedicated to causes</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.490" end="00:50:44.490" style="s2">but we admire people who are</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.690" end="00:50:46.290" style="s2">authentically dedicated to causes that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.490" end="00:50:48.359" style="s2">we think are worth pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.290" end="00:50:50.220" style="s2">right there couldn&#39;t be authentic Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.359" end="00:50:52.140" style="s2">there can be authentic people running</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.220" end="00:50:53.310" style="s2">Soviet gulags who really believe in</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.140" end="00:50:55.740" style="s2">their cause they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.310" end="00:50:57.720" style="s2">authentic reactionaries right so in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.740" end="00:50:59.550" style="s2">sense that you know Peterson is a person</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.720" end="00:51:00.900" style="s2">a great authenticity I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.550" end="00:51:02.790" style="s2">anyone could deny that right he really</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.900" end="00:51:04.109" style="s2">seems to believe what he&#39;s saying and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.790" end="00:51:05.820" style="s2">think that a test to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.109" end="00:51:07.980" style="s2">charisma that Nathan was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.820" end="00:51:10.369" style="s2">right he comes across as a man of</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.980" end="00:51:12.570" style="s2">conviction who really feels that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.369" end="00:51:14.850" style="s2">speaking to the fundaments of Western</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.570" end="00:51:16.440" style="s2">civilization and its enemy and people</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.850" end="00:51:18.150" style="s2">who want answers to these questions pick</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.440" end="00:51:20.609" style="s2">up on that and it resonates with them</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.150" end="00:51:23.040" style="s2">right after the second a more delicate</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.609" end="00:51:24.630" style="s2">question that Ben was trial ighting it</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.040" end="00:51:26.760" style="s2">concerns whether or not what he</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.630" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">authentically believes is morally</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.760" end="00:51:31.260" style="s2">plausible right and that&#39;s what I have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:33.780" style="s2">lot more issue with because even though</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.260" end="00:51:35.490" style="s2">he seems to authentically believe and a</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.780" end="00:51:37.320" style="s2">lot of these different reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.490" end="00:51:38.790" style="s2">convictions however it is that we want</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.320" end="00:51:41.070" style="s2">to frame them I don&#39;t think that they</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.790" end="00:51:44.130" style="s2">are actually hold up to sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.070" end="00:51:45.840" style="s2">moral analysis I think actually if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.130" end="00:51:47.340" style="s2">even look at the liberal tradition and</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.840" end="00:51:49.830" style="s2">has been articulated through the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.340" end="00:51:52.170" style="s2">century most liberals who looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.830" end="00:51:53.490" style="s2">tradition with any severity would say it</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.170" end="00:51:54.930" style="s2">doesn&#39;t hold up to serious moral</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.490" end="00:51:58.380" style="s2">scrutiny and there are a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.930" end="00:52:00.700" style="s2">different dimensions to that so would I</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.380" end="00:52:01.720" style="s2">characterize him as a good person I can</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.700" end="00:52:04.630" style="s2">she was a person of tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.720" end="00:52:06.339" style="s2">authenticity great charisma and powerful</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.630" end="00:52:08.200" style="s2">conviction but somebody who holds</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.339" end="00:52:11.050" style="s2">ultimately an implausible and</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.200" end="00:52:13.089" style="s2">undesirable moral outlook that people of</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.050" end="00:52:18.579" style="s2">good conscience should reject for a wide</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.089" end="00:52:20.349" style="s2">variety of different reasons well I</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.579" end="00:52:22.150" style="s2">would just say that I agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.349" end="00:52:24.550" style="s2">Nathan in the sense that I do believe</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.150" end="00:52:26.740" style="s2">that and that&#39;s my problem with Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.550" end="00:52:28.510" style="s2">particularly and I think in the book</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.740" end="00:52:30.970" style="s2">there&#39;s an introduction by Slava</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.510" end="00:52:33.430" style="s2">Dziedzic and Jeter kind of makes this</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.970" end="00:52:38.109" style="s2">point because he says the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.430" end="00:52:42.099" style="s2">Peterson is not when he lies but when he</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.109" end="00:52:44.170" style="s2">hides a truth when he&#39;s lying right and</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.099" end="00:52:46.540" style="s2">I think this is a brilliant point made</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.170" end="00:52:48.040" style="s2">by Dziedzic right I think that this is</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.540" end="00:52:51.910" style="s2">something I tried also to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.040" end="00:52:53.829" style="s2">into my own like a critique right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.910" end="00:52:56.980" style="s2">I think the problem and I do agree that</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.829" end="00:52:58.990" style="s2">and my problem being is with him at</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.980" end="00:53:01.869" style="s2">least and related to your question is I</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.990" end="00:53:04.750" style="s2">do think that he hides these very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.869" end="00:53:09.069" style="s2">rational politics right in like this</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.750" end="00:53:11.440" style="s2">kind of common sensical things that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.069" end="00:53:13.119" style="s2">telling you right because when people</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.440" end="00:53:14.770" style="s2">tell you like well and maybe if you want</p>

<p begin="00:53:14.770" end="00:53:18.849" style="s2">bed in the morning right like well if</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.960" end="00:53:20.800" style="s2">you maybe you want to howl even more or</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.849" end="00:53:22.390" style="s2">they&#39;re lying you wanna do that for</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.800" end="00:53:24.310" style="s2">yourselves like you accomplish little</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.390" end="00:53:26.109" style="s2">things right I have friends that have</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.310" end="00:53:27.940" style="s2">gone through like psychological</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.109" end="00:53:30.130" style="s2">treatment and one of the big not</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.940" end="00:53:32.200" style="s2">treatment but they talk to cycle other</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.130" end="00:53:33.880" style="s2">psychologists especially today right and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.200" end="00:53:35.800" style="s2">what the psychologists have told my</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.880" end="00:53:38.319" style="s2">friends is like well if you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.800" end="00:53:41.020" style="s2">to feel this we&#39;re like very deep</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.319" end="00:53:43.510" style="s2">pressure what we&#39;re living try to give</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.020" end="00:53:45.730" style="s2">yourself little tasks like right at - so</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.510" end="00:53:47.980" style="s2">you feel that you complete a task over</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.730" end="00:53:51.550" style="s2">the day and you feel good for yourself</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.980" end="00:53:53.380" style="s2">right and these will like if you build</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.550" end="00:53:55.089" style="s2">up on that and we&#39;ll help you learn</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.380" end="00:53:57.250" style="s2">right so what I&#39;m saying is it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.089" end="00:53:58.960" style="s2">wrong to sometimes tell yourself do your</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.250" end="00:54:00.640" style="s2">bed and stuff right or the problem is</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.960" end="00:54:02.859" style="s2">what comes next repeaters on and he</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.640" end="00:54:04.839" style="s2">tells you right like well you don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.859" end="00:54:07.210" style="s2">your bed because you want to be order</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.839" end="00:54:09.160" style="s2">and orders good etc and if we look at</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.210" end="00:54:11.920" style="s2">what&#39;s happening today in the u.s. right</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.160" end="00:54:14.120" style="s2">what we are seeing is that not all forms</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.920" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">of or there are okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.120" end="00:54:18.380" style="s2">right just because we say they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:20.870" style="s2">natural right sometimes in order to see</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.380" end="00:54:22.760" style="s2">something better happening maybe we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.870" end="00:54:24.530" style="s2">come to the moment in which all of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.760" end="00:54:26.810" style="s2">previous earlier has to crumble right</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.530" end="00:54:30.140" style="s2">and try to kind of grab it and just want</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.810" end="00:54:33.890" style="s2">to want it to stay the same way for our</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.140" end="00:54:35.600" style="s2">own personal reasons right is bad or at</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.890" end="00:54:38.510" style="s2">least I would say it&#39;s totally wrong to</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.600" end="00:54:41.600" style="s2">hide it until like under some pretension</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.510" end="00:54:42.890" style="s2">of I&#39;m just giving advice right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.600" end="00:54:44.720" style="s2">actually just wanted to build on this</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.890" end="00:54:51.710" style="s2">since I touch very briefly on that in</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.720" end="00:54:53.120" style="s2">that section it&#39;s that he kind of insist</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.710" end="00:54:55.070" style="s2">on advice that on the surface though it</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.120" end="00:54:57.260" style="s2">seems really common sensical and</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.070" end="00:54:59.330" style="s2">actually is individually dollars right</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.260" end="00:55:00.530" style="s2">like having grown up in toronto as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.330" end="00:55:01.640" style="s2">millennial I can tell you there are a</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.530" end="00:55:03.170" style="s2">lot of people I know who should clean</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.640" end="00:55:06.110" style="s2">their room I would probably benefit from</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.170" end="00:55:08.360" style="s2">that right you know ask personalized</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.110" end="00:55:10.130" style="s2">advice it&#39;s not bad where I find this</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.360" end="00:55:11.780" style="s2">problematic is when someone says you</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.130" end="00:55:13.910" style="s2">should put your own life in order before</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.780" end="00:55:15.560" style="s2">trying to change the world well what if</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.910" end="00:55:17.020" style="s2">your life is in disorder because there</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.560" end="00:55:19.850" style="s2">are fundamental problems in the world</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.020" end="00:55:21.470" style="s2">and one of the examples I give is if</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.850" end="00:55:24.170" style="s2">you&#39;re not earning enough money to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.470" end="00:55:26.210" style="s2">actually live a life of dignity when</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.170" end="00:55:28.430" style="s2">Peterson is telling you don&#39;t form a</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.210" end="00:55:30.200" style="s2">union or don&#39;t try to politically change</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.430" end="00:55:32.060" style="s2">that situation just try to improve</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.200" end="00:55:33.830" style="s2">things for yourself that&#39;s highly</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.060" end="00:55:34.910" style="s2">problematic because one of the best ways</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.830" end="00:55:36.770" style="s2">you might be able to improve things for</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.910" end="00:55:38.450" style="s2">yourself and for that matter improve</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.770" end="00:55:41.270" style="s2">things for others would be by engaging</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.450" end="00:55:42.620" style="s2">in social agitation and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.270" end="00:55:45.950" style="s2">this kind of common-sense bullet the</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.620" end="00:55:47.980" style="s2">advice becomes problematic and where we</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.950" end="00:55:51.970" style="s2">should question its political efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.980" end="00:55:53.900" style="s2">yeah and I would just also just add that</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.970" end="00:55:56.210" style="s2">you know because because I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.900" end="00:55:58.880" style="s2">come people to the chat were amazed by</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.210" end="00:56:00.170" style="s2">the assertion that that Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.880" end="00:56:03.290" style="s2">individual virtue wasn&#39;t really of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.170" end="00:56:05.420" style="s2">interest here so just to just briefly</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.290" end="00:56:08.540" style="s2">defend that look if you wanted somebody</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.420" end="00:56:13.100" style="s2">to be a friend or romantic partner or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.540" end="00:56:15.110" style="s2">mentor or therapist then if then sure</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.710" end="00:56:35.300" style="s2">popular obsession with this point right</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.690" end="00:56:37.160" style="s2">now in Western politics whether somebody</p>

<p begin="00:57:16.430" end="00:57:22.160" style="s2">have so I think rather than trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.310" end="00:57:23.900" style="s2">look into Peterson&#39;s heart which is</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.160" end="00:57:26.090" style="s2">impossible in any case for those of us</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.900" end="00:57:31.010" style="s2">who don&#39;t know him we should we should</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.090" end="00:57:32.930" style="s2">evaluate his ideas as they are can I get</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.010" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">could I get Raven Connolly Connolly&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.930" end="00:57:37.430" style="s2">question here could I take that Peter</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:39.230" style="s2">sure okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.430" end="00:57:41.360" style="s2">so raven connelly writes here should i</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.230" end="00:57:45.620" style="s2">read the question or a raven do you want</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.360" end="00:57:46.970" style="s2">to unmute yourself and ask it I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.620" end="00:57:51.080" style="s2">really frame it as a question but</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.970" end="00:57:53.000" style="s2">however you are taking it go for it okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.080" end="00:57:55.450" style="s2">I thought it was a question because</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.000" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">there is a question mark in there I see</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.450" end="00:58:01.580" style="s2">yeah I think what&#39;s very interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">the way that if you look at maps of</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.580" end="00:58:08.510" style="s2">meaning part of what Peterson does is</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:13.040" style="s2">you know an apropos is kind of Union</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.510" end="00:58:15.250" style="s2">influence he takes he takes these sort</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.040" end="00:58:19.460" style="s2">of narratives right these archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.250" end="00:58:23.300" style="s2">narratives and he maps them on to you</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.460" end="00:58:24.740" style="s2">know cognitive biology essentially and</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.300" end="00:58:25.670" style="s2">he focuses on certain this has already</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.740" end="00:58:27.200" style="s2">been written about actually in</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.670" end="00:58:30.350" style="s2">psychology today right he focuses on</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.200" end="00:58:32.030" style="s2">certain kinds of narratives right you</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.350" end="00:58:33.740" style="s2">know that you know in which there is</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.030" end="00:58:35.090" style="s2">sort of a hero&#39;s journey and so forth</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.740" end="00:58:35.960" style="s2">right we could talk about the Odyssey or</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.090" end="00:58:38.120" style="s2">we could talk about the back of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.960" end="00:58:40.160" style="s2">Gita and things like this and while</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.120" end="00:58:41.060" style="s2">these do persist across different</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.160" end="00:58:43.540" style="s2">cultures</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.060" end="00:58:45.110" style="s2">um you know what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.540" end="00:58:47.060" style="s2">you know from an anthropological</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.110" end="00:58:49.220" style="s2">standpoint I think it&#39;s broadly</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.060" end="00:58:52.460" style="s2">understood that this kind of narrative</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.220" end="00:58:55.100" style="s2">structure is characteristic of post</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.460" end="00:58:57.980" style="s2">agricultural societies in general right</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.100" end="00:58:59.620" style="s2">and also you know with post agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.980" end="00:59:01.880" style="s2">and animal domestication we tend to get</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.620" end="00:59:04.340" style="s2">you know the rise of patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.880" end="00:59:05.690" style="s2">structures right so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.340" end="00:59:08.930" style="s2">interesting because to talk about this</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.690" end="00:59:11.230" style="s2">view of the Risso notion of nature right</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.930" end="00:59:14.660" style="s2">versus a Hobbesian view of nature or</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.230" end="00:59:17.810" style="s2">peterson has to you know for all of this</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.660" end="00:59:19.430" style="s2">to be plausible right he has to pedal</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.190" end="00:59:55.940" style="s2">that it seems to me that you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.530" end="00:59:58.460" style="s2">perhaps far more interesting than this</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.940" end="01:00:01.430" style="s2">debate and of itself is the way that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.460" end="01:00:05.560" style="s2">these conceptions of nature nature index</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.430" end="01:00:08.030" style="s2">to different political positions right</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.560" end="01:00:10.520" style="s2">so you know you can that the reality is</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.030" end="01:00:13.760" style="s2">right you can find like you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.520" end="01:00:15.470" style="s2">I I tend to think that you know class</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.760" end="01:00:17.330" style="s2">and wealth inequality well I think this</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.470" end="01:00:19.310" style="s2">is is demonstrable or a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.330" end="01:00:22.820" style="s2">certain changes that emerged perhaps in</p>

<p begin="01:00:22.820" end="01:00:27.080" style="s2">evolutionary history of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.860" end="01:00:28.460" style="s2">some dispute over those matters but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.080" end="01:00:31.340" style="s2">point is you can find all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.460" end="01:00:33.200" style="s2">examples in nature to rationalize</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.340" end="01:00:35.000" style="s2">different political views right so</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.200" end="01:00:36.260" style="s2">Peterson cites Jane Goodall&#39;s work on</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.000" end="01:00:37.670" style="s2">chimps and he says well chimps are</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.260" end="01:00:39.470" style="s2">horrible and they kill each other and</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.670" end="01:00:40.910" style="s2">you know this is what nature is right</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.470" end="01:00:43.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s like well if you&#39;re left you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.910" end="01:00:44.660" style="s2">can just go cite bonobos right I mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.160" end="01:00:46.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not that you know there&#39;s always a</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.660" end="01:00:49.940" style="s2">counterpoint right so it&#39;s not terribly</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.700" end="01:00:54.190" style="s2">convincing in the end you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.940" end="01:00:55.570" style="s2">think you know in a lot of respects or</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.190" end="01:00:57.610" style="s2">least with respect to Peterson that it</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.570" end="01:01:00.130" style="s2">can be more interesting to analyze again</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.610" end="01:01:02.590" style="s2">these conceptualizations of nature with</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.130" end="01:01:04.030" style="s2">respect to the general political and</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.590" end="01:01:14.890" style="s2">ideological agenda that he&#39;s putting</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.030" end="01:01:16.390" style="s2">forth give any folks that room yeah but</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.890" end="01:01:19.230" style="s2">I don&#39;t know maybe we could save it for</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.390" end="01:01:24.810" style="s2">the sense-making session later on today</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.230" end="01:01:30.610" style="s2">okay cool we&#39;ll plug that at the end so</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.810" end="01:01:32.530" style="s2">Rogell oh you had a question about what</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.610" end="01:01:36.990" style="s2">is a morals and immersion biology could</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.530" end="01:01:36.990" style="s2">you eat yourself in and read that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.810" end="01:01:49.680" style="s2">on Peterson&#39;s case for emergent morale</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.230" end="01:01:51.850" style="s2">firm Wiley emerging from biology and</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.680" end="01:01:55.300" style="s2">what did you guys think of that and also</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.850" end="01:01:57.570" style="s2">just curious what moral structures are</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.300" end="01:02:06.790" style="s2">you guys operating from just kind of see</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.570" end="01:02:10.510" style="s2">I mean I guess I would say that some</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.790" end="01:02:13.000" style="s2">moral impulses probably do have almost</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.510" end="01:02:19.000" style="s2">certainly right do have have biological</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.000" end="01:02:20.650" style="s2">sources some don&#39;t right so so so so it</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.000" end="01:02:24.190" style="s2">could be that you know some of our</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.650" end="01:02:27.400" style="s2">deepest moral intuitions are ones that</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.190" end="01:02:30.760" style="s2">anybody who shared our biology would</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.400" end="01:02:33.420" style="s2">have and some of them might come from</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.760" end="01:02:36.340" style="s2">from cultural sources or other things</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.420" end="01:02:38.680" style="s2">but I don&#39;t in a sense I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.340" end="01:02:41.140" style="s2">it&#39;s a very interesting question right</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.680" end="01:02:44.650" style="s2">because I think that because I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.140" end="01:02:47.490" style="s2">like no matter which ones come from</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.650" end="01:02:51.730" style="s2">which source right you know that like oh</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.490" end="01:02:54.760" style="s2">these these deeply held moral intuitions</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.730" end="01:02:57.070" style="s2">are an inheritance from evolution these</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.760" end="01:02:59.980" style="s2">these ones you know come from from from</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.070" end="01:03:02.380" style="s2">culture from whatever right you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.980" end="01:03:04.240" style="s2">wherever else they might come from I</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.380" end="01:03:06.970" style="s2">don&#39;t think it would ever make sense to</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:07.470" style="s2">say oh well will embrace the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.970" end="01:03:09.270" style="s2">come from</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.470" end="01:03:13.170" style="s2">right sources will reject the ones that</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.270" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">come from from the wrong sources and the</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.170" end="01:03:19.560" style="s2">reason I don&#39;t think that and trying to</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:21.690" style="s2">think how to how to put this as</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.560" end="01:03:25.740" style="s2">succinctly as possible so it&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.690" end="01:03:27.720" style="s2">become a total bore and like talk the</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.740" end="01:03:30.450" style="s2">next ten minutes you know about my</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.720" end="01:03:32.400" style="s2">co-author it&#39;s gonna be about it but has</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.450" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">to do with David Humes point about facts</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.400" end="01:03:40.530" style="s2">and values so they so empirical facts</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:43.710" style="s2">can only ever tell us how to implement</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.530" end="01:03:45.300" style="s2">our normative goals right that be that</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.710" end="01:03:48.900" style="s2">they could be terribly relevant to that</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.300" end="01:03:51.210" style="s2">right like okay we care about bringing</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.900" end="01:03:53.490" style="s2">about greater equality whatever we as we</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.210" end="01:03:55.170" style="s2">care about right then we can start</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.490" end="01:03:56.609" style="s2">looking at empirical facts like oh</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.170" end="01:03:59.880" style="s2">what&#39;s worked in the past what hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.609" end="01:04:03.420" style="s2">worked you know what are the one of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.880" end="01:04:06.000" style="s2">sort of limitations built in by various</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.420" end="01:04:08.400" style="s2">empirical issues and those can be</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.000" end="01:04:10.170" style="s2">tremendously relevant but the one thing</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.400" end="01:04:12.839" style="s2">that the facts can&#39;t do is tell us what</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.170" end="01:04:17.030" style="s2">to care about in the first place</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.839" end="01:04:19.619" style="s2">and so I&#39;m deeply skeptical of the idea</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.030" end="01:04:21.900" style="s2">that there&#39;s anything that we could</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.619" end="01:04:24.599" style="s2">appeal to outside of our most deeply</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.900" end="01:04:26.310" style="s2">held moral intuitions in order to in</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.599" end="01:04:29.160" style="s2">order to justify them you know that we</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.310" end="01:04:32.369" style="s2">say like you can say oh why do you care</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.160" end="01:04:34.500" style="s2">about X I can justify it in terms of Y</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.369" end="01:04:36.150" style="s2">if Y is some other goal that I care</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.500" end="01:04:38.910" style="s2">about even more deeply than I care about</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.150" end="01:04:40.080" style="s2">X but once you get down to why do you</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.910" end="01:04:42.690" style="s2">care about the things that you care</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.080" end="01:04:45.839" style="s2">about most deeply I just kind of see</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.690" end="01:04:47.310" style="s2">that as a pseudo question but my but my</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.839" end="01:04:50.010" style="s2">co-authors might have totally different</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.310" end="01:04:52.920" style="s2">views on this Oh could I just real quick</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.010" end="01:04:55.290" style="s2">clarify because at least from what I</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.920" end="01:04:56.910" style="s2">understand it is but his the main belief</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.290" end="01:05:00.119" style="s2">with the source of morals is that they</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.910" end="01:05:02.520" style="s2">arise from at least in part from a</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.119" end="01:05:05.550" style="s2">projection of the hierarchy and their</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.520" end="01:05:08.010" style="s2">certain behaviors naturally promotes you</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.550" end="01:05:09.900" style="s2">know confidence and climbing on the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.010" end="01:05:12.950" style="s2">hierarchy and that kinda has these weird</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.900" end="01:05:15.060" style="s2">and visible rules that aren&#39;t fully</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.950" end="01:05:16.339" style="s2">articulated or clarified they&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.060" end="01:05:17.970" style="s2">patterns of behavior that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.339" end="01:05:20.970" style="s2">conceptualize as rules</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.970" end="01:05:24.270" style="s2">so I guess to that extent</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.970" end="01:05:25.910" style="s2">you know before you that couldn&#39;t be the</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.270" end="01:05:28.710" style="s2">case right but if that were the case</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.910" end="01:05:30.359" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that be an example of where</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.710" end="01:05:31.650" style="s2">facts could actually define a morality</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.359" end="01:05:34.200" style="s2">because it&#39;s kind of a self</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.650" end="01:05:36.180" style="s2">introspection into the moral into the</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.200" end="01:05:38.340" style="s2">very concept of why we have a concept it</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.180" end="01:05:40.760" style="s2">is more yeah so I would make a</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.340" end="01:05:46.080" style="s2">distinction there between saying that</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.760" end="01:05:48.330" style="s2">that empirical facts can be can be</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.080" end="01:05:51.690" style="s2">informative for the descriptive question</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.330" end="01:05:53.160" style="s2">of why it is that we care about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.690" end="01:05:55.349" style="s2">things that we most deeply care about</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.160" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">but out make a distinction between that</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.349" end="01:05:59.940" style="s2">question and the question of why we</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:02.430" style="s2">should care about the things that we</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.940" end="01:06:04.200" style="s2">most deeply care about so the first</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.430" end="01:06:06.810" style="s2">question absolutely that&#39;s like that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.200" end="01:06:08.849" style="s2">that is a question for the empirical</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.810" end="01:06:12.060" style="s2">psychologists the anthropologist the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.849" end="01:06:15.270" style="s2">biologist even right sure absolutely but</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.060" end="01:06:17.820" style="s2">any I but what I&#39;m skeptical about is</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.270" end="01:06:21.480" style="s2">that any answers to those questions are</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.820" end="01:06:24.690" style="s2">going to be relevant to the to the the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.480" end="01:06:26.960" style="s2">art questions the the what should we</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.690" end="01:06:29.430" style="s2">care about the most</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.960" end="01:06:31.470" style="s2">yeah I probably agree with that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.430" end="01:06:33.570" style="s2">framework the way I identify following</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.470" end="01:06:37.320" style="s2">someone like Derek Parfit is as a quasi</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.570" end="01:06:39.810" style="s2">cognitive realist and to try to unpack</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.320" end="01:06:42.869" style="s2">that a little bit I do agree that a lot</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.810" end="01:06:44.490" style="s2">of our basic moral feelings or our Moral</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.869" end="01:06:46.349" style="s2">Sentiments to use the classical term</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.490" end="01:06:49.500" style="s2">probably do you have a biological or a</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.349" end="01:06:51.510" style="s2">naturalistic basis right they emerge you</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.500" end="01:06:53.460" style="s2">know in conscious beings that have</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.510" end="01:06:55.800" style="s2">evolved over a long period of time to</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.460" end="01:06:58.619" style="s2">have certain sentiments and studying</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.800" end="01:07:00.720" style="s2">them can be of great interest right now</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.619" end="01:07:02.490" style="s2">saying that just because we have certain</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.720" end="01:07:04.859" style="s2">moral sentiments that emerge in</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.490" end="01:07:06.599" style="s2">conscious beings doesn&#39;t really tell us</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.859" end="01:07:10.320" style="s2">very much about which Moral Sentiments</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.599" end="01:07:12.780" style="s2">are appropriate or what kind of rational</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.320" end="01:07:14.310" style="s2">programs or rational imperatives that we</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.780" end="01:07:15.750" style="s2">should ride from do sentiments right and</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.310" end="01:07:17.910" style="s2">this is where the realist element comes</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.750" end="01:07:20.190" style="s2">in because I think that once we try to</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.910" end="01:07:21.780" style="s2">use reason to ascertain what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.190" end="01:07:23.460" style="s2">moral codes we should follow they have</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.780" end="01:07:25.950" style="s2">an independent status that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.460" end="01:07:27.270" style="s2">beholden to how we feel about them and</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.950" end="01:07:29.250" style="s2">what I think is actually a much more</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.270" end="01:07:31.440" style="s2">interesting question than just what are</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.250" end="01:07:33.900" style="s2">our feelings about morality is actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.440" end="01:07:34.799" style="s2">context and people like Henry Sidgwick</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.900" end="01:07:37.079" style="s2">were aware of this</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.799" end="01:07:38.489" style="s2">as far back to the 19th century where we</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.079" end="01:07:40.380" style="s2">might have days strong and compelling</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.489" end="01:07:42.809" style="s2">moral reasons to do something that</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.380" end="01:07:44.670" style="s2">operates against our sentiments Sidgwick</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.809" end="01:07:46.949" style="s2">characterized this as a profound as</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.670" end="01:07:48.509" style="s2">problem in ethics right oftentimes we</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.949" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">might have compelling rational reasons</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.509" end="01:07:53.400" style="s2">to do something that we really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:57.359" style="s2">want to do and that actually feels wrong</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.400" end="01:07:58.499" style="s2">to us emotionally but nonetheless if we</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.359" end="01:08:00.089" style="s2">look at it from a more impartial</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.499" end="01:08:01.920" style="s2">perspective it seems like we have very</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.089" end="01:08:04.170" style="s2">good compelling moral reasons to do it</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:07.259" style="s2">and in his case Cedric was talking about</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.170" end="01:08:09.599" style="s2">the necessity to put aggregate utility</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.259" end="01:08:12.239" style="s2">over ahead of individual utility right</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.599" end="01:08:13.709" style="s2">and these kinds of questions aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.239" end="01:08:15.749" style="s2">things that can be answered by looking</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.709" end="01:08:17.429" style="s2">just at Moral Sentiments from whatever</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.749" end="01:08:20.699" style="s2">level of analysis that you think is</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.429" end="01:08:22.759" style="s2">appropriate right you can only answer</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.699" end="01:08:26.159" style="s2">them by using different analytical tools</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.759" end="01:08:27.540" style="s2">than what an empirical scientist or</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.159" end="01:08:30.270" style="s2">philosophical psychologists have</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.540" end="01:08:32.159" style="s2">available to them yeah yeah I would just</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.270" end="01:08:34.529" style="s2">I&#39;ll just say you know just real quickly</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.159" end="01:08:37.349" style="s2">so we don&#39;t turn our remaining time into</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.529" end="01:08:39.509" style="s2">a debate about meta ethics that would be</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.349" end="01:08:43.799" style="s2">a lot of fun though sure another time</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.509" end="01:08:47.250" style="s2">for sure then I&#39;d say that that what</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.799" end="01:08:49.139" style="s2">that more impartial perspective from</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.250" end="01:08:53.219" style="s2">which we can reject some of our</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.139" end="01:08:55.859" style="s2">sentiments amounts to ultimately has to</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.219" end="01:08:58.290" style="s2">come down to what Rawls calls reflective</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.859" end="01:09:00.900" style="s2">equilibrium which means that what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.290" end="01:09:03.630" style="s2">doing is we&#39;re looking at different</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.900" end="01:09:05.699" style="s2">sentiments that that seem to point in</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.630" end="01:09:07.440" style="s2">different directions and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.699" end="01:09:09.809" style="s2">through this process of trying to make</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.440" end="01:09:11.730" style="s2">trying to figure out how to cohere them</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.809" end="01:09:13.799" style="s2">together into an internally consistent</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.730" end="01:09:14.940" style="s2">framework which may it might mean at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.799" end="01:09:17.210" style="s2">end of it you have to throw some of them</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.940" end="01:09:19.589" style="s2">out right that&#39;s fine right but</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.210" end="01:09:22.559" style="s2">ultimately what&#39;s going on there still</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.589" end="01:09:24.859" style="s2">has in my view read that I&#39;d still go</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.559" end="01:09:27.569" style="s2">with the very human view about that has</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.859" end="01:09:30.239" style="s2">has sentiment at the base of it right</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.569" end="01:09:32.790" style="s2">like like like it&#39;s in at the end it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.239" end="01:09:34.650" style="s2">it&#39;s an elaborate form of throwing out</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.790" end="01:09:35.940" style="s2">some things we care about because we</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.650" end="01:09:38.040" style="s2">care about something else either more</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.940" end="01:09:40.020" style="s2">deeply yeah absolutely we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.040" end="01:09:41.159" style="s2">rationalize or create a hierarchy of</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.020" end="01:09:43.259" style="s2">rationalizations for our Moral</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.159" end="01:09:45.029" style="s2">Sentiments right and this should be done</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.259" end="01:09:46.500" style="s2">as and partially as possible but</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.029" end="01:09:49.140" style="s2">ultimately it does arise from a</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.500" end="01:09:51.630" style="s2">convention that we should be good</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.140" end="01:09:53.790" style="s2">in some strange sense of the word right</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.630" end="01:09:55.770" style="s2">and we can talk about that later on but</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.790" end="01:09:59.880" style="s2">that&#39;s why I think quasi cognitivist</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.770" end="01:10:01.410" style="s2">realism is the way to go about it uh can</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.880" end="01:10:03.360" style="s2">I can I hop in and just just say</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.410" end="01:10:04.650" style="s2">something I want to do because the the</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.360" end="01:10:06.540" style="s2">idea of competence hierarchies was</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.650" end="01:10:08.760" style="s2">brought up and I just wanted to</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.540" end="01:10:10.680" style="s2">elaborate a little bit on the historical</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.760" end="01:10:14.040" style="s2">and ideological context of Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.680" end="01:10:15.540" style="s2">work of course Peterson talks about you</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.040" end="01:10:17.610" style="s2">know certainly he naturalizes the idea</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.540" end="01:10:19.560" style="s2">of competence hierarchies right though I</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.610" end="01:10:21.000" style="s2">think he only says it&#39;s it&#39;s the case</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.560" end="01:10:22.590" style="s2">amongst animals with higher-level</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.000" end="01:10:25.170" style="s2">nervous systems that competence</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.590" end="01:10:27.480" style="s2">hierarchies exist and what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.170" end="01:10:31.680" style="s2">about this as regards competence</p>
<p begin="01:10:27.480" end="01:10:33.630" style="s2">hierarchies is that this notion that</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.680" end="01:10:37.380" style="s2">nature is defined by competence Aki&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.630" end="01:10:39.600" style="s2">emerges more or less specifically within</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.380" end="01:10:42.270" style="s2">the context of bourgeois capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.600" end="01:10:44.310" style="s2">society right so you know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.270" end="01:10:45.900" style="s2">interesting right if you look at if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.310" end="01:10:47.370" style="s2">will get C on SPO we&#39;re at the</p>

<p begin="01:10:47.370" end="01:10:52.230" style="s2">right the founder of it Emil but knee I</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.920" end="01:10:53.730" style="s2">believe he gave a speech when it was</p>

<p begin="01:11:12.270" end="01:11:18.630" style="s2">you know and I think you can see the way</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.600" end="01:11:21.060" style="s2">that this is very much part of the genus</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.630" end="01:11:24.690" style="s2">of a bourgeois society I mean of course</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.060" end="01:11:27.090" style="s2">you could look at you know the you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.690" end="01:11:28.350" style="s2">if you look at Darwin right in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.090" end="01:11:30.300" style="s2">how we conceptualize as natural</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.350" end="01:11:31.890" style="s2">selection and Marx observes this Darwin</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.300" end="01:11:36.570" style="s2">ends up being very influenced by Malthus</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.890" end="01:11:37.770" style="s2">right you know and this aspect of</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.570" end="01:11:39.390" style="s2">Darwin&#39;s work ends up being played</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.770" end="01:11:40.790" style="s2">played you know the sort of survival of</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.390" end="01:11:43.200" style="s2">the fittest sort of vulgar</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.790" end="01:11:44.820" style="s2">interpretation of Darwin&#39;s work ends up</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.200" end="01:11:47.880" style="s2">being played up more heavily than it</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.820" end="01:11:50.430" style="s2">even is represented you know in Darwin&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.880" end="01:11:53.280" style="s2">work so his cousin Francis Galton right</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.430" end="01:11:57.570" style="s2">you know he really stresses this you</p>
<p begin="01:11:53.280" end="01:11:59.670" style="s2">know sort of social Darwinian dimension</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.570" end="01:12:02.170" style="s2">right you know that then becomes very</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.670" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">very popular within the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.170" end="01:12:06.130" style="s2">but of course the difficulty with all of</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:08.320" style="s2">this right is that you know it is the</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.130" end="01:12:11.140" style="s2">case right within a society such as ours</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.320" end="01:12:13.960" style="s2">that hierarchies are based partially on</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.140" end="01:12:15.550" style="s2">competence right you know I think it</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.960" end="01:12:17.260" style="s2">would have been unthinkable for someone</p>

<p begin="01:12:17.260" end="01:12:20.710" style="s2">right you know to think that I our keys</p>

<p begin="01:12:20.710" end="01:12:26.170" style="s2">today there&#39;s enough of it right that it</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.530" end="01:12:28.660" style="s2">can be defended but you know I think</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.170" end="01:12:30.370" style="s2">what we have to understand is that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.660" end="01:12:32.050" style="s2">know like say you come from a very very</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.370" end="01:12:33.910" style="s2">wealthy country right typically a white</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.050" end="01:12:34.929" style="s2">country right you know then because of</p>

<p begin="01:14:34.110" end="01:14:41.230" style="s2">look I think I think that so</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.580" end="01:14:45.580" style="s2">so it&#39;s certainly true that many people</p>

<p begin="01:19:16.940" end="01:19:20.330" style="s2">and just to bring it back to Peterson</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.890" end="01:19:22.510" style="s2">one of the things that I point out is</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.330" end="01:19:24.860" style="s2">he&#39;s very willing to forgive Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.510" end="01:19:26.870" style="s2">this is the same Nietzsche I used to say</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.860" end="01:19:29.600" style="s2">things like well if several million</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.870" end="01:19:31.160" style="s2">people die in the 20th century that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.600" end="01:19:33.620" style="s2">acceptable loss to produce a more</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.160" end="01:19:35.300" style="s2">interesting kind of environment or who</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.620" end="01:19:37.490" style="s2">famously chimed in the Spoke Zarathustra</p>

<p begin="01:19:37.490" end="01:19:41.840" style="s2">a whip right and he&#39;s also very willing</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.190" end="01:19:44.060" style="s2">to forgive Martin Heidegger who unlike</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.840" end="01:19:45.800" style="s2">Marx actually did support in</p>

<p begin="01:19:45.800" end="01:19:50.780" style="s2">the Nazi Party all right he was very</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.740" end="01:19:52.970" style="s2">like vigorously involved he tattled to</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.780" end="01:19:55.610" style="s2">the Gestapo about you know various</p>

<p begin="01:19:55.610" end="01:19:59.540" style="s2">about how they weren&#39;t German enough and</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.410" end="01:20:02.150" style="s2">you find very little mention of that in</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.540" end="01:20:03.470" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s work much as you don&#39;t find a</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.150" end="01:20:05.060" style="s2">lot of references to the crimes</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.470" end="01:20:07.460" style="s2">committed by various classical liberals</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.060" end="01:20:09.170" style="s2">and the work of the IDW more generally</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.460" end="01:20:11.150" style="s2">right and I&#39;m not saying that we</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.170" end="01:20:14.210" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t read Marx our fight ago and</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.150" end="01:20:16.070" style="s2">Nietzsche or lock our path on that basis</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.210" end="01:20:18.650" style="s2">what we need to do is of course extract</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.070" end="01:20:20.900" style="s2">was valuable from their work well sadly</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.650" end="01:20:23.150" style="s2">chucking the rest as either an</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.900" end="01:20:25.040" style="s2">unfortunate relic of history or just</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.150" end="01:20:27.740" style="s2">every bad conclusion that they reached</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.040" end="01:20:29.480" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t really supported by anything</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.740" end="01:20:33.590" style="s2">other than their own prejudices and</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.480" end="01:20:35.180" style="s2">negative inclination yeah yeah oh by the</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.590" end="01:20:38.240" style="s2">way real quickly I just realized I never</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.180" end="01:20:39.650" style="s2">actually connected the dots with my last</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.240" end="01:20:41.930" style="s2">comment right about Rawls and</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.650" end="01:20:44.330" style="s2">individualism that that walls you and</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.930" end="01:20:47.990" style="s2">framework that I just mentioned is still</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.330" end="01:20:50.750" style="s2">one that in if we mean by individualism</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.990" end="01:20:54.020" style="s2">as seen discrete individuals as the</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.750" end="01:20:55.229" style="s2">relevant unit of moral evaluation unlike</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.020" end="01:20:57.959" style="s2">for example utility</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.229" end="01:20:59.909" style="s2">which is actually collectivist in the</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.959" end="01:21:01.590" style="s2">sense that your your aggregated</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.909" end="01:21:04.079" style="s2">happiness and not worrying about how its</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.590" end="01:21:06.090" style="s2">distributed among individuals then</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.079" end="01:21:08.219" style="s2">Rahl&#39;s e&#39;en ISM is is morally</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.090" end="01:21:11.039" style="s2">individualist right roles you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.219" end="01:21:13.499" style="s2">Rawls&#39;s concern is how any given form of</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.039" end="01:21:15.329" style="s2">social organization and what it would be</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.499" end="01:21:18.179" style="s2">like to live in it as one of the least</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.329" end="01:21:19.499" style="s2">well-off members of that society so even</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.179" end="01:21:23.309" style="s2">though his conclusions are very</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.499" end="01:21:25.199" style="s2">different than that libertarians or</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.309" end="01:21:27.389" style="s2">perking conservatives or anything it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.199" end="01:21:30.389" style="s2">not because he is less morally concerned</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.389" end="01:21:31.349" style="s2">with individuals yeah actually this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.389" end="01:21:33.269" style="s2">one of the things that I want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.349" end="01:21:36.840" style="s2">about also since I&#39;m an Aussie at heart</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.269" end="01:21:38.849" style="s2">right although my own esoteric way and</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.840" end="01:21:40.739" style="s2">when it comes to the point about Marx</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.849" end="01:21:42.959" style="s2">right I actually think Marx very much</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.739" end="01:21:44.429" style="s2">belongs in what you call the broad or</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.959" end="01:21:47.039" style="s2">Western Canon which includes liberalism</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.429" end="01:21:50.010" style="s2">in part because marks rather like many</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.039" end="01:21:51.300" style="s2">of his liberal progeny ders was very</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.010" end="01:21:53.369" style="s2">concerned with freedom first and</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.300" end="01:21:55.559" style="s2">foremost right one of the odd things if</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.369" end="01:21:57.630" style="s2">you read Marx whenever he actually talks</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.559" end="01:21:59.340" style="s2">about his own normative commitments</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.630" end="01:22:01.050" style="s2">which has been pointed out has been</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.340" end="01:22:02.940" style="s2">frequently and he almost always talked</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.050" end="01:22:05.070" style="s2">about things in terms of freedom the</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.940" end="01:22:06.809" style="s2">development of your personality not</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.070" end="01:22:08.760" style="s2">living in an exploitative system where</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.809" end="01:22:10.260" style="s2">you&#39;re ready to power &#39;less rather than</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.760" end="01:22:12.389" style="s2">in terms of the necessity for strict</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.260" end="01:22:14.219" style="s2">equality per se and this comes from the</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.389" end="01:22:15.510" style="s2">fact that Marx was highly opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.219" end="01:22:17.459" style="s2">Hegel well yeah right</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.510" end="01:22:19.769" style="s2">who was very much a kind of conservative</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.459" end="01:22:21.389" style="s2">liberal thinker who Marx radicalized</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.769" end="01:22:23.639" style="s2">along with others in the Yoyogi galleon</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.389" end="01:22:24.959" style="s2">movement and Hegel&#39;s entire point was</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.639" end="01:22:26.909" style="s2">that you know in society you want</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.959" end="01:22:29.489" style="s2">freedom to develop various sides of your</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.909" end="01:22:30.900" style="s2">personality and as robust a fashion as</p>
<p begin="01:22:29.489" end="01:22:32.820" style="s2">possible you know this is putting it</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.900" end="01:22:35.039" style="s2">very simply since of course</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.820" end="01:22:37.170" style="s2">hable Hegel is famously difficult know</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.039" end="01:22:39.420" style="s2">when it comes to what I think our own</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.170" end="01:22:41.610" style="s2">normative commitments should be I agree</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.420" end="01:22:42.929" style="s2">with somebody like Rawls right I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.610" end="01:22:45.300" style="s2">even think you can talk about us living</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.929" end="01:22:46.949" style="s2">in a meritocracy when it&#39;s patently</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.300" end="01:22:50.369" style="s2">obvious that many people enjoy</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.949" end="01:22:51.570" style="s2">tremendous advantages from birth right</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.369" end="01:22:54.090" style="s2">and other people are extremely</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.570" end="01:22:55.979" style="s2">disadvantaged from birth and this can</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.090" end="01:22:57.869" style="s2">include things from their social status</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.979" end="01:22:59.190" style="s2">what kind of family you&#39;re born into you</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.869" end="01:23:00.719" style="s2">what kind of advantages your parents are</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.190" end="01:23:02.219" style="s2">going to give you a disadvantage is</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.719" end="01:23:05.670" style="s2">they&#39;re going to give you but can also</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.219" end="01:23:08.010" style="s2">come to or so I relate to things like</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.670" end="01:23:09.120" style="s2">natural abilities but one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.010" end="01:23:10.500" style="s2">that people like Charles Moreau</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.120" end="01:23:12.830" style="s2">really like to talk about and say well</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.500" end="01:23:15.930" style="s2">we should live in it from a meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.830" end="01:23:17.580" style="s2">defined by IQ I the smartest people</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.930" end="01:23:19.050" style="s2">should rise to the top or they will rise</p>
<p begin="01:23:17.580" end="01:23:19.530" style="s2">to the top and there&#39;s nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.050" end="01:23:21.150" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.530" end="01:23:23.190" style="s2">well my account that&#39;s not a meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.150" end="01:23:25.950" style="s2">right if winning a genetic genetic</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.190" end="01:23:27.630" style="s2">lottery allows you to get to the top you</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.950" end="01:23:29.550" style="s2">don&#39;t merit that you happen to be lucky</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.630" end="01:23:31.410" style="s2">enough to be born with us and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.550" end="01:23:33.450" style="s2">rauzein point is that you shouldn&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.410" end="01:23:34.860" style="s2">bad about this but you should recognize</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.450" end="01:23:37.230" style="s2">that you were lucky enough to be born</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.860" end="01:23:39.360" style="s2">where certain gifts and be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.230" end="01:23:41.100" style="s2">redistribute some of what you gained on</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.360" end="01:23:43.830" style="s2">their behalf to those who through no</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.100" end="01:23:45.540" style="s2">fault of their own happen to be less</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.830" end="01:23:46.950" style="s2">fortunate than you are and I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.540" end="01:23:48.420" style="s2">that&#39;s the appropriate thing to do and</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.950" end="01:23:49.830" style="s2">it&#39;s also the liberal thing to do</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.420" end="01:23:51.810" style="s2">if you take things like the moral</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.830" end="01:23:54.030" style="s2">quality of individuals and fairness</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.810" end="01:23:56.820" style="s2">seriously which our society are afraid</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.030" end="01:23:59.070" style="s2">to say does not in any serious respect</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.820" end="01:24:01.590" style="s2">yeah okay I guess I guess I just very</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.070" end="01:24:06.000" style="s2">briefly shot man that you know i think</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.590" end="01:24:10.110" style="s2">that i think that if by meritocracy</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.000" end="01:24:12.470" style="s2">you mean a a society in which the</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.110" end="01:24:15.900" style="s2">primary way of distributed resources is</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.470" end="01:24:18.140" style="s2">according to a hierarchy of competence</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.900" end="01:24:22.350" style="s2">right as is a hierarchy based on</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.140" end="01:24:24.660" style="s2">variations and natural talents then of</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.350" end="01:24:26.070" style="s2">course one we obviously don&#39;t live in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.660" end="01:24:30.420" style="s2">society with the slightest resemblance</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.070" end="01:24:32.310" style="s2">to that but you know I think that like</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.420" end="01:24:35.490" style="s2">Twitter is very useful for illustrating</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.310" end="01:24:41.790" style="s2">this how the mental quality of a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.490" end="01:24:43.290" style="s2">our richest plutocrats and - it wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.790" end="01:24:45.090" style="s2">be a desirable one to live in anyway</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.290" end="01:24:49.560" style="s2">right as Matt says right just just to</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.090" end="01:24:52.770" style="s2">put a very just just to lower the level</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.560" end="01:24:55.230" style="s2">of discourse here I&#39;ll say that my wife</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.770" end="01:24:56.850" style="s2">and I just watched the classic 1997</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.230" end="01:24:59.490" style="s2">science fiction film Gattaca the other</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.850" end="01:25:02.280" style="s2">night and that that seems like a good</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.490" end="01:25:04.140" style="s2">illustration of why a genuinely mirrored</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.280" end="01:25:06.990" style="s2">kradic society in the sense of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.140" end="01:25:10.980" style="s2">Society of where distribution is along</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.990" end="01:25:14.280" style="s2">the lines of of classic of variations</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.980" end="01:25:17.880" style="s2">natural talents would be a dystopia yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.280" end="01:25:20.580" style="s2">great film and I just uh can I just say</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.880" end="01:25:22.770" style="s2">something if we have a bit if we have a</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.580" end="01:25:25.530" style="s2">couple minutes I just want</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.770" end="01:25:27.810" style="s2">to say first of all just with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.530" end="01:25:30.450" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying about marks and</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.810" end="01:25:32.370" style="s2">individuality it seems to me that there</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.450" end="01:25:34.530" style="s2">is a you know the problem of this with</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.370" end="01:25:36.720" style="s2">marks is always like in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.530" end="01:25:40.860" style="s2">and marks his early work you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.720" end="01:25:43.260" style="s2">different albeit in a genre similar to</p>
<p begin="01:25:40.860" end="01:25:48.120" style="s2">Peterson in a certain sense is that he</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.260" end="01:25:51.420" style="s2">does have you know a bio logistic view</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.120" end="01:25:52.950" style="s2">of morality in a certain sense right and</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.420" end="01:25:56.340" style="s2">this is because of the daddy has to fire</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.950" end="01:25:58.350" style="s2">back right so for our back you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.340" end="01:26:00.060" style="s2">understands huggles dialectic you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.350" end="01:26:02.460" style="s2">in relation to the biology of the human</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.060" end="01:26:04.410" style="s2">itself right so the things that are</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.460" end="01:26:07.830" style="s2">portrayed is dialectical movements and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.410" end="01:26:09.390" style="s2">haggle become a question of biology and</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.830" end="01:26:10.980" style="s2">Mark sort of structures is work in that</p>
<p begin="01:26:09.390" end="01:26:12.540" style="s2">way like the struggle for socialism is</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.980" end="01:26:15.690" style="s2">about overcoming the alienation of the</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.540" end="01:26:18.240" style="s2">individual but in around the mid-1840s</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.690" end="01:26:20.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a shift right where Marx pivots</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.240" end="01:26:23.490" style="s2">and he starts to focus more on the way</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.370" end="01:26:25.190" style="s2">that notions of individuality an agency</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.490" end="01:26:28.950" style="s2">for example are structured by</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.190" end="01:26:31.050" style="s2">socio-economic formations and you know</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.950" end="01:26:32.820" style="s2">in capital we see that you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.050" end="01:26:34.890" style="s2">historical unfolding of value in</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.820" end="01:26:36.000" style="s2">economic systems becomes quite decisive</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.890" end="01:26:37.650" style="s2">so he says well the freedom</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.000" end="01:26:39.630" style="s2">characteristic of Protestantism is</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.650" end="01:26:42.180" style="s2">appropriate to a society of individual</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.630" end="01:26:44.250" style="s2">commodity producers and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.180" end="01:26:48.080" style="s2">you know and that certainly opens the</p>
<p begin="01:26:44.250" end="01:26:51.000" style="s2">door to a broader critique of notions of</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.080" end="01:26:53.130" style="s2">liberalism or humanism in terms of how</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.000" end="01:26:55.560" style="s2">they can be ideologically deployed in</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.130" end="01:26:56.820" style="s2">the present or in that Marx&#39;s time so</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.560" end="01:26:58.860" style="s2">people go in different directions in</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.820" end="01:27:00.390" style="s2">this like Michele onry tries to explain</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.860" end="01:27:03.180" style="s2">all of Marxism with respect to</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.390" end="01:27:04.710" style="s2">individual phenomenology reading the</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.180" end="01:27:07.320" style="s2">earlier work whereas someone like Luis</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.710" end="01:27:08.760" style="s2">Salazar will say well Marx is totally</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.320" end="01:27:11.190" style="s2">anti humanist and there&#39;s a scientific</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.760" end="01:27:13.200" style="s2">Marxism that dissolves these notions and</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.190" end="01:27:14.610" style="s2">so on and I also just want to say one</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.200" end="01:27:17.250" style="s2">other thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.610" end="01:27:20.730" style="s2">I believe rayvin&#39;s said how do we</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.250" end="01:27:24.180" style="s2">distinguish competency from merit and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.730" end="01:27:27.180" style="s2">think one thing again from a Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.180" end="01:27:30.900" style="s2">perspective is that you know if you</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.180" end="01:27:32.190" style="s2">think of our society economically you</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.900" end="01:27:35.130" style="s2">know this is one way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.190" end="01:27:36.640" style="s2">right you know there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.130" end="01:27:37.930" style="s2">inequality about the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.640" end="01:27:39.730" style="s2">you know if someone has capital and they</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.930" end="01:27:41.530" style="s2">start a business right but they&#39;re able</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.730" end="01:27:44.590" style="s2">to appropriate the value you create</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.530" end="01:27:46.270" style="s2">right you know and we&#39;re it the case</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.590" end="01:27:48.130" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t have a system right in</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.270" end="01:27:50.110" style="s2">which one you know you have people in</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.130" end="01:27:51.190" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s working for minimum wages you</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.110" end="01:27:52.810" style="s2">have you know shareholders and</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.190" end="01:27:54.730" style="s2">McDonald&#39;s owning Ferraris and so forth</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.810" end="01:27:56.830" style="s2">the people actually would be rewarded</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.730" end="01:27:58.720" style="s2">far more based on merit right because</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.830" end="01:28:00.220" style="s2">they&#39;d be being remunerated for you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:58.720" end="01:28:02.950" style="s2">for something approximating the actual</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.220" end="01:28:05.500" style="s2">value of their work right so I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.950" end="01:28:07.960" style="s2">marks this point not respect is that the</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.500" end="01:28:11.050" style="s2">capitalist mode of production is</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.960" end="01:28:13.300" style="s2">actually incompatible with a truly</p>
<p begin="01:28:11.050" end="01:28:16.930" style="s2">merit-based focus</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.300" end="01:28:17.890" style="s2">I just want that no I just want to say</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.930" end="01:28:21.940" style="s2">something that this should be our last</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.890" end="01:28:27.250" style="s2">share because we do have to close out do</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.940" end="01:28:28.630" style="s2">you want to one of the things where I</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.250" end="01:28:30.670" style="s2">think we can distinguish confidence from</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.630" end="01:28:32.140" style="s2">merit is confidence is fundamentally</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.670" end="01:28:34.720" style="s2">just how good you are that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.140" end="01:28:36.340" style="s2">right and there are a lot of different</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.720" end="01:28:39.100" style="s2">dimensions of formal competencies that</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.340" end="01:28:41.760" style="s2">somebody might have and they&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.100" end="01:28:43.840" style="s2">by the market and fairly arbitrary ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.760" end="01:28:45.460" style="s2">sometimes in less arbitrary ways</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.840" end="01:28:47.890" style="s2">depending upon the skills that one might</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.460" end="01:28:50.260" style="s2">develop but what we understand typically</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.890" end="01:28:51.490" style="s2">when we talk about merit it goes back to</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.260" end="01:28:54.820" style="s2">an earlier question of what someone</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.490" end="01:28:56.290" style="s2">deserves right and I think this is where</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.820" end="01:28:58.060" style="s2">people like Rawls and myself have a</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.290" end="01:29:00.160" style="s2">fundamental problem with the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:58.060" end="01:29:02.200" style="s2">Association people make between a</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.160" end="01:29:03.910" style="s2">competence hierarchy and when were the</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.200" end="01:29:06.820" style="s2">deserving or the worthy rise to the top</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.910" end="01:29:08.920" style="s2">because my argument would be yes while</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.820" end="01:29:10.780" style="s2">it might be the case that people with</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.920" end="01:29:12.340" style="s2">high levels of confidence in fields that</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.780" end="01:29:14.920" style="s2">the market happens to reward in here I</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.340" end="01:29:16.210" style="s2">think Conrad is correct right might rise</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.920" end="01:29:17.800" style="s2">to the top that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.210" end="01:29:19.120" style="s2">they&#39;re particularly worthy in any</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.800" end="01:29:21.580" style="s2">meaningful sense of the word</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.120" end="01:29:22.630" style="s2">particularly if they get ahead merely</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.580" end="01:29:23.590" style="s2">because they have gifts that were</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.630" end="01:29:25.450" style="s2">distributed them through the</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.590" end="01:29:27.700" style="s2">happenstance of nature or because they</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.450" end="01:29:29.290" style="s2">have had certain advantages from the</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.700" end="01:29:31.720" style="s2">beginning if what you really want to</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.290" end="01:29:33.310" style="s2">talk about was a meritocracy our society</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.720" end="01:29:35.110" style="s2">would look radically different than it</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.310" end="01:29:37.360" style="s2">does right now so radically different</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.110" end="01:29:39.220" style="s2">actually that would probably fill</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.360" end="01:29:40.690" style="s2">Peterson with nightmares because it</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.220" end="01:29:42.130" style="s2">would involve massive forms of</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.690" end="01:29:45.040" style="s2">disordered to try to establish anything</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.130" end="01:29:47.200" style="s2">approximating a meritocracy in the sense</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.040" end="01:29:49.750" style="s2">that any moral theory would find</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.200" end="01:29:50.980" style="s2">appropriate all right so I think if</p>
<p begin="01:29:49.750" end="01:29:53.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to actually have a serious</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.980" end="01:29:55.810" style="s2">debate about capitalism versus liberal</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.980" end="01:29:57.250" style="s2">socialism or Marxism of where it happens</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.810" end="01:29:59.680" style="s2">to be we need to start from the</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.250" end="01:30:01.300" style="s2">standpoint that whatever capitalism is</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.680" end="01:30:03.790" style="s2">and one of hierarchy competencies are</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.300" end="01:30:05.410" style="s2">they are not meritocratic right in fact</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.790" end="01:30:11.230" style="s2">it&#39;s a perversion of the notion of merit</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.410" end="01:30:13.090" style="s2">ought to consider them such cool and the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.230" end="01:30:15.210" style="s2">sense Ben wants to respond but we have</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.090" end="01:30:18.640" style="s2">to we have to stop right there no okay</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.210" end="01:30:20.560" style="s2">so thank you for coming today this was a</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.640" end="01:30:22.870" style="s2">really juicy discussion I think the chat</p>

<p begin="01:30:22.870" end="01:30:26.710" style="s2">philosophical culture wars are going in</p>
