<p begin="00:04:14.159" end="00:04:18.079" style="s2">talking to someone who</p>

<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:31.520" style="s2">had a good chat with them</p>

<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:24.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s okay but i think this week i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.160" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">going to try and y&#39;all can help hold me</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.240" end="00:06:28.880" style="s2">accountable on this</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:32.000" style="s2">to go ahead and have a public uh an</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.880" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">open debate on whether we should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.000" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">sending the kids back to school</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.160" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">i probably need to narrow it down to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:39.680" style="s2">us to make it manageable</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.919" end="00:06:43.360" style="s2">but the debate could be instructive to</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.240" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:46.960" style="s2">municipalities i think also we&#39;re kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:48.560" style="s2">of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.960" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">doing the worst with coronavirus right</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.560" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">now i think that&#39;s what i hear but that</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:54.400" style="s2">may be our news media extra</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">exaggerating things but uh so would</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.400" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">probably be the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:07:00.720" style="s2">most contentious discussion um so</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.319" style="s2">start a debate on that put it through</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.720" end="00:07:05.360" style="s2">the system and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.319" end="00:07:08.720" style="s2">learn from it</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.360" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">would be my next steps and then on the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.720" end="00:07:16.400" style="s2">side i&#39;m prototy to prototyping to</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:19.840" style="s2">apps for other startups that are not</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.400" end="00:07:22.880" style="s2">neither of them are are</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.840" end="00:07:24.639" style="s2">high profit startups so</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.880" end="00:07:26.479" style="s2">they&#39;re just kind of project ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.639" end="00:07:29.680" style="s2">doing some prototypes</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.479" end="00:07:33.360" style="s2">and i&#39;m thinking about doing some</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.680" end="00:07:34.960" style="s2">uh demos of some profile projects</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.360" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">so just stuff i&#39;ve wanted to do that i</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.960" end="00:07:38.880" style="s2">could show on my profile like</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">one is telling you what&#39;s the best time</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.880" end="00:07:41.840" style="s2">to run</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">during the day based on your own</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.840" end="00:07:45.280" style="s2">parameters doing that for my mom who</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">goes walking</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.280" end="00:07:48.639" style="s2">and stuff like that so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:50.879" style="s2">also kind of what i&#39;m working on</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.639" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think i have any hot seat</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.879" end="00:07:52.960" style="s2">stuff so we could talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">marketing or</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.960" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">adriel if yours is kind of if you think</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:07:57.759" style="s2">yours is quick we could start yours and</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">then hit</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.759" end="00:08:02.639" style="s2">marketing after that sure and it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:05.199" style="s2">of marketing adjacent anyway</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.639" end="00:08:07.199" style="s2">and also a little bit touches on</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.199" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">something that i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.199" end="00:08:10.560" style="s2">maybe dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.639" end="00:08:14.800" style="s2">so mine has to do with and i think sort</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:17.280" style="s2">of briefly touched on this topic</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.800" end="00:08:18.240" style="s2">internally before and now it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.280" end="00:08:22.000" style="s2">it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.240" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">coming up quick um so part of it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.000" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">i think anybody that sort of attended uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:26.319" style="s2">multiple of these and heard me talk</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.319" end="00:08:31.120" style="s2">wiki election a couple times the end</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:34.240" style="s2">goal is it&#39;ll cover a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.120" end="00:08:36.399" style="s2">um and i was</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.240" end="00:08:37.919" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of always been grappling with</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.399" end="00:08:38.640" style="s2">the challenge of trying to do too much</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.919" end="00:08:41.440" style="s2">under</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.640" end="00:08:42.959" style="s2">one umbrella and where maybe the name</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.440" end="00:08:43.839" style="s2">book election doesn&#39;t actually make</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.959" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.839" end="00:08:49.839" style="s2">um and and part of it came up yesterday</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:52.399" style="s2">with the part to track organizations</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.839" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">so what i&#39;m thinking of is there was</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.399" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">another um</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:08:57.839" style="s2">i guess brand or company or i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:01.680" style="s2">what to call it</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.839" end="00:09:03.760" style="s2">that uh i&#39;ve got the the domain name for</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.680" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">i kind of like the name of and it makes</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.760" end="00:09:08.720" style="s2">sense in context of everything</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:10.480" style="s2">called converati and</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.720" end="00:09:12.080" style="s2">the end goal was to maybe have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.480" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">different site it&#39;s a part of the same</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.080" end="00:09:15.519" style="s2">sort of data set</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">where wiki election is focused on</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.519" end="00:09:20.640" style="s2">politics right so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:23.040" style="s2">uh politicians and parties and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.640" end="00:09:24.080" style="s2">where they get their donations from and</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.040" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">what legislation</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.080" end="00:09:28.160" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re passing you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">lobbying groups they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.160" end="00:09:31.839" style="s2">they&#39;re working with that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.240" end="00:09:34.080" style="s2">and then for conferrati have that be</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.839" end="00:09:36.080" style="s2">more for the organizations</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.080" end="00:09:37.600" style="s2">so like what companies are there who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.080" end="00:09:39.120" style="s2">on the board um</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.600" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">possibly things like how they paid their</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.120" end="00:09:43.680" style="s2">staff and you know what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">environmental impact they have but then</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.680" end="00:09:49.680" style="s2">also some of that overlap with</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:51.680" style="s2">wikilection on like how involved is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.680" end="00:09:54.160" style="s2">is that organization in politics what</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.680" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">sort of donations have they given</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.160" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">especially for lobbying groups what kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:09:59.680" style="s2">of legislation have</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:02.240" style="s2">have they affected uh so that you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.680" end="00:10:04.480" style="s2">sort of see two sides of that same coin</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.240" end="00:10:06.240" style="s2">i think in both canada and the us</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.480" end="00:10:07.760" style="s2">companies can get pretty involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.240" end="00:10:09.440" style="s2">process and spend a lot of money and</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.760" end="00:10:10.959" style="s2">trying to affect legislation</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.440" end="00:10:13.120" style="s2">and being able to see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.959" end="00:10:15.519" style="s2">on both sides there like so for</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.120" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">you know on work election being able to</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.519" end="00:10:19.920" style="s2">see</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:21.440" style="s2">um where a politician&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.920" end="00:10:23.440" style="s2">donations are are coming from like</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.440" end="00:10:27.200" style="s2">especially which industry</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.440" end="00:10:29.120" style="s2">and then see which legislation</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.200" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">or i guess how they lean on legislation</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.120" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">that that affects</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">industries especially the ones that</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:34.880" style="s2">contributed to them you know to show</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.880" end="00:10:38.800" style="s2">heavily swayed by donations</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.040" end="00:10:43.200" style="s2">and so the the question is sort of about</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.760" end="00:10:45.680" style="s2">having</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.200" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">one versus multiple brands like having</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.680" end="00:10:50.240" style="s2">it split up</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:51.040" style="s2">like that or both just from the public</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.240" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.040" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">do people find that confusing does it it</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:56.000" style="s2">make more sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:57.440" style="s2">and from this sort of a project</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.000" end="00:10:58.240" style="s2">standpoint does it make sense to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.440" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">two</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.240" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">very similar projects that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:04.640" style="s2">which is sort of where i think it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.880" end="00:11:05.360" style="s2">a bit like what you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.640" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">bentley</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.360" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">with bruising score and gully bot where</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.839" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of two sides of the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">coin but it&#39;s two different things to to</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.839" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">to to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:18.560" style="s2">yeah i think i&#39;m um i did it kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:20.240" style="s2">opposite way</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.560" end="00:11:21.920" style="s2">so reason score is kind of a big tool</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.240" end="00:11:22.240" style="s2">and now i&#39;m narrowing it down to one of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.920" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.240" end="00:11:27.040" style="s2">focuses of one of the use cases and you</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">did wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.040" end="00:11:30.160" style="s2">which is focusing on the political and</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">now you&#39;re trying to decide whether you</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.160" end="00:11:34.160" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">do the larger thing um i</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.160" end="00:11:37.360" style="s2">i think the good thing about khan</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">ferrari is that it could mean any</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.360" end="00:11:42.720" style="s2">almost anything yeah so you could do</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.079" end="00:11:46.800" style="s2">wiki election under that</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.720" end="00:11:48.720" style="s2">moniker if you had to um</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.800" end="00:11:50.000" style="s2">martu should have to speak to this but i</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.720" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;d be that difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.000" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">technically</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">to serve the same thing to both sites</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:56.160" style="s2">and maybe have one</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.519" end="00:12:01.279" style="s2">maybe start in a different area so if</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s not too much of a technical thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.279" end="00:12:06.160" style="s2">and you already own the domain</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.600" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">then i would i think it&#39;d probably be a</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.160" end="00:12:09.440" style="s2">good idea if</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:10.959" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling passionate about the the</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.440" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">business</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.959" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.519" end="00:12:19.040" style="s2">so i think that&#39;s a good idea go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:24.800" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s just an entry point domain</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:26.399" style="s2">name is an entry point to the software</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.800" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">and this is exactly the same what i am</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.399" end="00:12:31.760" style="s2">doing with hyperlogos</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:33.920" style="s2">the software is the same and it works</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.760" end="00:12:36.639" style="s2">not on the same database maybe but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.920" end="00:12:39.200" style="s2">configurable to the point of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.639" end="00:12:40.959" style="s2">you have just one set of files and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.200" end="00:12:44.800" style="s2">different databases for different</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.959" end="00:12:49.120" style="s2">entry points and uh it&#39;s really easy to</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.800" end="00:12:49.680" style="s2">um see what uh domain was used to enter</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.120" end="00:12:52.160" style="s2">the site</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.680" end="00:12:53.279" style="s2">and then present uh even slightly</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.160" end="00:12:56.079" style="s2">different front-end</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.279" end="00:12:57.440" style="s2">and possibly slightly different angle to</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.079" end="00:13:00.720" style="s2">view the data</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.440" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">right yeah and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.720" end="00:13:04.160" style="s2">like it would end up sharing data if you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">think you know if maybe there&#39;s ten</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.160" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">tables</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">each one might use like seven of them</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.079" end="00:13:14.000" style="s2">it can and in this specific case</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">probably it even should because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.000" end="00:13:17.440" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.560" style="s2">um all different angles are going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.440" end="00:13:20.480" style="s2">work on the same</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.560" end="00:13:21.760" style="s2">set of people for example instead of</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.480" end="00:13:24.320" style="s2">political parties</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.760" end="00:13:25.680" style="s2">companies and and so on so it makes</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.320" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">sense to share data</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.680" end="00:13:30.000" style="s2">some data at least uh users like</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:32.959" style="s2">internal users</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.000" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">that can be kept separate so it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.959" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">all doable and it&#39;s all pretty</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">uh easy to do so no problem</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">okay cool thank you all right</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">okay yeah because i&#39;d like i&#39;d be more</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.560" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">interested in the companies actually and</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:52.720" style="s2">i also wanted to know</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:54.240" style="s2">um does wiki election include all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.720" end="00:13:57.839" style="s2">lobby groups</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.240" end="00:14:00.160" style="s2">as well as the politicians that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.839" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">yes and that&#39;s one of the weirder areas</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.160" end="00:14:02.480" style="s2">where they kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.120" end="00:14:04.320" style="s2">the lobbying groups kind of need to</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.480" end="00:14:06.480" style="s2">exist on both sides and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.320" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">really one of the only groups that do</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.480" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">like i i</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:10.560" style="s2">don&#39;t expect the political parties to</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">exist on conferrati</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.560" end="00:14:14.800" style="s2">but lobbying groups have to be both yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:15.440" style="s2">because if you look at a lobbying group</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.800" end="00:14:17.199" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.440" end="00:14:18.639" style="s2">wikileaks inside it&#39;s very focused on</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.199" end="00:14:20.800" style="s2">politics you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.639" end="00:14:22.480" style="s2">which like which you know still which</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.800" end="00:14:23.040" style="s2">industries do do they get their money</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.480" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.040" end="00:14:27.279" style="s2">but largely based on what legislation</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:30.240" style="s2">are they trying to affect what</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.279" end="00:14:31.519" style="s2">um possibly which politicians have they</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.240" end="00:14:34.160" style="s2">made the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.519" end="00:14:34.720" style="s2">donations to you know with the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.160" end="00:14:36.800" style="s2">emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.720" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">on what role is that lobbying group</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.800" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">playing in politics</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">and then on the organization side it</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:43.360" style="s2">would be heavily involved with</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.760" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">which industries are they involved with</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.360" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">which you know uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">like executives right like on the</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:51.600" style="s2">business side</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:53.519" style="s2">sort of yeah which organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.600" end="00:14:56.480" style="s2">which industries are they getting</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.519" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">their money from and they&#39;ll you&#39;ll see</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.480" end="00:15:00.000" style="s2">information from the other side but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:01.360" style="s2">emphasis will be on</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.000" end="00:15:03.120" style="s2">what that window is so if we&#39;re gone</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.360" end="00:15:04.320" style="s2">friday it&#39;ll be the organization</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.120" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">and for wiki election it&#39;s how they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.320" end="00:15:07.120" style="s2">affecting politics yeah because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:08.560" style="s2">know whether</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.120" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">is there anyone watching them because i</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.560" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">remember watching a documentary</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:14.000" style="s2">about lobby groups in up until then i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:17.279" style="s2">never heard of them</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.000" end="00:15:20.079" style="s2">and the amount of money they get spent</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.279" end="00:15:21.680" style="s2">on these lobby groups and for them to to</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.079" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">get in and actually sway</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.680" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">decisions and bills and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:28.639" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">it&#39;s quite disgusting really and</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.639" end="00:15:33.519" style="s2">i believe that problem is either</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">entirely unique or mostly unique to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.519" end="00:15:36.560" style="s2">us yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.839" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">well i know for the uk and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">big huh</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">uh i can&#39;t remember that many years ago</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">but they got colored some people got</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.160" style="s2">colored</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:49.839" style="s2">uh cash for questions and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.160" end="00:15:51.279" style="s2">that so they got they got hold out by</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.839" end="00:15:55.519" style="s2">the newspapers which probably</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.279" end="00:15:57.199" style="s2">end up paying the price</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.519" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">i don&#39;t know whether it was a setup or</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.199" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">whatever but i know there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">groups i don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:06.399" style="s2">called lobby groups</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:08.639" style="s2">or or whatever but for the uk i think</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.399" end="00:16:10.720" style="s2">they&#39;re probably in every country sway</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.639" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">in every government regardless</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.720" end="00:16:14.160" style="s2">i mean so i don&#39;t think it i think us i</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:15.920" style="s2">guess</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.160" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">one of the differences i think might be</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.920" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">in the us i think there&#39;s sort of two</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.040" style="s2">different types of lobbying groups</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:24.160" style="s2">there&#39;s you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.040" end="00:16:26.560" style="s2">moms against x where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.160" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">in theory more like citizen focused and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.560" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">kind of just trying to be a group of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">people trying to affect legislation in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">certain direction</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">personally i guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.320" end="00:16:42.000" style="s2">industry comes together and they all put</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.160" end="00:16:43.279" style="s2">money in a pot and then that pod is used</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.000" end="00:16:45.759" style="s2">to affect</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.279" end="00:16:46.800" style="s2">legislation that massively benefits</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.759" end="00:16:48.399" style="s2">their industries</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.800" end="00:16:50.320" style="s2">yeah and from what i&#39;ve heard these</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.399" end="00:16:50.800" style="s2">studies in the us on those lobbying</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.320" end="00:16:53.680" style="s2">groups</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.800" end="00:16:54.320" style="s2">are the single biggest return on</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.680" end="00:16:57.519" style="s2">investment</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.320" end="00:16:59.040" style="s2">that like it&#39;s the the best one of any</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.519" end="00:17:00.959" style="s2">action that a company</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.040" end="00:17:03.199" style="s2">can currently take like it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.959" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">over-the-top massive roi</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.199" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">so of course companies are going to to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:10.720" style="s2">yeah because it&#39;s funny because like um</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">over in the uk you know you get</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.720" end="00:17:14.000" style="s2">some of these mps and they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:16.079" style="s2">business interests</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.000" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">in various companies and and they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.079" end="00:17:20.079" style="s2">ones putting through bills for stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:21.760" style="s2">they&#39;re on boards of this that and the</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.360" end="00:17:55.360" style="s2">yeah the money&#39;s going to hotels and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.400" end="00:17:56.000" style="s2">tourist industry while all the services</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.360" end="00:17:58.799" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.000" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a package of 15.9 million of</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.799" end="00:18:01.120" style="s2">cuts to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:03.039" style="s2">gone across the board and all the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">different services in</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.039" end="00:18:07.039" style="s2">edinburgh uh but they give 600 million</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:10.559" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.039" end="00:18:13.039" style="s2">tesco who&#39;s you know you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.559" end="00:18:14.080" style="s2">it&#39;s just ridiculous really yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.039" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">then like</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.080" end="00:18:19.360" style="s2">if i hear that i wonder okay so first of</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">all how much has tescos contributed to</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.360" end="00:18:22.799" style="s2">either individual politicians or</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:24.799" style="s2">lobbying groups that are pushing things</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.799" end="00:18:26.240" style="s2">or just do certain politicians have ties</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.799" end="00:18:29.679" style="s2">to something directly</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.240" end="00:18:31.520" style="s2">and both are important</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.679" end="00:18:33.039" style="s2">it&#39;s about having sort of as many data</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.520" end="00:18:35.520" style="s2">points as possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.039" end="00:18:36.640" style="s2">to uncover that sort of conflict of of</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.520" end="00:18:38.240" style="s2">interest or</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.640" end="00:18:40.240" style="s2">you know things that might be swaying</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.240" end="00:18:41.919" style="s2">politicians that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.240" end="00:18:45.120" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be because just because</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.919" end="00:18:46.640" style="s2">somebody contributed to your campaign</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.120" end="00:18:48.320" style="s2">sort of you know financially and</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.640" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">tit-for-tat it makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.320" end="00:18:52.799" style="s2">but democratically it doesn&#39;t right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:56.240" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.799" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">so yeah and that is a one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.240" end="00:18:59.280" style="s2">challenges with all having two domains</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:00.400" style="s2">is it&#39;s like with something like</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.280" end="00:19:03.520" style="s2">lobbying</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.400" end="00:19:04.240" style="s2">how does that show across each and i</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.520" end="00:19:06.480" style="s2">think that might</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.240" end="00:19:08.320" style="s2">end up being could you not do it all</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.480" end="00:19:11.679" style="s2">under the same debate</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.320" end="00:19:13.679" style="s2">of comfort arty i could yeah but i just</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.679" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.679" end="00:19:18.000" style="s2">election i mean it could end up being</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:21.039" style="s2">like that wiki election is a tool</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.000" end="00:19:23.280" style="s2">offered by conferrati and uh</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.039" end="00:19:24.799" style="s2">but for now i think it makes sense to</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.280" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">have two different</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.799" end="00:19:28.799" style="s2">domains and also two different brands</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:29.840" style="s2">because that helps i think with like if</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.799" end="00:19:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.840" end="00:19:37.600" style="s2">uh if i&#39;m doing marketing towards each</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.360" end="00:19:39.280" style="s2">then right the conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.600" end="00:19:41.039" style="s2">what wiki election is more about you</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:42.320" style="s2">know keeping politicians honest</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.039" end="00:19:44.960" style="s2">and holding them into account and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.320" end="00:19:47.919" style="s2">setting up a permanent record</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.960" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">organizations is largely about you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.919" end="00:19:51.600" style="s2">having information about them so you can</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">decide who you want to do business with</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.600" end="00:19:56.240" style="s2">right yeah yeah and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:57.840" style="s2">audience for them would be other</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.240" end="00:20:01.280" style="s2">businesses or would they be just</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.840" end="00:20:03.520" style="s2">considered citizens and consumers right</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.280" end="00:20:05.600" style="s2">it also for confront it won&#39;t just be</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.520" end="00:20:06.960" style="s2">politics right it&#39;ll also be like</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.600" end="00:20:09.280" style="s2">how environmentally aware is this</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.960" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">company right like are they known to uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.280" end="00:20:13.200" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.000" end="00:20:16.159" style="s2">use wash green wash whatever</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.200" end="00:20:17.280" style="s2">exactly right anything that you as a</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.159" end="00:20:19.280" style="s2">consumer would want</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.280" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">to know based on what information is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.280" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">available there&#39;s still problems</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">how do they pay their employees right</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:27.840" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:30.320" style="s2">exactly and then because right now like</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.840" end="00:20:32.159" style="s2">with example that kerry gave right with</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.320" end="00:20:34.000" style="s2">what are certain companies doing during</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.159" end="00:20:36.400" style="s2">the pandemic you have some that are</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.000" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">are sort of using this as an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.400" end="00:20:39.360" style="s2">somehow to justify paying their</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">employees less</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.360" end="00:20:42.799" style="s2">and you know try and scroll in where a</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:43.440" style="s2">company is profitable but still trying</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.799" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.440" end="00:20:47.760" style="s2">take a really big slice of the pie for</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.480" end="00:20:48.880" style="s2">what the government is trying to do to</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.760" end="00:20:51.200" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.880" end="00:20:52.480" style="s2">and then big companies come in and take</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.200" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">maybe more than they should</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.480" end="00:20:56.000" style="s2">like in the us with the pvp loans there</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:58.080" style="s2">were some big</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.000" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">companies that were quite profitable</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.080" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">that were have found to you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:03.520" style="s2">have gotten hundreds of millions of</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:06.799" style="s2">dollars while small companies</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.520" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">the pvp loans ran out before they could</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.799" end="00:21:09.760" style="s2">get theirs</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:11.520" style="s2">yeah the big companies had the advantage</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.760" end="00:21:14.240" style="s2">of you know having an</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.520" end="00:21:16.080" style="s2">in in the various groups to know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:17.760" style="s2">how to effectively get themselves to the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.080" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">front of the line and they did that and</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.760" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">they got a bunch of money but some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">them were actually shamed into giving</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.480" style="s2">the money back</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">good which is interesting right because</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.480" end="00:21:27.200" style="s2">that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">one of the number one things that can</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.200" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">actually affect the behavior of a gaming</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">corporation</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.880" end="00:21:34.159" style="s2">is the public saying um no if you do</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">that we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.159" end="00:21:38.559" style="s2">going to give you business anymore</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.559" style="s2">yeah but a lot of people really just</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.559" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">don&#39;t give at all so like like take for</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.559" end="00:21:44.320" style="s2">example amazon</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:46.000" style="s2">you know i mean just just how much</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.320" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">amazon&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.000" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">increased and and listening to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:54.480" style="s2">like more about what uber do</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:56.799" style="s2">and you know they&#39;ve got no you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.480" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">it&#39;s just various things i because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.799" end="00:22:01.440" style="s2">more i look into sort of like businesses</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.440" style="s2">and corporations and that the most</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.440" end="00:22:04.400" style="s2">sickened i get by what they&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.440" end="00:22:07.039" style="s2">to get away with</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.400" end="00:22:08.960" style="s2">and but then again i suppose all stems</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.039" end="00:22:09.600" style="s2">back to the monetary system if you tell</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.960" end="00:22:12.320" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.600" end="00:22:13.760" style="s2">how the monetary system actually works</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.320" end="00:22:14.720" style="s2">because they still believe that just you</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.760" end="00:22:16.400" style="s2">know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.720" end="00:22:18.320" style="s2">everything you know and you just get</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.400" end="00:22:19.840" style="s2">your cash for your wages and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.320" end="00:22:21.919" style="s2">and a lot of people just still believe</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.840" end="00:22:22.880" style="s2">that because they can see the physical</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.919" end="00:22:24.720" style="s2">cash</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.880" end="00:22:27.200" style="s2">but they don&#39;t see this the back end of</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.720" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">it and i don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.200" end="00:22:31.280" style="s2">that they don&#39;t care but i&#39;m sure if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:33.200" style="s2">you taught more people how it actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.280" end="00:22:34.559" style="s2">worked and spoke the language that</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.200" end="00:22:35.679" style="s2">they&#39;d actually believe and how it</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.559" end="00:22:38.799" style="s2">affects them</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.679" end="00:22:40.880" style="s2">i i&#39;d be they&#39;d be bigger riots</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.799" end="00:22:42.320" style="s2">um and people just wouldn&#39;t have it you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.880" end="00:22:43.919" style="s2">know i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.320" end="00:22:45.520" style="s2">yeah part of part of the problem though</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.919" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">is that so many people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.520" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">busy living it&#39;s they&#39;re exhausted</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">so a site like this would lower the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.159" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">friction to shopping more</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.360" end="00:22:59.600" style="s2">because you may like hear oh yeah amazon</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">or walmart&#39;s not paying the customers or</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.600" end="00:23:04.480" style="s2">put local businesses out there but like</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:05.679" style="s2">how much are they if they weren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.480" end="00:23:08.000" style="s2">would someone else do it</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.679" end="00:23:09.280" style="s2">and then what&#39;s an alternative where can</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.000" end="00:23:13.039" style="s2">i go so</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.280" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">right if conferrati can make that easier</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.039" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:18.720" style="s2">we would might be able to shift um</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:20.640" style="s2">you know it would never be 100 of people</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.720" end="00:23:23.039" style="s2">but yeah it might be more</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.640" end="00:23:24.480" style="s2">yeah totally and a part of the goal is</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.039" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">to track it on as many elements as</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.480" end="00:23:27.120" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">so that you can decide what what you</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.120" end="00:23:29.440" style="s2">care about right because if the site is</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:30.960" style="s2">trying to make</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.440" end="00:23:32.720" style="s2">these value calls for you they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.960" end="00:23:33.200" style="s2">who who are these people trying to tell</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.720" end="00:23:35.280" style="s2">me</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">how to spend my money but if you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.280" end="00:23:36.720" style="s2">tell it how you want to spend your money</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.720" end="00:23:40.080" style="s2">all it says is okay so based on what</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">you&#39;ve said you care about here&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.080" end="00:23:44.640" style="s2">those companies score</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:45.200" style="s2">like one of the important things in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.640" end="00:23:47.520" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.200" end="00:23:48.480" style="s2">at least for me that like i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.520" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">available</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.480" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">is the effective tax rate that that</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:53.840" style="s2">company has paid</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:56.480" style="s2">right okay because most of them have</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.840" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">loopholes they as i said</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.480" end="00:24:02.559" style="s2">like these methods that not only pay</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:05.679" style="s2">zero in tax but that then get</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.559" end="00:24:08.880" style="s2">various you know incentives and like</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.679" end="00:24:11.039" style="s2">and uh and subsidies and</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.880" end="00:24:12.240" style="s2">and stuff like that to say hey so this</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.039" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">company made x</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.240" end="00:24:15.760" style="s2">they paid their you know executives this</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.039" style="s2">way they pay their staff that way</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.760" end="00:24:20.240" style="s2">they have this sort of subsidies and</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.039" end="00:24:21.760" style="s2">they pay no tax</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.240" end="00:24:23.520" style="s2">you can decide if that means anything to</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.760" end="00:24:25.120" style="s2">you if maybe it&#39;s just one piece</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.520" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">or if you want to see sort of that whole</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.120" end="00:24:29.919" style="s2">piece of the financial pie</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">and then the end goal would sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.919" end="00:24:33.440" style="s2">hey here&#39;s the you know some of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.600" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">main competitors</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.440" end="00:24:36.480" style="s2">that score higher based on what you said</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:37.840" style="s2">you care about</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.480" end="00:24:40.480" style="s2">so if you&#39;re looking at amazon and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.840" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">there&#39;s some alternatives</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.480" end="00:24:43.919" style="s2">and you&#39;re looking at amazon it might</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:45.039" style="s2">say here&#39;s their score and here&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.919" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">of the scores of their</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.039" end="00:24:50.640" style="s2">their competitors right okay</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:52.159" style="s2">all right so kind of like our</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.640" end="00:24:54.720" style="s2">conversation yesterday on the</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.159" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">alternative to and caftera but like</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.720" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">starting out with corporations instead</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.279" end="00:25:08.159" style="s2">to split down into sort of multiple</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.000" end="00:25:09.039" style="s2">levels just because amazon does so many</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.159" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.039" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">yeah they&#39;ve got the fingers and loads</p>

<p begin="00:25:20.720" end="00:25:22.559" style="s2">the quickest and easiest way to get it</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.320" end="00:25:24.000" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.559" end="00:25:25.440" style="s2">and it&#39;s for free i&#39;m not i&#39;m actually</p>

<p begin="00:25:39.600" end="00:25:43.679" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of tech people who were</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.840" end="00:25:47.039" style="s2">kind of responsible</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.679" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">for developing algorithms for nefarious</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.039" end="00:25:50.400" style="s2">companies</p>

<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:11.360" style="s2">these companies to make change and</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.720" end="00:26:12.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a guy who i can&#39;t remember</p>

<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:25.360" style="s2">algorithms and such like that and he was</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.679" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">one of the guys that wrote one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.360" end="00:26:29.360" style="s2">algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">or was part of that uh yeah there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.360" end="00:26:34.000" style="s2">sting</p>

<p begin="00:26:51.760" end="00:26:54.720" style="s2">you go and you get a job and you do what</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:58.320" style="s2">they ask you to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.720" end="00:27:00.159" style="s2">and you don&#39;t really before recently it</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.320" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">wasn&#39;t much thought into it and also</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.159" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">many of them didn&#39;t think oh that i&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.440" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">throwing elections</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:09.919" style="s2">by yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.120" style="s2">on the the project board they then be</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.919" end="00:27:12.720" style="s2">like hey jim we&#39;re going to have you</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.120" end="00:27:13.600" style="s2">work on algorithm that&#39;s going to skew</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.720" end="00:27:15.520" style="s2">the election</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.600" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">yeah right they they just say hey you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.520" end="00:27:18.640" style="s2">going to be on here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">the specs and then the person that</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.640" end="00:27:21.760" style="s2">designed it honestly</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.600" style="s2">i would say three-quarters of the time</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.760" end="00:27:24.559" style="s2">they don&#39;t even know how other groups</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.600" end="00:27:26.080" style="s2">are going to use it they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.559" end="00:27:28.159" style="s2">building a feature that sounds neat</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.080" end="00:27:30.240" style="s2">yeah well well that&#39;s going to be funny</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.159" end="00:27:30.640" style="s2">what obsessed me about these algorithms</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.240" end="00:27:34.080" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.640" end="00:27:36.080" style="s2">about that is um well what</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.080" end="00:27:37.600" style="s2">one of the the finance companies does</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.080" end="00:27:40.240" style="s2">this year share</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.600" end="00:27:41.600" style="s2">prices and um to do with that and there</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.240" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">was a young guy who ended up killing</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.600" end="00:27:45.520" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">because these algorithms said seven</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.520" end="00:27:49.120" style="s2">million</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">robin hood which that one was weird</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.120" end="00:27:54.080" style="s2">because that wasn&#39;t even actual money</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:57.120" style="s2">that was like a testing</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.080" end="00:28:00.159" style="s2">account that they used to help people</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.120" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">um learn yeah how people learn how to</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.159" end="00:28:04.720" style="s2">invest so he was</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">dealing with fake money i guess one day</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">i think that may have actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:09.200" style="s2">been a bug like where he had you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:10.799" style="s2">some good money one day and then he woke</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">up and he was negative seven million</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.799" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">yeah i guess that just hit him in super</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">because he knew it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.399" end="00:28:16.960" style="s2">just training</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.080" end="00:28:25.919" style="s2">like now you&#39;re seven million in debt</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">you know what i mean it it it was fake</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.919" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">and it sounded like he knew that i think</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:30.559" style="s2">he was probably just</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:31.200" style="s2">depressed and that was the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.559" end="00:28:33.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.200" end="00:28:35.200" style="s2">said but yeah that&#39;s weird because</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.440" end="00:28:36.640" style="s2">that&#39;s actually a tool that&#39;s meant to</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.200" end="00:28:38.320" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.640" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise learn how</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.320" end="00:28:41.760" style="s2">to invest learn how to invest what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:44.159" style="s2">actually trying to help like</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.760" end="00:28:45.840" style="s2">people in poverty because that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.159" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">know in game a that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:31:47.120" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">and and i&#39;m i&#39;m part of a few of them</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">which are kind of watch</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">you know because some of the comments</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:55.360" style="s2">are just hilarious they should be on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:58.720" style="s2">comedy show</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.360" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s just that nefarious ways oh get</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.720" end="00:32:03.200" style="s2">them to do this and get them to do that</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:05.039" style="s2">i think you just touched on one of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.200" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">biggest challenges for this group</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.039" end="00:32:08.640" style="s2">is all of those marketing resources are</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:10.399" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.640" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">for-profit companies right so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.399" end="00:32:15.279" style="s2">about like it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:16.640" style="s2">it&#39;s weirdly not usually about getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.279" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">an audience they just</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.640" end="00:32:19.919" style="s2">directly skew it as how to make money</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">how to get</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.919" end="00:32:23.039" style="s2">followers that you can then monetize</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:25.120" style="s2">like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.039" end="00:32:26.640" style="s2">i think a lot of the tactics are useful</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.120" end="00:32:27.679" style="s2">and some aren&#39;t i think it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.640" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.679" end="00:32:32.240" style="s2">do i don&#39;t know the time for this um and</p>

<p begin="00:36:27.520" end="00:36:32.880" style="s2">have sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">different reasons for</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.880" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">what they&#39;re supporting and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:37.839" style="s2">also just things like well it&#39;s close by</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:40.800" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.839" end="00:36:41.920" style="s2">so even if they don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.800" end="00:36:43.359" style="s2">support the things i care about if</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.920" end="00:36:44.400" style="s2">they&#39;re my only option i still need to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.359" end="00:36:46.079" style="s2">eat</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.400" end="00:36:48.000" style="s2">right okay and then there&#39;s you know it</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.079" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">might be sort of on that same vein</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.000" end="00:36:51.040" style="s2">well i don&#39;t want to deal with walmart</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">or amazon or</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.040" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">whoever but they&#39;re the only company in</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:56.720" style="s2">my</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:57.839" style="s2">city offering this thing or you might</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.720" end="00:36:59.280" style="s2">have to choose between</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.839" end="00:37:00.960" style="s2">walmart and amazon and you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.280" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">either you&#39;re like but which dude do i</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.960" end="00:37:03.839" style="s2">pick</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:05.359" style="s2">so i think it is an important element i</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.839" end="00:37:08.400" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t say the only one</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.359" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">but i personally hope in in the coming</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.400" end="00:37:10.720" style="s2">years that it becomes the most important</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.160" end="00:37:12.400" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.720" end="00:37:14.240" style="s2">and that people are always sort of using</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.400" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">that to to weigh in</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.240" end="00:37:18.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s a bunch of things that you</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:18.800" style="s2">could do like with browser extensions</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.000" end="00:37:20.560" style="s2">and whatnot</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.800" end="00:37:22.560" style="s2">to sort of always have that information</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.560" end="00:37:23.200" style="s2">be available because even on something</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.560" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.200" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">like amazon it could be okay here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">amazon score</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.800" style="s2">but also you&#39;re trying to buy something</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">from this company on amazon so now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.800" end="00:37:32.960" style="s2">talking about at least two companies</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:34.880" style="s2">amazon</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.960" end="00:37:36.480" style="s2">and whoever makes that thing is your</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.880" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">technically supporting</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.480" end="00:37:41.520" style="s2">them as well do you want both okay</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.720" end="00:37:47.680" style="s2">i just noticed that an app i was i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.920" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">seen before but they weren&#39;t out so i</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.680" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">wasn&#39;t sure whether they actually did</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:57.119" style="s2">what they say uh but you can</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:38:01.119" style="s2">pop my screen up if you want just while</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.119" end="00:38:03.800" style="s2">we&#39;re on the discussion oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.119" end="00:38:06.440" style="s2">yeah there we go yeah so this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.800" end="00:38:09.599" style="s2">boycott.com</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.440" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">b-o-b-y-c-o-t-t by calling.</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.599" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">but yeah it&#39;s basically the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">boycott now i think this is more</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:19.520" style="s2">campaign based as opposed to you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">you do a</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.520" end="00:38:23.200" style="s2">yeah this one&#39;s campaign based it but it</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">does allow you to search by</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.200" end="00:38:26.720" style="s2">upc symbol and stuff like that so</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">depending on what</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.720" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">um what your</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:35.599" style="s2">flavor is uh so that&#39;s interesting that</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">that i think this came out fairly</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.599" end="00:38:38.480" style="s2">recently because i saw it a couple</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">months ago and i wasn&#39;t sure if it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.480" end="00:38:41.520" style="s2">going to be a thing or not</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.800" end="00:38:50.000" style="s2">uh yeah so that&#39;s an option yeah</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.000" end="00:38:52.240" style="s2">i think that&#39;s a very good good start</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.000" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">and uh i mean i&#39;m always a fan of having</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.240" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:55.920" style="s2">multiple irons in the fire because</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:57.200" style="s2">there&#39;s always a chance that one project</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.920" end="00:38:59.040" style="s2">will end up failing so if something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.200" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">con ferrari doesn&#39;t take off</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.040" end="00:39:02.079" style="s2">i definitely want to know that you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:06.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not the only option out there</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.079" end="00:39:08.720" style="s2">yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.320" end="00:39:10.000" style="s2">and i think i think somebody touched on</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.720" end="00:39:12.079" style="s2">it a bit earlier</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.000" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">with the one of the important parts to</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.079" end="00:39:15.520" style="s2">work with the public on is sort of what</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">are the things you care about</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.520" end="00:39:18.960" style="s2">that should end up being scored because</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:20.880" style="s2">i i know</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.960" end="00:39:22.000" style="s2">in the uh the prototypes i&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.880" end="00:39:24.400" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.000" end="00:39:26.160" style="s2">my tucson i&#39;ve just got sort of six</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.400" end="00:39:26.640" style="s2">vague metrics that i&#39;ll end up scoring</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.160" end="00:39:29.200" style="s2">on for</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.640" end="00:39:30.000" style="s2">the prototype but in the end version it</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.200" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">needs to you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.000" end="00:39:33.359" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a nearly infinite</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:34.800" style="s2">number of</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.359" end="00:39:37.119" style="s2">sort of the different categories and</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.800" end="00:39:39.839" style="s2">subcategories like there might be</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.119" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">you know the very broad environmentalism</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.839" end="00:39:43.839" style="s2">and that could break down into like okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:47.280" style="s2">water pollution and air pollution and</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.839" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">you know th they themselves</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:51.280" style="s2">might not make that much pollution but</p>

<p begin="00:39:51.280" end="00:39:55.680" style="s2">which then ends up being</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.599" end="00:39:56.640" style="s2">pollution all that sort of thing where</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">it&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="00:40:00.720" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">drill down and say well i don&#39;t believe</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.440" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">that this particular part of</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:10.640" style="s2">environmental environmentalism is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:12.400" style="s2">important but these two are</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.640" end="00:40:14.400" style="s2">and that whole system so carried you</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.400" end="00:40:14.880" style="s2">talked about a kind of a generic kind of</p>

<p begin="00:41:26.480" end="00:41:30.480" style="s2">c and you need to be able to spam your</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.839" end="00:41:32.319" style="s2">network</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.480" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">about three times a day because as i</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.319" end="00:41:34.960" style="s2">said one of my friends did one for an</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.200" style="s2">art exhibition</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.960" end="00:41:38.720" style="s2">he wasn&#39;t an artist he just decided he</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.200" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">was going to do an art exhibition</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.720" end="00:41:42.800" style="s2">and and that and he managed to raise all</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">the money but what he ended up doing was</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.800" end="00:41:46.240" style="s2">having to</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:46.640" style="s2">keep up people every day you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:48.800" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.640" end="00:41:50.240" style="s2">and let them know and keep them updated</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.800" end="00:41:51.440" style="s2">and as i said it&#39;s kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.240" end="00:41:54.000" style="s2">full-time job</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.440" end="00:41:54.720" style="s2">and you know to me so like if i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.000" end="00:41:56.160" style="s2">know him</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.720" end="00:41:57.680" style="s2">i would have just clicked off it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.160" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">gone oh you know what i&#39;m sick of it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.680" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve heard from you</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:02.720" style="s2">you know what i mean so what&#39;s the fine</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:04.880" style="s2">line of sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.720" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">panicking to sort of get the money</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.880" end="00:42:07.760" style="s2">because as i said</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.280" style="s2">my thing with kickstarter was if you</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.760" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t raise the money you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.280" end="00:42:12.880" style="s2">you didn&#39;t raise all the money that you</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:14.240" style="s2">didn&#39;t get anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.880" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">and i thought well you&#39;ve just you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.240" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">just spent maybe the past</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:21.599" style="s2">two months of spamming all your friends</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:24.079" style="s2">neighbors anybody</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.599" end="00:42:25.119" style="s2">talking to them you know money grabbing</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.079" end="00:42:27.280" style="s2">sort of like from</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.119" end="00:42:28.480" style="s2">from that amount of time and you&#39;ve not</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.280" end="00:42:31.119" style="s2">raised it so all</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.480" end="00:42:32.640" style="s2">that effort has gone into nothing you</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.119" end="00:42:35.520" style="s2">know because as i said</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.640" end="00:42:36.720" style="s2">i&#39;ve given to two that have you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.520" end="00:42:38.960" style="s2">completed</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.720" end="00:42:40.960" style="s2">and that there was two that failed and</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.960" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">they were mostly graphic novels</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.960" end="00:42:44.079" style="s2">and stuff like that so they learned a</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:46.319" style="s2">lot but as i said</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.079" end="00:42:48.480" style="s2">you know it puts the relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.319" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">they&#39;ve got with people in jeopardy</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.480" end="00:42:54.319" style="s2">so as i said that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the marketing techniques</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.319" end="00:42:56.560" style="s2">that works</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:42:59.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s probably the most popular but</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:43:00.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not the only</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.040" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">yeah and that&#39;s becoming less and less</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.800" end="00:43:04.480" style="s2">popular the whole like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">slash and burn i just need to make it</p>

<p begin="00:44:23.359" end="00:44:27.839" style="s2">horrifying jobs that you&#39;ve got to have</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.359" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">targets you can&#39;t talk to people</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.839" end="00:44:30.880" style="s2">for such a time as well you know what i</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:33.119" style="s2">mean and it&#39;s just they&#39;re just</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.160" end="00:44:46.319" style="s2">it really bothers me that someone would</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.079" end="00:44:48.319" style="s2">expect you to actually do that you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.319" end="00:44:50.160" style="s2">i mean so um</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.319" end="00:44:52.079" style="s2">i&#39;d like to find a marketing campaign</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.160" end="00:44:53.760" style="s2">where you didn&#39;t have to bother anyone</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.079" end="00:44:55.440" style="s2">well yeah i mean the other the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.760" end="00:44:57.359" style="s2">common one is actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.440" end="00:44:58.560" style="s2">creating a landing page and buying ads</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.359" end="00:44:59.359" style="s2">and then testing out the different</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.560" end="00:45:01.280" style="s2">landing pages</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.359" end="00:45:03.200" style="s2">but that right that contends on your</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.280" end="00:45:04.720" style="s2">ability to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.200" end="00:45:06.480" style="s2">express the idea and it has to be an</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.720" end="00:45:08.400" style="s2">idea that people can understand quickly</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.480" end="00:45:10.400" style="s2">and are willing to support</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.400" end="00:45:11.680" style="s2">so i mean the better there are ideas</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.400" end="00:45:13.920" style="s2">that are so good</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.680" end="00:45:15.280" style="s2">that you don&#39;t that you know your two</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.920" end="00:45:17.359" style="s2">three friends will tell</p>

<p begin="00:45:18.640" end="00:45:23.760" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this area where</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.160" end="00:45:25.280" style="s2">the ideas are getting more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.760" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">that you either have to put in more</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.280" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">money or you have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">drain your network right okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">so i&#39;m trying to think of like what the</p>

<p begin="00:45:37.520" end="00:45:40.400" style="s2">the really early days</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.800" end="00:45:41.599" style="s2">in a project trying to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.400" end="00:45:43.040" style="s2">the market wants how you want to</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.599" end="00:45:46.319" style="s2">position your</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.040" end="00:45:48.000" style="s2">you you your project um which i think a</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.319" end="00:45:49.520" style="s2">lot of people don&#39;t really think of when</p>

<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:35.359" style="s2">but but based on what you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.680" end="00:46:37.680" style="s2">he said and what he&#39;s shown that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.359" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">i get out of it so there&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.680" end="00:46:41.040" style="s2">the positioning piece whereas just</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.040" end="00:46:44.560" style="s2">what story to tell who your you know who</p>

<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:52.880" style="s2">your audience in some cases that&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.839" end="00:46:54.960" style="s2">of combined with</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.880" end="00:46:56.400" style="s2">the next step but with a lot of projects</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.960" end="00:46:57.839" style="s2">like ours you start out you know with a</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.400" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">facebook group or</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.839" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">or something where your end goal is just</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:03.119" style="s2">to see okay did</p>

<p begin="00:47:05.040" end="00:47:11.760" style="s2">yeah developing them stories and</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:13.200" style="s2">you think the main thing first</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.760" end="00:47:14.800" style="s2">developing a story</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.200" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">yeah yeah you got to know you got to</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.800" end="00:47:17.839" style="s2">well usually the first step is to narrow</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">your audience</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.839" end="00:47:20.880" style="s2">because almost everyone unless they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.040" style="s2">it like that no one will because that</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.160" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">people don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.040" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">themselves using you know using your</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">tool using a product going to it</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:36.960" style="s2">unless they unless it feels like it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:47:36.960" end="00:47:40.559" style="s2">for everybody it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.319" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">it&#39;s an unfortunate habit of the human</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.559" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">brain so</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:44.160" style="s2">yeah figuring out your audience and then</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.040" end="00:50:10.720" style="s2">right but marketing for the most part is</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.200" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">just navigating how humans actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.720" end="00:50:13.760" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve done tons of research to say how</p>

<p begin="00:50:18.960" end="00:50:22.880" style="s2">all sorts of things that we still have</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.559" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">to navigate within the realms of how do</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.880" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">people actually operate yes</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.559" end="00:50:38.319" style="s2">somebody said propaganda for good</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.599" end="00:50:44.079" style="s2">pfg have we done a project raising on</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:47.200" style="s2">your project yet</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.079" end="00:50:53.599" style="s2">because of the because me me drop-ins</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.480" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">got stopped after to week two</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.599" end="00:50:58.240" style="s2">part of me thing was right was to get so</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:01.520" style="s2">like get that back on the go</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.240" end="00:51:04.160" style="s2">because like i&#39;ve been running them for</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.520" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">well till they told me to sod off really</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.160" end="00:51:07.200" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">and i know it was was not about bringing</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.200" end="00:51:10.480" style="s2">money in this was all about building</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:11.839" style="s2">relationships with people in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.480" end="00:51:14.480" style="s2">community</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.839" end="00:51:15.599" style="s2">um so that&#39;s coming along well as i said</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.480" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">once you want to get the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.599" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">the churches wait until phase four of</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:21.119" style="s2">the lockdown to go back into it and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.119" end="00:51:25.119" style="s2">but also i&#39;ll speak to a guy um who</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:25.760" style="s2">responded to one of me posts and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.119" end="00:51:28.160" style="s2">and he was in</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.760" end="00:51:30.480" style="s2">um because because all these big pub</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.160" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">companies are basically taking over all</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.480" end="00:51:35.440" style="s2">like as i said pubs used to be the hub</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:37.040" style="s2">of sort of like social life in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.440" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">and i don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.040" end="00:51:40.800" style="s2">anywhere else but in the uk</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:42.240" style="s2">there used to be a pub on every corner</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.800" end="00:51:44.319" style="s2">and you know people would be</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.240" end="00:51:45.839" style="s2">various running them and you&#39;d go and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.319" end="00:51:47.680" style="s2">have your pub friends</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.839" end="00:51:49.280" style="s2">who you&#39;d only see in the pub you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.680" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">never see anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.280" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">you never see them outside you just see</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:54.319" style="s2">them in the pub it&#39;s like they just live</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:56.559" style="s2">there you know what i mean so</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.319" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">so there&#39;s a whole social aspect of that</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.559" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">and then hubs get shut down they get</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:01.359" style="s2">taken over</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">but like you&#39;ve got these companies like</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.359" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">punch</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">and these other to buy out all these</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:09.040" style="s2">pubs and then they offered them back</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.240" style="s2">to to you know low cost anyone could run</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.040" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">their own pub</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.240" end="00:52:14.400" style="s2">throughout being that yeah so um and</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:15.520" style="s2">then they do that to people and then the</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.400" end="00:52:17.280" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.520" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">they just they&#39;re just after the money</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.280" end="00:52:20.559" style="s2">from the pub from the beer</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:22.400" style="s2">so they have to take on their beard so</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.559" end="00:52:24.640" style="s2">he&#39;s not allowed to do any local beers</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.400" end="00:52:26.400" style="s2">not allowed to do this that the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.640" end="00:52:27.760" style="s2">and what what goes away from that is</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.400" end="00:52:29.839" style="s2">because they</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.760" end="00:52:32.400" style="s2">have to be focused on keeping the place</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.839" end="00:52:34.400" style="s2">open the the the desperation that they</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.400" end="00:52:35.440" style="s2">have on running after people to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.400" end="00:52:36.880" style="s2">try and get the money</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.440" end="00:52:38.800" style="s2">you don&#39;t really care whether people</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.880" end="00:52:41.040" style="s2">come in they just came with the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.800" end="00:52:43.040" style="s2">you know they get slaughtered by the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.040" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">beer and that&#39;s basically it so the</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.040" end="00:52:46.000" style="s2">social aspect</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:47.119" style="s2">of all that has gone now and i was</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.000" end="00:52:48.400" style="s2">listening to someone saying there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.119" end="00:52:50.720" style="s2">public spaces</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.400" end="00:52:52.160" style="s2">where people can actually gather unless</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.720" end="00:52:54.160" style="s2">they&#39;re a corporation</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.160" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">already business you know you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.160" end="00:52:56.400" style="s2">give us money before you can actually go</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:58.319" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.400" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">so part of me thing was to try and make</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.319" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">it so yes i know it needs to wash its</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:03.680" style="s2">face</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:04.960" style="s2">but yes i want to offer a place for</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.680" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">people to gather</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.960" end="00:53:08.000" style="s2">members of the public that you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:09.680" style="s2">they&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.000" end="00:53:11.359" style="s2">you know want to come in they can have a</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.680" end="00:53:13.200" style="s2">cup of tea that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.359" end="00:53:14.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m gonna have to find different</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.200" end="00:53:17.440" style="s2">revenue streams</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.800" end="00:53:18.000" style="s2">of finding out of to make that that</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.440" end="00:53:20.160" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.000" end="00:53:21.440" style="s2">and i&#39;ve got to write a plan and take</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.160" end="00:53:23.119" style="s2">all that in mind</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.440" end="00:53:25.520" style="s2">but as i said i was looking at donut</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.119" end="00:53:26.480" style="s2">economics and i realized you know you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.520" end="00:53:28.960" style="s2">got the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.480" end="00:53:30.720" style="s2">local the global and then you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.960" end="00:53:32.720" style="s2">social and the economic</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.720" end="00:53:34.160" style="s2">and i know that&#39;s just kind of a 30 at</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.720" end="00:53:35.680" style="s2">the moment but i&#39;m going to try and do</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.160" end="00:53:38.000" style="s2">the plan out of that</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.680" end="00:53:39.839" style="s2">but obviously the it&#39;s the nondominium</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.000" end="00:53:41.440" style="s2">which adrian laughed at me last time</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.839" end="00:53:42.640" style="s2">when i said it&#39;s nondividing like a</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.440" end="00:53:44.480" style="s2">condominium</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.640" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to go after that model</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.480" end="00:53:48.800" style="s2">and as i said the guy he was talking to</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:50.559" style="s2">he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s got a network of all</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.800" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">these people who run pubs and</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.559" end="00:53:53.839" style="s2">uh and the pubs are dying on their feet</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:55.440" style="s2">because they&#39;re like they&#39;re closing</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.839" end="00:53:57.680" style="s2">down all the time</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.440" end="00:53:58.559" style="s2">and as i said cafes are opening up but</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.680" end="00:54:01.040" style="s2">they&#39;re after the</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.559" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">the money and that so um he&#39;s got a big</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.040" end="00:54:04.000" style="s2">network of people there</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:05.440" style="s2">and i was talking to him for about two</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.000" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">hours today</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.440" end="00:54:08.800" style="s2">he was telling me what he was doing and</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:11.599" style="s2">it was along the same lines</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.800" end="00:54:13.599" style="s2">as what i was doing and and then i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.599" end="00:54:15.680" style="s2">got somebody else going to talk to one</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.599" end="00:54:18.720" style="s2">of the chairmen of this local</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.680" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">town council planning or whatever about</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.720" end="00:54:22.000" style="s2">what what we&#39;re doing and seeing if</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:22.960" style="s2">there&#39;s any empty spaces and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.000" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">because i lost out</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.960" end="00:54:26.160" style="s2">to the one because they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">built in flats but that&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.160" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">but if you can manage to find one place</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">to do this</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:32.559" style="s2">in and i think that&#39;ll be a game changer</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:34.720" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.559" end="00:54:36.640" style="s2">the rest of them because as i said i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.720" end="00:54:37.040" style="s2">be quite happy because i&#39;ve got people</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.640" end="00:54:39.200" style="s2">all</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.040" end="00:54:40.079" style="s2">up and down the uk as well in other</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.200" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">places</p>

<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:45.359" style="s2">setting them up but as i said i just</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.640" end="00:55:03.839" style="s2">because i&#39;m shite at that writing down</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.319" end="00:55:05.440" style="s2">like i said i said i could talk the legs</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.839" end="00:55:07.520" style="s2">off donkeys but don&#39;t don&#39;t make me</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.440" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">write shit down</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.520" end="00:55:12.640" style="s2">well yeah and yeah so the so a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:14.720" style="s2">video kind of discussion would just</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.640" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">focus on ideas and doing that</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.720" end="00:55:18.160" style="s2">and maybe also one of the things could</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">be asking for someone to kind of help</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.160" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:23.040" style="s2">talk to you and then they can write up</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:24.079" style="s2">the plan yeah we&#39;ve got about five</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.040" end="00:55:26.960" style="s2">minutes left</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.079" end="00:55:28.400" style="s2">um so let&#39;s kind of open it up to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.960" end="00:55:31.119" style="s2">closing comments and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.400" end="00:55:32.079" style="s2">then if no one has anything we can oh</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.119" end="00:55:35.359" style="s2">i&#39;m out there</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.079" end="00:55:37.359" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of nothing i think that uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.359" end="00:55:38.960" style="s2">to round out the list i was talking</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.359" end="00:55:40.319" style="s2">about there&#39;s the like so</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.960" end="00:55:42.240" style="s2">there there&#39;s the positioning the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.319" end="00:55:42.799" style="s2">building your audience i think the third</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.240" end="00:55:44.240" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.799" end="00:55:45.599" style="s2">which is important but i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.240" end="00:55:47.200" style="s2">people in this group are hesitant to</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.599" end="00:55:48.960" style="s2">talk about or even use this term is</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.200" end="00:55:52.079" style="s2">monetization</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.960" end="00:55:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s taking your your your audience and</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.079" end="00:55:55.760" style="s2">not even necessarily just modernization</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.760" end="00:55:59.119" style="s2">but like a call to action</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.760" end="00:56:00.480" style="s2">where for something like wikilection</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.119" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">eventually i&#39;m going to need to</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.480" end="00:56:04.319" style="s2">crowdsource because i my end goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:05.680" style="s2">not take any corporate money</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.319" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">which means that it has to come from</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.680" end="00:56:08.799" style="s2">somewhere and so that&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.799" style="s2">patreon and kickstarter</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.799" end="00:56:12.400" style="s2">or some things that might be you know</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.799" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">actually selling an item like for for</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.400" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">cubespawn</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">i think the plan there is to actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:20.319" style="s2">sell the cubes that spawn</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:21.440" style="s2">um but that&#39;s a whole avenue in itself</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.319" end="00:56:22.559" style="s2">which i think has some negative</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.440" end="00:56:24.559" style="s2">connotations</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.559" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">but the projects have to keep the lights</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.559" end="00:56:29.280" style="s2">on and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:30.000" style="s2">finding that balance in admitting that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:31.520" style="s2">you have to make money</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.000" end="00:56:32.880" style="s2">but not having that be your sole purpose</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.520" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">i think a good word for that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.880" end="00:56:36.559" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:38.559" style="s2">because we want our products to exist</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.559" end="00:56:39.920" style="s2">and we want them to continue exist</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.559" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">although part of me is a little scared</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.920" end="00:56:43.680" style="s2">of that because our projects should only</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:44.400" style="s2">exist for the extent that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.680" end="00:56:47.440" style="s2">valuable</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.400" end="00:56:48.240" style="s2">right if suddenly we solve government</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.440" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">issues</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.240" end="00:56:52.319" style="s2">we won&#39;t need a wiki election not that</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:54.720" style="s2">that&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.319" end="00:56:56.480" style="s2">in your case but like let&#39;s say we were</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.720" end="00:56:57.119" style="s2">trying to solve for poverty and we get</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.480" end="00:56:59.520" style="s2">ubi</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.119" end="00:57:01.119" style="s2">installed and there&#39;s and and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.520" end="00:57:03.200" style="s2">of really solves it then</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.119" end="00:57:05.040" style="s2">if it does which i&#39;m not saying it will</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.200" end="00:57:06.480" style="s2">um then you would want to close down</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.040" end="00:57:07.440" style="s2">that project and people can go find</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.480" end="00:57:08.559" style="s2">something valuable</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.440" end="00:57:10.480" style="s2">but yeah but making something</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.559" end="00:57:12.640" style="s2">sustainable for as long as it needs i</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.480" end="00:57:13.920" style="s2">yeah that would be the game b version of</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.640" end="00:57:16.559" style="s2">of monetization</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.920" end="00:57:17.040" style="s2">or profit yeah which i think that there</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.559" end="00:57:20.720" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.040" end="00:57:23.119" style="s2">a particular conversation around</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.720" end="00:57:24.079" style="s2">like you know that particular thing of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.119" end="00:57:27.200" style="s2">trying to to</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.079" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">to to make money where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.200" end="00:57:30.400" style="s2">because i think sustainability would i</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">think that i hear</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.400" end="00:57:35.520" style="s2">you know not polluting and like overall</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:36.799" style="s2">which is still important but i think a</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.520" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">lot of that is also around your</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.799" end="00:57:40.480" style="s2">positioning</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:42.319" style="s2">where in in marketing the modernization</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.480" end="00:57:44.640" style="s2">is specifically</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.319" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">getting people involved at various</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.640" end="00:57:48.319" style="s2">levels so kind of like the next step for</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:50.079" style="s2">building your audience and then actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.319" end="00:57:51.680" style="s2">okay now now that you know a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.079" end="00:57:54.319" style="s2">people are following me on facebook</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.680" end="00:57:55.760" style="s2">what do i do with them what&#39;s the the</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.319" end="00:57:58.000" style="s2">next step</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.760" end="00:58:00.640" style="s2">i think part of that might be to make</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.000" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">money but the other part like for</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.640" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">wiki election part of it is just getting</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">people to sign up and actually add</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:09.599" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:12.880" style="s2">yeah which is not it has yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.599" end="00:58:14.400" style="s2">actually yeah that&#39;s probably a better</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.880" end="00:58:16.160" style="s2">thing because part of that could be</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.400" end="00:58:17.760" style="s2">making money but it&#39;s also if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.160" end="00:58:19.440" style="s2">if we just want you to you know to sign</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.760" end="00:58:21.040" style="s2">up and sign in and you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.440" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">actually use it that&#39;s still an</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.040" end="00:58:24.880" style="s2">important part</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:26.160" style="s2">yeah i guess realistically if it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.880" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">an open resource</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.160" end="00:58:31.680" style="s2">and the costs are so low for like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:32.720" style="s2">in technical stuff and it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.680" end="00:58:34.720" style="s2">volunteer then</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.720" end="00:58:37.520" style="s2">you may not money may not have to be</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.720" end="00:58:39.280" style="s2">involved in one of our projects</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.520" end="00:58:41.280" style="s2">um i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think that&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.280" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">possible but i mean it is possible i</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.280" end="00:58:45.359" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:45.680" style="s2">yeah well and i think that&#39;s where one</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.359" end="00:58:47.520" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.680" end="00:58:49.680" style="s2">the things that we could do with</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.520" end="00:58:50.079" style="s2">together tech is have that be the</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.680" end="00:58:52.000" style="s2">umbrella</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.079" end="00:58:53.359" style="s2">to sort of handle the okay well if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.000" end="00:58:54.720" style="s2">want to handle these kind of projects</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.359" end="00:58:57.680" style="s2">you just donate</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.720" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">one amount to together tech and then</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.680" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">that group can say okay so what do we</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:02.319" style="s2">want to fund with this</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.319" style="s2">which then also helps what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.319" end="00:59:05.680" style="s2">talking about with the once a project</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.319" end="00:59:08.640" style="s2">has lived its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.680" end="00:59:09.119" style="s2">well if together tech is sort of quote</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.640" end="00:59:11.760" style="s2">unquote</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.119" end="00:59:12.880" style="s2">the owner of that thing then it can have</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.760" end="00:59:14.720" style="s2">you know people that know marketing</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.880" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">people that know coding people</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.720" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">this that once the community decides</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:19.760" style="s2">that&#39;s outlived its purpose</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:21.680" style="s2">you can just stop putting resources on</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.760" end="00:59:24.559" style="s2">it or put you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.680" end="00:59:26.000" style="s2">fewer resources like if we get ubi you</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.559" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">probably still want some people on the</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.000" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">the project almost for like a lobbying</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">thing because there&#39;s going to be people</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:31.599" style="s2">who still</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:32.880" style="s2">fight against it and you&#39;ll want to make</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.599" end="00:59:35.280" style="s2">sure that you&#39;re not you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.880" end="00:59:36.559" style="s2">getting too complacent or people end up</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.280" end="00:59:39.520" style="s2">killing it</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.559" end="00:59:40.079" style="s2">i think anyway but you would all you</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.520" end="00:59:41.839" style="s2">would</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.079" end="00:59:43.520" style="s2">definitely not need the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.839" end="00:59:44.640" style="s2">resources that you had up until that</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.520" end="00:59:48.400" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.640" end="00:59:50.559" style="s2">yep i think we&#39;ve run out of time</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.400" end="00:59:52.640" style="s2">i think might you want to chime in</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.559" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">quickly just yeah i just wanted to close</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.640" end="00:59:56.640" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">um first um sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.640" end="00:59:59.920" style="s2">yes and i don&#39;t see it actually ending</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:02.960" style="s2">because the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.920" end="01:00:05.839" style="s2">there is going to be uh game a</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.960" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">types like always i don&#39;t see them just</p>

<p begin="01:00:09.680" end="01:00:13.520" style="s2">there will always be in the foreseeable</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.880" end="01:00:17.280" style="s2">future</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.520" end="01:00:20.799" style="s2">need to watch them and</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:24.880" style="s2">track their nasty businesses and</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.799" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">stuff and sustainability also means</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.880" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">something unknown in game a territory</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:30.160" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:31.440" style="s2">limiting the profits to only what is</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.160" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">actually needed</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.440" end="01:00:35.119" style="s2">game is strictly profit as much as</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:38.960" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.119" end="01:00:39.839" style="s2">and in this case profit only means that</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.960" end="01:00:42.640" style="s2">the network</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.839" end="01:00:44.240" style="s2">and infrastructure and people they need</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.640" end="01:00:47.760" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.240" end="01:00:50.799" style="s2">sustained but uh not over</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.760" end="01:00:53.359" style="s2">grown to you know not looking for</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.799" end="01:00:54.880" style="s2">uh new ways to grow but rather this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.359" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">the goal</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.880" end="01:01:02.319" style="s2">we need so much uh resources to</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:06.240" style="s2">uh get to the goal and be able to</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.319" end="01:01:08.880" style="s2">um do what we</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.240" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">need to do and what we said we are doing</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.880" end="01:01:12.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:13.839" style="s2">that&#39;s it and everything else if it</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.799" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">happens to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.839" end="01:01:18.160" style="s2">more so to speak profitable then</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.960" end="01:01:22.480" style="s2">all the profits would go directly into</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:25.839" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.480" end="01:01:29.040" style="s2">project itself not as like</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.839" end="01:01:32.160" style="s2">reinvesting profits but uh like um</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.040" end="01:01:32.640" style="s2">okay this is the surplus of uh resources</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.160" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.640" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">we can do something nice uh and not just</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">package it and</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:43.760" style="s2">you know take away so strict rules of</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.920" end="01:01:46.640" style="s2">game b yeah which to me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.760" end="01:01:47.839" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the only things that to me</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.640" end="01:01:50.720" style="s2">makes something not a game b</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.839" end="01:01:52.400" style="s2">project is what like is i guess the</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.720" end="01:01:54.240" style="s2">opposite of what you&#39;re talking about or</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.400" end="01:01:55.440" style="s2">if it&#39;s rent seeking if it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.240" end="01:01:57.119" style="s2">shareholder</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.440" end="01:01:58.240" style="s2">like it&#39;s all about shareholder profit</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.119" end="01:01:59.200" style="s2">that to me is one of the only things</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:00.960" style="s2">where you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.200" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">that&#39;s game a like straight up that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.960" end="01:02:06.319" style="s2">pure game</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">that drives bad behavior almost anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.319" end="01:02:08.319" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:10.240" style="s2">you know you can be a game b your game</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.319" end="01:02:11.440" style="s2">be adjacent but that&#39;s the only thing in</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.240" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">our conversation around</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.440" end="01:02:14.640" style="s2">is it game b that&#39;s all i took took out</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:16.079" style="s2">of it</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.640" end="01:02:19.839" style="s2">we all sort of had ideas and we&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.079" end="01:02:22.000" style="s2">well but there&#39;s if sedans and butts but</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.839" end="01:02:23.200" style="s2">the the for profit part to me is the one</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.000" end="01:02:26.400" style="s2">thing where i&#39;m like okay i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.200" end="01:02:28.160" style="s2">really trust that project anymore</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.400" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">if it&#39;s set up for profit or if it&#39;s set</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.160" end="01:02:31.760" style="s2">up especially in a way</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:33.920" style="s2">where the profit ends up in people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.760" end="01:02:36.240" style="s2">pockets like the more money that company</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.920" end="01:02:38.880" style="s2">makes the more money these people make</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.240" end="01:02:39.920" style="s2">that drives that drives bad behaviors as</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.880" end="01:02:41.680" style="s2">opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.920" end="01:02:43.200" style="s2">here&#39;s how much the project costs to run</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.680" end="01:02:44.640" style="s2">here&#39;s the the salary that we</p>
