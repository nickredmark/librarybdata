<p begin="00:01:43.950" end="00:01:49.499" style="s2">we have to understand that we have these</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.299" end="00:02:11.370" style="s2">though feminists have monopolized that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.099" end="00:02:13.260" style="s2">dialogue of women good men bad women the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.370" end="00:02:15.780" style="s2">oppressed men as the oppressors and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.260" end="00:02:18.420" style="s2">that&#39;s about as dysfunctional as you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.780" end="00:02:19.620" style="s2">structure a dialogue it&#39;s as it&#39;s like a</p>

<p begin="00:02:23.400" end="00:02:28.140" style="s2">and and I have been telling her what to</p>

<p begin="00:02:28.140" end="00:02:33.750" style="s2">any attention to my direction and she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.900" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">a 100% wrong on these 14 different items</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.750" end="00:02:38.129" style="s2">and I&#39;d like you to help align with me</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.590" style="s2">to help you understand how wrong she is</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.129" end="00:02:42.599" style="s2">by the way if you do align with me I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.590" end="00:02:45.239" style="s2">will continue hiring you as a therapist</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.599" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">I control the money but if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.239" end="00:02:48.690" style="s2">align with me that&#39;ll be the end of you</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:50.970" style="s2">as a therapist and we&#39;re basically</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.690" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">having feminists say to the world if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.970" end="00:02:56.579" style="s2">want to teach in gender studies you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:58.200" style="s2">this party ideology to follow you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.579" end="00:02:59.700" style="s2">to believe you have to articulate that</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.200" end="00:03:02.340" style="s2">men we live in a patriarchal world</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.700" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">dominated by men that made rules to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.340" end="00:03:05.159" style="s2">benefit men at the expense of women and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:07.650" style="s2">if you don&#39;t follow that ideology</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.159" end="00:03:10.590" style="s2">there&#39;s not a chance in that you&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.650" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">a job at any decent university unless</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.590" end="00:03:15.000" style="s2">that ideology is at your forefront and</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">you just have your own unique ways which</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.000" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">we give you many unique ways no problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:20.760" style="s2">at all as long as you have unique ways</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:22.530" style="s2">of expressing that ideology as</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.760" end="00:03:25.500" style="s2">effectively as possible to your to your</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.530" end="00:03:27.269" style="s2">students and do not deviate from that or</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.500" end="00:03:29.160" style="s2">allow anyone else to come into this</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.269" end="00:03:32.489" style="s2">university to talk in a different way</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.160" end="00:03:36.510" style="s2">about that and so you cannot define it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.489" end="00:03:40.200" style="s2">would be hard to write a novel with a</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.510" end="00:03:43.079" style="s2">fictional situation that would be more</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.200" end="00:03:45.269" style="s2">of a dysfunctional dialogue the the</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.079" end="00:03:47.400" style="s2">monologue then the monologue that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.269" end="00:03:48.959" style="s2">happening now well you know we&#39;ve we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.400" end="00:03:52.079" style="s2">used to have a battle of the sexes</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.959" end="00:03:54.030" style="s2">that&#39;s been historical but now we no</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.079" end="00:03:56.970" style="s2">longer have a battle of the sexes we</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.030" end="00:04:00.180" style="s2">have a war in which only one side has</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.970" end="00:04:02.370" style="s2">shown up the other side called men have</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.180" end="00:04:04.859" style="s2">put their heads in the sand and hope the</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.370" end="00:04:09.120" style="s2">bullets will miss that&#39;s a dysfunctional</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.859" end="00:04:10.680" style="s2">dialogue so what needs to happen to to</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.120" end="00:04:12.870" style="s2">get out of this we need to start</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.680" end="00:04:15.239" style="s2">communication training in first second</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.870" end="00:04:17.609" style="s2">third grade so that everybody knows how</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.239" end="00:04:20.729" style="s2">to listen to everyone so that the bully</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.609" end="00:04:23.099" style="s2">so we see in the bully his vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.729" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">or her vulnerability we see in the mean</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.099" end="00:04:28.500" style="s2">girl her vulnerability or his vote her</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:31.920" style="s2">vulnerability and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.500" end="00:04:33.720" style="s2">we have people share what they&#39;re about</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.920" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">what their feelings are what their hurts</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.720" end="00:04:37.980" style="s2">are what their pains are and all come</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:40.800" style="s2">together to to do that this is already</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.980" end="00:04:43.050" style="s2">this is just a theory in Denmark they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.800" end="00:04:45.060" style="s2">doing this in younger grades and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.050" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">been very helpful in helping them have a</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.060" end="00:04:49.740" style="s2">much more constructive first second</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:52.230" style="s2">third grade but I believe we also need</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.740" end="00:04:54.690" style="s2">to do this not just in kindergarten</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.230" end="00:04:56.190" style="s2">first second third grade but we went but</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.690" end="00:04:58.110" style="s2">when our boys and girls are going</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.190" end="00:04:59.670" style="s2">through that process we need to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.110" end="00:05:02.130" style="s2">their parents go through it at the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.670" end="00:05:03.810" style="s2">time because if kids come home learning</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.130" end="00:05:05.430" style="s2">how to communicate to parents who do not</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.810" end="00:05:07.530" style="s2">know how to communicate they will have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.430" end="00:05:09.390" style="s2">lack of respect for their parents which</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.530" end="00:05:11.310" style="s2">will undermine their ability to follow</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.390" end="00:05:14.040" style="s2">their parents guidance and that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.310" end="00:05:17.760" style="s2">destabilize the family and so this has</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.040" end="00:05:20.850" style="s2">to all this is the number one agenda</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.760" end="00:05:24.180" style="s2">that needs to occur so that&#39;s step one</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.850" end="00:05:27.180" style="s2">step two is that men have to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.180" end="00:05:30.510" style="s2">men have to be willing to risk their</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.180" end="00:05:32.940" style="s2">careers as I certainly experienced</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.510" end="00:05:35.070" style="s2">myself doing when I started speaking up</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.940" end="00:05:37.470" style="s2">about these issues it was very clear to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.070" end="00:05:40.320" style="s2">me that I lost my standing ovations that</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.470" end="00:05:42.120" style="s2">I used to have and the more I paid</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:44.190" style="s2">attention to the dialogues that were</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.120" end="00:05:45.479" style="s2">happening though the the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.190" end="00:05:47.340" style="s2">that were happening in the men&#39;s groups</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.479" end="00:05:49.380" style="s2">I formed by forms of 300 men&#39;s groups</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.340" end="00:05:51.810" style="s2">and you know that John Lennon was what</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.380" end="00:05:55.560" style="s2">you know joined one of them and and</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.810" end="00:05:57.780" style="s2">those were those were ways where men</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.560" end="00:06:00.930" style="s2">opened up and said what they felt in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.780" end="00:06:03.510" style="s2">safety of other men who were saying gee</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.930" end="00:06:08.070" style="s2">I didn&#39;t realize anybody else but me</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.510" end="00:06:10.140" style="s2">felt that and so but then when many of</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.070" end="00:06:13.530" style="s2">them and when I started to incorporate</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.140" end="00:06:15.960" style="s2">those what I heard in the men&#39;s groups</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.160" end="00:10:09.760" style="s2">there is debt that the boys without</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:30.910" style="s2">okay I don&#39;t have a father he died in</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.150" end="00:10:32.530" style="s2">war or whatever but at least I have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.910" end="00:10:34.720" style="s2">culture telling me I have to clear</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.530" end="00:10:37.210" style="s2">senses of purpose not true anymore</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.720" end="00:10:40.300" style="s2">and it&#39;s good that we have a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.210" end="00:10:42.730" style="s2">void for boys it&#39;s just terrible that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.300" end="00:10:45.370" style="s2">have a purpose void for boys at a time</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.730" end="00:10:47.980" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have that the ability of</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.370" end="00:10:49.870" style="s2">we oftentimes and many families don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.980" end="00:10:50.890" style="s2">have a father to direct male</p>

<p begin="00:10:50.890" end="00:10:55.000" style="s2">toward a constructive purpose because</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.020" end="00:10:57.070" style="s2">when male testosterone is not directed</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.000" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">toward a constructive purpose it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.070" end="00:11:01.690" style="s2">being directed toward a disruptive</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:04.030" style="s2">purpose and it&#39;s a very powerful force</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.690" end="00:11:06.580" style="s2">so I now know as a result of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.030" end="00:11:09.570" style="s2">research for the boy crisis that</p>

<p begin="00:11:12.820" end="00:11:18.370" style="s2">have in common one thing they are either</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.459" end="00:11:20.890" style="s2">boys or girls who don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.370" end="00:11:23.170" style="s2">significant amount of father involvement</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.890" end="00:11:25.570" style="s2">when we look at the school shooters or</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.170" end="00:11:29.290" style="s2">the mass shooters they are almost all</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.570" end="00:11:31.480" style="s2">boys who don&#39;t have a significant amount</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.290" end="00:11:33.790" style="s2">of father involvement when we look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.480" end="00:11:35.260" style="s2">prisoners we know that the only women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.790" end="00:11:37.899" style="s2">centers that we have in the United</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.260" end="00:11:39.459" style="s2">States we though we have many we know</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.720" end="00:11:48.279" style="s2">do have men&#39;s centers they&#39;re called</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.160" end="00:11:52.390" style="s2">prisons and the prisons are filled with</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.279" end="00:11:56.079" style="s2">about 93 percent males but what we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.390" end="00:11:58.630" style="s2">know is that very almost the common</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.079" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">denominator of those males is lack of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.630" end="00:12:02.829" style="s2">father involvement I just checked this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:06.130" style="s2">out with the chief judge of the Superior</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.829" end="00:12:08.410" style="s2">Court of Washington DC and he told me</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.130" end="00:12:12.040" style="s2">and the other family court judges told</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.410" end="00:12:13.930" style="s2">me that in fact is well over 90 percent</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.040" end="00:12:16.209" style="s2">of the people in prison who are males</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.930" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">are males without significant father</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.209" end="00:12:21.190" style="s2">involvement and so I discovered in just</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:24.220" style="s2">a hundred different ways that when</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.190" end="00:12:27.579" style="s2">children don&#39;t have their fathers they</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.220" end="00:12:31.120" style="s2">have significant amounts of problems but</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.579" end="00:12:33.160" style="s2">boys in particular have a greater amount</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.120" end="00:12:37.180" style="s2">of problems because they don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.160" end="00:12:39.700" style="s2">role model they don&#39;t have a way to find</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.180" end="00:12:42.880" style="s2">themselves as a male we often do rite of</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.700" end="00:12:46.959" style="s2">passage programs but rite of passage is</p>

<p begin="00:19:14.690" end="00:19:19.010" style="s2">conference called a wellness conference</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.850" end="00:19:21.440" style="s2">and Idaho and many many of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.010" end="00:19:24.530" style="s2">presentations were on the the divine</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.440" end="00:19:27.380" style="s2">female but there were no presentations</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.530" end="00:19:29.870" style="s2">on the male of the female shadow or the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.380" end="00:19:33.080" style="s2">you know the the less than divine well</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.870" end="00:19:36.020" style="s2">if you will and yet there is a huge</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.080" end="00:19:38.380" style="s2">amount of cultural conversation on the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.020" end="00:19:41.750" style="s2">and the male shadow which we aren&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.380" end="00:19:44.059" style="s2">gentle enough to call the shadow when</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.750" end="00:19:46.790" style="s2">you hear the word male shadow that</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.059" end="00:19:48.770" style="s2">implies men who are being introspective</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.790" end="00:19:50.600" style="s2">about integrating the shadow side of</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.770" end="00:19:53.780" style="s2">themselves into the rest of themselves</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.600" end="00:19:56.540" style="s2">and and having an acceptance of that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.780" end="00:19:59.060" style="s2">and and are trying to become holistic as</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.540" end="00:20:01.400" style="s2">men but when you hear the statements</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.060" end="00:20:03.440" style="s2">about male privilege and male power that</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.400" end="00:20:06.830" style="s2">comes from a political ideological place</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.440" end="00:20:09.380" style="s2">that really doesn&#39;t allow and that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.830" end="00:20:12.230" style="s2">and those men go into college and they</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.380" end="00:20:14.660" style="s2">can&#39;t speak up without calling it being</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.230" end="00:20:16.250" style="s2">told oh you&#39;re just mansplaining so</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.660" end="00:20:16.850" style="s2">we&#39;re telling the boys and men on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.250" end="00:20:19.190" style="s2">one hand</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.850" end="00:20:20.960" style="s2">share your feelings and then the moment</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.190" end="00:20:22.940" style="s2">men share their feelings they go your</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.960" end="00:20:27.230" style="s2">mansplaining and that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.940" end="00:20:29.180" style="s2">excuse me what did I hear and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.230" end="00:20:32.510" style="s2">you know a guy that&#39;s in class in</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.180" end="00:20:34.430" style="s2">college and that is being sharing his</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.510" end="00:20:38.390" style="s2">his heart and his pain and his shame and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.430" end="00:20:40.580" style="s2">his and his shadow side openly and he</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.390" end="00:20:42.380" style="s2">notices that women withdraw from him in</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.580" end="00:20:44.540" style="s2">the class but if he had an interest in</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.380" end="00:20:46.700" style="s2">taking somebody out and asking somebody</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.540" end="00:20:48.830" style="s2">out in the classroom that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.700" end="00:20:51.410" style="s2">that would undermine his ability to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.830" end="00:20:55.250" style="s2">successful in making that contact so we</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.410" end="00:20:58.940" style="s2">have a huge amount of problem and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.250" end="00:21:01.520" style="s2">what I said before about we&#39;ve taken a</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.940" end="00:21:03.530" style="s2">magnifying glass we&#39;ve taken our</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.520" end="00:21:05.600" style="s2">binoculars and we&#39;ve used our binoculars</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.530" end="00:21:07.460" style="s2">to look at women&#39;s experience of</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.600" end="00:21:09.530" style="s2">powerlessness and women&#39;s experience of</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.460" end="00:21:11.750" style="s2">male power but we haven&#39;t looked at</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.530" end="00:21:14.720" style="s2">men&#39;s experience of powerlessness and</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.750" end="00:21:18.350" style="s2">men&#39;s experience of female power that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.720" end="00:21:19.910" style="s2">a problem we&#39;re looking only at one side</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.350" end="00:21:23.600" style="s2">of the equation and we&#39;ve done that for</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.910" end="00:21:25.490" style="s2">a half a century and it&#39;s so important</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.600" end="00:21:28.790" style="s2">that the conversation become more</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.490" end="00:21:32.180" style="s2">balanced male/female dynamics are an</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.790" end="00:21:34.910" style="s2">evolutionary tango in which every time</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.180" end="00:21:37.310" style="s2">you change any part of the dance you</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.910" end="00:21:42.290" style="s2">have to look at both sides of that dance</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.310" end="00:21:44.050" style="s2">changing women do not worship men who</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.290" end="00:21:46.430" style="s2">are expressing their feelings and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.050" end="00:21:49.670" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re going to you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.430" end="00:21:52.250" style="s2">they&#39;re the first signs of what women</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.670" end="00:21:54.230" style="s2">are interested in is the cheerleader is</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.250" end="00:21:56.570" style="s2">cheering for the football player which</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.230" end="00:21:58.370" style="s2">the the the the the foot the</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.570" end="00:22:01.070" style="s2">cheerleaders are saying hit him again</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.370" end="00:22:03.260" style="s2">hit him again harder harder or first and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.070" end="00:22:04.990" style="s2">ten do it again then first and ten do it</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.260" end="00:22:07.420" style="s2">again is first and ten</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.990" end="00:22:09.550" style="s2">a concussion again first thing at 10:00</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.420" end="00:22:12.070" style="s2">risk a dislocated shoulder spinal cord</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.550" end="00:22:15.460" style="s2">injury again because if you take that</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.070" end="00:22:17.050" style="s2">piece of leather a hundred yards in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.460" end="00:22:19.660" style="s2">car and it goes you go across into the</p>

<p begin="00:22:19.660" end="00:22:23.920" style="s2">more we will love you more boys are</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.820" end="00:22:25.870" style="s2">getting the message that girls like them</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.920" end="00:22:28.690" style="s2">and love them when they risk their</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.870" end="00:22:30.970" style="s2">bodies because that&#39;s historically and</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.690" end="00:22:34.059" style="s2">evolutionary preparation for them</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.970" end="00:22:37.090" style="s2">risking their bodies as firefighters as</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.059" end="00:22:41.080" style="s2">in the military being disposable we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.090" end="00:22:43.059" style="s2">we haven&#39;t had no conversation about the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.080" end="00:22:45.910" style="s2">pressure on boys and men to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.059" end="00:22:48.340" style="s2">disposable what I call the social bribes</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.910" end="00:22:52.240" style="s2">as social bribes from fathers from</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.340" end="00:22:54.820" style="s2">mothers from from women from men to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.240" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">willing to be if you go to war and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.820" end="00:23:00.990" style="s2">serve in the military or you&#39;re an elite</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:23:05.590" style="s2">Navy SEAL that you will be called a hero</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.990" end="00:23:08.350" style="s2">if you are the the male who is willing</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.590" end="00:23:11.230" style="s2">to die as a volunteer firefighter you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.350" end="00:23:14.110" style="s2">getting no pay economically all of your</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.230" end="00:23:17.470" style="s2">pay is the social bribe of respect of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.110" end="00:23:19.300" style="s2">honor of women being more attracted to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.470" end="00:23:21.880" style="s2">you and your firefighting uniform and</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.300" end="00:23:25.600" style="s2">that is your pay but you have to realize</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.880" end="00:23:29.740" style="s2">that that pay is a social bribe for you</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.600" end="00:23:32.650" style="s2">to be disposable so that women and other</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.740" end="00:23:34.360" style="s2">men can be protected it&#39;s one thing for</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.650" end="00:23:36.700" style="s2">you to understand that as your social</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.360" end="00:23:39.220" style="s2">bribe to be disposable it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.700" end="00:23:41.920" style="s2">thing to allow yourself to have that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.220" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">cold male power and privilege when in</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.920" end="00:23:47.020" style="s2">fact it&#39;s male disposability I&#39;d love to</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:48.070" style="s2">hear you kind of summarize where you</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.020" end="00:23:50.590" style="s2">came from I think you&#39;ve got a really</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.070" end="00:23:53.350" style="s2">interesting perspective having been part</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.590" end="00:23:55.179" style="s2">of the women&#39;s movement and and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.350" end="00:23:56.920" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re now kind of seen as the</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.179" end="00:24:01.210" style="s2">father of the men&#39;s movement yes yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.920" end="00:24:02.679" style="s2">it&#39;s ironic I start yes yeah and I did</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.210" end="00:24:05.950" style="s2">start out when I was doing my doctorate</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.679" end="00:24:07.510" style="s2">at New York University the women&#39;s I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.950" end="00:24:09.700" style="s2">teaching at Rutgers University at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.510" end="00:24:11.620" style="s2">time and when the women&#39;s movement</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.700" end="00:24:13.600" style="s2">surfaced I started incorporating that</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.620" end="00:24:18.309" style="s2">into my political science curriculum as</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.600" end="00:24:19.360" style="s2">a political movement and my advisors and</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.309" end="00:24:21.850" style="s2">I was also doing my</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.360" end="00:24:24.220" style="s2">doctoral dissertation at the time and so</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.850" end="00:24:25.900" style="s2">the students and at Rutgers were saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.220" end="00:24:27.790" style="s2">man when you speak about the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.900" end="00:24:29.380" style="s2">movement you got fire in your belly and</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.790" end="00:24:30.700" style="s2">yeah you should think you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.380" end="00:24:32.170" style="s2">you doing your dissertation on and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.700" end="00:24:35.710" style="s2">said what I was doing it on which was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.170" end="00:24:37.000" style="s2">different part of politics and they said</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.710" end="00:24:39.220" style="s2">you should think about doing it on</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.000" end="00:24:42.309" style="s2">something about the women&#39;s movement so</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.220" end="00:24:44.110" style="s2">I went to my to my Advisory Committee</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.309" end="00:24:46.090" style="s2">and they said oh you know Warren you</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.110" end="00:24:48.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want to sort of like demean</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.090" end="00:24:50.320" style="s2">yourself with taking on some little fad</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.280" end="00:24:51.820" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be going away in a few</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.320" end="00:24:52.990" style="s2">years and I said I don&#39;t think this is a</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.820" end="00:24:55.510" style="s2">fair that&#39;s going to be going away I</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.990" end="00:24:57.070" style="s2">think this is a an evolutionary shift</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.510" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">where women are beginning to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.070" end="00:25:01.330" style="s2">and say the old gender roles of the past</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:04.000" style="s2">were too rigid we&#39;re more than just a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.330" end="00:25:05.770" style="s2">role and I think that this is going to</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.000" end="00:25:07.990" style="s2">have implications for both women and men</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.770" end="00:25:11.650" style="s2">however I do agree that it&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.990" end="00:25:13.330" style="s2">hostility toward men and you know and it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.650" end="00:25:16.270" style="s2">may take a little bit longer to catch on</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.330" end="00:25:18.669" style="s2">among men and so they said if you really</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.270" end="00:25:20.559" style="s2">want to go for it but that got me deeply</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.669" end="00:25:22.179" style="s2">involved and then that led to my being</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.559" end="00:25:23.620" style="s2">elected to the board of directors of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.179" end="00:25:26.140" style="s2">National Organization for Women in New</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.620" end="00:25:28.660" style="s2">York City and then I got reelected for a</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.140" end="00:25:30.490" style="s2">few years after that and so I spoke all</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.660" end="00:25:32.410" style="s2">around the world on women&#39;s issues the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.490" end="00:25:34.840" style="s2">importance of women&#39;s issues and why any</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.410" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">secure man should be a supporter of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.840" end="00:25:40.840" style="s2">women being having more flexible roles</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:43.120" style="s2">and and also the importance of this for</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.840" end="00:25:46.000" style="s2">men and for men to be a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.120" end="00:25:47.940" style="s2">process and this was a place where Betty</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.000" end="00:25:50.169" style="s2">Ford Ann and I agreed very strongly</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.940" end="00:25:52.210" style="s2">Betty Ford and ended up writing us a</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.169" end="00:25:55.419" style="s2">book called second-stage that didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.210" end="00:25:58.270" style="s2">nearly as much publicity as the as the</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.419" end="00:26:00.309" style="s2">feminine mystique but when she did that</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.270" end="00:26:03.010" style="s2">she said that the second stage of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.309" end="00:26:05.320" style="s2">women&#39;s movement needed to be men having</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.010" end="00:26:07.360" style="s2">more flexible roles as well and this she</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.320" end="00:26:09.370" style="s2">and I had discussed this and many times</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.360" end="00:26:12.309" style="s2">and we both strongly agreed that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.370" end="00:26:14.470" style="s2">where it needed to go unfortunately the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.309" end="00:26:17.320" style="s2">women&#39;s movement started moving in a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.470" end="00:26:20.350" style="s2">direction that was much less male</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.320" end="00:26:22.660" style="s2">friendly in the and the key turning</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.350" end="00:26:26.200" style="s2">point in my relationship with now in New</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.660" end="00:26:30.379" style="s2">York City was that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.200" end="00:26:32.899" style="s2">many women who were divorced we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.379" end="00:26:35.570" style="s2">writing into the board and saying I</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.899" end="00:26:39.190" style="s2">don&#39;t like your whole equality policy</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.570" end="00:26:41.779" style="s2">because that means that men and women</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.190" end="00:26:44.869" style="s2">have equal rights to the children after</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.779" end="00:26:46.519" style="s2">divorce when in fact I know what&#39;s best</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.869" end="00:26:49.369" style="s2">for my children the mothers would say</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.519" end="00:26:51.259" style="s2">and so if I want to marry a new man</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.369" end="00:26:53.600" style="s2">start a new life move out of the state</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.259" end="00:26:55.489" style="s2">and keep my children away from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.600" end="00:26:58.869" style="s2">father I should be allowed to do that</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.489" end="00:27:02.470" style="s2">and I said whoa you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.869" end="00:27:04.970" style="s2">females doing what is best for them</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.470" end="00:27:07.669" style="s2">without asking what is best for the</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.970" end="00:27:09.619" style="s2">children and so I started doing some</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.669" end="00:27:12.440" style="s2">research on this and I said from what I</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.619" end="00:27:13.759" style="s2">can tell it looks like the children do</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.440" end="00:27:15.229" style="s2">best when they have about an equal</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.759" end="00:27:18.139" style="s2">amount of mother and father involvement</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.229" end="00:27:20.479" style="s2">after divorce and unless we find out</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.139" end="00:27:22.820" style="s2">otherwise that should be where we stand</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.479" end="00:27:25.580" style="s2">the fact that that was the the point</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.820" end="00:27:27.169" style="s2">that you kind of found yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.580" end="00:27:29.659" style="s2">conflict with links very much into the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.169" end="00:27:32.090" style="s2">book that you&#39;ve now your new book which</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.659" end="00:27:34.669" style="s2">is the effect that that has often on</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.090" end="00:27:37.369" style="s2">boys what led me to doing the boy crisis</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.669" end="00:27:39.080" style="s2">was as I was speaking around the country</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.369" end="00:27:40.759" style="s2">when when why men are the way they are</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.080" end="00:27:42.409" style="s2">it got translated into a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.759" end="00:27:44.539" style="s2">languages and as did the myth of male</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.409" end="00:27:47.210" style="s2">power and that led me to speaking in</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.539" end="00:27:50.629" style="s2">countries like Japan and Germany and</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.210" end="00:27:52.669" style="s2">Australia New Zealand etc and in many of</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.629" end="00:27:55.099" style="s2">those countries after my talks teachers</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.669" end="00:27:57.679" style="s2">would say you know I&#39;m seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.099" end="00:28:00.229" style="s2">happen in my classroom the boys are</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.679" end="00:28:02.119" style="s2">really struggling a lot and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.229" end="00:28:04.369" style="s2">falling a lot behind girls and in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.119" end="00:28:06.229" style="s2">particular school you know both of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.369" end="00:28:07.609" style="s2">valedictorian of the salutatorian and</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.229" end="00:28:11.389" style="s2">most of the Honor Society of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.609" end="00:28:14.929" style="s2">equivalent thereof is almost 70 80 %</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.389" end="00:28:17.059" style="s2">girls and so that alerted me to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.929" end="00:28:18.529" style="s2">something is happening here my sister</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.059" end="00:28:22.970" style="s2">was a teacher she said the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.529" end="00:28:25.159" style="s2">and so I know this was yes quite a while</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.970" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">ago this is back in the 70s I began to</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.159" end="00:28:30.289" style="s2">hear about this maybe even in the 80s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:32.809" style="s2">70s and 80s divorces were happening in</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.289" end="00:28:34.879" style="s2">large numbers and I was beginning to see</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.809" end="00:28:36.559" style="s2">and my sister and other people would say</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.879" end="00:28:38.230" style="s2">you know a lots of times when the</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.559" end="00:28:39.910" style="s2">families break up the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.230" end="00:28:42.880" style="s2">the the the kids that are otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.910" end="00:28:44.890" style="s2">doing well especially the boys seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.880" end="00:28:49.000" style="s2">really fall-off in motivation and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.890" end="00:28:50.980" style="s2">attitude and send withdraw and but those</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.000" end="00:28:52.600" style="s2">were all just pieces of information but</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.980" end="00:28:54.850" style="s2">I began to feel like there was something</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.600" end="00:28:57.549" style="s2">there to that so the first thing I</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.850" end="00:29:00.540" style="s2">noticed was that the boy crisis was</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.549" end="00:29:05.590" style="s2">happening when the United Nations</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.540" end="00:29:07.690" style="s2">authorized a study called pasa of tests</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.590" end="00:29:10.120" style="s2">that were being done of children and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.690" end="00:29:11.919" style="s2">the largest developed nations and in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.120" end="00:29:14.710" style="s2">less developed nations well when I</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.919" end="00:29:17.140" style="s2">sorted out the 63 nations the largest</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.710" end="00:29:20.260" style="s2">developed nations all the developed</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.140" end="00:29:22.299" style="s2">nations had boys falling significantly</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.260" end="00:29:24.760" style="s2">behind girls and almost all of their</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.299" end="00:29:27.429" style="s2">academic subjects so I started asking</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.760" end="00:29:30.370" style="s2">why and looked at the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.429" end="00:29:33.100" style="s2">developed nations had permission for two</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.370" end="00:29:37.830" style="s2">things to happen one was for there to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.100" end="00:29:41.020" style="s2">a divorces and for women to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.830" end="00:29:43.240" style="s2">usually in most countries the women had</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.020" end="00:29:45.460" style="s2">more priority if they said that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.240" end="00:29:47.049" style="s2">was any challenge with the man or most</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.460" end="00:29:48.610" style="s2">judges wanted the children to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.049" end="00:29:51.250" style="s2">involved with both parents but if a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.610" end="00:29:52.840" style="s2">woman objected to that most judges were</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.250" end="00:29:55.390" style="s2">afraid to go against the woman&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.840" end="00:29:57.640" style="s2">objection because if the woman says she</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.390" end="00:30:00.070" style="s2">was afraid of the man and any one thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.640" end="00:30:02.200" style="s2">happened at any point in the future the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.070" end="00:30:04.510" style="s2">judges career could be in jeopardy and</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.200" end="00:30:07.480" style="s2">so most judges heard in the in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.510" end="00:30:10.900" style="s2">direction of protecting the mom from the</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.480" end="00:30:12.910" style="s2">you know any possible undesirability of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.900" end="00:30:15.429" style="s2">the father so that was happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.910" end="00:30:17.320" style="s2">divorce area and then a huge thing was</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.429" end="00:30:19.179" style="s2">happening in throughout most of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.320" end="00:30:22.120" style="s2">world in the developed world which was</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.179" end="00:30:23.950" style="s2">that as the world as the developed</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.120" end="00:30:26.950" style="s2">nations had less preoccupation with</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.950" end="00:30:29.650" style="s2">survival they gave more permission to</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.950" end="00:30:32.950" style="s2">women for women to have children without</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.650" end="00:30:35.350" style="s2">being devout being married and in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.950" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">group I noticed that there was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.350" end="00:30:40.630" style="s2">divide also as there was in the divorce</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:43.960" style="s2">be people the the mother so in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.630" end="00:30:46.840" style="s2">United States to be very clear 53</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.960" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">percent of women under 30 who have</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.840" end="00:30:49.730" style="s2">children have children without being</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:52.880" style="s2">married</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.730" end="00:30:55.309" style="s2">now marriage to per se is not a big</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.880" end="00:30:57.440" style="s2">thing from my perspective but it turns</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.309" end="00:30:59.149" style="s2">out to be a huge thing in terms of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.440" end="00:31:00.919" style="s2">possibility the probability that</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.149" end="00:31:04.610" style="s2">children will have contact with their</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.919" end="00:31:06.889" style="s2">dads in unmarried when women have</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.610" end="00:31:08.539" style="s2">children without being married there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.889" end="00:31:11.210" style="s2">relatively small chance that those</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.539" end="00:31:13.399" style="s2">children will have long term contact</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.210" end="00:31:15.350" style="s2">with their fathers and so I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.399" end="00:31:18.710" style="s2">beginning to see this enormous gap</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.350" end="00:31:20.659" style="s2">between children that had had contact</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.710" end="00:31:23.809" style="s2">with their fathers that was that were</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.659" end="00:31:25.850" style="s2">consistent and that was significant and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.809" end="00:31:27.320" style="s2">children that did not and the children</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.850" end="00:31:28.909" style="s2">that had a lot of contact with their</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.320" end="00:31:31.970" style="s2">fathers even if they were in divorced</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.909" end="00:31:33.980" style="s2">families or they were unmarried families</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.970" end="00:31:35.570" style="s2">that small percentage of children that</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.980" end="00:31:37.130" style="s2">did have good contact with their fathers</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.570" end="00:31:40.789" style="s2">did quite well not as well as it an</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.130" end="00:31:43.610" style="s2">intact family but close to it and then</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.789" end="00:31:45.889" style="s2">conversely the children that had minimal</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.610" end="00:31:48.470" style="s2">or no contact with their fathers were</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.889" end="00:31:50.299" style="s2">doing terribly as a rule and more than</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.470" end="00:31:52.820" style="s2">that I was altum Utley able to research</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.299" end="00:31:55.760" style="s2">that to them for the boy crisis book to</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.820" end="00:31:59.539" style="s2">the point where I was able to identify</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.760" end="00:32:01.909" style="s2">seventy different ways that children do</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.539" end="00:32:03.830" style="s2">so much worse with their fathers this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.909" end="00:32:06.559" style="s2">true of girls and boys but it was more</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.830" end="00:32:09.860" style="s2">true of boys the intensity level and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.559" end="00:32:11.960" style="s2">degree of and the numbers of areas were</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.860" end="00:32:14.510" style="s2">greater with the boys why a boy is</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.960" end="00:32:16.130" style="s2">affected more than girls I think the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.510" end="00:32:18.830" style="s2">number one reason is that when a girl</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.130" end="00:32:23.000" style="s2">has a single mom she has a role model</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.830" end="00:32:24.559" style="s2">when a boy has no a single mom he does</p>

<p begin="00:34:27.830" end="00:34:33.440" style="s2">he&#39;s not a sole breadwinner there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.139" end="00:34:36.200" style="s2">challenge there as well so a boy has to</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.440" end="00:34:38.600" style="s2">sort out what do I want to be if there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:34:43.070" end="00:34:49.280" style="s2">purposes for girls and so a boy without</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.770" end="00:34:51.830" style="s2">a father and with a purpose void has a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.280" end="00:34:54.440" style="s2">purpose void combined with a dad void</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.830" end="00:34:57.050" style="s2">and the dad void and the purpose void</p>

<p begin="00:34:57.050" end="00:35:02.930" style="s2">because a dad whose constructive and</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.080" end="00:35:05.960" style="s2">involved is a dad who can channel the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.930" end="00:35:09.620" style="s2">testosterone toward two things helping</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.960" end="00:35:11.720" style="s2">his son say what&#39;s your unique</p>

<p begin="00:35:11.720" end="00:35:16.970" style="s2">man and then secondly no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.930" end="00:35:18.590" style="s2">your unique characteristics are and no</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.970" end="00:35:20.570" style="s2">matter what fulfills you you have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.590" end="00:35:23.599" style="s2">also be responsible for earning income</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.570" end="00:35:26.420" style="s2">so you have to balance this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.599" end="00:35:28.820" style="s2">fulfillment which I want to support just</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.420" end="00:35:31.640" style="s2">but just make sure that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.820" end="00:35:34.430" style="s2">the more fulfilling a job is the less</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.640" end="00:35:37.070" style="s2">it&#39;s likely to pay and so therefore when</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.430" end="00:35:39.170" style="s2">you do a fulfilling job don&#39;t neglect</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.070" end="00:35:41.420" style="s2">don&#39;t just say oh I can do anything I</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.170" end="00:35:43.010" style="s2">want to do because most women won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.420" end="00:35:45.260" style="s2">interested in you and you will not feel</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.010" end="00:35:48.260" style="s2">you&#39;re producing for the family and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.260" end="00:35:51.140" style="s2">contributing in a in an honest way and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.260" end="00:35:55.160" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got to combine this but</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.140" end="00:35:57.950" style="s2">combining being fulfilled with producing</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.160" end="00:36:00.800" style="s2">responsible income that can help produce</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.950" end="00:36:03.109" style="s2">support both yourself and share the</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.800" end="00:36:05.510" style="s2">support of your children that&#39;s a tough</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.109" end="00:36:09.500" style="s2">combination and without a father figure</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.510" end="00:36:11.840" style="s2">there to help a a move through that pit</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.500" end="00:36:13.640" style="s2">is very challenging whereas girls have</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.840" end="00:36:15.680" style="s2">the support of both the culture they</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.640" end="00:36:17.540" style="s2">don&#39;t have a purpose void they have an</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.680" end="00:36:21.109" style="s2">expansion of purpose and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.540" end="00:36:23.180" style="s2">female role model which the for her</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.109" end="00:36:25.339" style="s2">being growing up as a as a productive</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.180" end="00:36:27.710" style="s2">woman the boy does not have a male role</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.339" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">model and so that&#39;s one of the those are</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.710" end="00:36:33.859" style="s2">two of the major reasons that boys fall</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:38.450" style="s2">so far behind girls I also teach men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.859" end="00:36:39.740" style="s2">work and what&#39;s interesting is there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.450" end="00:36:42.530" style="s2">lot in the culture at the moment around</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.740" end="00:36:45.349" style="s2">kind of me too and times up and male</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.530" end="00:36:47.960" style="s2">behavior really acting men really acting</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.349" end="00:36:49.640" style="s2">out but there&#39;s another side to it as</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.960" end="00:36:51.050" style="s2">well I mean what I often see from the</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.640" end="00:36:54.260" style="s2">men coming to the workshops that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.050" end="00:36:58.270" style="s2">doing is a sense of shame around</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.260" end="00:37:00.920" style="s2">themselves as men of castration of</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.270" end="00:37:04.580" style="s2">internalized yeah internalized shame</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.920" end="00:37:07.099" style="s2">around themselves exactly hashtag me to</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.580" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">is wonderful up to a point it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.099" end="00:37:11.060" style="s2">wonderful in the sense that we want</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:12.440" style="s2">women to speak up and say where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.060" end="00:37:14.380" style="s2">where they&#39;ve been offended where</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.859" end="00:37:27.960" style="s2">excellent and there&#39;s more to men and</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.829" end="00:37:30.750" style="s2">women than women only</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.960" end="00:37:33.119" style="s2">there is men and women are men as well</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.750" end="00:37:36.059" style="s2">as women they&#39;re boys as well as girls I</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.119" end="00:37:38.910" style="s2">talk in the boy crisis I quote a real</p>
