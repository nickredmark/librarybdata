<p begin="00:00:09.870" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">to men I&#39;m a woman who&#39;s published</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.870" end="00:00:17.939" style="s2">online I am a woman where a group of</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:21.509" style="s2">women apologize for how they&#39;ve hurt men</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.939" end="00:00:28.550" style="s2">I am a woman who has hurt men who has</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.509" end="00:00:32.610" style="s2">heard men was art men I do in our time</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.550" end="00:00:35.879" style="s2">when we can truly empower ourselves by</p>

<p begin="00:00:35.879" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">an end to the cycle of hurting and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:46.769" style="s2">blaming it went viral with hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:50.420" style="s2">thousands of views online news articles</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.769" end="00:00:55.159" style="s2">as far afield as Israel and Belgium and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.420" end="00:00:55.159" style="s2">some very polarized reactions</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.440" end="00:01:01.820" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.199" end="00:01:12.689" style="s2">so the impulse for making this film came</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.950" end="00:01:16.770" style="s2">out of of a deep longing for healing bit</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.689" end="00:01:18.990" style="s2">of the wound between the tendus the link</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.770" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">to my working experience my work</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.990" end="00:01:26.700" style="s2">background yeah there is one for sure</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.100" end="00:01:28.590" style="s2">I&#39;ve been working as a mediator for more</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.700" end="00:01:31.500" style="s2">than 10 years now</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.590" end="00:01:33.570" style="s2">so in conflict resolution work helping</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.500" end="00:01:35.429" style="s2">people to get out of very stuck in</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.570" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">different difficult situations and</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.429" end="00:01:42.450" style="s2">conflicts and my experience in this work</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.369" end="00:01:46.799" style="s2">is that the patterns we are used to</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.450" end="00:01:49.289" style="s2">think in either or either I&#39;m wrong or</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.799" end="00:01:52.110" style="s2">you must be wrong either I&#39;m right or I</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.289" end="00:01:55.289" style="s2">must be guilty either I&#39;m the victim or</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.110" end="00:01:57.959" style="s2">I&#39;m the perpetrator it&#39;s always even or</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.289" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">and we get stuck in that and that this</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.959" end="00:02:03.479" style="s2">is never true in the end and that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:05.189" style="s2">does not lead anywhere and my experience</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.479" end="00:02:09.360" style="s2">in this conflict resolution work is that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.189" end="00:02:12.959" style="s2">it&#39;s really always the moment where both</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.360" end="00:02:15.420" style="s2">sides start to look also at their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.959" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">contribution to the conflict that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.420" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">something starts to shift and that a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:25.440" style="s2">way out of it and really something new</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:27.480" style="s2">can be created and can happen for me it</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.440" end="00:02:29.700" style="s2">really it really put its finger on</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.480" end="00:02:32.370" style="s2">something that I&#39;ve never seen addressed</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.700" end="00:02:34.290" style="s2">in the kind of in the public debate it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.370" end="00:02:35.940" style="s2">not it&#39;s not to say like this this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.290" end="00:02:38.220" style="s2">the full truth but it&#39;s like this is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.940" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">aspect of the truth that no light has</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.220" end="00:02:44.370" style="s2">been shown on I have a lot of friends</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:48.330" style="s2">who are activists a lot of feminist</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.370" end="00:02:51.810" style="s2">friends both men and women and I knew</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.330" end="00:02:54.629" style="s2">the kind of reactions that the film was</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.810" end="00:02:56.310" style="s2">going to get so so there was a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.629" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">like okay this is gonna take some</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.310" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">courage to to do this because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:03.510" style="s2">people are not gonna like it I was an</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:05.580" style="s2">activist myself for a long period of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.510" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">time and very passionate about making</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.580" end="00:03:10.380" style="s2">the world a better place and doing lots</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:14.550" style="s2">of things and as I started my own</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.380" end="00:03:17.370" style="s2">growth work I became aware of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.550" end="00:03:19.440" style="s2">my own shadows if this film doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.370" end="00:03:21.690" style="s2">challenge me when I participate</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.440" end="00:03:23.400" style="s2">I shouldn&#39;t participate because I have</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.690" end="00:03:25.530" style="s2">to say something here because I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.400" end="00:03:28.140" style="s2">said it before and I have never</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.530" end="00:03:32.370" style="s2">experienced before that I&#39;m allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.140" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">say it without being drawn without being</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.370" end="00:03:37.530" style="s2">blamed without being the witch and what</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:39.900" style="s2">is the reaction being so far from</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.530" end="00:03:42.000" style="s2">putting the film out into the world most</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.900" end="00:03:50.130" style="s2">of them and most of the feedback that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.000" end="00:03:54.180" style="s2">get directly is very touched voices from</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.130" end="00:03:56.130" style="s2">men and women men who say that they</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.180" end="00:03:57.660" style="s2">started to cry but they had tears in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.130" end="00:04:00.600" style="s2">eyes because they have never heard this</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.660" end="00:04:03.440" style="s2">and that it felt so healing to them and</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.600" end="00:04:05.790" style="s2">then they are very critical and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.440" end="00:04:11.820" style="s2">controversial reactions to from both</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.790" end="00:04:17.220" style="s2">sides from men and women from the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.820" end="00:04:21.600" style="s2">woman&#39;s side what comes most as fear or</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.220" end="00:04:24.390" style="s2">critic is an understanding of the film</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.600" end="00:04:26.340" style="s2">as if we said it&#39;s all our fault I</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.390" end="00:04:28.950" style="s2">understand the anger and rage that can</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.340" end="00:04:30.750" style="s2">come up with that and if we truly said</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.950" end="00:04:35.340" style="s2">that in the film if we truly said it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.750" end="00:04:37.860" style="s2">all our fault you are all excused any</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.340" end="00:04:39.510" style="s2">abusive behavior from man towards woman</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.860" end="00:04:42.300" style="s2">is excused because it&#39;s all our fault if</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.510" end="00:04:45.180" style="s2">we truly said that rage and anger would</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.300" end="00:04:49.680" style="s2">be the right reaction I think but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.180" end="00:04:50.450" style="s2">don&#39;t we don&#39;t say that so what are you</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.680" end="00:04:55.470" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.450" end="00:05:00.300" style="s2">what we are saying is let&#39;s have a look</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.470" end="00:05:03.360" style="s2">to what we are doing to contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.300" end="00:05:05.340" style="s2">the situation that is as it is and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.360" end="00:05:08.250" style="s2">want to change it so your film has come</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.340" end="00:05:10.140" style="s2">out almost a year after me too but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.250" end="00:05:11.760" style="s2">takes a very different perspective and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.140" end="00:05:15.660" style="s2">almost polar opposite perspective to me</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.760" end="00:05:17.820" style="s2">- why do you think that is and is it a</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.660" end="00:05:18.560" style="s2">response to me - when I&#39;ve been writing</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.820" end="00:05:21.200" style="s2">this text</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:28.100" style="s2">it really came out of a moment web came</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.200" end="00:05:30.200" style="s2">out of me this was in August 2017 and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.100" end="00:05:34.030" style="s2">think me too started in September</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.200" end="00:05:37.030" style="s2">October so it was actually before me -</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.030" end="00:05:39.800" style="s2">it had nothing nothing to do with it</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.030" end="00:05:43.520" style="s2">unless you can say there is there was a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.800" end="00:05:46.220" style="s2">lot of stuff in the field and what I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:48.290" style="s2">brought up is one perspective so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.220" end="00:05:52.580" style="s2">not a response to me - it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.290" end="00:05:54.680" style="s2">perspective I think that what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.580" end="00:05:56.450" style="s2">important in the mid-to is that women</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.680" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">started to speak up and to say I won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.450" end="00:06:00.290" style="s2">hide anymore because I am ashamed of</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.400" end="00:06:02.330" style="s2">what happened to me I&#39;m going to tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.290" end="00:06:08.030" style="s2">you and I&#39;m going to say it&#39;s not okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.330" end="00:06:09.860" style="s2">it&#39;s very important but I I feel that</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.030" end="00:06:11.540" style="s2">there is really one perspective missing</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.860" end="00:06:14.030" style="s2">and it&#39;s interesting that this</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.540" end="00:06:16.850" style="s2">perspective came to me to write a text</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.030" end="00:06:19.370" style="s2">about it before me to even start it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.850" end="00:06:22.580" style="s2">when I look to it now because the film</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.370" end="00:06:26.180" style="s2">has come out after me - of course I see</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.580" end="00:06:29.510" style="s2">it as another perspective - the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.180" end="00:06:31.580" style="s2">picture and an important one because</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.510" end="00:06:35.510" style="s2">it&#39;s really not very present in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.580" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">media and society so far some of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.510" end="00:06:40.669" style="s2">comments online have been kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:42.919" style="s2">tone has been you&#39;re letting women down</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.669" end="00:06:43.970" style="s2">you&#39;re betraying women in some way have</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.919" end="00:06:46.490" style="s2">you seen that of what do you make of</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.970" end="00:06:49.580" style="s2">that like you we are the women who</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.490" end="00:06:53.660" style="s2">betray women right it&#39;s so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.580" end="00:06:55.700" style="s2">because when I did this film and after</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.660" end="00:07:00.050" style="s2">shooting it even more than before I felt</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.700" end="00:07:03.139" style="s2">I am saying this for myself I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.050" end="00:07:06.220" style="s2">this because I embrace all my mistakes</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.139" end="00:07:10.430" style="s2">and all my shadows at least I try and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.220" end="00:07:14.840" style="s2">when I hear we are betraying women no</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.430" end="00:07:17.720" style="s2">way it&#39;s so much self-love at the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.840" end="00:07:21.950" style="s2">time I somehow liked it because what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.720" end="00:07:27.169" style="s2">really don&#39;t like is every human being</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.950" end="00:07:30.169" style="s2">with a vagina is is has this duty to</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.169" end="00:07:32.129" style="s2">laugh every other woman on earth like</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.169" end="00:07:33.929" style="s2">the sister goddess I see</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.129" end="00:07:35.789" style="s2">it&#39;s all refreshing if so many women</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.929" end="00:07:37.739" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be my sisters because they</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.789" end="00:07:40.169" style="s2">don&#39;t like me it&#39;s so refreshing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.739" end="00:07:42.959" style="s2">like what happens ladies come on we have</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.169" end="00:07:44.939" style="s2">different opinions that&#39;s not a real</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.959" end="00:07:47.009" style="s2">problem we have real problems out there</p>

<p begin="00:07:56.849" end="00:08:01.979" style="s2">this very moment no fucking way</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.919" end="00:08:05.429" style="s2">I learned my stuff that&#39;s what I would</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.979" end="00:08:09.929" style="s2">say a lot of people look at me to which</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.429" end="00:08:11.309" style="s2">started last October and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.929" end="00:08:15.029" style="s2">message that you&#39;re putting out they</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.309" end="00:08:17.909" style="s2">feel is too early because it&#39;s only now</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.029" end="00:08:19.110" style="s2">after many years that women are finding</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.909" end="00:08:20.969" style="s2">their voices are setting their</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.110" end="00:08:22.619" style="s2">boundaries or speaking to things that</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.969" end="00:08:24.929" style="s2">have happened to them and then to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.619" end="00:08:26.819" style="s2">immediately come in and say well we need</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.929" end="00:08:28.740" style="s2">to look at our stuff as well too many</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.819" end="00:08:31.199" style="s2">people especially many women I think</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.740" end="00:08:33.240" style="s2">they feel this is too early what do you</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.199" end="00:08:35.789" style="s2">say to that yes I have heard that too</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.240" end="00:08:41.449" style="s2">you know I can see that</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.789" end="00:08:45.209" style="s2">on a personal level of course I can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.449" end="00:08:48.870" style="s2">in a deep process of just starting to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.209" end="00:08:52.079" style="s2">look at to allow for example memories</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.870" end="00:08:54.300" style="s2">come back of experienced abuse to allow</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.079" end="00:08:56.459" style="s2">my wounds to open up to feel them to</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.300" end="00:08:58.980" style="s2">truly feel them and I can be completely</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.459" end="00:09:00.930" style="s2">absorbed by that and then being asked to</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.980" end="00:09:02.790" style="s2">be bothered about men&#39;s wounds and to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.930" end="00:09:05.579" style="s2">own my stuff could be far too much in</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.790" end="00:09:10.259" style="s2">that very moment and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.579" end="00:09:13.439" style="s2">saying while I have not healed my wounds</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.259" end="00:09:16.560" style="s2">yet and even on a collective level while</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.439" end="00:09:21.959" style="s2">as long as we women have not completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.560" end="00:09:23.730" style="s2">healed our wounds we should not look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.959" end="00:09:29.160" style="s2">our shadow and take responsibility for</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.730" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">our part is stupid or even dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.160" end="00:09:33.720" style="s2">because that will and then we will not</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:37.949" style="s2">change anything I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.720" end="00:09:40.470" style="s2">either/or it must be both I have to care</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.949" end="00:09:44.120" style="s2">for my healing and for my wounds it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.470" end="00:09:46.040" style="s2">important and I have to look into my</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.120" end="00:09:49.580" style="s2">shado pardon what I&#39;m doing because</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.040" end="00:09:51.560" style="s2">otherwise I will never truly empower</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.580" end="00:09:55.370" style="s2">myself I will never access my natural</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.560" end="00:09:57.160" style="s2">power and while I&#39;m trying to heal my</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.370" end="00:09:59.660" style="s2">wounds I&#39;m acting out of my shadow</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.160" end="00:10:01.970" style="s2">towards men in a way that they will</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.660" end="00:10:05.030" style="s2">continue the toxic behavior towards</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.970" end="00:10:10.330" style="s2">women and we will get more wounding and</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.030" end="00:10:13.100" style="s2">it will just continue so I think if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.330" end="00:10:17.450" style="s2">truly want to change something if we</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.100" end="00:10:21.530" style="s2">really want to do a new step we need</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.450" end="00:10:23.570" style="s2">both care for our bones and take</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.530" end="00:10:26.290" style="s2">responsibility for our shadow so</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.570" end="00:10:29.770" style="s2">something I&#39;ve been struck by with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.290" end="00:10:33.260" style="s2">reactions that people having in is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.770" end="00:10:36.530" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of discomfort around this</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.260" end="00:10:38.900" style="s2">issue in this something that I know for</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.530" end="00:10:42.440" style="s2">my personal growth work my own journey</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.900" end="00:10:44.390" style="s2">is that that is the essence of shadow</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.440" end="00:10:46.310" style="s2">work like the definition is like you</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.390" end="00:10:47.930" style="s2">don&#39;t want to look that you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.310" end="00:10:54.590" style="s2">to go there that&#39;s why it&#39;s gone into</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.930" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">the shadow and the the beauty of it or</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.590" end="00:10:58.460" style="s2">the healing is that if you have the</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.980" style="s2">courage to look and inquire into that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.460" end="00:11:03.530" style="s2">and own it on those really uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.980" end="00:11:05.690" style="s2">sides that actually you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.530" end="00:11:07.580" style="s2">want to ignore this it&#39;s the irony of so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.690" end="00:11:10.130" style="s2">often the things that we least want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.580" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">say are the things that breed connection</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.130" end="00:11:15.170" style="s2">are the things that create healing and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:16.760" style="s2">really believe that I personal</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.170" end="00:11:19.430" style="s2">experience that that&#39;s true in</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.760" end="00:11:21.560" style="s2">one-on-one relations with humans and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.430" end="00:11:23.860" style="s2">really believe that society socially</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.560" end="00:11:27.130" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in society it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.860" end="00:11:29.540" style="s2">larger manifestation of that I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.130" end="00:11:31.940" style="s2">for the lack of empathy you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.540" end="00:11:34.520" style="s2">encounter if your partners and wives</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.940" end="00:11:37.550" style="s2">when we suddenly want you to show</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.520" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">feelings and understand ours I sent out</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.550" end="00:11:43.520" style="s2">the poem or the text message to various</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.880" end="00:11:47.960" style="s2">women&#39;s networks asking who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.520" end="00:11:50.780" style="s2">participate and I had a lot of very</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.960" end="00:11:52.640" style="s2">powerful and enthusiastic responses not</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.780" end="00:11:57.710" style="s2">only oh yes maybe I will</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.640" end="00:12:00.380" style="s2">but really a thank you for putting words</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.710" end="00:12:04.370" style="s2">to that and this is so much needed and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.380" end="00:12:07.390" style="s2">want to be part of it and so we came</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.370" end="00:12:09.920" style="s2">together in different filming days and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.390" end="00:12:12.710" style="s2">did not only have the filming but also</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.920" end="00:12:14.990" style="s2">huge processes to go through because it</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.710" end="00:12:18.560" style="s2">was not easy for all of us</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.990" end="00:12:20.840" style="s2">the women chose what they wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.560" end="00:12:24.080" style="s2">they chose the parts they were touched</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.840" end="00:12:27.350" style="s2">most of or they felt they wanted to own</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.080" end="00:12:29.900" style="s2">and most of them chose the most</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.350" end="00:12:31.820" style="s2">difficult things for them because I said</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.900" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that one is tough it&#39;s tough to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.820" end="00:12:36.500" style="s2">say that and I feel resistance also to</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:39.410" style="s2">saying it but I feel it&#39;s so true and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.500" end="00:12:43.130" style="s2">want to own it I want to apologize for</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.410" end="00:12:46.490" style="s2">all the mixed messages you get from us</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.130" end="00:12:49.910" style="s2">women when we do everything we can to</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.490" end="00:12:54.230" style="s2">seduce you and then end up blaming you</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.910" end="00:12:55.010" style="s2">for being too horny and only wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.230" end="00:12:57.290" style="s2">have sex</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.010" end="00:12:59.840" style="s2">many women report it afterwards they</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.290" end="00:13:02.330" style="s2">experience and many of us including me</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.840" end="00:13:04.520" style="s2">were not only exhausted but even feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.330" end="00:13:07.490" style="s2">like like we were going to be sick by</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.520" end="00:13:09.560" style="s2">falling sick different kinds stomachache</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.490" end="00:13:12.220" style="s2">headache migraine whatever a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.560" end="00:13:14.840" style="s2">different symptoms showed up</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.220" end="00:13:18.740" style="s2">nightmares also not being able to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.840" end="00:13:21.890" style="s2">and it lasted only one day and one night</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.740" end="00:13:23.900" style="s2">and I had so many feedbacks of how the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.890" end="00:13:27.080" style="s2">next day I woke up and I felt light I</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.900" end="00:13:30.590" style="s2">felt fresh I felt more alive than ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.080" end="00:13:32.420" style="s2">I had the feedbag of I watched in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.590" end="00:13:34.930" style="s2">mirror and I for the first time in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.420" end="00:13:38.770" style="s2">life I felt that I loved myself</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.930" end="00:13:42.710" style="s2">woman reported that they started to</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.770" end="00:13:44.800" style="s2">apologize personally to men of their</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.710" end="00:13:48.260" style="s2">past or in their present life for things</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.800" end="00:13:52.250" style="s2">and said wow I did never imagine how</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.260" end="00:13:55.520" style="s2">much that was freeing myself I felt</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.250" end="00:14:00.710" style="s2">lighter and lighter and more and more</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.520" end="00:14:03.770" style="s2">self-love and many said I felt so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.710" end="00:14:04.940" style="s2">empowered I felt so I felt my power as a</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.770" end="00:14:08.110" style="s2">woman for the first time</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.940" end="00:14:14.260" style="s2">so it was quite amazing process in yen</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.110" end="00:14:17.510" style="s2">why do you think that happened I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.260" end="00:14:18.860" style="s2">and it was the experience was far</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.510" end="00:14:26.180" style="s2">stronger than I expected</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.860" end="00:14:30.500" style="s2">to be honest I think we cannot truly</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.180" end="00:14:32.750" style="s2">love ourselves and we cannot truly</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.500" end="00:14:35.510" style="s2">empower ourselves truly access our</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.750" end="00:14:37.610" style="s2">natural power that we all have without</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.510" end="00:14:39.590" style="s2">also known in our shadow and taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.610" end="00:14:43.880" style="s2">responsibility for this part of our self</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.590" end="00:14:45.770" style="s2">and I think this is what happened I was</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.880" end="00:14:47.920" style="s2">amazing to experience that what do you</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.770" end="00:14:50.630" style="s2">hope men will get from watching us I</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.920" end="00:14:53.690" style="s2">hope they get the most air flow from it</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.630" end="00:14:56.450" style="s2">and I think men recovering in their</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.690" end="00:14:59.060" style="s2">self-love it&#39;s the only real drop that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.450" end="00:15:00.830" style="s2">need to get done if they want to get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.060" end="00:15:03.800" style="s2">job done but I don&#39;t see a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.830" end="00:15:06.890" style="s2">healing point or a deep deeper wound in</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.800" end="00:15:09.410" style="s2">the collective masculine soul then lack</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.890" end="00:15:13.730" style="s2">of self-love because they really didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.410" end="00:15:17.380" style="s2">get an appreciating environment and if</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.730" end="00:15:20.330" style="s2">they restore a gram of real self-love</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.380" end="00:15:22.790" style="s2">they will treat women like goddesses</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.330" end="00:15:25.190" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a problem with hating</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.790" end="00:15:29.150" style="s2">women they have a problem with loving</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.190" end="00:15:31.880" style="s2">themselves people won&#39;t act like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.150" end="00:15:33.010" style="s2">good beings that they are when we treat</p>

<p begin="00:15:33.010" end="00:15:40.340" style="s2">the more we criticize men the more we</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.200" end="00:15:43.190" style="s2">just misuse our right to criticise them</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.340" end="00:15:47.240" style="s2">to belittle them if we keep doing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.190" end="00:15:51.950" style="s2">we directly lead to more hating of women</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.240" end="00:15:54.080" style="s2">more misogyny more more rape culture we</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.950" end="00:15:56.110" style="s2">lead to more of it and we know it we</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.080" end="00:15:58.790" style="s2">know it from psychology we know it from</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.110" end="00:16:00.830" style="s2">pedagogic we know it from teachers we</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.790" end="00:16:03.350" style="s2">know it from trauma therapy we just</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.830" end="00:16:06.380" style="s2">don&#39;t use what we know one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.350" end="00:16:08.990" style="s2">criticisms of the film is the idea of a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.380" end="00:16:11.300" style="s2">collective apology saying that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.990" end="00:16:12.680" style="s2">apologize for someone else so you could</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.300" end="00:16:15.730" style="s2">apologize for your own stuff but not</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.680" end="00:16:19.449" style="s2">apologize for all women for example</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.730" end="00:16:21.549" style="s2">which is very true of course I cannot</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.449" end="00:16:24.009" style="s2">apologize for anyone else</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.549" end="00:16:30.369" style="s2">I cannot take responsibility for anyone</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.009" end="00:16:33.220" style="s2">else for sure and yet I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.369" end="00:16:35.470" style="s2">so easy to make a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.220" end="00:16:38.559" style="s2">collective and personal and individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.470" end="00:16:41.679" style="s2">there is no collective if not expressed</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.559" end="00:16:43.359" style="s2">through the individual and as we are</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.679" end="00:16:47.049" style="s2">social creatures there is no individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.359" end="00:16:51.160" style="s2">without the collective and I want can</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.049" end="00:16:55.869" style="s2">give an example for myself I have found</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.160" end="00:16:58.059" style="s2">myself many times being thinking and or</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.869" end="00:17:00.220" style="s2">talking in a quite judgmental ways about</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.059" end="00:17:02.739" style="s2">man when I heard myself speaking these</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.220" end="00:17:04.899" style="s2">words these words coming out of my mouth</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.739" end="00:17:06.669" style="s2">I hurt my mother talked I hurt my</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.899" end="00:17:11.019" style="s2">grandmother talked I hurt my great</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.669" end="00:17:13.299" style="s2">grandmother I shall talk so I realized</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.019" end="00:17:15.159" style="s2">it&#39;s not only my own experiences in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.299" end="00:17:18.970" style="s2">own hurt it&#39;s a learned pattern already</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.159" end="00:17:22.929" style="s2">it&#39;s out of the herd of farmer women so</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.970" end="00:17:25.449" style="s2">how can you really different how can you</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.929" end="00:17:28.389" style="s2">really make a difference between the two</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.449" end="00:17:32.740" style="s2">levels and what is surprised you most</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.389" end="00:17:35.169" style="s2">about the reaction to the film yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.740" end="00:17:37.120" style="s2">have not spoken of the men&#39;s negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.169" end="00:17:38.799" style="s2">reactions yet and that is an answer to</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.120" end="00:17:41.260" style="s2">that question because that surprised me</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.799" end="00:17:44.860" style="s2">most not that there might be negative</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.260" end="00:17:47.710" style="s2">reactions but I have learned thanks to</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.860" end="00:17:49.220" style="s2">the reactions to the film about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.710" end="00:17:52.820" style="s2">men&#39;s rights movement and</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.220" end="00:17:54.770" style="s2">and going their own way movement I had</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.820" end="00:17:56.480" style="s2">not heard of that before you took could</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.770" end="00:17:59.360" style="s2">you expect who do you say what some of</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.480" end="00:18:01.400" style="s2">the comments were exactly the directions</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.360" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">were for example sorry ladies it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.400" end="00:18:06.590" style="s2">late I will never trust you again or</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:09.920" style="s2">this is all not true you have been paid</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.590" end="00:18:14.440" style="s2">for it or you&#39;re doing this only to</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.920" end="00:18:21.230" style="s2">manipulate us again so a lot of mistrust</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.440" end="00:18:27.190" style="s2">some all say I&#39;m just just hateful it</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.230" end="00:18:31.400" style="s2">shows to me how deep man rules are and</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.190" end="00:18:33.260" style="s2">in the first place it was painful to get</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.400" end="00:18:36.890" style="s2">these reactions to a message that came</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.260" end="00:18:42.320" style="s2">out of my heart that was meant really</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.890" end="00:18:44.240" style="s2">that is mentor he honestly it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.320" end="00:18:48.560" style="s2">painful in the first place in the second</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.240" end="00:18:50.990" style="s2">place I thought wow it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.560" end="00:18:52.790" style="s2">that it comes up that it becomes visible</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.990" end="00:18:54.410" style="s2">because it&#39;s so important that shows how</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.790" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">important this message is and how</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.410" end="00:19:01.490" style="s2">important the work is how important</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">healing is it and this wounding of man</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.490" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">and of woman actually and there have</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:09.890" style="s2">been quite a few comments especially on</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:11.900" style="s2">the YouTube film of men saying exactly</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.890" end="00:19:13.520" style="s2">that sorry ladies it&#39;s too late or</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.900" end="00:19:15.860" style="s2">you&#39;re just trying to manipulate us</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.520" end="00:19:18.440" style="s2">again what was your reaction to that I</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.860" end="00:19:21.380" style="s2">say sorry as honest as I can do it today</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.440" end="00:19:23.870" style="s2">leave it or take it and it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.380" end="00:19:26.750" style="s2">that in those comments especially from</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.870" end="00:19:29.630" style="s2">men it&#39;s like it&#39;s not good enough where</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.750" end="00:19:33.260" style="s2">I think but that&#39;s the best that I can</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.630" end="00:19:35.660" style="s2">give and this comment is hopefully not</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.260" end="00:19:39.140" style="s2">the best that you can give because there</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.660" end="00:19:42.830" style="s2">is a standard that I said and I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.140" end="00:19:49.070" style="s2">don&#39;t go down to this level of of hating</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.830" end="00:19:51.430" style="s2">and blaming so yes 100% of the mess</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.070" end="00:19:54.710" style="s2">between the sexes is in my hands and</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.430" end="00:19:57.740" style="s2">100% is in your hands and I will never</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.710" end="00:19:59.750" style="s2">ever take 1% of your responsibility and</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.740" end="00:20:01.880" style="s2">say oh I am the bad one I&#39;m not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.750" end="00:20:06.440" style="s2">one so it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.880" end="00:20:08.180" style="s2">like what do you want to get rid of with</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.440" end="00:20:10.310" style="s2">this kind of sorry it&#39;s too late</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.180" end="00:20:12.320" style="s2">they don&#39;t even mean sorry it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.310" end="00:20:15.350" style="s2">even well sorry it&#39;s so cynic it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.320" end="00:20:19.630" style="s2">it&#39;s uninteresting for me somehow what</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.350" end="00:20:22.700" style="s2">do you hope the film will achieve this</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.630" end="00:20:26.720" style="s2">peace and laugh and ecstasy for</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.700" end="00:20:33.560" style="s2">everybody and I think what I hope what</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.720" end="00:20:36.350" style="s2">this film effects is a deeper sense for</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.560" end="00:20:39.230" style="s2">both sexes of how complex this</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.350" end="00:20:42.650" style="s2">challenges and that we really have to do</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.230" end="00:20:44.900" style="s2">our homework everybody cries for the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.650" end="00:20:46.550" style="s2">one for the big laugh for the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.900" end="00:20:48.710" style="s2">relationship then do your fucking</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.550" end="00:20:54.460" style="s2">homework it will hurt of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.710" end="00:20:59.930" style="s2">my hope is that we can truly do a step</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.460" end="00:21:04.430" style="s2">into a new dialogue and co-creation</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.930" end="00:21:06.290" style="s2">where women start to say I love being a</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.430" end="00:21:08.240" style="s2">woman again and a man can say I love</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.290" end="00:21:10.100" style="s2">being a man and we all can say we love</p>

<p begin="00:21:10.100" end="00:21:17.930" style="s2">I dream of a time where we can truly</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.210" end="00:21:20.180" style="s2">allow ourselves to love again and that</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.930" end="00:21:22.300" style="s2">is impossible without allowing ourselves</p>
