<p begin="00:01:24.020" end="00:01:29.970" style="s2">hello and welcome to the next episode of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.610" end="00:01:32.430" style="s2">boys club this is episode 20 finding</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.970" end="00:01:34.890" style="s2">purpose in modern society it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.430" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">recorded live and it was an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.890" end="00:01:40.350" style="s2">conversation and I think there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:41.490" style="s2">meaning there and well I suppose I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.350" end="00:01:42.840" style="s2">just tell you one or two things about it</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:45.900" style="s2">so you might consider sticking around</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.840" end="00:01:48.830" style="s2">and listening Neville who I speak to in</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.900" end="00:01:53.490" style="s2">the podcast is a 77 year old innovator a</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.830" end="00:01:57.300" style="s2">gestalt therapist urban shaman a venture</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.490" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">capitalist and mentor and I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.300" end="00:02:02.160" style="s2">someone who has developed his</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:03.630" style="s2">relationship with spirit now we discuss</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.160" end="00:02:04.880" style="s2">what we mean by spirits so I won&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.630" end="00:02:08.550" style="s2">into that here</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.880" end="00:02:10.740" style="s2">of course people come to these kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.550" end="00:02:16.100" style="s2">discussions with different vocabularies</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.740" end="00:02:20.400" style="s2">and different axioms about ontology and</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.100" end="00:02:23.880" style="s2">the nature of things that can be a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.400" end="00:02:27.570" style="s2">hindrance I suppose to real communion</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.880" end="00:02:32.010" style="s2">around a conversation about spirit but I</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.570" end="00:02:36.959" style="s2">believe that there is a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.010" end="00:02:39.560" style="s2">reality to living and that the psyche</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.959" end="00:02:43.459" style="s2">itself and consciousness itself draws on</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.560" end="00:02:49.430" style="s2">something so fundamental that deserves</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.459" end="00:02:49.430" style="s2">the spiritual language to encapsulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.459" end="00:02:57.019" style="s2">and I enjoyed this discussion a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.140" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">despite some amount of stress involved</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.019" end="00:03:08.070" style="s2">but I look forward to many more and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:11.730" style="s2">hope you enjoy it so thank you and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.070" end="00:03:15.890" style="s2">promise not to be so bloody serious all</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.730" end="00:03:22.850" style="s2">the time so there we go</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.890" end="00:03:22.850" style="s2">now I hope you enjoy this so</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.430" end="00:03:29.770" style="s2">something strange about recording</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.710" end="00:03:33.130" style="s2">conversations is that there is a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.770" end="00:03:36.130" style="s2">kind of incumbent on you to to continue</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.130" end="00:03:42.490" style="s2">speaking even when sometimes silence is</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.130" end="00:03:46.510" style="s2">the right thing and so yeah I&#39;ll get my</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.490" end="00:03:51.300" style="s2">excuses in early for go ahead silent can</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.510" end="00:03:55.600" style="s2">I be silent the whole card you will see</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.300" end="00:03:59.050" style="s2">so alright here&#39;s a quote to begin with</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.600" end="00:04:01.060" style="s2">and it&#39;s from a man who is nothing short</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.050" end="00:04:04.210" style="s2">of a genius his name was Carl Gustav</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.060" end="00:04:07.240" style="s2">Jung the story of a life begins</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.210" end="00:04:09.760" style="s2">somewhere at some particular point we</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.240" end="00:04:12.460" style="s2">happen to remember and even then it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.760" end="00:04:14.020" style="s2">already highly complex we do not know</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.460" end="00:04:16.210" style="s2">how life was going to turn out</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.020" end="00:04:18.610" style="s2">so therefore the story has no beginning</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.210" end="00:04:21.549" style="s2">and the end can only be vaguely in to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.610" end="00:04:26.500" style="s2">that the life of man is a dubious</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.549" end="00:04:33.790" style="s2">experiment now he wrote this in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.500" end="00:04:35.920" style="s2">preface to his autobiography and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.790" end="00:04:39.360" style="s2">something fundamentally right about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.920" end="00:04:43.750" style="s2">I think because if we want to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.360" end="00:04:47.410" style="s2">what it is to live a meaningful life</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.750" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">then I think in a certain sense we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.410" end="00:04:51.970" style="s2">to be open to the fact that we cannot</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:55.630" style="s2">entirely low in the final analysis what</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.970" end="00:04:59.110" style="s2">we are here to do in any fixed sense or</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.630" end="00:05:02.860" style="s2">even how it all turns out because what</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.110" end="00:05:05.920" style="s2">we do is embedded in many processes and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.860" end="00:05:08.860" style="s2">we interact with other people constantly</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.920" end="00:05:11.620" style="s2">and so even after we pass what we do</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.860" end="00:05:14.680" style="s2">leaves in air code which affects the</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.620" end="00:05:18.250" style="s2">story of everyone else and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.680" end="00:05:20.710" style="s2">clear when a moment would be to look</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.250" end="00:05:26.020" style="s2">back and go that&#39;s my life that&#39;s who I</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.710" end="00:05:27.730" style="s2">am nevertheless we need to develop some</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.020" end="00:05:30.880" style="s2">coherent sense of what we are and what</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.730" end="00:05:32.350" style="s2">we&#39;re doing and in a very important</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.880" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">sense I think that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.350" end="00:05:35.800" style="s2">understood as something like a story so</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.050" end="00:05:38.860" style="s2">never I want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.800" end="00:05:40.210" style="s2">ask you a question that I think is one</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.860" end="00:05:42.400" style="s2">of the most difficult questions you</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.210" end="00:05:44.229" style="s2">can&#39;t ask anyone and I&#39;ve sort of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.400" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">said that there&#39;s no possible way you</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.229" end="00:05:51.220" style="s2">could ever finally answer this but you</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:52.539" style="s2">are 77 years old now 77 years young</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.220" end="00:05:57.970" style="s2">thank you yes that&#39;s right you always</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.539" end="00:06:02.650" style="s2">get me on that one so so what then is</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.970" end="00:06:04.629" style="s2">the story of your life oh my god - come</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.650" end="00:06:07.780" style="s2">on whatever till you really want to go</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.629" end="00:06:15.099" style="s2">and everyone hmm what are you here to do</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.780" end="00:06:19.270" style="s2">what am I here to do right okay I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.099" end="00:06:21.819" style="s2">clear on my current purpose now but my</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.270" end="00:06:25.000" style="s2">purpose and I want to touch on this I</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.819" end="00:06:28.539" style="s2">think there are six it this seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.000" end="00:06:34.030" style="s2">booming a lot can you hear okay okay all</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.539" end="00:06:36.280" style="s2">right I&#39;d like to touch on later that in</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.030" end="00:06:39.580" style="s2">my experience in my view there are</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.280" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">basically six purposes that every single</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.580" end="00:06:46.900" style="s2">one of us live and that these change</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:49.240" style="s2">roughly every five years so that every</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.900" end="00:06:53.349" style="s2">five years if you like we have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.240" end="00:06:56.009" style="s2">reinvent our grand purpose and we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.349" end="00:06:58.330" style="s2">six big ones to choose from and</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.009" end="00:07:04.810" style="s2">ninety-eight percent of us choose from</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.330" end="00:07:07.779" style="s2">those six but these are changed as life</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.810" end="00:07:11.199" style="s2">changes but they also change out of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.779" end="00:07:14.050" style="s2">series of events and seven years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.199" end="00:07:17.949" style="s2">woke up in the morning I was clear where</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.050" end="00:07:20.529" style="s2">my life was going what I was doing I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.949" end="00:07:23.440" style="s2">a son who had paranoid schizophrenic</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.529" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">premium and he was really quite</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.440" end="00:07:30.580" style="s2">literally mad and a lot of my time and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:33.340" style="s2">effort was been caring for him looking</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.580" end="00:07:36.789" style="s2">after him and that morning I woke up and</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.340" end="00:07:38.729" style="s2">I started to feel enormous pain I</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.789" end="00:07:42.819" style="s2">dropped on the floor</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.729" end="00:07:47.260" style="s2">my wife rang me hand melons and I was</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.819" end="00:07:49.360" style="s2">taken into a hospital saying that I had</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.260" end="00:07:55.030" style="s2">people silence which is a bit unusual at</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.360" end="00:07:59.110" style="s2">72 70 sorry 70 the water later I was in</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.030" end="00:07:59.590" style="s2">a room of four with a lovely morphine</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.110" end="00:08:03.070" style="s2">drip</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.590" end="00:08:04.930" style="s2">which I rather enjoyed to be honest and</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.070" end="00:08:06.700" style="s2">I&#39;m lying there trying to press the</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.930" end="00:08:10.210" style="s2">button to get some more but it had an</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.700" end="00:08:12.790" style="s2">overload and I couldn&#39;t do it and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.210" end="00:08:15.010" style="s2">nurse came in looking a bit distressed</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.790" end="00:08:17.980" style="s2">and she said there&#39;s some people here to</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.010" end="00:08:21.550" style="s2">see and so we&#39;re moving you into a</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.980" end="00:08:24.760" style="s2">single room so I walked out with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.550" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">drip and these funny pajamas that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.760" end="00:08:31.660" style="s2">put on with no underpants in you feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:34.479" style="s2">very sort of a bit wary walking down the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.660" end="00:08:37.000" style="s2">main corridor like this Villas I&#39;m a bit</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.479" end="00:08:40.810" style="s2">loose bit loose in there door hangers</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.000" end="00:08:43.120" style="s2">and I walked out and I could see my wife</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.810" end="00:08:47.800" style="s2">there and her daughter looking very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.120" end="00:08:51.550" style="s2">stressed and I saw a policeman so they</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.800" end="00:08:54.370" style="s2">went into the single room and I looked</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.550" end="00:08:59.290" style="s2">at him and said Anthony the name of my</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.370" end="00:09:03.970" style="s2">son and he said yes I said did and he</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.290" end="00:09:08.220" style="s2">said yes and I said suicide and he said</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.970" end="00:09:15.700" style="s2">yes and I said fuck and started to cry</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.220" end="00:09:18.160" style="s2">quite a lot so that event where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.700" end="00:09:20.820" style="s2">my life was involved in being a father</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.160" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">and looking after him and caring for him</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.820" end="00:09:28.540" style="s2">caused a significant re-evaluation in my</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:32.080" style="s2">life and it caused a change in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.540" end="00:09:35.560" style="s2">purpose that I now live to that purpose</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.080" end="00:09:39.420" style="s2">now is that I wish and I am actively</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.560" end="00:09:43.210" style="s2">every day seeking to directly influence</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.420" end="00:09:47.230" style="s2">10,000 people to create and grow a</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.210" end="00:09:50.380" style="s2">business with soul to change the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.230" end="00:09:53.050" style="s2">and have the life and lifestyle that</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.380" end="00:09:56.410" style="s2">they want now that purpose might sound</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.050" end="00:09:58.540" style="s2">pretty eerie theory but for me it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.410" end="00:09:59.690" style="s2">reason the race on d&#39;etre I get up every</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.540" end="00:10:02.990" style="s2">day</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.690" end="00:10:07.880" style="s2">it motivators motivates me extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.990" end="00:10:16.430" style="s2">it keeps me young and makes every bloody</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.880" end="00:10:19.010" style="s2">thing I do every day meaningful so when</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.430" end="00:10:23.450" style="s2">we talk about business with soul we use</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.010" end="00:10:28.450" style="s2">a word there that for lots of people the</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.450" end="00:10:31.520" style="s2">word soul has become detached from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.450" end="00:10:37.430" style="s2">reality you can really grasp yes</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.520" end="00:10:39.950" style="s2">right and well I think something we both</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.430" end="00:10:44.840" style="s2">share is an appreciation for the spirit</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.950" end="00:10:47.330" style="s2">and in some important sense the</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.840" end="00:10:49.240" style="s2">recognition the motivation to do any of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.330" end="00:10:52.880" style="s2">that at all</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.240" end="00:10:57.260" style="s2">comes from a relationship with spirit</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.880" end="00:10:59.210" style="s2">yes so perhaps you could talk to me a</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.260" end="00:11:06.140" style="s2">little bit about your own relationship</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.210" end="00:11:14.540" style="s2">with soul which one is it you reckon the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.140" end="00:11:18.260" style="s2">left or the right either either open up</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.540" end="00:11:21.500" style="s2">a Pandora&#39;s box there but basically Carl</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.260" end="00:11:23.870" style="s2">Gustav Jung fundamentally said there is</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.500" end="00:11:26.660" style="s2">no difference in a personal sense</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.870" end="00:11:30.260" style="s2">between soul and spirit now a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.660" end="00:11:32.420" style="s2">people do distinguish between that but</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.260" end="00:11:36.290" style="s2">he also said that really and is quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.420" end="00:11:39.500" style="s2">right the word for soul in Greek is</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.290" end="00:11:44.540" style="s2">psyche and out of psyche we get the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.500" end="00:11:47.210" style="s2">words psychology and all the other words</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.540" end="00:11:50.540" style="s2">beginning with sight so for my</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.210" end="00:11:54.770" style="s2">convenience I I think the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.540" end="00:11:57.470" style="s2">psyche soul and spirit are virtually the</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.770" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">same yes I think that&#39;s correct and and</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.470" end="00:12:03.700" style="s2">that what when we&#39;re talking about soul</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:07.220" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the very essence of</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.700" end="00:12:09.290" style="s2">who we are as a human kind has a being</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.220" end="00:12:12.530" style="s2">yes and one of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.290" end="00:12:13.670" style="s2">things about human beings is first of</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.530" end="00:12:16.610" style="s2">all we are the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.670" end="00:12:19.090" style="s2">only animal on the whole planet that</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.610" end="00:12:21.830" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get up and walk after birth</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.090" end="00:12:25.880" style="s2">every other animal that I can think of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.830" end="00:12:28.610" style="s2">sort of is more or less complete to</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.880" end="00:12:31.460" style="s2">stand alone and exist alone but</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.610" end="00:12:36.950" style="s2">humankind isn&#39;t that we are actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.460" end="00:12:41.930" style="s2">born incomplete and if we look at them</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.950" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">then one of the fundamental purposes of</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.930" end="00:12:49.610" style="s2">our life and our reason to be a soul and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:54.140" style="s2">a spirit embodied in a physical body is</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.610" end="00:12:57.020" style="s2">to make us complete and when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.140" end="00:12:59.870" style="s2">complete we&#39;re ready to go wherever</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.020" end="00:13:03.160" style="s2">Souls and spirits go either into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.870" end="00:13:06.050" style="s2">earth and finish or somewhere else but</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.160" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">that&#39;s our journey our journey is to</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.050" end="00:13:12.140" style="s2">complete ourselves yes the movement</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:14.450" style="s2">towards wholeness yet completion right</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.140" end="00:13:16.190" style="s2">which for young can be understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.450" end="00:13:18.710" style="s2">through that can be understood through</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.190" end="00:13:20.810" style="s2">the process of individuation yes which</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.710" end="00:13:23.630" style="s2">is something like the integration of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.810" end="00:13:26.510" style="s2">unconscious contents into the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.630" end="00:13:29.170" style="s2">life which is to say also into action in</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.510" end="00:13:33.740" style="s2">the world and therefore also action</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.170" end="00:13:36.020" style="s2">within an interconnected network of well</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.740" end="00:13:38.000" style="s2">at least other human beings but really</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.020" end="00:13:39.650" style="s2">the whole web of life itself</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:44.030" style="s2">and perhaps we could extend that even</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.650" end="00:13:47.560" style="s2">further so can I can I just jump in</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.030" end="00:13:51.880" style="s2">there you&#39;re always living in an age</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.560" end="00:13:56.590" style="s2">where each of us to become who we are</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.880" end="00:13:59.450" style="s2">was a fundamental raison d&#39;être a famous</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.590" end="00:14:01.520" style="s2">really special purpose yes and it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.450" end="00:14:04.040" style="s2">remains one of the six that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.520" end="00:14:08.410" style="s2">keep coming back to that is to become</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.040" end="00:14:12.440" style="s2">the best us that we possibly can be but</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.410" end="00:14:14.270" style="s2">increasingly the way the world is and we</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.440" end="00:14:16.940" style="s2">are at I think one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.270" end="00:14:20.060" style="s2">incredible tipping points in human</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.940" end="00:14:22.010" style="s2">history not just our lives but but human</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.060" end="00:14:25.790" style="s2">history and there&#39;s there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.010" end="00:14:26.980" style="s2">thirty tsunamis that are hitting the</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.790" end="00:14:29.470" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.980" end="00:14:32.170" style="s2">and they are fundamentally changing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.470" end="00:14:34.329" style="s2">way the world is and the way the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.170" end="00:14:39.190" style="s2">will become and the futures that we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.329" end="00:14:41.560" style="s2">all have so my personal view is that we</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.190" end="00:14:44.579" style="s2">are at a tipping point where we have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.560" end="00:14:48.310" style="s2">move away from the focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.579" end="00:14:51.069" style="s2">individuation still important to a</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.310" end="00:14:54.509" style="s2">purpose that is more collaborative that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.069" end="00:14:56.889" style="s2">is more tribal that is more</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.509" end="00:14:59.379" style="s2">communicating and working together and I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.889" end="00:15:03.220" style="s2">think that&#39;s a fundamental shift in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.379" end="00:15:05.680" style="s2">modern world so one of the many answers</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.220" end="00:15:08.259" style="s2">to your question I think is how do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.680" end="00:15:12.389" style="s2">find soul spirit purpose and meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.259" end="00:15:15.579" style="s2">the modern world it&#39;s through loving</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.389" end="00:15:18.879" style="s2">relating working with others and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.579" end="00:15:23.199" style="s2">becoming a very big prime purpose of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.879" end="00:15:24.910" style="s2">six yes I mean so I agree with you and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.199" end="00:15:27.189" style="s2">think this is somewhere we&#39;ve spoken</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.910" end="00:15:29.470" style="s2">about a little bit before and this will</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.189" end="00:15:33.100" style="s2">be a consistent area of push and pull</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.470" end="00:15:34.750" style="s2">because talk about the collective you</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.100" end="00:15:36.130" style="s2">have to talk about the individual and to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.750" end="00:15:38.259" style="s2">talk about the individual you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.130" end="00:15:40.360" style="s2">talk about the collective and so but</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.259" end="00:15:43.240" style="s2">which one like we&#39;ve come through a</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.360" end="00:15:46.600" style="s2">process where the individual is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.240" end="00:15:49.630" style="s2">supreme over and above the society over</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.600" end="00:15:53.110" style="s2">and above community you know well go to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.630" end="00:15:55.680" style="s2">just about any American self-help</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.110" end="00:15:58.449" style="s2">evangelist and it&#39;s all about you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.680" end="00:16:00.490" style="s2">finding your goals and striving and</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.449" end="00:16:04.000" style="s2">being ambitious and whatever but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.490" end="00:16:07.149" style="s2">all about being you it&#39;s really being</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.000" end="00:16:10.000" style="s2">you in a community in a tribe in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.149" end="00:16:12.880" style="s2">family in a group of people and that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.000" end="00:16:19.750" style="s2">that has to change if we get to save the</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.880" end="00:16:21.309" style="s2">planet for example well yes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.750" end="00:16:24.069" style="s2">certainly no disagreement from me when</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.309" end="00:16:27.459" style="s2">it comes to the proper sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.069" end="00:16:31.449" style="s2">developing yourself as an individual to</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.459" end="00:16:34.689" style="s2">be a cognizant of your impact and</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.449" end="00:16:38.139" style="s2">relation with everything else around you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.689" end="00:16:40.010" style="s2">and it should be more understood from</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.139" end="00:16:45.350" style="s2">the perspective of finding your pro</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.010" end="00:16:48.200" style="s2">nitch to give value in that Network what</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.350" end="00:16:51.740" style="s2">what sort of character essentially are</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.200" end="00:16:54.980" style="s2">you destined in some sense to become or</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.740" end="00:17:02.180" style="s2">to unfold yourself into that complements</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.980" end="00:17:06.709" style="s2">the show in your own unique way now it</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.180" end="00:17:09.199" style="s2">is it is still somewhat confusing though</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.709" end="00:17:13.459" style="s2">because I think at least where I come</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.199" end="00:17:15.110" style="s2">from sorry what&#39;s confusing I&#39;ll well</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.459" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">the following the following thought</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.110" end="00:17:20.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s a tension there right</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:23.780" style="s2">because yes we want to add as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.240" end="00:17:27.440" style="s2">can to to everyone around us and that</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.780" end="00:17:29.270" style="s2">might mean not placing yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.440" end="00:17:32.420" style="s2">center and recognizing that you just</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.270" end="00:17:35.780" style="s2">have a part to play but I think within</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.420" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">us all as a part of that essence of</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.780" end="00:17:41.810" style="s2">spirit and psyche in some important</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.500" end="00:18:45.020" style="s2">you&#39;re saying there he uses the word</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.000" end="00:18:49.850" style="s2">entelechy and what he says is that just</p>

<p begin="00:19:38.780" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">to that as well and that is the purpose</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.750" end="00:19:49.310" style="s2">of being in community and making the</p>

<p begin="00:19:51.590" end="00:20:00.310" style="s2">starting to unravel now now so our</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.150" end="00:20:03.410" style="s2">individuation needs to take place within</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.310" end="00:20:06.260" style="s2">within an ability and an interest to</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.420" end="00:20:20.270" style="s2">spiritually yes no I do agree with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.960" end="00:20:26.000" style="s2">and we can I guess best to move on from</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.270" end="00:20:27.500" style="s2">this because I can only anticipate if I</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.000" end="00:20:30.470" style="s2">follow that train it&#39;s just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.500" end="00:20:34.790" style="s2">technical dispute that ultimately needs</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.470" end="00:20:43.520" style="s2">leads nowhere but why don&#39;t we then pick</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.790" end="00:20:51.350" style="s2">back up on can you talk me through how</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.520" end="00:20:54.740" style="s2">it was you were able to pick your gaze</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.350" end="00:20:57.470" style="s2">back up and set a new purpose for your</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.740" end="00:21:00.470" style="s2">life after the tragic news you heard</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.470" end="00:21:05.330" style="s2">that you spoke about the suicide of your</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.470" end="00:21:07.700" style="s2">son Anthony yes it took it took at least</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.330" end="00:21:11.510" style="s2">a year to rebuild and</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.700" end="00:21:15.710" style="s2">um there isn&#39;t a day gone by that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.510" end="00:21:18.200" style="s2">don&#39;t remember my son and even talking</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.710" end="00:21:21.679" style="s2">about him now I&#39;m starting to tear up so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.200" end="00:21:24.260" style="s2">that grieving process I think for</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.679" end="00:21:29.230" style="s2">someone you deeply love I don&#39;t think it</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.260" end="00:21:32.630" style="s2">ever ends and why should it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.230" end="00:21:36.620" style="s2">when I divorced my first wife or my only</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.630" end="00:21:40.159" style="s2">wife we did that in great love we</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.620" end="00:21:44.000" style="s2">couldn&#39;t hold Antony&#39;s madness as a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.159" end="00:21:46.820" style="s2">couple it was just so bad that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.000" end="00:21:48.500" style="s2">destroyed our relationship but we parted</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.820" end="00:21:53.659" style="s2">in great love and we still love each</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.500" end="00:21:59.320" style="s2">other so it&#39;s like some of the shittiest</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.659" end="00:22:03.049" style="s2">things in life like Amy&#39;s dead become a</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.320" end="00:22:07.130" style="s2">crystal or a magnifying glass for us to</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.049" end="00:22:09.559" style="s2">really really examine what&#39;s going on in</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.130" end="00:22:11.899" style="s2">our life and why are we here and who are</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.559" end="00:22:13.820" style="s2">we and who do we want to become and by</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.899" end="00:22:17.659" style="s2">the way these questions are the</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.820" end="00:22:21.159" style="s2">questions of purpose Who am I who do I</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.659" end="00:22:25.100" style="s2">want to be what values do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.159" end="00:22:27.820" style="s2">express in the world what what</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.100" end="00:22:30.889" style="s2">contribution do I make these sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.820" end="00:22:36.529" style="s2">philosophical questions are actually the</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.889" end="00:22:39.559" style="s2">questions of purpose and the the death</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.529" end="00:22:44.210" style="s2">of my son which was fundamental because</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.559" end="00:22:46.970" style="s2">like that&#39;s that&#39;s an unnatural thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.210" end="00:22:49.720" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s the natural order is</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.970" end="00:22:53.090" style="s2">that that you know you have kids and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.720" end="00:22:56.419" style="s2">they look after you after you&#39;ve looked</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.090" end="00:22:59.720" style="s2">after them and you die and then they die</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.419" end="00:23:04.070" style="s2">so when they die before you it&#39;s like it</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.720" end="00:23:07.669" style="s2">it sets up an incredible rift in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.070" end="00:23:09.950" style="s2">universe in your personal cosmos but but</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.669" end="00:23:16.090" style="s2">what happened was that in many ways I</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.950" end="00:23:18.980" style="s2">felt at that point I hit rock bottom but</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.090" end="00:23:21.590" style="s2">the turning point and the answer had it</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.980" end="00:23:24.980" style="s2">I reconstruct was that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.590" end="00:23:30.340" style="s2">when I hit rock bottom and it really</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.980" end="00:23:33.890" style="s2">looked at who I was and experienced that</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.340" end="00:23:34.580" style="s2">tragedy and took it on board I found it</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.890" end="00:23:37.070" style="s2">was rock</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.580" end="00:23:40.030" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t quicksand it wasn&#39;t saying it</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.070" end="00:23:42.950" style="s2">wasn&#39;t water I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.030" end="00:23:44.690" style="s2">evaporating I wasn&#39;t going away do you</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.950" end="00:23:50.030" style="s2">understand that it was like I actually</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.690" end="00:23:53.540" style="s2">found an absolute beautiful new fucking</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.030" end="00:23:56.330" style="s2">painful like you know that life wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.540" end="00:24:01.850" style="s2">all Roseate and you know beer and chips</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.330" end="00:24:03.770" style="s2">and I had to accept that this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.850" end="00:24:06.020" style="s2">I didn&#39;t want to have happen and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.770" end="00:24:08.450" style="s2">been getting really angry about it I</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.020" end="00:24:12.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t want it to happen but it happened</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.450" end="00:24:16.160" style="s2">and I have to accept that that is one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.920" end="00:24:19.040" style="s2">the bedrocks of building who you are as</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.160" end="00:24:22.370" style="s2">a human being yes and I think that rock</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.040" end="00:24:25.250" style="s2">bottom actually is can I have a tissue</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.370" end="00:24:28.490" style="s2">is anyone got a tissue please sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.250" end="00:24:31.790" style="s2">not sorry about that I&#39;m glad that at 77</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.490" end="00:24:37.640" style="s2">I can express my real emotions yes and</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.790" end="00:24:45.620" style="s2">you can ask for a tissue - yeah thank</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.640" end="00:24:49.460" style="s2">you thank you so I think that&#39;s hitting</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.620" end="00:24:53.720" style="s2">rock bottom there is and it&#39;s rock</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.460" end="00:24:57.170" style="s2">well it&#39;s rock it has in its real as in</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.720" end="00:25:00.380" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a connection with perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.170" end="00:25:05.990" style="s2">the source of the most real thing there</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.380" end="00:25:07.220" style="s2">is which is the recognition was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.990" end="00:25:10.820" style="s2">there and a half</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.220" end="00:25:19.640" style="s2">it&#39;s an affectation and it&#39;s it&#39;s a self</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.820" end="00:25:24.260" style="s2">affirmation of a will to live of spirit</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.640" end="00:25:30.490" style="s2">of so I think that&#39;s the only thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.260" end="00:25:33.770" style="s2">powerful enough to to enable them to</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.490" end="00:25:35.510" style="s2">enable the experience of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.770" end="00:25:40.960" style="s2">moment in your life</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.510" end="00:25:46.060" style="s2">to be in fact the language wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.960" end="00:25:46.060" style="s2">obviously it&#39;s not the best but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.240" end="00:25:51.790" style="s2">there&#39;s something there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.470" end="00:25:54.470" style="s2">beautiful about something real there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.790" end="00:25:56.570" style="s2">man who was going to be here today about</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.470" end="00:25:58.700" style="s2">his gallivanting all over Australia</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.570" end="00:26:02.660" style="s2">working very hard his name&#39;s Patrick</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.700" end="00:26:04.960" style="s2">Slater and here I tell this story quite</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.660" end="00:26:10.150" style="s2">a lot because I think it encapsulates</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.960" end="00:26:14.900" style="s2">well similar themes and he was hiking in</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.150" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">Japan and bug is quite a quite a tall</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.900" end="00:26:21.880" style="s2">man and so he got very very sick as he</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:24.920" style="s2">was hiking along in the snow just</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.880" end="00:26:27.440" style="s2">imagine some blizzard just high up in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.920" end="00:26:29.870" style="s2">Japan and he and buggies just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.440" end="00:26:32.570" style="s2">hunched along as how I kind of imagined</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.870" end="00:26:34.400" style="s2">it you know and apparently the view from</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.570" end="00:26:36.020" style="s2">people behind him walking was just the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.400" end="00:26:38.390" style="s2">most tragic thing ever he&#39;s almost dying</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.020" end="00:26:39.860" style="s2">and in this blizzard and it was the</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.390" end="00:26:41.690" style="s2">worst he&#39;d ever felt in his whole life</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.860" end="00:26:46.190" style="s2">just absolutely terrible</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.690" end="00:26:48.110" style="s2">thought he was going to die and so they</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.190" end="00:26:51.730" style="s2">continued on continued on and eventually</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.110" end="00:26:54.220" style="s2">they stopped and he has a cup of tea and</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.730" end="00:26:57.950" style="s2">I think he said he felt something like</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.950" end="00:27:04.760" style="s2">was the trajectory from being the</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.070" end="00:27:08.300" style="s2">absolute worst to just moving off that</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.760" end="00:27:09.650" style="s2">slightly that all of a sudden became one</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.300" end="00:27:12.560" style="s2">of the most beautiful moments of his</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.650" end="00:27:16.130" style="s2">life which speaks to the idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.560" end="00:27:22.610" style="s2">ultimately the trajectory it&#39;s the goal</p>

<p begin="00:27:22.610" end="00:27:26.390" style="s2">most fundamental I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.710" end="00:27:29.690" style="s2">something even more fundamental there</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.390" end="00:27:32.860" style="s2">and I agree with you I reckon every</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.690" end="00:27:35.930" style="s2">single day each of us is faced with</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.860" end="00:27:41.210" style="s2">three choices and this I think only</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.930" end="00:27:44.510" style="s2">three will will I move forward and grow</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.210" end="00:27:47.610" style="s2">and learn and be a better person and</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.510" end="00:27:51.180" style="s2">make a better contribution today</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.610" end="00:27:52.340" style="s2">or will I stand still or will I go</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.180" end="00:27:55.590" style="s2">backwards</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.340" end="00:27:57.870" style="s2">now that&#39;s a stupid thing to say but</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.590" end="00:28:01.830" style="s2">think of it I reckon there are three</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.870" end="00:28:02.850" style="s2">choices and I reckon we&#39;re faced with</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.830" end="00:28:05.820" style="s2">that every day</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.850" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">now as part of this we&#39;re talking about</p>

<p begin="00:32:14.570" end="00:32:21.919" style="s2">really interesting the the author of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.049" end="00:32:24.020" style="s2">this book traced did DNA tracings around</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.919" end="00:32:27.010" style="s2">the world including with Australian</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.020" end="00:32:31.190" style="s2">Aboriginals and found that they had</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.010" end="00:32:33.169" style="s2">Chinese genes and there were maps that</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.190" end="00:32:36.549" style="s2">have been discovered that Marco Polo</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.169" end="00:32:39.320" style="s2">took back to Europe that the Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.549" end="00:32:41.660" style="s2">certainly discovered most of the west</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.320" end="00:32:45.530" style="s2">coast of Australia and most of the south</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.660" end="00:32:52.010" style="s2">coasts and probably probably Tasmanian</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.530" end="00:32:55.580" style="s2">so the Chinese were here long before the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.010" end="00:32:57.679" style="s2">Europeans who of course being so</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:32:59.480" style="s2">egocentric were the first to discover</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.679" end="00:33:01.700" style="s2">the world and the first and they went to</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.480" end="00:33:03.559" style="s2">America as well long before the</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.700" end="00:33:06.410" style="s2">Europeans now what&#39;s the point of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.559" end="00:33:09.950" style="s2">story the point is that out of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.410" end="00:33:13.520" style="s2">ignorant are in the medieval a in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.950" end="00:33:16.040" style="s2">medieval world these flat maps so-called</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.520" end="00:33:21.340" style="s2">used to have a big landmass down south</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.040" end="00:33:25.850" style="s2">and it was called anybody know Terra</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.340" end="00:33:29.540" style="s2">Australis incognita in Latin which means</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.850" end="00:33:32.929" style="s2">the great unknown Southland but the</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.540" end="00:33:36.260" style="s2">notion was that we had to set off in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.929" end="00:33:40.429" style="s2">ships and find this unknown Southland</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.260" end="00:33:43.669" style="s2">and I&#39;m telling this story because most</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.429" end="00:33:48.919" style="s2">of us seem to believe that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.669" end="00:33:52.010" style="s2">search for our purpose but I want to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.919" end="00:33:56.000" style="s2">that there are two purposes that we are</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.010" end="00:33:58.820" style="s2">given at birth and for purposes that we</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.000" end="00:34:03.640" style="s2">need to create so it&#39;s not a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.820" end="00:34:07.250" style="s2">the search for meaning it&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.640" end="00:34:10.310" style="s2">deciding what our meaning is what our</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.250" end="00:34:11.990" style="s2">purpose is as any particular time now</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.310" end="00:34:14.629" style="s2">I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.990" end="00:34:16.700" style="s2">suddenly been transported to one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.629" end="00:34:19.040" style="s2">those great South American countries</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.700" end="00:34:21.460" style="s2">like Peru or wherever where they have</p>

<p begin="00:34:21.460" end="00:34:26.139" style="s2">I&#39;d like you to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.379" end="00:34:30.549" style="s2">that you find yourself waking up on a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.139" end="00:34:36.700" style="s2">plateau and when you wake up you look to</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.549" end="00:34:39.519" style="s2">the left and there are two mountains two</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.700" end="00:34:41.529" style="s2">mountains of equal size when you look to</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.519" end="00:34:47.019" style="s2">the right you find that there are four</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.529" end="00:34:50.019" style="s2">mountains of of equal size and in your</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.019" end="00:34:52.389" style="s2">mystical state because you are in a</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.019" end="00:34:53.859" style="s2">sense of transcendence or something</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.389" end="00:34:57.430" style="s2">you&#39;ve probably been taking a few</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.859" end="00:35:01.049" style="s2">chemicals in this state an ancient</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.430" end="00:35:04.029" style="s2">princess appears to you and quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.049" end="00:35:09.039" style="s2">unusually she&#39;s able to communicate with</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.029" end="00:35:13.119" style="s2">you by thought transfer and she knows</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.039" end="00:35:16.269" style="s2">that what you are seeking for is to</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.119" end="00:35:19.109" style="s2">clarify your purpose whatever it might</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.269" end="00:35:21.970" style="s2">be at this particular point in time and</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.109" end="00:35:25.930" style="s2">she points to the two mountains to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.970" end="00:35:30.099" style="s2">left and she says first of all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.930" end="00:35:33.039" style="s2">purposes were given to you at birth the</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.099" end="00:35:35.160" style="s2">first one over there is the God purpose</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.039" end="00:35:37.599" style="s2">now you can call at many names</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.160" end="00:35:41.589" style="s2">scientists say we actually have a god</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.599" end="00:35:45.039" style="s2">gene which is a gene that is searching</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.589" end="00:35:48.549" style="s2">for a higher being and we go right back</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.039" end="00:35:51.009" style="s2">into all the earliest civilizations and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.549" end="00:35:54.220" style="s2">we find that every one of them had a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.009" end="00:35:57.309" style="s2">sense of art and a sense of-of a world</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.220" end="00:36:00.210" style="s2">beyond and things were buried with with</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.309" end="00:36:04.089" style="s2">people going right back 10,000 years</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.210" end="00:36:10.269" style="s2">so the first purpose that we are all</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.089" end="00:36:14.589" style="s2">given is to have some belief in a God or</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.269" end="00:36:18.069" style="s2">a being or a transcendence now we will</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.589" end="00:36:20.470" style="s2">translate that in many ways but this</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.069" end="00:36:24.039" style="s2">voice tells you that you cannot live a</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.470" end="00:36:28.569" style="s2">meaningful purpose life unless you have</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.039" end="00:36:30.430" style="s2">some sense of a life beyond a life</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.569" end="00:36:34.509" style="s2">that&#39;s different a life that compared</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.430" end="00:36:37.000" style="s2">transcendence a spirit a being a God you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.509" end="00:36:39.490" style="s2">call it any damn thing you like</p>

<p begin="00:36:42.580" end="00:36:49.420" style="s2">then this voice says over here is the</p>

<p begin="00:36:49.420" end="00:36:55.810" style="s2">single animal is going that is that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.000" end="00:36:58.750" style="s2">are born it is an expectation that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.810" end="00:37:00.730" style="s2">will find a partner or multiple partners</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.750" end="00:37:02.500" style="s2">you will have as much sex as you</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.730" end="00:37:04.410" style="s2">possibly can manage until you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.500" end="00:37:08.290" style="s2">exhausted and then you&#39;ll do it again</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.410" end="00:37:11.170" style="s2">and you will have some children you will</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.290" end="00:37:12.760" style="s2">raise those children and you will create</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.170" end="00:37:15.550" style="s2">for them a better life than the one</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.760" end="00:37:18.550" style="s2">you&#39;ve had yourself that is an innate</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.550" end="00:37:21.220" style="s2">biological purpose that we all have and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.550" end="00:37:23.850" style="s2">whether the we&#39;re gay or transgender or</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.220" end="00:37:26.140" style="s2">bisexual or whatever the hell we are</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.850" end="00:37:30.000" style="s2">unless we somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.140" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">work through that notion of family</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.000" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2">creating something having children of</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:41.440" style="s2">some sort whether that&#39;s kids that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.650" end="00:37:45.160" style="s2">mentor and because both of my kids are</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.440" end="00:37:49.150" style="s2">adopted and now I have one only not two</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.160" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">I work that that that through by</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.150" end="00:37:54.670" style="s2">mentoring and having people that that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:57.670" style="s2">are my children that that I mentor and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.670" end="00:38:00.130" style="s2">every single one of us has to work that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.670" end="00:38:01.150" style="s2">purpose through it&#39;s part of what it</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.130" end="00:38:04.780" style="s2">means to be human</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.150" end="00:38:09.900" style="s2">right okay so what I&#39;m hearing there is</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.780" end="00:38:13.300" style="s2">we innately have this connection to some</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.900" end="00:38:16.090" style="s2">transcend transcendence yes source yes</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.300" end="00:38:22.570" style="s2">and then we feel the need to participate</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.090" end="00:38:24.880" style="s2">in furthering that source by its</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.570" end="00:38:29.440" style="s2">engaging in some kind of co-creative</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.880" end="00:38:32.680" style="s2">manifestation of that source so igniting</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.440" end="00:38:41.200" style="s2">in other people how to properly develop</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.680" end="00:38:42.670" style="s2">in light of well by the light of that by</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.200" end="00:38:46.390" style="s2">that first purpose but that&#39;s way too</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.670" end="00:38:47.920" style="s2">vague and sorry it&#39;s interesting I can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.390" end="00:38:49.910" style="s2">remember there any of their names at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.920" end="00:38:53.420" style="s2">moment I&#39;ve already had a drink but</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.910" end="00:38:56.060" style="s2">some of the great atheists who spend</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.420" end="00:38:59.120" style="s2">their whole life proving there is no</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.060" end="00:39:01.580" style="s2">other transcendental state or being or</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.120" end="00:39:05.390" style="s2">God or call him see it whatever you like</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.580" end="00:39:07.430" style="s2">they actually do believe in God they</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.390" end="00:39:09.590" style="s2">just spend so much because if you if</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.430" end="00:39:13.730" style="s2">you&#39;re absolutely convinced there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.590" end="00:39:15.740" style="s2">God or no other existence why the fuck</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.730" end="00:39:19.070" style="s2">do you keep arguing about it just get on</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.740" end="00:39:21.260" style="s2">with your living so they&#39;re they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.070" end="00:39:24.250" style="s2">of you know they&#39;re involved in it</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.260" end="00:39:26.930" style="s2">so then there&#39;s there&#39;s four others and</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.250" end="00:39:29.930" style="s2">the first one we&#39;ve there on the right</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.930" end="00:39:33.530" style="s2">zone and these are the terror Australis</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.930" end="00:39:37.360" style="s2">incognita they&#39;re there they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.530" end="00:39:41.360" style="s2">there to be created because they exist</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.360" end="00:39:45.710" style="s2">they are there for us to consciously</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.360" end="00:39:50.180" style="s2">choose at this time in our life we will</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.710" end="00:39:54.080" style="s2">embrace the first two are Givens the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.180" end="00:39:55.970" style="s2">next four are choice and the first one</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.080" end="00:39:58.870" style="s2">is we&#39;ve touched on another touch first</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.970" end="00:40:02.030" style="s2">on the notion of self actualization</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.870" end="00:40:05.560" style="s2">individuation becoming the best human</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.030" end="00:40:09.290" style="s2">being that we are able to be to grow</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.560" end="00:40:11.960" style="s2">expressing gratitude every day and to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.290" end="00:40:16.250" style="s2">keep getting better and different and</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.960" end="00:40:19.910" style="s2">enlarged and becoming the expressing our</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.250" end="00:40:23.390" style="s2">entelechy expressing the potential that</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.910" end="00:40:27.380" style="s2">we were born with the next one is the</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.390" end="00:40:29.300" style="s2">notion that I don&#39;t believe we God</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.380" end="00:40:32.120" style="s2">created us I don&#39;t believe there is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.300" end="00:40:36.580" style="s2">God personally but I believe that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.120" end="00:40:41.060" style="s2">create God in our image and the most</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.580" end="00:40:43.550" style="s2">amazing emotion or expression that we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.060" end="00:40:48.020" style="s2">ever been able to come up with is love</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.550" end="00:40:53.450" style="s2">and so so hang on a second so we came up</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.020" end="00:40:57.590" style="s2">with love I know love is the most the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.450" end="00:41:01.010" style="s2">strongest emotion desire value that we</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.590" end="00:41:03.440" style="s2">can think of and that&#39;s why we have</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.010" end="00:41:07.760" style="s2">invented and said God</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.440" end="00:41:10.250" style="s2">god is love so we&#39;ve created God in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.760" end="00:41:13.099" style="s2">best image that we can think of which is</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.250" end="00:41:14.750" style="s2">love so it seems to me that love has to</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.099" end="00:41:18.980" style="s2">be connected though to that initial</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.750" end="00:41:23.960" style="s2">source you&#39;re referring to the first one</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.980" end="00:41:28.069" style="s2">yes it does but I guess I&#39;ve misled us</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.960" end="00:41:31.089" style="s2">here what I&#39;m saying is that the the</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.069" end="00:41:33.829" style="s2">next purpose that we need to choose is</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.089" end="00:41:37.940" style="s2">centered around the notion of love and</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.829" end="00:41:40.250" style="s2">relationship love in all its forms the</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.940" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">Greek we only use one word for love the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.250" end="00:41:47.089" style="s2">Greeks had three words</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:50.030" style="s2">Agatha Fillion and I got ahead of divine</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.089" end="00:41:53.839" style="s2">love brotherly love and sexual love but</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.030" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">but the next purpose that is fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.839" end="00:42:00.470" style="s2">to all of us is to love and be loving</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">and without that without that as a core</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.470" end="00:42:08.690" style="s2">purpose we are not human we&#39;re something</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:11.300" style="s2">else we become beasts you okay so on</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.690" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">this side three purposes the first is to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.300" end="00:42:15.829" style="s2">be the best human being we can be to</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">grow the second one is to love and be</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.829" end="00:42:20.930" style="s2">loving and to create meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:23.990" style="s2">purposeful wonderful relationships</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.930" end="00:42:26.000" style="s2">singular or plural or you know being</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.990" end="00:42:29.300" style="s2">polygamous or whatever we need to be to</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.000" end="00:42:31.910" style="s2">do that the third the third and final</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.300" end="00:42:34.280" style="s2">one and this is becoming more important</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.910" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">and especially it&#39;s becoming important</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.280" end="00:42:40.910" style="s2">to the Millennials the people who are</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:43.819" style="s2">under 36 and that is the desire to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.910" end="00:42:47.450" style="s2">some good in the world to leave the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.819" end="00:42:50.000" style="s2">world better than we found it to create</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.450" end="00:42:53.510" style="s2">something bigger better than brighter</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.000" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">than us now I say there are six because</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.510" end="00:43:00.470" style="s2">so far I&#39;ve only found five fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:02.660" style="s2">purposes that everybody lives by but</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.470" end="00:43:04.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve put a six in there because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.660" end="00:43:06.670" style="s2">know everything I&#39;m sure there are some</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.880" end="00:43:11.270" style="s2">ones in this room that&#39;ll say after me</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.670" end="00:43:14.270" style="s2">this one so I&#39;m willing to learn so 6 is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.270" end="00:43:16.049" style="s2">the Terra Australis incognito the one I</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.270" end="00:43:19.259" style="s2">don&#39;t know about okay</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.049" end="00:43:24.119" style="s2">but this is what&#39;s important all of</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.259" end="00:43:29.549" style="s2">those six mountains of equal size and</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.119" end="00:43:34.259" style="s2">our equal value right now your choice is</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.549" end="00:43:38.299" style="s2">to climb one mountain being right now</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.259" end="00:43:41.009" style="s2">the predominant mountain of the six and</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.299" end="00:43:46.049" style="s2">from that mountain you are going to</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.009" end="00:43:50.189" style="s2">embrace the other five so for me at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.049" end="00:43:55.019" style="s2">moment it is too since my son died it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.189" end="00:43:58.199" style="s2">to do some good in the world and from</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.019" end="00:44:02.309" style="s2">that I am able to embrace my spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.199" end="00:44:04.979" style="s2">purpose my family purpose my loving</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.309" end="00:44:08.009" style="s2">purpose my personal growth purpose and</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.979" end="00:44:10.619" style="s2">whatever else might come along I hope</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.009" end="00:44:14.339" style="s2">that makes sense to you because we need</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.619" end="00:44:17.130" style="s2">to create and choose our purpose it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.339" end="00:44:21.179" style="s2">not out there waiting for us and we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.130" end="00:44:24.689" style="s2">to search it right now you tonight say</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.179" end="00:44:27.959" style="s2">of those six this is the one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.689" end="00:44:33.420" style="s2">preeminent and I will embrace the others</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.959" end="00:44:37.079" style="s2">from that mountaintop well that was um</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.420" end="00:44:39.089" style="s2">that was a monologue wasn&#39;t it sorry</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.079" end="00:44:44.640" style="s2">about that there was no there was very</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.089" end="00:44:50.069" style="s2">interesting I guess honestly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.640" end="00:44:54.809" style="s2">for me those purposes are all linked and</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.069" end="00:45:01.859" style="s2">they are we could you know each them</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.809" end="00:45:04.529" style="s2">apart in many different ways you know so</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.859" end="00:45:09.739" style="s2">rather than do that exactly I thought</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.529" end="00:45:12.239" style="s2">maybe I might ask about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.739" end="00:45:17.189" style="s2">foundational transformative experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.239" end="00:45:21.079" style="s2">in your life that have been very</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.189" end="00:45:23.429" style="s2">important in building your capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.079" end="00:45:25.189" style="s2">relate to the world like this and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.429" end="00:45:27.660" style="s2">spoken about one of them but I know that</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.189" end="00:45:29.730" style="s2">your past you have had a series of</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.660" end="00:45:32.550" style="s2">shamanic experiences</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.730" end="00:45:39.869" style="s2">yes that works sorry that were pivotal</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.550" end="00:45:44.190" style="s2">in the finding a new purpose so is there</p>

<p begin="00:45:47.490" end="00:45:56.180" style="s2">should say also as well what a shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.210" end="00:46:02.490" style="s2">experience I think is is the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.180" end="00:46:05.570" style="s2">intermediation between transpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.490" end="00:46:09.510" style="s2">domain of consciousness and ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.570" end="00:46:14.820" style="s2">conscious States which is quite a</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.510" end="00:46:17.490" style="s2">confusing idea because it involves</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.820" end="00:46:24.150" style="s2">relinquishing a certain way of relating</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.490" end="00:46:27.330" style="s2">to what you are and demands of you at</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.150" end="00:46:31.560" style="s2">capacity to navigate your own internal</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.330" end="00:46:35.760" style="s2">experience using in a way a different</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.560" end="00:46:40.350" style="s2">set of tools because it&#39;s not so much an</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.760" end="00:46:42.869" style="s2">intellectual process as it is orienting</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.350" end="00:46:46.800" style="s2">in experience and again discerning</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.869" end="00:46:49.440" style="s2">between qualities and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.800" end="00:46:51.090" style="s2">something that&#39;s not it&#39;s becoming more</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.440" end="00:46:53.190" style="s2">common to talk about this stuff but I</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.090" end="00:46:56.580" style="s2">think in ordinary life is something that</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.190" end="00:46:59.960" style="s2">eludes our comprehension quite easily</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.580" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">and the reason for that is we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.960" end="00:47:04.890" style="s2">remarkably concerned with the external</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">world and we take a lot of the internal</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.890" end="00:47:10.050" style="s2">world for granted which is to say we</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:13.680" style="s2">take a lot of the unconscious components</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.050" end="00:47:16.859" style="s2">of our psyche for granted now commonly</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.680" end="00:47:18.390" style="s2">people might well we we dream most every</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.859" end="00:47:20.369" style="s2">night some people remember them some</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.390" end="00:47:23.550" style="s2">don&#39;t and what happens in dreams is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.369" end="00:47:24.840" style="s2">projection of the unconscious content at</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.550" end="00:47:28.710" style="s2">least a selection of unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.840" end="00:47:29.609" style="s2">contents into well consciousness sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.710" end="00:47:32.220" style="s2">but it&#39;s a different sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.609" end="00:47:35.000" style="s2">consciousness the question is what the</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.220" end="00:47:38.510" style="s2">hell is going on there and and</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.000" end="00:47:42.560" style="s2">how how can you draw any meaning from</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.510" end="00:47:47.180" style="s2">such experiences at all now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.560" end="00:47:51.980" style="s2">difficult to link the meaning of dreams</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.180" end="00:47:54.620" style="s2">to where we are without again speaking</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.980" end="00:47:57.230" style="s2">about psychology in the work of Carl</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.620" end="00:47:58.820" style="s2">Jung and the conception of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.230" end="00:48:03.170" style="s2">archetypes of the collective unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.820" end="00:48:06.170" style="s2">which is something like an innate set of</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.170" end="00:48:10.070" style="s2">patterns which are also the filtration</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.170" end="00:48:12.200" style="s2">mechanism for meaning these are a</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.070" end="00:48:15.860" style="s2">collection of patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.200" end="00:48:17.270" style="s2">analogous to instincts analogous to</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.860" end="00:48:20.000" style="s2">physiological instincts they are</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.270" end="00:48:24.430" style="s2">instincts of the psyche but again also a</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.000" end="00:48:29.240" style="s2">filtration mechanism for the mind as it</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.430" end="00:48:31.430" style="s2">relates to the world so what we</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.240" end="00:48:36.380" style="s2">experience is fed through this pattern</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.430" end="00:48:38.240" style="s2">recognition and it rises up as a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.380" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">spontaneous selection of symbols that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.240" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">array themselves in narrative something</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:46.820" style="s2">like this now many people here will be</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:49.970" style="s2">familiar with psychedelic experience and</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.820" end="00:48:52.100" style="s2">some may even have been to far-off</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.970" end="00:48:54.500" style="s2">parts of the world or perhaps closer to</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.100" end="00:48:57.500" style="s2">home where you can have experiences that</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.500" end="00:49:01.160" style="s2">are mediated by a guide or perhaps not</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.500" end="00:49:07.490" style="s2">and they&#39;re very very strange and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.160" end="00:49:09.950" style="s2">involve in some sense the apparition of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.490" end="00:49:16.220" style="s2">unconscious contents into the conscious</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.950" end="00:49:18.650" style="s2">life now the unconscious contents are</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.220" end="00:49:23.810" style="s2">you as well as the conscious life is you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.650" end="00:49:26.270" style="s2">and they reflect where you are and what</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.810" end="00:49:26.450" style="s2">you&#39;re doing and where are we going with</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.270" end="00:49:28.910" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.450" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">where we are going is to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.910" end="00:49:33.830" style="s2">your shamanic experiences but just to</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:37.880" style="s2">provide I suppose a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.830" end="00:49:41.670" style="s2">background into how to understand what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.880" end="00:49:43.650" style="s2">going on in an experience where</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.670" end="00:49:45.619" style="s2">well I know for instance that in one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.650" end="00:49:48.680" style="s2">your shamanic experiences you</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.619" end="00:49:54.049" style="s2">encountered a shaman an old wise man</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.680" end="00:49:58.769" style="s2">right and this was a well perhaps I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.049" end="00:50:00.750" style="s2">let you tell the story but look you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.769" end="00:50:03.000" style="s2">opening up a real can of oils with the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.750" end="00:50:06.630" style="s2">shamanic experience it&#39;s weird to most</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.000" end="00:50:08.910" style="s2">of us ah it&#39;s it&#39;s a world that is</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.630" end="00:50:12.269" style="s2">similar to the psychedelic world without</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.910" end="00:50:14.220" style="s2">drugs or can be but I guess and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.269" end="00:50:16.140" style="s2">happy to talk about it but I guess I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.220" end="00:50:19.680" style="s2">little bit interested whether there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.140" end="00:50:23.369" style="s2">any comments or questions from the group</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.680" end="00:50:24.569" style="s2">so I&#39;ll just say yeah any any time if</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.369" end="00:50:26.369" style="s2">someone wants to ask a particular</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.569" end="00:50:27.660" style="s2">question or felt like there was</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.369" end="00:50:29.190" style="s2">something that was touched on that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.660" end="00:50:34.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t explore that you would like us to</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.190" end="00:50:36.779" style="s2">explore please say so at any time just</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.140" end="00:50:38.369" style="s2">let the silent sit for a few seconds now</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.779" end="00:50:40.700" style="s2">and in case anybody feels like saying</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.369" end="00:50:40.700" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.299" end="00:50:46.760" style="s2">it looks like Neville it&#39;s not going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.200" end="00:50:46.760" style="s2">be able to dodge talking about shamanism</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.420" end="00:50:56.700" style="s2">okay just very briefly the shamans are</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.329" end="00:51:02.519" style="s2">amazing people that arose in medic</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.700" end="00:51:05.460" style="s2">tribes before the great I unilateral God</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.519" end="00:51:10.410" style="s2">religions of Judaism Christianity Islam</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.460" end="00:51:14.730" style="s2">took over the world they were tried</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.410" end="00:51:18.259" style="s2">tribal chief makers they were dancers</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.730" end="00:51:21.809" style="s2">they were physicians and healers and</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.259" end="00:51:27.619" style="s2">I&#39;ve had many many experiences as an</p>

<p begin="00:51:27.619" end="00:51:36.839" style="s2">fasting and certain types of music that</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.180" end="00:51:42.779" style="s2">changed brain patterns the background is</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.839" end="00:51:47.339" style="s2">that I was born and bred a evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.779" end="00:51:50.009" style="s2">Christian which was a whole series of</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.339" end="00:51:54.089" style="s2">don&#39;ts I was saying to someone one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.009" end="00:51:54.990" style="s2">them one of the the messages we used to</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.089" end="00:51:57.900" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.990" end="00:52:00.260" style="s2">you must not dance because dancing is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.900" end="00:52:03.930" style="s2">vertical expression of a horizontal</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.260" end="00:52:06.030" style="s2">intention and I have since learned that</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.930" end="00:52:10.110" style="s2">that&#39;s absolutely true so I do as much</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.030" end="00:52:12.720" style="s2">dancing as I possibly can but the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.110" end="00:52:15.000" style="s2">religion I was raised in was don&#39;t do</p>

<p begin="00:52:26.700" end="00:52:33.540" style="s2">was it was a religion of don&#39;t stone</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.369" end="00:52:35.610" style="s2">stone stones and and and I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.540" end="00:52:39.060" style="s2">raised with the feeling that my inner</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.610" end="00:52:41.940" style="s2">life was so dirty and dark and devious</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.060" end="00:52:46.860" style="s2">and full of demons that you should not</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.940" end="00:52:50.010" style="s2">go there but through these experiences</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.860" end="00:52:53.220" style="s2">of transcendental going down deep inside</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.010" end="00:52:56.369" style="s2">myself the very first one after going</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.220" end="00:53:00.960" style="s2">down for layers being led by a very</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.369" end="00:53:04.830" style="s2">skilled person I found an old man</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.960" end="00:53:08.190" style="s2">a Chinese man with a beard and I stick</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.830" end="00:53:10.020" style="s2">and he said I&#39;m a shaman and at that</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.190" end="00:53:13.050" style="s2">point I never heard of what the word was</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.020" end="00:53:15.030" style="s2">and he took off the cloak that he was</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.050" end="00:53:17.369" style="s2">wearing and you were going through an</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.030" end="00:53:20.010" style="s2">internal experience in an internal yes</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.369" end="00:53:24.960" style="s2">total so it&#39;s like a dream states an</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.010" end="00:53:27.270" style="s2">awake MIDI me mediated meditations and</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.960" end="00:53:28.520" style="s2">what was the experience of moving into</p>

<p begin="00:53:28.520" end="00:53:37.350" style="s2">well transformative because ah it was</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.470" end="00:53:40.020" style="s2">absolutely alien to me to be led into my</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.350" end="00:53:42.300" style="s2">psyche and as I went down into the</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.020" end="00:53:45.150" style="s2">layers instead of finding a dark and</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.300" end="00:53:49.050" style="s2">dirty and devious I found it beautiful I</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.150" end="00:53:54.630" style="s2">found it was full of colors and totems</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.050" end="00:53:58.770" style="s2">and power animals and transcendence and</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.630" end="00:54:02.220" style="s2">States and people from history people</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.770" end="00:54:05.010" style="s2">who were part of my DNA and at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.220" end="00:54:08.460" style="s2">bottom or ancestral kind of experience I</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.010" end="00:54:11.700" style="s2">had a universal global</p>

<p begin="00:54:15.170" end="00:54:20.849" style="s2">vibration it was just I mean I&#39;ve never</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:22.890" style="s2">had a psychedelic experience I assume</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.849" end="00:54:26.130" style="s2">that it was that&#39;s close enough to some</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.890" end="00:54:28.619" style="s2">kinds but did you did you retain a sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.130" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">of your own identity in this experience</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.619" end="00:54:33.869" style="s2">or where you fused with the environment</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:37.920" style="s2">well it was it was like as I was going</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.869" end="00:54:40.109" style="s2">down the layers of my psyche my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.920" end="00:54:43.859" style="s2">self kept changing and as I said I</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.109" end="00:54:47.040" style="s2">started with this view that my inner</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.859" end="00:54:49.440" style="s2">self was dark devious dirty and full of</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.040" end="00:54:52.080" style="s2">demons and to be avoided as I went down</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.440" end="00:54:56.250" style="s2">these layers being led by music and</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.080" end="00:54:57.690" style="s2">meditation I found that that was hog</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.250" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">shit if you&#39;ll excuse the expression</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.690" end="00:55:04.050" style="s2">that inside was like going into an</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:06.690" style="s2">Aladdin&#39;s cave there were treasures</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.050" end="00:55:09.720" style="s2">there were gifts there were there was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.690" end="00:55:11.460" style="s2">potential I never knew and as I said at</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.720" end="00:55:14.760" style="s2">the bottom or you you raised it at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.460" end="00:55:18.080" style="s2">bottom there was this very old Chinese</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.760" end="00:55:24.390" style="s2">man who looked like he was about 800 and</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.080" end="00:55:26.099" style="s2">he had this amazing yellow cloak and he</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.390" end="00:55:28.040" style="s2">took it off and gave it to me as a gift</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.099" end="00:55:31.080" style="s2">and said you&#39;re a shaman</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.040" end="00:55:33.270" style="s2">now as I went back the layers of my</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.080" end="00:55:36.330" style="s2">psyche I couldn&#39;t take this coke cloak</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.270" end="00:55:39.690" style="s2">of course into the real world I had to</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.330" end="00:55:42.210" style="s2">leave it at the top level but it&#39;s there</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.690" end="00:55:44.640" style="s2">at the top of the top level so the top</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.210" end="00:55:46.170" style="s2">level of my psyche right do you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.640" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">deepest or do you mean just when you</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.170" end="00:55:49.980" style="s2">were exiting the states we started at</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:51.900" style="s2">the top of a mountain we knew it down</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.980" end="00:55:53.250" style="s2">down and down and this was right at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.900" end="00:55:54.810" style="s2">bottom and you leave it up to the top</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.250" end="00:55:57.330" style="s2">then we went up and right at the top of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.810" end="00:56:00.030" style="s2">the mountain when I came back into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.330" end="00:56:04.890" style="s2">real world I had to leave the cloak but</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.030" end="00:56:08.990" style="s2">it was there as a transformative thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.890" end="00:56:10.670" style="s2">that I can put on at any time</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.990" end="00:56:11.990" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of beautiful things</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.670" end="00:56:18.020" style="s2">down there but there&#39;s also a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.990" end="00:56:21.710" style="s2">darkness no less far less darkness then</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.020" end="00:56:26.080" style="s2">we have all been taught and far more</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.710" end="00:56:29.140" style="s2">Beauty far more gifts far more jewels</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.080" end="00:56:33.140" style="s2">far more potential</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.140" end="00:56:34.880" style="s2">well there&#39;s untapped potential no doubt</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.140" end="00:56:37.040" style="s2">uncapped I&#39;m anxious</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.880" end="00:56:40.460" style="s2">so you think then we can make sense of</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.040" end="00:56:42.770" style="s2">the very depths of us as being more good</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.460" end="00:56:46.790" style="s2">than they are thought there does not</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.770" end="00:56:49.250" style="s2">need to be a balance yin 9 90% came too</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.790" end="00:56:50.570" style="s2">soon wow that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting I</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.250" end="00:56:53.320" style="s2">don&#39;t think I agree with that</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.570" end="00:56:55.640" style="s2">I mean how how can that be the case</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.320" end="00:56:57.859" style="s2">because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve experienced so</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.640" end="00:56:59.450" style="s2">in so in was this in one experience or</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.859" end="00:57:01.460" style="s2">whether multiple experience it has 10</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.450" end="00:57:04.460" style="s2">years of experience 10 years of</p>

<p begin="00:57:08.180" end="00:57:13.460" style="s2">contents so moving through darkness and</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.430" end="00:57:16.520" style="s2">then there&#39;s just the more bountiful</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.460" end="00:57:18.560" style="s2">treasure&#39; to be found within well I can</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.520" end="00:57:20.690" style="s2">hear you&#39;re leading me but I have to say</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.560" end="00:57:23.900" style="s2">those experiences time and time again</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.690" end="00:57:27.040" style="s2">were never of darkness would never of</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.900" end="00:57:31.820" style="s2">demons they were the opposite and they</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.040" end="00:57:34.280" style="s2">the transformative thing was like you</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.820" end="00:57:37.640" style="s2">imagine a lead in the story of 11 a poor</p>

<p begin="00:58:21.130" end="00:58:27.039" style="s2">but the message for me is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.250" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">more wondrous more amazing more</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.039" end="00:58:31.920" style="s2">fantastic than we have been taught I</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.059" end="00:58:46.869" style="s2">wondrous I definitely don&#39;t want to take</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.609" end="00:58:49.329" style="s2">that perspective but look I&#39;m you asked</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.869" end="00:58:51.430" style="s2">me about my shamanic experiences I can</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.329" end="00:58:53.980" style="s2">only share with what I experienced</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.430" end="00:58:56.470" style="s2">whether that&#39;s universe or I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.980" end="00:58:59.710" style="s2">well no I mean of course I&#39;d love it to</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.470" end="00:59:02.109" style="s2">be I would love that all of us here find</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.710" end="00:59:05.529" style="s2">that we are wondrous joyous fantastic</p>

<p begin="00:59:05.529" end="00:59:10.000" style="s2">and that we fulfilled that potential and</p>

<p begin="00:59:10.000" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">don&#39;t think we can divorce what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.769" end="00:59:16.059" style="s2">experience in your particular shamanic</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:18.400" style="s2">journeys from every other thing you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.059" end="00:59:21.190" style="s2">done in your life and what you&#39;re aiming</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.400" end="00:59:22.509" style="s2">at more you were aiming at then how</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.190" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">would you conducted yourself how you</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.509" end="00:59:28.089" style="s2">conducted yourself in that exploration</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:30.299" style="s2">itself what your intentions were what</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.089" end="00:59:32.980" style="s2">you wanted to achieve in the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.299" end="00:59:35.769" style="s2">broadly speaking the responsibility you</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.980" end="00:59:39.880" style="s2">took for working for the better of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.769" end="00:59:45.809" style="s2">things you know so I mean so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.880" end="00:59:53.920" style="s2">interested in doing is is learning</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.809" end="00:59:56.980" style="s2">what&#39;s most helpful in preparing for any</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.920" end="01:00:03.990" style="s2">sort of exploration whether out into the</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.980" end="01:00:03.990" style="s2">actual world or or within because</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.140" end="01:00:09.460" style="s2">intention is important and the</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.029" end="01:00:13.539" style="s2">congruence between what you want to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.460" end="01:00:17.890" style="s2">in the world and how you treat yourself</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.539" end="01:00:24.609" style="s2">in your experience is crucial yes</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.890" end="01:00:28.720" style="s2">so look it doesn&#39;t make sense to me at</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.609" end="01:00:31.630" style="s2">all that the universe broadly speaking</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.720" end="01:00:34.530" style="s2">can be more good than it is bad I think</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.630" end="01:00:40.740" style="s2">we are faced with this situation of</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.530" end="01:00:46.450" style="s2">essentially more or less immutable flux</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.740" end="01:00:49.870" style="s2">continual harmony balance and we play</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.450" end="01:00:53.590" style="s2">out that capacity in ourselves and we</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.870" end="01:00:56.610" style="s2">have the capacity to choose our way to</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.590" end="01:01:01.920" style="s2">some significant but limited degree</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.610" end="01:01:05.970" style="s2">within the framework of our lives and</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.920" end="01:01:09.430" style="s2">given the interconnected and</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.970" end="01:01:17.440" style="s2">ridiculously long lineage of our entire</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.430" end="01:01:21.580" style="s2">evolutionary history and so I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.440" end="01:01:24.550" style="s2">guess I guess I just do I do have a I do</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.580" end="01:01:27.970" style="s2">have a concern when it comes to</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.550" end="01:01:32.250" style="s2">discussing any sort of transformative</p>

<p begin="01:01:41.680" end="01:01:46.420" style="s2">because if you&#39;re not properly equipped</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.750" end="01:01:48.010" style="s2">you can do yourself lasting damage and</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.420" end="01:01:50.050" style="s2">I&#39;m not trying to create some sort of</p>

<p begin="01:01:56.170" end="01:02:00.820" style="s2">then I might ask what do you think it is</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.240" end="01:02:03.370" style="s2">about how you&#39;ve lived your life how you</p>

<p begin="01:02:05.710" end="01:02:12.540" style="s2">there is treasure within and then we</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.950" end="01:02:15.970" style="s2">look at many many many examples</p>

<p begin="01:02:30.220" end="01:02:38.350" style="s2">potential in us to be that yes but but</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.750" end="01:02:40.900" style="s2">this is about a choice I said I think</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.350" end="01:02:45.790" style="s2">quite clearly for me this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.900" end="01:02:47.410" style="s2">purpose is is not something that a god</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.790" end="01:02:50.349" style="s2">or a</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.410" end="01:02:54.519" style="s2">or whatever give us except for the two</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.349" end="01:02:58.509" style="s2">mountains about a spiritual belief</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.519" end="01:02:59.769" style="s2">system and the biological imperative to</p>
<p begin="01:02:58.509" end="01:03:02.529" style="s2">procreate</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.769" end="01:03:05.369" style="s2">they are Givens everything else is a</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.529" end="01:03:10.359" style="s2">choice and I put it to you like this</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.369" end="01:03:11.170" style="s2">life and human beings go over like most</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.359" end="01:03:14.049" style="s2">of you I&#39;m so sorry</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.170" end="01:03:19.029" style="s2">I stopped you one second this this this</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.049" end="01:03:21.430" style="s2">desire to procreate this desire to to to</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.029" end="01:03:24.210" style="s2">to require that the transcendent I mean</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.430" end="01:03:27.099" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s precisely on in these areas</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.210" end="01:03:29.829" style="s2">that many many people I mean people</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.099" end="01:03:32.619" style="s2">reject these right people many people</p>

<p begin="01:03:37.869" end="01:03:43.569" style="s2">so the question is like and they face a</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.279" end="01:03:45.160" style="s2">consequence of that I&#39;m not saying that</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.569" end="01:03:45.730" style="s2">you have to get married and have</p>

<p begin="01:03:59.769" end="01:04:05.440" style="s2">why don&#39;t people because they make a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.710" end="01:04:06.730" style="s2">choice and because they&#39;re mislead they</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.440" end="01:04:09.759" style="s2">don&#39;t so they&#39;re making so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.730" end="01:04:11.140" style="s2">making a choice bites but ok so I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:04:21.609" end="01:04:25.539" style="s2">only have to look what&#39;s happened in</p>

<p begin="01:04:33.519" end="01:04:40.390" style="s2">capable as human beings of the most</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.690" end="01:04:43.269" style="s2">incredible awful unbelievable</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.390" end="01:04:48.000" style="s2">godforsaken atrocious atrocities we&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:53.650" style="s2">wondrous things now I think we have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.759" end="01:04:56.680" style="s2">choice which universe we live in</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.650" end="01:05:00.630" style="s2">yes that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a choice</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.680" end="01:05:04.230" style="s2">I can choose to follow the darkness</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.630" end="01:05:08.310" style="s2">I can choose to be a rotten human being</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.230" end="01:05:08.820" style="s2">I can choose to do dirt on other human</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.310" end="01:05:11.910" style="s2">beings</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.820" end="01:05:14.610" style="s2">I can choose to beat up my wife right</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.910" end="01:05:17.340" style="s2">that&#39;s a choice I I know I know so that</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.610" end="01:05:20.190" style="s2">sorry what is the better choice to go</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.340" end="01:05:22.230" style="s2">that way or to go this way well I think</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.190" end="01:05:23.550" style="s2">I think everyone I mean almost everyone</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.230" end="01:05:25.290" style="s2">would agree with that I guess the</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.550" end="01:05:28.650" style="s2">problem is is that people don&#39;t a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.290" end="01:05:31.560" style="s2">people don&#39;t feel like they can of</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.650" end="01:05:37.500" style="s2">course they don&#39;t but but we do we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.560" end="01:05:41.070" style="s2">a choice so I so I&#39;m interested in what</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.500" end="01:05:44.190" style="s2">it is that people lose connection to in</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.070" end="01:05:46.950" style="s2">a in a in a pre in a precognitive way I</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.190" end="01:05:48.360" style="s2">have no idea I cannot tell you well only</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.950" end="01:05:50.130" style="s2">but that&#39;s that&#39;s why that&#39;s why the</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.360" end="01:05:51.930" style="s2">that&#39;s why understanding the process of</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.130" end="01:05:54.390" style="s2">engaging with the shamanic journey I</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.930" end="01:05:56.100" style="s2">think is so interesting because the way</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.390" end="01:05:58.710" style="s2">to orient in that space is not</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.100" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">intellectually so the question is when</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.710" end="01:06:02.460" style="s2">you are in that place of Darkness and</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.950" style="s2">you&#39;re moving down the mountain to use</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.460" end="01:06:06.870" style="s2">your own metaphor like how do you hold</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.950" end="01:06:08.850" style="s2">that space and move into it with the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.870" end="01:06:12.060" style="s2">right intention right you make the</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.850" end="01:06:14.520" style="s2">choice do you follow the darkness or do</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.060" end="01:06:16.560" style="s2">you follow the light do you follow the</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.520" end="01:06:18.840" style="s2">negative energy or do you follow the</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.560" end="01:06:21.180" style="s2">positive energy and every single one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.840" end="01:06:25.500" style="s2">us are faced with that every day</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.180" end="01:06:28.620" style="s2">do I choose today to grow to be better</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.500" end="01:06:31.200" style="s2">to add kindness to the world to make the</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.620" end="01:06:34.050" style="s2">world better do I choose just to stand</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.200" end="01:06:37.380" style="s2">still or do I choose to go backwards and</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.050" end="01:06:39.690" style="s2">embrace negativity you know things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.380" end="01:06:42.450" style="s2">are not so good that&#39;s the choice you</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.690" end="01:06:46.860" style="s2">and I every one of us are presented with</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.450" end="01:06:48.690" style="s2">every single moment of our lives yes I</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.860" end="01:06:50.580" style="s2">mean I agree there&#39;s there&#39;s things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.690" end="01:06:56.160" style="s2">complicate this process though one of</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.580" end="01:07:00.000" style="s2">them is immense fear but I can choose to</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.160" end="01:07:02.190" style="s2">give in to fear you know I can choose to</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.000" end="01:07:06.840" style="s2">be annihilated when my son kills himself</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.190" end="01:07:09.210" style="s2">and be overwhelmed by existential guilt</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.840" end="01:07:12.360" style="s2">you know why wasn&#39;t I a good enough</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.210" end="01:07:15.440" style="s2">parent and father to stop this suicide</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.360" end="01:07:18.480" style="s2">what I could choose to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.440" end="01:07:22.650" style="s2">look III do agree with you I do agree</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:29.670" style="s2">with you I I guess I&#39;m trying to get to</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.650" end="01:07:34.140" style="s2">a place and use language that sorry look</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.670" end="01:07:39.900" style="s2">I think the issue today is that many of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.140" end="01:07:44.310" style="s2">us do not want to make life happen we</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.900" end="01:07:45.090" style="s2">want to let it happen and letting life</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.310" end="01:07:48.750" style="s2">happen</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.090" end="01:07:53.220" style="s2">I believe leads to the darkness the dark</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.750" end="01:07:55.830" style="s2">side hmm that&#39;s interesting so letting</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.220" end="01:07:57.540" style="s2">life happen I mean so we want to</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.830" end="01:07:59.700" style="s2">distinguish again should make we had</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.540" end="01:08:01.980" style="s2">happen yep we want to distinguish two</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.700" end="01:08:04.290" style="s2">kinds of letting life happen there one</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.980" end="01:08:08.220" style="s2">which would be the positive sense which</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.290" end="01:08:12.210" style="s2">is paying attention to the experience in</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.220" end="01:08:15.660" style="s2">front of you right being able to look</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.210" end="01:08:20.550" style="s2">and observe and pay attention before</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.660" end="01:08:24.060" style="s2">immediately reacting precisely and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.550" end="01:08:27.450" style="s2">there&#39;s a letting things happen to you</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.060" end="01:08:30.690" style="s2">that as you go along with whatever the</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.450" end="01:08:34.220" style="s2">flow is without you engaging that</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.690" end="01:08:36.870" style="s2">capacity to discern and have agency and</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.220" end="01:08:43.800" style="s2">enact agency on the basis of that</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.870" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">discernment between quality so so I mean</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.800" end="01:08:52.320" style="s2">I I want I do want to talk about fear</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:55.350" style="s2">because I think fear is a thick veil at</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.320" end="01:08:58.110" style="s2">the moment in well I think it has been</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.350" end="01:09:00.090" style="s2">of necessity throughout the entire</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.110" end="01:09:02.400" style="s2">course of human history because we have</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.090" end="01:09:05.070" style="s2">this very precious thing that we come</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.400" end="01:09:10.710" style="s2">innate with which is this drive to live</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.070" end="01:09:12.450" style="s2">that I believe resides in a spiritual</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.710" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">base and by spiritual I mean something</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.450" end="01:09:17.100" style="s2">fundamental that we participate in which</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:18.660" style="s2">on this view is something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.100" end="01:09:22.170" style="s2">consciousness so consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.660" end="01:09:25.110" style="s2">fundamental that means our consciousness</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.170" end="01:09:27.300" style="s2">is of a kind with what is fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.110" end="01:09:28.270" style="s2">the capacity to discern between</p>

<p begin="01:09:28.270" end="01:09:37.210" style="s2">in our conscious experience is therefore</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.960" end="01:09:41.740" style="s2">related somehow to what&#39;s going on at a</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.210" end="01:09:43.510" style="s2">very fundamental level our capacity to</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.740" end="01:09:46.029" style="s2">orient their foreign consciousness is</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.510" end="01:09:53.950" style="s2">involved in the creation of continued</p>

<p begin="01:09:53.950" end="01:10:03.220" style="s2">are finite and growth and movement and</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.010" end="01:10:05.740" style="s2">change is all one at and individuality</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.220" end="01:10:09.310" style="s2">and identity is all one at the price of</p>

<p begin="01:10:16.270" end="01:10:18.640" style="s2">we&#39;ll just let me I have to I have to</p>

<p begin="01:13:39.400" end="01:13:47.140" style="s2">animal or the internal state of just</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.070" end="01:13:50.650" style="s2">simply fighting it denying it have it a</p>

<p begin="01:13:50.650" end="01:13:55.930" style="s2">there are at least five other options</p>

<p begin="01:13:55.930" end="01:14:01.060" style="s2">to bunker down and wait till it goes</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.110" end="01:14:04.090" style="s2">away and a lot of people are doing that</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.060" end="01:14:06.790" style="s2">that&#39;s a response another way is to be</p>

<p begin="01:14:48.700" end="01:14:58.330" style="s2">next response is is innovate change a</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.710" end="01:15:01.120" style="s2">transformation so like we are not</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.330" end="01:15:03.100" style="s2">actually rational human beings the</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.120" end="01:15:07.090" style="s2">notion that we are rational is bullshit</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.100" end="01:15:10.000" style="s2">we know from imaging that virtually all</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.090" end="01:15:13.060" style="s2">data there comes to us from the external</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.000" end="01:15:15.520" style="s2">world goes to the central part of the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.060" end="01:15:18.250" style="s2">brain which is the I called them a</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.520" end="01:15:21.040" style="s2">million brain the horse brain where all</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.250" end="01:15:23.350" style="s2">the emotions lie and it&#39;s mixed with all</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.040" end="01:15:28.680" style="s2">sorts of emotions like fear like anger</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.350" end="01:15:33.190" style="s2">like like positivity when we we face a</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.680" end="01:15:36.640" style="s2">negative emotion and we consciously</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.190" end="01:15:40.030" style="s2">using consciousness awareness we replace</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.640" end="01:15:42.340" style="s2">it with a different emotion you know I</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.030" end="01:15:45.670" style="s2">can do this this is overwhelming but</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.340" end="01:15:49.530" style="s2">I&#39;ll face it I&#39;ll learn from it as soon</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.670" end="01:15:49.530" style="s2">as we do that the fear goes away</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.919" end="01:16:04.199" style="s2">but we don&#39;t just have fight or flight</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.579" end="01:16:09.510" style="s2">as our responses so before immediately</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.199" end="01:16:14.309" style="s2">responding we can pay attention and</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.510" end="01:16:16.380" style="s2">recognize other options yes okay and the</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.309" end="01:16:19.619" style="s2">more we practice that and the more we</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.380" end="01:16:21.570" style="s2">practice gratitude the more options we</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.619" end="01:16:23.070" style="s2">discover right the link between</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.570" end="01:16:25.349" style="s2">gratitude and options would be very</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.070" end="01:16:27.239" style="s2">interesting but we are at 9:30 now and</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.349" end="01:16:31.409" style="s2">I&#39;m conscious of people&#39;s time we said</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.239" end="01:16:34.349" style="s2">we&#39;d speak to about now maybe we&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.409" end="01:16:38.429" style="s2">take five five minutes or so and wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.349" end="01:16:40.829" style="s2">and then I&#39;m happy to have you know any</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.429" end="01:16:43.829" style="s2">questions asked if anyone wants to wants</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.829" end="01:16:46.289" style="s2">to ask a question it&#39;s a Nevil or about</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.829" end="01:16:57.439" style="s2">what we&#39;ve discussed was that hand at</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.289" end="01:17:17.789" style="s2">the back had people not being what sorry</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.439" end="01:17:20.159" style="s2">people not being okay yes yep right okay</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.789" end="01:17:21.959" style="s2">so the question was how do you define a</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.159" end="01:17:24.090" style="s2">good community and what advice would you</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.959" end="01:17:26.849" style="s2">have for someone who wants to find a</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.090" end="01:17:29.869" style="s2">community right that&#39;s a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:17:26.849" end="01:17:29.869" style="s2">question has had</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.130" end="01:17:48.650" style="s2">I guess the simple answer is start</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.220" end="01:17:48.650" style="s2">simply relating to everybody you meet</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.850" end="01:17:58.470" style="s2">seven years ago I used to go to a I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.340" end="01:18:01.200" style="s2">not a party animal my wife used to be a</p>
<p begin="01:17:58.470" end="01:18:03.150" style="s2">myers-briggs person and she used to ask</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.200" end="01:18:05.850" style="s2">me generally she&#39;d say I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.150" end="01:18:09.900" style="s2">whether you&#39;re an INFP or an ESTJ and</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.850" end="01:18:11.880" style="s2">the answer is on both I but I&#39;ve learned</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.900" end="01:18:15.120" style="s2">to be an extrovert I&#39;m really an</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.880" end="01:18:18.150" style="s2">introvert and I would go to parties and</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.120" end="01:18:20.910" style="s2">I&#39;d be overwhelmed by the community the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.150" end="01:18:23.580" style="s2">all the people there so what I would do</p>
<p begin="01:18:20.910" end="01:18:27.060" style="s2">would grab a plate of hors d&#39;oeuvres or</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.580" end="01:18:29.520" style="s2">whatever and I would go round and I</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.060" end="01:18:31.980" style="s2">would share the hors d&#39;oeuvres and have</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.520" end="01:18:34.740" style="s2">a few words until I suddenly found</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.980" end="01:18:36.180" style="s2">someone that was Sympatico and I grabbed</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.740" end="01:18:39.750" style="s2">that person and talked with them all</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.180" end="01:18:42.900" style="s2">evening you know and and we had a</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.750" end="01:18:45.570" style="s2">community of two and I think of the</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.900" end="01:18:49.620" style="s2">essence that&#39;s fundamentally what</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.570" end="01:18:53.490" style="s2">community is most people are lonely I</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.620" end="01:18:56.820" style="s2">believe most people are waiting except</p>
<p begin="01:18:53.490" end="01:18:59.990" style="s2">the extreme in extroverts most people</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.820" end="01:19:03.630" style="s2">are waiting for the other person to</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.990" end="01:19:05.640" style="s2">communicate to initiate conversation to</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.630" end="01:19:08.250" style="s2">move the relationship from being</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.640" end="01:19:11.070" style="s2">transactional about buying and selling</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.250" end="01:19:14.490" style="s2">to something that has a bit of a tea</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.070" end="01:19:16.620" style="s2">dimension a bit of depth and the way we</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.490" end="01:19:21.950" style="s2">build community is we take the</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.620" end="01:19:24.900" style="s2">initiative and we start that process of</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.950" end="01:19:27.930" style="s2">opening our soul to another human being</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.900" end="01:19:28.650" style="s2">and finding their soul and we do it one</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.930" end="01:19:31.140" style="s2">at a time</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.650" end="01:19:34.050" style="s2">I believe I can&#39;t answer that in any</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.140" end="01:19:37.370" style="s2">other way I just like to add that the</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.050" end="01:19:40.380" style="s2">Syracuse I think have a wonderful</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.370" end="01:19:44.610" style="s2">methodology they believe that the whole</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.380" end="01:19:46.929" style="s2">world in terms of us as human beings has</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.610" end="01:19:51.070" style="s2">seven eleven circles</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.929" end="01:19:53.949" style="s2">in the in the very inner soul mate</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.070" end="01:19:57.340" style="s2">circle they say that in our whole life</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.949" end="01:20:00.429" style="s2">we probably have a maximum of three to</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.340" end="01:20:02.469" style="s2">four to five real soul mates we might</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.429" end="01:20:05.860" style="s2">only ever have one in our whole life and</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.469" end="01:20:07.840" style="s2">then the next level is friends that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.860" end="01:20:10.540" style="s2">know are really close and whatever and</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.840" end="01:20:13.050" style="s2">we keep going out to the eleventh circle</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.540" end="01:20:16.330" style="s2">being friends we have yet to meet and</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.050" end="01:20:19.090" style="s2">and I think that that&#39;s what community</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.330" end="01:20:22.230" style="s2">is about it&#39;s about eleven circles and</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.090" end="01:20:26.199" style="s2">in the middle of it is three or four</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.230" end="01:20:28.900" style="s2">soul mates and that&#39;s vegans their</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.199" end="01:20:40.179" style="s2">people their relationships we build over</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.900" end="01:20:44.790" style="s2">a total lifetime so I think the essence</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.179" end="01:20:47.860" style="s2">of nevels answer there was showing up</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.790" end="01:20:50.440" style="s2">really as who you are when you meet</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.860" end="01:20:53.380" style="s2">other people yes and being vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.440" end="01:20:56.080" style="s2">right precisely and being and being</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.380" end="01:20:58.600" style="s2">vulnerable my current wife gets annoyed</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.080" end="01:21:01.810" style="s2">because in the flat where we live in</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.600" end="01:21:05.260" style="s2">Melbourne I talk to everybody you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.810" end="01:21:10.600" style="s2">and she she can&#39;t ask the men and I said</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.260" end="01:21:13.570" style="s2">well I just had you know it&#39;s like you</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.600" end="01:21:16.210" style="s2">gotta you gotta talk to people so part</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.570" end="01:21:18.190" style="s2">of that 1r ability means putting</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.210" end="01:21:20.409" style="s2">yourself out there which means speaking</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.190" end="01:21:26.409" style="s2">in part and that means if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.409" end="01:21:28.600" style="s2">vulnerable it&#39;s it&#39;s true so what I mean</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.409" end="01:21:30.580" style="s2">what&#39;s ham in mainland herbal know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.600" end="01:21:31.810" style="s2">of course well I mean there&#39;s plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.580" end="01:21:34.060" style="s2">harm actually in being vulnerable</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.810" end="01:21:35.590" style="s2">I mean that&#39;s what being vulnerable is</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.060" end="01:21:38.520" style="s2">right like you&#39;re putting yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.590" end="01:21:40.989" style="s2">danger now that&#39;s what life requires</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.520" end="01:21:44.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what growth requires it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.989" end="01:21:48.010" style="s2">any real connection requires taking a</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.440" end="01:21:49.540" style="s2">risk it sure vulnerability now to build</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.010" end="01:21:50.890" style="s2">on the answer because this is obviously</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.540" end="01:21:53.500" style="s2">something that is quite important to me</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.890" end="01:21:58.409" style="s2">and deeply involved in everything we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.500" end="01:22:00.610" style="s2">doing here and moving forwards so I</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.409" end="01:22:02.080" style="s2">don&#39;t I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.610" end="01:22:05.260" style="s2">in some sense that complicates it I</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.080" end="01:22:10.719" style="s2">think it&#39;s showing up speaking</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.260" end="01:22:12.310" style="s2">truthfully and well actually that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.719" end="01:22:15.850" style="s2">difficult part is I think is that you</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.310" end="01:22:17.050" style="s2">actually have to love yourself right you</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.850" end="01:22:18.699" style="s2">have to believe that you&#39;re worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.050" end="01:22:22.139" style="s2">love and it&#39;s a in some sense it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.699" end="01:22:28.420" style="s2">cliche way to appreciate thing to say</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.139" end="01:22:30.730" style="s2">but what I think that means is that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.420" end="01:22:35.739" style="s2">vulnerability you show is actually</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.730" end="01:22:39.940" style="s2">anchored in something that itself is in</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.739" end="01:22:44.889" style="s2">principle or could be good worthy of</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.940" end="01:22:47.619" style="s2">love just just on that as an evangelical</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.889" end="01:22:51.730" style="s2">I was taught over an hour again</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.619" end="01:22:52.960" style="s2">that joy was Jesus first other&#39;s second</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.730" end="01:22:56.560" style="s2">and yourself last</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.960" end="01:22:59.770" style="s2">that is hog shit if you go back to what</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.560" end="01:23:06.330" style="s2">that great teacher taught he says love</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.770" end="01:23:09.940" style="s2">others as your self not not others</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.330" end="01:23:12.580" style="s2">better different than we are or less</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.940" end="01:23:15.400" style="s2">than us but as ourselves and I think</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.580" end="01:23:18.969" style="s2">that&#39;s the whole basis of community to</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.400" end="01:23:22.000" style="s2">love others as ourselves not more not</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.969" end="01:23:26.860" style="s2">better not less not richer not poorer</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.000" end="01:23:28.989" style="s2">that as us right so you have something</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.860" end="01:23:30.449" style="s2">to offer and you must believe that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.989" end="01:23:34.770" style="s2">other person has something to offer to</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.449" end="01:23:38.679" style="s2">right that there is that there is</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.770" end="01:23:40.239" style="s2">something like that there is a dignity</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.679" end="01:23:45.909" style="s2">to the human spirit that there is a</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.239" end="01:23:48.489" style="s2">dignity to what we do in the world which</p>
<p begin="01:23:45.909" end="01:23:52.719" style="s2">is bear the reality of our finitude and</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.489" end="01:23:56.020" style="s2">suffering and somehow find a way to move</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.719" end="01:23:59.500" style="s2">forwards for the better all right this</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.020" end="01:24:02.100" style="s2">is a ridiculous burden and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.500" end="01:24:06.480" style="s2">it&#39;s an incredible thing to achieve and</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.100" end="01:24:08.770" style="s2">I think being in that space and</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.480" end="01:24:13.310" style="s2">believing that not just with the mind</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.770" end="01:24:18.020" style="s2">but also with the body is</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.310" end="01:24:21.580" style="s2">is necessary for the kind of community</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.020" end="01:24:24.700" style="s2">that I think is required to be able to</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.580" end="01:24:28.310" style="s2">platform these sorts of conversations</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.700" end="01:24:32.020" style="s2">that I think society needs today in</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.310" end="01:24:34.370" style="s2">Australia in these suburbs in the world</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.020" end="01:24:37.190" style="s2">there&#39;s much obviously that we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.370" end="01:24:42.290" style="s2">touched on and there&#39;s plenty that in</p>
