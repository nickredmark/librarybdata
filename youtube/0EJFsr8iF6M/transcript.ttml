<p begin="00:21:02.799" end="00:21:04.960" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.360" end="00:21:06.480" style="s2">often say my unconscious talks to me in</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.960" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">movies i think my question is</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.480" end="00:21:10.960" style="s2">what do i do with that so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">excellent um</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.960" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">i think that&#39;s very normal for many of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:17.679" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.960" style="s2">in the practice keep going but take note</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.679" end="00:21:22.080" style="s2">of that character</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.960" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">and you might want to uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.080" end="00:21:26.159" style="s2">then take that into another practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">which i have not talked too much about</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.159" end="00:21:29.679" style="s2">a kind of active imagination a jungian</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.679" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">in which um you would invoke that</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.159" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:38.159" style="s2">uh in imagery and then try to let it be</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.159" end="00:21:41.520" style="s2">spontaneously animated</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.159" end="00:21:42.720" style="s2">by um i guess information communication</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.520" end="00:21:45.520" style="s2">from the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.720" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">and then try to interact dialogically uh</p>

<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:51.120" style="s2">and so that can be a powerful way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.679" end="00:21:52.480" style="s2">trying to open up the channel i</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.120" end="00:21:53.919" style="s2">recommend that while you&#39;re doing the</p>

<p begin="00:21:53.919" end="00:21:59.440" style="s2">you still treat that as another valuable</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.360" end="00:22:00.880" style="s2">uh portal that you&#39;re grateful to and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.440" end="00:22:04.480" style="s2">you step beyond</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.880" end="00:22:07.520" style="s2">to step through but um</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.480" end="00:22:09.120" style="s2">this is also a symbol on a symbol</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.520" end="00:22:10.559" style="s2">symbol on means to join two things</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.120" end="00:22:11.600" style="s2">together the conscious and the</p>

<p begin="00:22:14.960" end="00:22:19.520" style="s2">and then so taking up something like the</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.600" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">open mindedness which we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.520" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">talk about because it&#39;s basically a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:24.000" style="s2">theoretical neoplatonic practice we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:26.640" style="s2">talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.000" end="00:22:27.120" style="s2">when we do the wisdom of hypatia um but</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.640" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.120" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">that you might you could probably go</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:32.240" style="s2">online and find a couple</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.000" style="s2">make sure it&#39;s by somebody who has</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.240" end="00:22:36.400" style="s2">training in union therapy</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.000" end="00:22:38.000" style="s2">uh some stuff on how to do active</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.400" end="00:22:40.400" style="s2">imagination there&#39;s some books</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.000" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">you might want to take that character</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.400" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">into active imagination as a way</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:46.400" style="s2">of affording more symbolic discourse</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:48.320" style="s2">between your conscious and unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.400" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">mind like they said we will come back to</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.320" end="00:22:51.919" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:53.679" style="s2">uh later when we get in more depth um</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.919" end="00:22:54.559" style="s2">i&#39;m sorry i keep promising you all these</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.679" end="00:22:56.400" style="s2">practices but</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.559" end="00:22:58.960" style="s2">we will get to them and you can see how</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.400" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">they complement see how naturally</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.960" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">they complement what we&#39;re doing in this</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:05.120" style="s2">in in these</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:06.240" style="s2">eastern oriented practices so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.120" end="00:23:07.840" style="s2">suggestion here</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.240" end="00:23:09.600" style="s2">for now and like i said by the time you</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.840" end="00:23:13.200" style="s2">get into the wisdom of hypatia</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.600" end="00:23:15.280" style="s2">that&#39;s something uh we&#39;ll be able to uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.200" end="00:23:16.720" style="s2">pursue it more in depth all of us</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.280" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">together and hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.720" end="00:23:20.559" style="s2">uh you&#39;ll be able to ask some more</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">penetrating</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.559" end="00:23:25.840" style="s2">uh questions at that time dimitar</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:27.520" style="s2">how do i use a journal to cultivate my</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.840" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">buddha in a period where i have no</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.520" end="00:23:32.960" style="s2">insights to write down</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:33.679" style="s2">what do i write about so uh when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.960" end="00:23:36.799" style="s2">when you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.679" end="00:23:38.880" style="s2">insights um well you probably do</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.799" end="00:23:40.880" style="s2">you&#39;re just not realizing it but um many</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.880" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">of them are not full blown aha</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.880" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:46.320" style="s2">uh you may just notice something about</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:48.400" style="s2">somebody that you hadn&#39;t noticed before</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.320" end="00:23:49.679" style="s2">or you might when you realize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.400" end="00:23:51.360" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;ve caught yourself from</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.679" end="00:23:53.919" style="s2">distraction throughout the day</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.360" end="00:23:54.960" style="s2">and you come back moments of mindfulness</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.919" end="00:23:58.159" style="s2">are very</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.960" end="00:23:58.960" style="s2">important moments moments also when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.159" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">felt</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.960" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">um that you stepped outside of being</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:07.679" style="s2">locked into that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:09.440" style="s2">hurt hunger fever framing of egocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.679" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">when you had a genuine impulse of</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.440" end="00:24:12.159" style="s2">generosity</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:13.679" style="s2">or caring for another person it will</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.159" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">probably very quickly</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.679" end="00:24:19.919" style="s2">get permeated and twisted by</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">egocentrism that that sets all of us but</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.919" end="00:24:24.320" style="s2">don&#39;t get don&#39;t get don&#39;t get frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:26.559" style="s2">or don&#39;t fall into despair about that</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.320" end="00:24:29.840" style="s2">there if there is nevertheless if there</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.559" end="00:24:33.360" style="s2">was not actually a genuine moment</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.840" end="00:24:35.440" style="s2">of generosity and outreach the machinery</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.360" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">of egocentrism wouldn&#39;t have to swoop in</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.440" end="00:24:39.520" style="s2">so powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:41.360" style="s2">to constrain and control it so try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.520" end="00:24:44.640" style="s2">take note of that try to take</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.360" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">note of those moments and so try to</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.640" end="00:24:47.919" style="s2">think of it a continuum from</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">all the way up to sort of full-blown aha</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.919" end="00:24:51.360" style="s2">almost epiphany insights</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:53.679" style="s2">down to little moments of noticing</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.360" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">mindfulness noticing a difference</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.679" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">noticing perhaps a change in your</p>

<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:00.559" style="s2">and especially moments of generosity</p>

<p begin="00:25:00.559" end="00:25:04.480" style="s2">what&#39;s called ecstasis in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:06.080" style="s2">neoplatonic tradition standing beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.480" end="00:25:08.559" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.080" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">those moments when you are genuinely uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.559" end="00:25:11.600" style="s2">even for a moment before that other</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">machinery gets it</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.600" end="00:25:15.679" style="s2">right you&#39;re beyond yours you&#39;re beyond</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:18.320" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.679" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">uh so take note of all of those it may</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.320" end="00:25:23.440" style="s2">be also</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">um uh in an aesthetic experience when</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.440" end="00:25:27.279" style="s2">you&#39;re in music</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:30.080" style="s2">you may realize sometimes that you get</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.279" end="00:25:31.600" style="s2">caught up ecstatically beyond it</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.080" end="00:25:33.919" style="s2">note that remember it instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">letting it uh drift away</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.919" end="00:25:37.520" style="s2">into the half dream of memory</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.640" end="00:25:42.080" style="s2">i can&#39;t quite read it here that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.559" end="00:25:44.400" style="s2">it&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.080" end="00:25:45.440" style="s2">or please forgive me if i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.400" end="00:25:48.000" style="s2">mispronouncing it</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.440" end="00:25:49.120" style="s2">occur observation watching how air was</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.000" end="00:25:52.000" style="s2">moving</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.120" end="00:25:53.440" style="s2">uh the leaves on the plant outside i</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.000" end="00:25:55.520" style="s2">observed some amazing synchronous</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.440" end="00:25:57.840" style="s2">degrees with my thoughts and perception</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.520" end="00:25:59.600" style="s2">this is the first time i want to do</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.840" end="00:26:02.960" style="s2">again thanks again john</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.600" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">um so what tends to happen and this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.960" end="00:26:07.120" style="s2">this is something you have to treat very</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.120" end="00:26:10.159" style="s2">as you get into these practices as you</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:12.720" style="s2">start to get reciprocal</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.159" end="00:26:14.400" style="s2">opening happening as we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.720" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">you you there will be more</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.400" end="00:26:20.640" style="s2">of these called synchronicities</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">sort of uh things happen where there</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.640" end="00:26:23.600" style="s2">seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.600" style="s2">a resonant correspondence between what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.600" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">going on inside and outside</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.600" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">um and this is very tempting and i think</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:30.799" style="s2">perhaps to some degree even young pal</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">created this temptation</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.799" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">to get into sort of thinking of this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:36.240" style="s2">magically</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">and that it gives us sort of a secret</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.240" end="00:26:40.080" style="s2">way which we could manipulate things</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:41.840" style="s2">i&#39;m not i&#39;m not saying you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.080" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">i&#39;m just saying that this is something</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.840" end="00:26:45.840" style="s2">we need</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:48.799" style="s2">remember what the buddha said the buddha</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.840" end="00:26:50.720" style="s2">was very not very specific about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.960" style="s2">you needed to do in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.720" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">a disciple a follower but he said this</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.960" end="00:26:56.960" style="s2">is how you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.840" end="00:27:00.640" style="s2">someone is not one of my disciples when</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.960" end="00:27:04.720" style="s2">they offer to perform a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.640" end="00:27:06.480" style="s2">so right noticing those synchronicities</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.720" end="00:27:08.720" style="s2">is something that you could write in</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.480" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">your journal and celebrate</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.720" end="00:27:15.279" style="s2">but it&#39;s very important</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">to resist an inflationary impulse that</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.279" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">comes up very naturally</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">when those kinds of resonances occur</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:24.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s just some overall values there</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:24.960" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely something to note in</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.240" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">your journal</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.960" end="00:27:28.559" style="s2">note it as an indication that reciprocal</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.559" end="00:27:34.240" style="s2">is probably occurring but remember to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.000" end="00:27:36.880" style="s2">frame it in a non-inflationary manner</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.240" end="00:27:38.159" style="s2">i mean what we&#39;re ultimately after in</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.880" end="00:27:40.080" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.159" end="00:27:42.399" style="s2">this is a neoplatonic way of putting it</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.080" end="00:27:44.640" style="s2">is we&#39;re after non-inflationary</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.399" end="00:27:46.559" style="s2">identification with what which is what</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.640" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">with what is most ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.559" end="00:27:51.120" style="s2">the great temptation and this is in so</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:54.480" style="s2">much mythology about the evil sorcerer</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.120" end="00:27:56.799" style="s2">is as we as that starts to occur</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.480" end="00:27:57.600" style="s2">we snap it back inside our ego-centric</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.799" end="00:28:00.559" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.600" end="00:28:01.279" style="s2">and we try to swallow the ultimate into</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.559" end="00:28:04.480" style="s2">ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.279" end="00:28:07.679" style="s2">a form of blasphemy and idolatry</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.480" end="00:28:09.360" style="s2">that is deeply destructive of everything</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.679" end="00:28:11.919" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to realize</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.360" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">in our aspirations towards wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.919" end="00:28:14.399" style="s2">enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.120" end="00:28:21.279" style="s2">if you start to lose</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.399" end="00:28:22.480" style="s2">you start to lose the sense of your</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.279" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">mortality</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.480" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">your mortality isn&#39;t the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:28.000" style="s2">you&#39;re going to die</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:30.640" style="s2">it&#39;s in the first mark noble truth your</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.000" end="00:28:31.440" style="s2">mortality is that there is no area of</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.640" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">your life</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.440" end="00:28:37.520" style="s2">no part of your psyche that is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:39.679" style="s2">susceptible to dukkha not susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.520" end="00:28:41.679" style="s2">self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.679" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">that to remember your mortality is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.679" end="00:28:48.000" style="s2">remember no matter where you turn</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:50.399" style="s2">you are limited by that perennial threat</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.000" end="00:28:52.159" style="s2">and that right and it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.399" end="00:28:56.840" style="s2">start forgetting that</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.159" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">when we start to because it is truly</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.840" end="00:29:03.679" style="s2">wonderful joseph pickens</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:06.000" style="s2">hello joseph uh it&#39;s good to uh have you</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.679" end="00:29:08.080" style="s2">here and asking questions what should</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.000" end="00:29:11.360" style="s2">the mind be doing during the moving</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.080" end="00:29:13.520" style="s2">uh uh so the gender is the sitting ones</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.360" end="00:29:15.600" style="s2">when you&#39;re moving so if you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.520" end="00:29:18.399" style="s2">any of these so this is the taoist</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.600" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">there&#39;s a yin and yang so in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.399" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">movements</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:22.960" style="s2">what you&#39;re generally doing is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:24.720" style="s2">an opening and closing of the body</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.960" end="00:29:26.559" style="s2">in some fashion and then you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.720" end="00:29:28.399" style="s2">the same thing with your mind so</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.559" end="00:29:29.600" style="s2">when i&#39;m opening my hands for example</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.399" end="00:29:32.080" style="s2">this is like meta</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.600" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">and i&#39;m opening up my attention out</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.080" end="00:29:36.240" style="s2">towards</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:37.200" style="s2">the horizon that encompasses me and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.240" end="00:29:40.480" style="s2">as i close</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.200" end="00:29:42.240" style="s2">my hands this is so this is yang</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.480" end="00:29:44.320" style="s2">and then this is the yin movement this</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:47.600" style="s2">is the movement towards the center</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.320" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">that ultimately grounds me so</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.600" end="00:29:51.440" style="s2">opening up to the horizon that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:53.520" style="s2">accompanies</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.440" end="00:29:55.360" style="s2">accompanies me moving towards what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.520" end="00:29:58.000" style="s2">called the axis mundi the</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.360" end="00:29:59.279" style="s2">the axis of the world the center that</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.000" end="00:30:02.559" style="s2">grounds me</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.279" end="00:30:09.120" style="s2">so my mind is moving yang</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.559" end="00:30:13.039" style="s2">and yin with the moving practices</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.120" end="00:30:14.720" style="s2">uh uh k conoloy i&#39;ve always had a song</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.039" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">i always have a song running through my</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:18.159" style="s2">mind when i try to meditate do you have</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:21.679" style="s2">any tips to deal with this</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.159" end="00:30:24.880" style="s2">um so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.679" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">very often the case trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.880" end="00:30:28.640" style="s2">something about it</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:29.679" style="s2">is the thing that will mo will make it</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.640" end="00:30:32.799" style="s2">worse</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.679" end="00:30:35.440" style="s2">so is it possible to</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.799" end="00:30:36.720" style="s2">leave it in this position what i do and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.440" end="00:30:39.840" style="s2">it seems to work for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.720" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">is i just i don&#39;t treat it as an</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.840" end="00:30:44.559" style="s2">obstacle</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:46.559" style="s2">i try to get it so that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.559" end="00:30:47.919" style="s2">the background and periphery of my</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.559" end="00:30:50.640" style="s2">awareness</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.919" end="00:30:51.600" style="s2">where it just runs and then what i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.640" end="00:30:54.080" style="s2">noticed is</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.600" end="00:30:54.880" style="s2">if i can get to that place where i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.080" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">fighting it</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.880" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">i&#39;m also not indulging it just it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:00.159" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:02.320" style="s2">and i treat it almost like you know you</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.159" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">go into a temple</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:05.600" style="s2">and there&#39;s music off in some room</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:07.840" style="s2">people are chanting</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.600" end="00:31:09.679" style="s2">i&#39;m just meditating here and they&#39;re off</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.840" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">there and this is a part of my mind</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.679" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">chanting</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:16.559" style="s2">you know it&#39;s often some other room and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.960" end="00:31:19.279" style="s2">what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.559" end="00:31:19.679" style="s2">that really fades in its ability to sort</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.279" end="00:31:21.679" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.679" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">get it get a grip on my awareness</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.679" end="00:31:26.480" style="s2">sometimes if it fades into silence</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:28.640" style="s2">uh sometimes it just diminishes but i</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.480" end="00:31:30.840" style="s2">found that has been very helpful for me</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.640" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">uh for dealing with that kind of inner</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.840" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">music</p>
