<p begin="00:00:00.030" end="00:00:04.319" style="s2">um yeah I just wanted I just want to</p>
<p begin="00:00:02.639" end="00:00:06.150" style="s2">make myself available that&#39;s all yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:15.450" style="s2">thank you I appreciate that a lot</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.150" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">I um you know one of the whole thing</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.450" end="00:00:20.990" style="s2">about our relationship to the potential</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.699" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">yeah how we can fall in love with it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.990" end="00:00:26.160" style="s2">and it&#39;s ended relationship to the</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:28.670" style="s2">actual but the two differences between</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.160" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">those you know I&#39;ve often wondered about</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.670" end="00:00:36.570" style="s2">when we see somebody right when I see</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:38.370" style="s2">you and I perceive you right it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.570" end="00:00:41.280" style="s2">strange thing to know exactly what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.370" end="00:00:43.379" style="s2">perceiving if I can you know I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.280" end="00:00:47.070" style="s2">exercise that that that I sometimes do</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.379" end="00:00:49.050" style="s2">with and in my courses well I&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.070" end="00:00:51.210" style="s2">somebody kind of make eye contact with</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.050" end="00:00:54.300" style="s2">each other and then have one person like</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.210" end="00:00:57.120" style="s2">look look at the other&#39;s eye and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.300" end="00:00:59.190" style="s2">describe the intimate like physical</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.120" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">details of it until they get into that</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.190" end="00:01:03.149" style="s2">perceptual switch where they they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:05.100" style="s2">looking at a person they&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.149" end="00:01:07.100" style="s2">an eyeball and then having your eye</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.100" end="00:01:11.159" style="s2">there and say okay now see them and</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.100" end="00:01:15.479" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of experience and in</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.159" end="00:01:21.000" style="s2">it and it seems to make experiencial</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.479" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">this this mystery that yeah what was I</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.000" end="00:01:25.950" style="s2">looking at what was the difference right</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:29.850" style="s2">like am i when I see you and my is it an</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.950" end="00:01:32.130" style="s2">actual am I seeing physical objects well</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.850" end="00:01:35.100" style="s2">not quite because it&#39;s like when i zoom</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.130" end="00:01:37.140" style="s2">into the object it&#39;s not like I see you</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.100" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">it&#39;s not the same experience but when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.140" end="00:01:42.659" style="s2">when I I let go of the object miss and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:46.979" style="s2">see you there&#39;s a different apprehension</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.659" end="00:01:49.290" style="s2">oh very much yeah I&#39;m wondering if that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.979" end="00:01:52.049" style="s2">apprehension is what we is a way of</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.290" end="00:01:56.430" style="s2">talking about that we perceive one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.049" end="00:01:58.560" style="s2">potential that&#39;s interesting let me</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.430" end="00:02:02.399" style="s2">reflect on that for a moment I mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.560" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">there&#39;s one sense in which I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.399" end="00:02:06.719" style="s2">speaking psychologically like organisms</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:08.569" style="s2">don&#39;t respond mostly to the physical</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.719" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">properties they respond to the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.569" end="00:02:13.620" style="s2">that&#39;s why the sight of the flame the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:16.410" style="s2">smell of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.620" end="00:02:18.780" style="s2">smoke the noise of someone saying fire</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.410" end="00:02:19.920" style="s2">or run can all cause the same behavior</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.780" end="00:02:21.900" style="s2">because they share meaning even though</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.920" end="00:02:24.840" style="s2">they&#39;re very physically different and</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.900" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">part of what you might be suggesting and</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.840" end="00:02:31.530" style="s2">I think the meaning is often carried you</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:34.590" style="s2">get more and more meaning as you move up</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.530" end="00:02:36.060" style="s2">to higher levels of organization so when</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.590" end="00:02:37.950" style="s2">you move to the I to the face the face</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.060" end="00:02:40.049" style="s2">is often more meaningful the eye and</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.950" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">then the person is more meaningful or</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.049" end="00:02:43.290" style="s2">their or their full body and then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:45.660" style="s2">moving body is more meaningful than the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.290" end="00:02:47.610" style="s2">still body etc etc and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.660" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely what what that means</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.610" end="00:02:54.660" style="s2">is both there&#39;s an increased actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:57.390" style="s2">actualization of some sort of structural</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.660" end="00:03:00.540" style="s2">functional organization but that that I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.390" end="00:03:02.129" style="s2">mean if we follow up on Aristotle was</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.540" end="00:03:06.209" style="s2">way and we&#39;re using his term so he</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.129" end="00:03:08.910" style="s2">better invoke him at least once like</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.209" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">that actuality is the capacity to act</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.910" end="00:03:14.329" style="s2">and so I mean when we&#39;re encountering</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:18.930" style="s2">that more meaning we&#39;re encountering</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.329" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">right that the person is and if are in</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.930" end="00:03:23.639" style="s2">if action is more meaning based than</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:24.930" style="s2">just physical feature based then when</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.639" end="00:03:26.430" style="s2">we&#39;re encountering more meaning I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.930" end="00:03:29.370" style="s2">trying to do this right on the fly here</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.430" end="00:03:31.620" style="s2">guy as we encounter more meaning we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.370" end="00:03:34.889" style="s2">actually encountering a greater capacity</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.620" end="00:03:36.810" style="s2">to act that&#39;s what I that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.889" end="00:03:38.310" style="s2">trying to suggest so that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.810" end="00:03:40.920" style="s2">because I hadn&#39;t thought about quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.310" end="00:03:43.950" style="s2">doing that before with Aristotle that</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.920" end="00:03:45.930" style="s2">idea of you know that there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.950" end="00:03:49.019" style="s2">there&#39;s this coordination between being</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.930" end="00:03:52.049" style="s2">more meaningful being more actual and</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.019" end="00:03:55.019" style="s2">being more capable of more more</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.049" end="00:03:57.359" style="s2">meaningful behavior yeah yeah that did</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.019" end="00:03:58.859" style="s2">that track at all did that work thank</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.359" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">you but basically I heard you say is the</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.859" end="00:04:12.109" style="s2">more but the more the more potential I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">can see the more I can act into which</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.109" end="00:04:20.250" style="s2">which gives me the ability to both well</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:23.750" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the potential and</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.250" end="00:04:26.099" style="s2">the actual like is does the word realize</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.750" end="00:04:27.510" style="s2">yes that&#39;s why I use that words a lot</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.099" end="00:04:29.190" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.510" end="00:04:30.870" style="s2">is something I&#39;m wondering about like</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.190" end="00:04:32.570" style="s2">this is what he&#39;s talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.870" end="00:04:35.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh that relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.570" end="00:04:37.980" style="s2">the actual the potential and that when</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.940" end="00:04:39.960" style="s2">we act into it in such a way that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.980" end="00:04:43.140" style="s2">more of the potential is realized but</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.960" end="00:04:46.230" style="s2">also more of the ground this is closed</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.140" end="00:04:48.930" style="s2">yes right so it&#39;s like it&#39;s like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.230" end="00:04:51.150" style="s2">a deef relationship between being</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.930" end="00:04:53.010" style="s2">informed in Aristotle sense being</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.150" end="00:04:55.170" style="s2">actualized to greater levels of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.010" end="00:04:58.290" style="s2">structural function organization and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.170" end="00:05:00.090" style="s2">capacity to generate information in in</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.290" end="00:05:02.450" style="s2">terms of patterns of intelligibility in</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.090" end="00:05:05.760" style="s2">the world there seems to be a direct</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.450" end="00:05:08.160" style="s2">relationship there that I think is</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.760" end="00:05:10.320" style="s2">something that I can now I hadn&#39;t put</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.160" end="00:05:12.750" style="s2">this together but I see that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.320" end="00:05:15.270" style="s2">something that Platonists was was was</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.750" end="00:05:19.500" style="s2">sort of you know drawing out of and</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.270" end="00:05:21.720" style="s2">developing out of Aristotle yeah because</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.500" end="00:05:24.720" style="s2">you know because Platonists takes the</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.720" end="00:05:26.610" style="s2">the levels and Aristotle&#39;s conformity</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.720" end="00:05:28.620" style="s2">theory and then he turns it into like</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.610" end="00:05:31.170" style="s2">any me and he connects it with the</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.620" end="00:05:37.970" style="s2">Platonic Anna got the idea that when I</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.170" end="00:05:41.040" style="s2">can fit myself to a particular level of</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.970" end="00:05:44.130" style="s2">of intelligibility then that will</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.040" end="00:05:47.310" style="s2">actualize me to a certain degree but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.130" end="00:05:49.800" style="s2">will also disclose reality as more</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.310" end="00:05:55.110" style="s2">meaningful to me in a coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.800" end="00:05:57.510" style="s2">fashion yeah that seems right so to</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.110" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">ground it back down in the exercise the</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.510" end="00:06:00.270" style="s2">the attentional scaling you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:02.100" style="s2">when you&#39;re getting people to move</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.270" end="00:06:04.470" style="s2">between feature and Gestalt yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.100" end="00:06:05.880" style="s2">then notice the change and especially</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.470" end="00:06:07.320" style="s2">there if you&#39;re doing it in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.880" end="00:06:11.040" style="s2">context I can see why this is so</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.320" end="00:06:13.920" style="s2">important yeah is because right you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.040" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">you&#39;re not what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.920" end="00:06:16.980" style="s2">doing that you&#39;re you&#39;re getting people</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.330" end="00:06:21.030" style="s2">to suddenly experience that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.980" end="00:06:23.940" style="s2">expanse of birth of meaning in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.030" end="00:06:26.840" style="s2">object but it&#39;s also causing them to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.940" end="00:06:28.950" style="s2">change to a different level of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.840" end="00:06:32.670" style="s2">processing power if I can put it that</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.950" end="00:06:34.320" style="s2">way right that but that totally and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.670" end="00:06:36.120" style="s2">think particularly well at least what</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.320" end="00:06:38.640" style="s2">I&#39;m attempting to do in that exercise is</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.120" end="00:06:41.280" style="s2">to take something that just seems so</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.640" end="00:06:43.830" style="s2">given an ordinary and reveal the end</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.280" end="00:06:45.870" style="s2">meanness of it Oh totally and I think</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.830" end="00:06:47.100" style="s2">that&#39;s any you&#39;re triggering the insight</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.870" end="00:06:49.020" style="s2">machinery when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.100" end="00:06:51.570" style="s2">playing between I mean I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.020" end="00:06:53.669" style="s2">what drives a lot of insight is the you</p>

<p begin="00:12:28.480" end="00:12:33.640" style="s2">relationship with transcendence right</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.820" end="00:12:36.040" style="s2">there I was suggesting to him that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.640" end="00:12:38.170" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like you to use something like</p>

<p begin="00:12:46.840" end="00:12:51.160" style="s2">so so the proposition was in there but</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.870" end="00:12:53.860" style="s2">right but there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.160" end="00:12:55.780" style="s2">there&#39;s this vertical integration within</p>

<p begin="00:13:29.150" end="00:13:33.740" style="s2">sense the ultimate bomb through it not</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.880" end="00:13:35.990" style="s2">yeah and I wish and I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.740" end="00:13:37.910" style="s2">your you know circling and other than</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.990" end="00:13:39.380" style="s2">these other practices and and Jordan was</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.910" end="00:13:41.570" style="s2">saying oh yeah yeah I get that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.380" end="00:13:44.510" style="s2">there&#39;s that there&#39;s that sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.570" end="00:13:45.800" style="s2">um right so I just want to express that</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.510" end="00:13:47.270" style="s2">to you because it&#39;s sort of uppermost in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.800" end="00:13:48.920" style="s2">my mind and it sort of being like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.270" end="00:13:51.140" style="s2">just sort of sort of bubbling through me</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.920" end="00:13:53.240" style="s2">that this that you know that that sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.140" end="00:13:56.090" style="s2">that and I get that that&#39;s what was</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.240" end="00:13:58.310" style="s2">going on in ancient philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.090" end="00:14:00.680" style="s2">practice even when it was doing things</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.310" end="00:14:02.960" style="s2">like ontology right even when it was</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.680" end="00:14:05.150" style="s2">doing ontology it was like we got it we</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.960" end="00:14:06.980" style="s2">got it first all we have to engage and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.150" end="00:14:09.230" style="s2">activate and complexify the whole person</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.980" end="00:14:12.860" style="s2">set it into a transformative relation</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.230" end="00:14:16.790" style="s2">and only in that will you adduce right</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.860" end="00:14:19.790" style="s2">yet the inexhaustibility of reality yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.790" end="00:14:22.090" style="s2">now I&#39;m just curious right now the way</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.790" end="00:14:24.980" style="s2">that this is coming together to you</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.090" end="00:14:27.410" style="s2">hearing is this are we inside of some</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.980" end="00:14:29.390" style="s2">like that kind of very process like if</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.410" end="00:14:33.410" style="s2">it feels like it it feels like it</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.390" end="00:14:35.210" style="s2">appears so I typically when I&#39;m moving</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.410" end="00:14:37.070" style="s2">around a lot I&#39;m playing with the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.210" end="00:14:38.690" style="s2">perspective my my hands are doing lots</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.070" end="00:14:40.220" style="s2">of respect double star I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.690" end="00:14:42.560" style="s2">trigger all kinds of procedural stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.220" end="00:14:45.980" style="s2">and then I mean you know and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.560" end="00:14:48.590" style="s2">trying to put this into an existential</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.980" end="00:14:51.290" style="s2">relevance I&#39;m trying to engage like you</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.590" end="00:14:53.960" style="s2">the the the machinery of the self and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.290" end="00:14:56.960" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s calling that all</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.960" end="00:14:59.510" style="s2">together the horizon that&#39;s like calling</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.960" end="00:15:02.050" style="s2">that deeper complex that that deeper</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.510" end="00:15:05.060" style="s2">complexification of yourselves</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.050" end="00:15:07.130" style="s2">that&#39;s the this is what I really got in</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.060" end="00:15:09.620" style="s2">this in both of these books that I that</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.130" end="00:15:14.690" style="s2">I rare this this this sense in which the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.620" end="00:15:17.420" style="s2">in in ancient philosophy there was this</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.690" end="00:15:23.830" style="s2">sense in which the the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.420" end="00:15:27.740" style="s2">knowing was to exemplify what the way of</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.830" end="00:15:29.690" style="s2">the way when lived words they&#39;re words</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.740" end="00:15:32.060" style="s2">that you could say it was you know how</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.690" end="00:15:35.540" style="s2">they say where</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.060" end="00:15:38.210" style="s2">method always precedes theory right</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.540" end="00:15:40.820" style="s2">first he does something right and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.210" end="00:15:42.620" style="s2">it but they don&#39;t really know how they</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.820" end="00:15:43.880" style="s2">how they do it they just do it and then</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.620" end="00:15:45.560" style="s2">people see it they&#39;re like then they</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.880" end="00:15:48.800" style="s2">they start to make theories about it</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.560" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">right yep and then ideally the theories</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.800" end="00:15:56.690" style="s2">that we make support a deepening yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:16:02.600" style="s2">what was embodied in that I guess that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.690" end="00:16:06.130" style="s2">like going from from like dear Ora</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.600" end="00:16:10.220" style="s2">to theory to thei aura that thing yes</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.130" end="00:16:11.570" style="s2">yeah so this is this is the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.220" end="00:16:13.220" style="s2">sort of reverberating in me right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.570" end="00:16:14.780" style="s2">there&#39;s sort of multidimensionality of</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.220" end="00:16:16.220" style="s2">dialectic as I put it so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.780" end="00:16:23.960" style="s2">wonderful mouthful that you won&#39;t put on</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.220" end="00:16:26.240" style="s2">a bumper sticker right so we&#39;ve all</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.960" end="00:16:28.070" style="s2">we&#39;ve obviously got this going on right</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.240" end="00:16:29.510" style="s2">between you and I and then you and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.070" end="00:16:31.160" style="s2">have talked already about and this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.510" end="00:16:33.050" style="s2">already gets us into the transformative</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.160" end="00:16:35.690" style="s2">relationship with the ontology right</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.050" end="00:16:37.460" style="s2">you&#39;ve got this going on between you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.690" end="00:16:39.830" style="s2">know the dialectic between levels</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.460" end="00:16:40.970" style="s2">ontological levels but now there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.830" end="00:16:43.220" style="s2">third dimension which you&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.970" end="00:16:45.110" style="s2">mentioned there&#39;s the constant dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.220" end="00:16:46.640" style="s2">between the kinds of knowing exemplified</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.110" end="00:16:49.490" style="s2">in the dialectic between theory and</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.640" end="00:16:51.500" style="s2">theory and they&#39;re constantly talking to</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.490" end="00:16:54.650" style="s2">each other as well and all three of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.500" end="00:16:57.470" style="s2">these are like really exemplified in</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.650" end="00:17:00.520" style="s2">Socratic dialectic it&#39;s all there</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.470" end="00:17:02.510" style="s2">happening in this really fluent</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.520" end="00:17:03.740" style="s2">integrated fashion this is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.510" end="00:17:05.930" style="s2">really excited about trying to convey to</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.740" end="00:17:08.180" style="s2">people because I also see this right I</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.930" end="00:17:10.040" style="s2">also see I think you know you know going</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.180" end="00:17:12.260" style="s2">to the circling practice now I see this</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.040" end="00:17:14.450" style="s2">happening in the circling and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.260" end="00:17:15.980" style="s2">also see people even marking it like</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.450" end="00:17:17.990" style="s2">phenomenologically and and</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.980" end="00:17:20.480" style="s2">propositioning though like they&#39;ll do</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.990" end="00:17:23.300" style="s2">okay I&#39;ll try it I&#39;m not trying to</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.480" end="00:17:24.680" style="s2">imitate in marketing video no no no this</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.300" end="00:17:26.930" style="s2">is done respectfully but they&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.680" end="00:17:30.020" style="s2">they&#39;ll be they&#39;ll be in right to sort</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.930" end="00:17:31.790" style="s2">of centring centered in the room right</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.020" end="00:17:34.370" style="s2">between everybody and then they&#39;ll build</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.790" end="00:17:35.840" style="s2">off and they&#39;ll fall back right and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.370" end="00:17:38.240" style="s2">you can see that they&#39;re there they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.840" end="00:17:39.680" style="s2">trying to do some theory they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.240" end="00:17:42.050" style="s2">to ok what&#39;s going like they&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.680" end="00:17:43.160" style="s2">to get some intelligible structure to</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.050" end="00:17:45.050" style="s2">this because they want to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.160" end="00:17:46.010" style="s2">bring it because if they can&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.050" end="00:17:48.320" style="s2">they can&#39;t bring it back</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.010" end="00:17:50.450" style="s2">words and then they did it and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.320" end="00:17:51.980" style="s2">can sometimes they get stuck there for a</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.450" end="00:17:54.080" style="s2">while and you can see them sort of and</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.980" end="00:17:56.840" style="s2">they it&#39;s funny how much they make their</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.080" end="00:17:59.390" style="s2">day they hold themselves back to almost</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.840" end="00:18:00.830" style="s2">gesturally convey that they&#39;re sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.390" end="00:18:02.600" style="s2">stuck in theory and then what will</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.830" end="00:18:04.010" style="s2">happen it and people will often notice</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.600" end="00:18:05.300" style="s2">they&#39;ll say oh I thought you just moved</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.010" end="00:18:08.090" style="s2">back into your chest</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.300" end="00:18:10.310" style="s2">yeah right and then you see them sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.090" end="00:18:12.800" style="s2">I don&#39;t know functions out what it is</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.310" end="00:18:14.360" style="s2">but it&#39;s said they go from here and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.800" end="00:18:16.310" style="s2">the urna right and they come in and you</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.360" end="00:18:19.580" style="s2">can oh no okay now they&#39;re back into now</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.310" end="00:18:21.860" style="s2">they&#39;re back into furia again so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.580" end="00:18:23.600" style="s2">going on and then of course people are</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.860" end="00:18:26.360" style="s2">the dialogue moves between different</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.600" end="00:18:27.710" style="s2">ontological levels seamlessly and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.360" end="00:18:29.750" style="s2">of course people connect and then</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.710" end="00:18:32.210" style="s2">reconnect and connect and reconnect and</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.750" end="00:18:35.930" style="s2">then and and and and then there&#39;s a kind</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.210" end="00:18:37.910" style="s2">of hyper coherence that gels um I just</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.930" end="00:18:40.790" style="s2">sorry I mean I&#39;m just getting into this</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.910" end="00:18:42.700" style="s2">but I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to like I said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.790" end="00:18:44.750" style="s2">trying to do a thority I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.700" end="00:18:46.340" style="s2">talk in a way that facilitates the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.750" end="00:18:48.680" style="s2">participation but also allows the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.340" end="00:18:53.450" style="s2">connection to cognitive science yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.680" end="00:18:54.770" style="s2">totally and I and I I&#39;m so appreciating</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.450" end="00:18:58.100" style="s2">everything that you&#39;re saying because</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.770" end="00:19:00.170" style="s2">all that&#39;s real super familiar and those</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.100" end="00:19:05.210" style="s2">those movements back and forth through</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.170" end="00:19:07.250" style="s2">when people go oh oh those are like you</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.210" end="00:19:09.290" style="s2">capture those things you can almost you</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.250" end="00:19:11.180" style="s2">can almost say I I sometimes joke and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.290" end="00:19:13.250" style="s2">I&#39;m like you know basically all you need</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.180" end="00:19:14.660" style="s2">to do is walk into a room someone says</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.250" end="00:19:19.000" style="s2">something and someone goes ah and there</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.660" end="00:19:19.000" style="s2">you go can you say that another way yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.660" end="00:19:25.760" style="s2">they&#39;re present is something opened up</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.340" end="00:19:27.920" style="s2">they got something yet it&#39;s not yet</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.760" end="00:19:30.830" style="s2">theory yes that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.920" end="00:19:32.930" style="s2">something was unconcealed and then say</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.830" end="00:19:35.720" style="s2">it another way and then they struggle in</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.930" end="00:19:38.840" style="s2">the articulation of it and then somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.720" end="00:19:40.430" style="s2">else goes hmm and you&#39;re like keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.840" end="00:19:47.780" style="s2">that long enough eventually you&#39;ll hit</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.430" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">God you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.780" end="00:19:51.950" style="s2">well it&#39;s funny because that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.650" end="00:23:15.610" style="s2">mean and dialectic of course we have to</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.750" end="00:23:16.960" style="s2">do the theory because there&#39;s existing</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.610" end="00:23:19.690" style="s2">theories where you have a responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.960" end="00:23:21.460" style="s2">to them yeah but right but but but but</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.620" end="00:23:35.560" style="s2">got split apart and this is one of</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.240" end="00:23:41.040" style="s2">things I want to talk with you about is</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.560" end="00:23:47.200" style="s2">sure is first of all kind of getting</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.040" end="00:23:51.550" style="s2">like how Socrates is custom underlying</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.680" end="00:26:46.930" style="s2">so it&#39;s considered it&#39;s so most people</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.220" end="00:26:50.680" style="s2">you know sort of 300 BCE till around you</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.930" end="00:26:53.380" style="s2">know when it changes into the Roman</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.680" end="00:26:55.990" style="s2">Empire you know it&#39;s the Hellenistic</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.380" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">period is sort of over when Rome is</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.990" end="00:27:01.780" style="s2">coming into sort of full ascendance</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:03.940" style="s2">because then the legacy right of our the</p>

<p begin="00:27:03.940" end="00:27:07.060" style="s2">this in the book and we wrote about how</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.380" end="00:27:10.420" style="s2">the Hellenistic period is a period of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.060" end="00:27:11.830" style="s2">pervasive dama sight and so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.420" end="00:27:14.400" style="s2">something very analogous to our current</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.830" end="00:27:16.690" style="s2">meeting crisis going on there me and</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.400" end="00:27:18.490" style="s2">that&#39;s when the therapeutic aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.690" end="00:27:20.950" style="s2">philosophy gets really strongly</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.490" end="00:27:23.140" style="s2">developed and integrated in well what</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.950" end="00:27:26.890" style="s2">was fascinating to me is just to think</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.140" end="00:27:28.840" style="s2">about that there have been lines of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.890" end="00:27:34.560" style="s2">thought like um you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.840" end="00:27:39.040" style="s2">Epicurus race duis ism the cynics</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.560" end="00:27:40.750" style="s2">Platonists that battle schools that have</p>

<p begin="00:27:40.750" end="00:27:46.960" style="s2">whole period of time like survived all</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.910" end="00:27:50.530" style="s2">this change that no know about and you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.960" end="00:27:52.840" style="s2">think about it well given how spread out</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.530" end="00:27:54.730" style="s2">everything was and given obviously there</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.840" end="00:27:58.360" style="s2">was a printing presses most people to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.730" end="00:28:00.910" style="s2">it like it&#39;s mostly cool culture that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.360" end="00:28:03.160" style="s2">you could have all of that dominant side</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.910" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">all of that intermingling and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.160" end="00:28:08.940" style="s2">there&#39;s this these deep these deep deep</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.370" end="00:28:17.470" style="s2">basically philosophical ideas that were</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.470" end="00:28:21.550" style="s2">passed on and yeah Nathan right over</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.470" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">time that is first of all that&#39;s that is</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.550" end="00:28:27.910" style="s2">profoundly stable right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:29.500" style="s2">stability there and and but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.910" end="00:28:34.450" style="s2">interesting is that it gave that</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.500" end="00:28:40.710" style="s2">stability yet the theory right was in</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.450" end="00:28:44.530" style="s2">service right right to the fiora right</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.710" end="00:28:46.300" style="s2">active that right yeah much yeah and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.530" end="00:28:47.590" style="s2">I think it seems so important and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.300" end="00:28:49.570" style="s2">think this is what I&#39;m starting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.590" end="00:28:51.100" style="s2">appreciate what you are doing right what</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.570" end="00:28:52.299" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to highlight from within</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.100" end="00:28:54.519" style="s2">the academic set</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.299" end="00:28:56.109" style="s2">which is impressive right because it</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.519" end="00:28:58.450" style="s2">seems like the academic set setting is</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.109" end="00:29:01.779" style="s2">it like if the theory&#39;s your experience</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.450" end="00:29:03.909" style="s2">doesn&#39;t really matter right for its it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.779" end="00:29:05.409" style="s2">the thing for human resources or it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.909" end="00:29:06.969" style="s2">the thing to go to therapy about but</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.409" end="00:29:11.830" style="s2">like the thing that matters is your</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.969" end="00:29:13.389" style="s2">propositions and and all that but I just</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.830" end="00:29:17.289" style="s2">think I think it&#39;s just telling about</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.389" end="00:29:21.129" style="s2">like that the theory does hold right it</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.289" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">can hold but when it&#39;s in right</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.129" end="00:29:25.419" style="s2">relationship to the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:26.829" style="s2">the person yes</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.419" end="00:29:28.539" style="s2">and Socrates exemplifies that</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.829" end="00:29:30.820" style="s2">integration yeah completely</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.539" end="00:29:33.159" style="s2">and he&#39;s so I mean hadou talks about is</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.820" end="00:29:35.589" style="s2">there&#39;s an essay in that book the figure</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.159" end="00:29:37.509" style="s2">of Socrates right the figure of Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.589" end="00:29:40.599" style="s2">is as important as anything Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.509" end="00:29:43.049" style="s2">ever said because he precise he is so</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.599" end="00:29:45.669" style="s2">identified with that project at least in</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.049" end="00:29:49.329" style="s2">the Platonic version of Socrates he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.669" end="00:29:51.789" style="s2">identified with that that product of</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.329" end="00:29:54.609" style="s2">exemplifying always exemplifying never</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.789" end="00:29:57.429" style="s2">just speaking and in fact many of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.609" end="00:30:00.249" style="s2">many of the dialogues indicate that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.429" end="00:30:02.289" style="s2">speaking sort of bankrupts because</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.249" end="00:30:04.629" style="s2">what&#39;s actually carrying the dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.289" end="00:30:07.539" style="s2">forward is the transformation that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.629" end="00:30:09.759" style="s2">being exemplified in Socrates right and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.539" end="00:30:11.559" style="s2">what is it mate so this is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.759" end="00:30:14.529" style="s2">thing this kind of gets us into our I</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.559" end="00:30:17.169" style="s2">think our condition now right like this</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.529" end="00:30:21.849" style="s2">like I think Heidegger has a bead on</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.169" end="00:30:27.099" style="s2">this that is horrifying notion of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.849" end="00:30:33.729" style="s2">the mania of technique right of like</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.099" end="00:30:36.429" style="s2">what what I think the Nietzsche in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.729" end="00:30:39.549" style="s2">way that probably drove him insane right</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.429" end="00:30:42.269" style="s2">was able to like name the Anto theology</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.549" end="00:30:45.369" style="s2">of the time while in with time right</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.269" end="00:30:48.959" style="s2">which is we go from we go from this</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.369" end="00:30:52.539" style="s2">sense this implicit explicit sense that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.959" end="00:30:55.959" style="s2">that that the cosmic and the most like</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.539" end="00:30:58.809" style="s2">the far and the near are one writers in</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.959" end="00:31:01.239" style="s2">this very sophisticated way right and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.809" end="00:31:04.419" style="s2">like seemed took it seemed to underlie</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.239" end="00:31:05.410" style="s2">the way people lived in the way in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.419" end="00:31:07.990" style="s2">different levels</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.410" end="00:31:09.640" style="s2">it affords aspiration because though you</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.990" end="00:31:11.289" style="s2">have to have those there has to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.640" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">connection between them Oh or my current</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.289" end="00:31:18.669" style="s2">self for my future self are not</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:23.380" style="s2">connected yeah totally to where now the</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.669" end="00:31:25.360" style="s2">only thing that seen is valid and even</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.380" end="00:31:28.299" style="s2">with post-modernism is becoming that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.360" end="00:31:30.730" style="s2">that that&#39;s being being underpinned</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.299" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">right which is basically the sense in</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.730" end="00:31:36.460" style="s2">which where reality is somehow in the</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:39.700" style="s2">proposition and that and that your</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.460" end="00:31:42.010" style="s2">experience right is if it&#39;s connected to</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.700" end="00:31:45.220" style="s2">that at all it&#39;s not it&#39;s seen as</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.010" end="00:31:48.700" style="s2">subordinate to that to the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.220" end="00:31:50.080" style="s2">no way and I was I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.700" end="00:31:53.470" style="s2">this this is one of the big things that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.080" end="00:31:56.039" style="s2">I just I texted it to you I see if I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.470" end="00:31:58.690" style="s2">find it so I can kind of quote it it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.039" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">who is in thinking being where he was</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.690" end="00:32:06.429" style="s2">talking about Pluto nice and the sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:07.690" style="s2">of being as intelligibility yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.429" end="00:32:10.570" style="s2">right oh so central</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.690" end="00:32:13.600" style="s2">that&#39;s that I think pearls right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.570" end="00:32:16.360" style="s2">the thing that runs from Plato through</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.600" end="00:32:18.700" style="s2">to clitoris yes even into Aquinas in</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.360" end="00:32:21.100" style="s2">some ways yes and it&#39;s and it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.700" end="00:32:23.370" style="s2">that I think that far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.100" end="00:32:26.770" style="s2">Heidegger really inherited that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.370" end="00:32:29.169" style="s2">like it goes the being of being is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.770" end="00:32:32.470" style="s2">inexhaustible horizon of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.169" end="00:32:34.929" style="s2">I think so I mean I I think that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.470" end="00:32:40.980" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on I think you can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.929" end="00:32:40.980" style="s2">Heidegger wrestling with something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.070" end="00:32:47.320" style="s2">okay so part of what I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.159" end="00:32:48.940" style="s2">this is a good a good response to what</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.320" end="00:32:51.490" style="s2">we&#39;re doing here little see him off</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.940" end="00:32:54.370" style="s2">kilter a for a sec but part of what the</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.490" end="00:32:56.650" style="s2">meaning crisis is is we&#39;ve lost we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.370" end="00:33:01.690" style="s2">lost Socrates to put it into a slogan</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.650" end="00:33:03.429" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost that that and there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.690" end="00:33:04.840" style="s2">there&#39;s a phrase in Nietzsche that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.429" end="00:33:06.010" style="s2">really really important to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.840" end="00:33:07.690" style="s2">gotta talk about it in the series he</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.010" end="00:33:09.900" style="s2">says because he&#39;s very critical of</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.690" end="00:33:12.669" style="s2">Socrates throughout all of his writings</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.900" end="00:33:16.780" style="s2">but he but he there&#39;s this moment of</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.669" end="00:33:18.880" style="s2">disclosure he says I hate Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.780" end="00:33:20.770" style="s2">I reject Socrates or Socrates as false</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.880" end="00:33:24.400" style="s2">notice notice right</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.770" end="00:33:30.220" style="s2">I hate Socrates he is so close to me I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.400" end="00:33:31.500" style="s2">always fighting him because you see</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.220" end="00:33:36.220" style="s2">what&#39;s going on with Nietzsche right</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.500" end="00:33:37.900" style="s2">he&#39;s he he&#39;s proposing right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.220" end="00:33:41.410" style="s2">proposing the ubermensch but he&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.900" end="00:33:43.870" style="s2">actually providing right anything other</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.410" end="00:33:45.460" style="s2">than discourse and he&#39;s struggling and</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.870" end="00:33:48.460" style="s2">you can see him struggling with trying</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.460" end="00:33:50.680" style="s2">to but and he can&#39;t turn to the Platonic</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.460" end="00:33:52.660" style="s2">tradition because he rejects the the</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.680" end="00:33:55.000" style="s2">metaphysical position he thinks it</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.660" end="00:33:58.270" style="s2">represents the two worlds mythology and</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.000" end="00:34:00.610" style="s2">so he like he keeps getting drawn to</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.270" end="00:34:02.290" style="s2">somebody right and then I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.610" end="00:34:06.430" style="s2">what I think this is why he had this</p>

<p begin="00:34:11.740" end="00:34:16.240" style="s2">have to do something like what Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.360" end="00:34:18.100" style="s2">did you have to bring in all the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.240" end="00:34:22.090" style="s2">transformation you have to bring in</p>

<p begin="00:34:34.720" end="00:34:37.750" style="s2">hiding it because while I talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.520" end="00:34:39.640" style="s2">this before but good because Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.750" end="00:34:41.380" style="s2">is basically just negating you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.640" end="00:34:44.530" style="s2">Christian the Christian until Anto</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.380" end="00:34:46.000" style="s2">theology of his time and and I see</p>

<p begin="00:34:46.000" end="00:34:52.570" style="s2">and and see so I mean how digger it with</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.649" end="00:34:56.320" style="s2">the neologisms and the way he writes</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.570" end="00:34:59.290" style="s2">he&#39;s trying to engage yeah these other</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.320" end="00:35:02.260" style="s2">aspects um I have some criticisms of</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.290" end="00:35:05.890" style="s2">Heidegger at that point but but I do see</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.260" end="00:35:07.540" style="s2">him that he he sees I mean this is how</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.890" end="00:35:09.100" style="s2">I&#39;m reading him he sees that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.540" end="00:35:11.770" style="s2">that there&#39;s he&#39;s got to do something</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.100" end="00:35:15.280" style="s2">fundamentally different what need she</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.770" end="00:35:18.010" style="s2">did and that that that that that right</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.280" end="00:35:20.620" style="s2">the the that something like an agog a</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.010" end="00:35:22.390" style="s2">that the there is no ubermensch with out</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.620" end="00:35:25.630" style="s2">right anna gaga</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.390" end="00:35:30.510" style="s2">yeah least that&#39;s how i&#39;m reading part</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.630" end="00:35:33.510" style="s2">and so part of anna got good real quick</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.510" end="00:35:36.390" style="s2">an agave again okay so an agave is the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.510" end="00:35:38.820" style="s2">is this I think one of their sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.390" end="00:35:40.830" style="s2">profound insights in in Plato that I</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.820" end="00:35:44.900" style="s2">think it gets very clearly articulated</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.830" end="00:35:46.980" style="s2">annex located in finest and the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.900" end="00:35:49.290" style="s2">one of the things that drives my</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.980" end="00:35:51.570" style="s2">self-deception is I have conflict within</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.290" end="00:35:52.830" style="s2">my psyche my psyche is in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.570" end="00:35:54.990" style="s2">disordered and lacking in</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.830" end="00:35:56.730" style="s2">intelligibility and then one of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.990" end="00:35:58.470" style="s2">things that wisdom does is it more</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.730" end="00:35:59.910" style="s2">properly aligned and we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.470" end="00:36:01.410" style="s2">about these alignment ideas all through</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.910" end="00:36:04.560" style="s2">our dialogue write it more properly</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.410" end="00:36:05.790" style="s2">aligns and thereby reduces right that</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.560" end="00:36:08.270" style="s2">interest because the interest psychic</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.790" end="00:36:10.619" style="s2">conflict if my appetites are not</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.270" end="00:36:12.780" style="s2">properly in dialogue with my reason</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.619" end="00:36:16.320" style="s2">I&#39;ll myself because things will</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.780" end="00:36:18.810" style="s2">be improperly super salient to me etc so</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.320" end="00:36:21.510" style="s2">if I get those if I get what political</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.810" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">the inner justice right I&#39;m gonna reduce</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.510" end="00:36:26.100" style="s2">the the self-deception but as I reduce</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:27.420" style="s2">the self-deception and we will fight</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.100" end="00:36:32.010" style="s2">about this earlier it&#39;s gonna open up my</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.420" end="00:36:34.980" style="s2">capacity my insight to see deeper deeper</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.010" end="00:36:37.650" style="s2">patterns of reality but then as I get as</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.980" end="00:36:39.359" style="s2">I taste deeper reality as I develop a</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.650" end="00:36:41.460" style="s2">taste for mental reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.359" end="00:36:44.490" style="s2">I then internalize that back and I can</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.460" end="00:36:45.869" style="s2">more fully get at the depths of the the</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.490" end="00:36:48.420" style="s2">machinery of the psyche and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.869" end="00:36:50.130" style="s2">whole thing does this its cycles because</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.420" end="00:36:51.990" style="s2">they mutually afford each other and what</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.130" end="00:36:55.500" style="s2">I get is I get two of my strongest meta</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.990" end="00:36:57.600" style="s2">drives being Co satisfied my desire for</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.500" end="00:36:59.430" style="s2">inner peace and my desire to be in</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.600" end="00:37:01.140" style="s2">contact with what what is most real and</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.430" end="00:37:03.420" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s this is the anagen</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.140" end="00:37:05.070" style="s2">transformation ya know what latina is</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.420" end="00:37:07.350" style="s2">added to that because it&#39;s implicit I</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.070" end="00:37:10.170" style="s2">think in Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave is</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.350" end="00:37:12.359" style="s2">but what this means is it&#39;s I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.170" end="00:37:15.420" style="s2">cycling this way you see it and and agog</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.359" end="00:37:18.960" style="s2">a means to ascend because as they said</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.420" end="00:37:20.700" style="s2">you know as as my psyche let&#39;s say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.960" end="00:37:22.470" style="s2">say it more properly aligned go back to</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.700" end="00:37:24.000" style="s2">our earlier thing the four kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.470" end="00:37:27.750" style="s2">knowing and they complexify and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.000" end="00:37:29.850" style="s2">that allows me it enables me to confront</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.750" end="00:37:31.950" style="s2">more of the dynamical complexity of</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.850" end="00:37:34.470" style="s2">reality so reality can now be more</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.950" end="00:37:36.240" style="s2">disclosed to me I can couple to it right</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.470" end="00:37:39.450" style="s2">and then that&#39;s gonna tutor me I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.240" end="00:37:42.630" style="s2">be able to internalize that in right and</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.450" end="00:37:43.980" style="s2">so I the my complexification and the</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.630" end="00:37:46.440" style="s2">complexity of reality</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.980" end="00:37:48.030" style="s2">are coupled together in mutual like in</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.440" end="00:37:50.490" style="s2">this in this pattern of conformity</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.030" end="00:37:53.430" style="s2">conforming right I das intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.490" end="00:37:56.670" style="s2">patterns and so I think what Heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.430" end="00:37:58.950" style="s2">is trying to do with Alafaya I wish he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.670" end="00:38:00.060" style="s2">said it I think he was struggling but I</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.950" end="00:38:02.910" style="s2">think part of what he&#39;s trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.060" end="00:38:05.400" style="s2">with Alafaya is get us to that sense of</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.910" end="00:38:08.250" style="s2">the an agogic disclosure of truth as</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.400" end="00:38:12.030" style="s2">opposed to just a mere presentation all</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.250" end="00:38:13.470" style="s2">right all right so you know in Alafaya</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.030" end="00:38:15.119" style="s2">right the things are disclosed but</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.470" end="00:38:17.520" style="s2">they&#39;re disclosed there disclosed in a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.119" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">resonant fashion right not just</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.520" end="00:38:22.170" style="s2">disclosed right and and and and and</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:24.060" style="s2">that&#39;s why he talks so much about your</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.170" end="00:38:26.700" style="s2">comportment you know and he invokes he</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.060" end="00:38:31.980" style="s2">invokes Annie Oakley in the Oakland onic</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.700" end="00:38:34.109" style="s2">idea the leis in height right but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.980" end="00:38:36.359" style="s2">have some criticisms of Glazer night</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.109" end="00:38:38.100" style="s2">because I think it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s too far I</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.359" end="00:38:42.030" style="s2">think he&#39;s overreacting to the Cartesian</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.100" end="00:38:43.740" style="s2">imposition of the will and he&#39;s going so</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.030" end="00:38:44.970" style="s2">I agree with Barfield that he shouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.740" end="00:38:46.950" style="s2">have gone through the leis in height</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.970" end="00:38:48.690" style="s2">because that&#39;s only half of that cart</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.950" end="00:38:51.150" style="s2">yeah he&#39;s and I has to be paired with</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.690" end="00:38:53.130" style="s2">Dirk Brook breakthrough Dirk Brook</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.150" end="00:38:54.750" style="s2">breakthrough has to go laser night and</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.130" end="00:38:56.609" style="s2">Dirk Brook have to always be held</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.750" end="00:38:58.950" style="s2">together yeah I mean you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.609" end="00:38:59.760" style="s2">write and he&#39;s about breakthrough and</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.950" end="00:39:01.980" style="s2">what we&#39;re talking about with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.760" end="00:39:03.750" style="s2">circling breakthrough at the break a be</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.980" end="00:39:06.390" style="s2">an appropriate frame and then I have to</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.090" end="00:39:15.359" style="s2">about circling like that the practice of</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.250" end="00:39:19.500" style="s2">circling he is simply practice is being</p>

<p begin="00:40:27.180" end="00:40:33.640" style="s2">you gotta set it up but it has to catch</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.740" end="00:40:34.480" style="s2">for itself right yeah yeah yeah yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.640" end="00:40:37.810" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.480" end="00:40:40.480" style="s2">and now here&#39;s that um there&#39;s a few</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.810" end="00:40:42.880" style="s2">different threads but there&#39;s one in</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.480" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">which I&#39;m really interested in in this</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:49.480" style="s2">thing that you said in our email</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:51.610" style="s2">exchange about Rogers right they brought</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.480" end="00:40:53.590" style="s2">us right up to that point right which is</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.610" end="00:40:55.090" style="s2">we were tired we&#39;re breaking out Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.590" end="00:40:57.220" style="s2">and and all that kind of stuff and at</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.090" end="00:40:59.500" style="s2">the end you&#39;re like you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.220" end="00:41:02.800" style="s2">there&#39;s Socrates which is about</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.500" end="00:41:05.710" style="s2">basically transforming and rot Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.800" end="00:41:08.710" style="s2">lose about healing and he&#39;s like in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.710" end="00:41:13.270" style="s2">day I&#39;ll pick Socrates right yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.710" end="00:41:17.830" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right that now that&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.270" end="00:41:19.840" style="s2">third thing right where is where is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.830" end="00:41:22.540" style="s2">there&#39;s this relationship between you</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.840" end="00:41:23.770" style="s2">and I and the dialogue right but then</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.540" end="00:41:26.980" style="s2">there&#39;s this other thing that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.770" end="00:41:28.480" style="s2">starting to talk about which is because</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.980" end="00:41:30.250" style="s2">I&#39;m realizing like as we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.480" end="00:41:32.410" style="s2">about this is pretty much all I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.250" end="00:41:34.450" style="s2">interested in with was circling right</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.410" end="00:41:37.000" style="s2">like right there&#39;s a lot of stuff around</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.450" end="00:41:39.160" style="s2">relationships because it&#39;s that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.000" end="00:41:42.100" style="s2">the form that we we take right is</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.160" end="00:41:43.960" style="s2">looking at each other but but for me at</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.100" end="00:41:47.170" style="s2">the end of the day it isn&#39;t about deeper</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.960" end="00:41:50.500" style="s2">relationships as as the as the end goal</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.170" end="00:41:54.280" style="s2">right it&#39;s really about it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.500" end="00:41:58.480" style="s2">about what kind of what even kids are</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.280" end="00:42:03.190" style="s2">calls forth those relationships and this</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.480" end="00:42:04.750" style="s2">this third thing right that happened so</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.190" end="00:42:07.350" style="s2">you and I are dialoguing and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.750" end="00:42:10.940" style="s2">there&#39;s this other thing that starts to</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.350" end="00:42:13.300" style="s2">show up right I think is</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.940" end="00:42:15.829" style="s2">of like that you could say that the</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.300" end="00:42:19.819" style="s2">philosophical intimacy of this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.829" end="00:42:22.670" style="s2">I&#39;m think transcendent that that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.819" end="00:42:24.200" style="s2">some way realizes itself in here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.670" end="00:42:26.359" style="s2">Socratic circle that comes back around</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.200" end="00:42:28.869" style="s2">like realizes that it was the ground we</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.359" end="00:42:33.310" style="s2">were already standing on very much</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.869" end="00:42:37.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not just personal disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.310" end="00:42:39.560" style="s2">right but it&#39;s in many ways its</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.460" end="00:42:42.170" style="s2">transformative disclosure and foreign</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.560" end="00:42:43.760" style="s2">disclosure right you&#39;re like that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.170" end="00:42:46.819" style="s2">I&#39;d meant when I was offering Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.760" end="00:42:49.190" style="s2">beyond Rogers is because right there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.819" end="00:42:52.069" style="s2">sense in which there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.190" end="00:42:54.680" style="s2">an aspirational quality that emerges I</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.069" end="00:42:56.390" style="s2">mean and this again this circles back to</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.680" end="00:43:01.700" style="s2">Heidegger because when Heidegger sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.390" end="00:43:03.500" style="s2">you you know he he brings out that the</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.700" end="00:43:05.119" style="s2">logos is the gathering together so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.500" end="00:43:06.859" style="s2">it comes to belong together right he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:08.660" style="s2">that part of the meaning of logos had</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.859" end="00:43:10.940" style="s2">been for buried behind sort of word</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.660" end="00:43:12.140" style="s2">reason study and then he brings back</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.940" end="00:43:14.150" style="s2">well no but there&#39;s a more primordial</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.140" end="00:43:15.829" style="s2">meeting of and so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.150" end="00:43:18.050" style="s2">to get out with dia logos that know</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.829" end="00:43:19.069" style="s2">we&#39;re talking but then there&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.050" end="00:43:23.690" style="s2">that&#39;s what I mean there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.069" end="00:43:27.140" style="s2">takes shape and then it it&#39;s it is</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.690" end="00:43:29.930" style="s2">normatively grounding but also vetting</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.140" end="00:43:32.599" style="s2">what belongs in the dialogue right it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.930" end="00:43:34.069" style="s2">right and that&#39;s and I and that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.599" end="00:43:36.290" style="s2">think people start using very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.069" end="00:43:38.390" style="s2">spiritual language to talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.290" end="00:43:41.180" style="s2">yeah that emergence and that&#39;s clearly</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.390" end="00:43:44.660" style="s2">what what but Plato&#39;s invoking in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.180" end="00:43:50.119" style="s2">dialogues in a lot of in a lot of places</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.660" end="00:43:52.520" style="s2">and I guess like I said I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.119" end="00:43:55.099" style="s2">hold these Jordan often uses this thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.520" end="00:43:56.900" style="s2">about he&#39;s juggling balls so we got we</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.099" end="00:43:59.390" style="s2">got I just want to recap because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.900" end="00:44:02.450" style="s2">great you got that we&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.390" end="00:44:04.700" style="s2">back-and-forth like right and then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.450" end="00:44:06.410" style="s2">got that as people are an agave ik</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.700" end="00:44:09.170" style="s2">they&#39;re ascending right there so there</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.410" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this coordinated mutual</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.170" end="00:44:13.220" style="s2">disclosure and that&#39;s why it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:16.250" style="s2">love because mutually accelerating</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.220" end="00:44:17.750" style="s2">disclosure is love right between reality</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.250" end="00:44:19.280" style="s2">and the psyche the depths of reality in</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.750" end="00:44:21.109" style="s2">the depths of psyche are adducing</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.280" end="00:44:24.470" style="s2">calling out to each other and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.109" end="00:44:27.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the ontological and then theory</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.470" end="00:44:29.630" style="s2">see Oriya are dialoguing with each other</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.730" style="s2">and yet and then and i think what you</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.630" end="00:44:33.170" style="s2">put your finger on right now is theirs I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.730" end="00:44:35.810" style="s2">would say it&#39;s the fourth there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.170" end="00:44:38.960" style="s2">fourth thing that between all three of</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.810" end="00:44:41.000" style="s2">those that&#39;s really hard to speak but</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.960" end="00:44:42.410" style="s2">it&#39;s but it&#39;s taking shape between all</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.000" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">three of those because those three</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.410" end="00:44:45.740" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was trying to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:47.750" style="s2">axes model they&#39;re not they&#39;re not all</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.740" end="00:44:53.260" style="s2">fog &#39;&#39;&#39;l to each other they&#39;re highly</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.750" end="00:44:58.160" style="s2">coordinated yes each other right right</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.260" end="00:45:01.760" style="s2">is that that thing is that the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:04.760" style="s2">that that brings the four ways of</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.760" end="00:45:06.800" style="s2">knowing into deeper complexity what</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.760" end="00:45:09.619" style="s2">supplies it I think so</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.800" end="00:45:12.290" style="s2">is it I think it intimated that horizon</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.619" end="00:45:17.690" style="s2">I think I think it does in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.290" end="00:45:19.609" style="s2">that it&#39;s only when okay so this is this</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.690" end="00:45:20.270" style="s2">is speculation in the a and the good</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.609" end="00:45:23.000" style="s2">sense of the word</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.270" end="00:45:24.200" style="s2">right we&#39;re trying we&#39;re trying right</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.000" end="00:45:26.270" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s what it that&#39;s what it says</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.200" end="00:45:30.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what the S they used to be in sa</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.270" end="00:45:31.670" style="s2">a right to try we&#39;re trying here so and</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.440" end="00:45:33.230" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things also that I</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.670" end="00:45:35.839" style="s2">like about the Socratic dialogues people</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.230" end="00:45:39.170" style="s2">try in the treatise nobody&#39;s trying they</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.839" end="00:45:42.170" style="s2">just give you their final results I said</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.170" end="00:45:46.730" style="s2">but but Montaigne brought back the</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.170" end="00:45:52.250" style="s2">original meaning so I I think when we</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.730" end="00:45:54.470" style="s2">get when we were in that state and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.250" end="00:45:57.230" style="s2">both intrapersonal and interpersonal and</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.470" end="00:46:00.710" style="s2">neutral level right as we said it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.230" end="00:46:05.359" style="s2">of those right I think that like I said</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.710" end="00:46:11.230" style="s2">that gives us our best coupling so that</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.359" end="00:46:14.180" style="s2">we we are we have I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.230" end="00:46:16.250" style="s2">platini&#39;s his sense of right the you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.180" end="00:46:18.200" style="s2">reading Shaw&#39;s work on theory here right</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.250" end="00:46:21.380" style="s2">that we have the the best state of</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.200" end="00:46:23.450" style="s2">receptivity for the disclosure of what</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.380" end="00:46:24.770" style="s2">is deepest right that we shouldn&#39;t be we</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.450" end="00:46:26.089" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be idolatrous about that we</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.770" end="00:46:28.369" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t say now I have seen the face</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.089" end="00:46:30.890" style="s2">of God or something blasphemous like</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.369" end="00:46:33.380" style="s2">that because that&#39;s - that&#39;s - that&#39;s -</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.890" end="00:46:35.270" style="s2">that&#39;s to forget our mortality to use</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.380" end="00:46:36.950" style="s2">you know some high daguerreian language</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.270" end="00:46:37.940" style="s2">there but that&#39;s the that&#39;s sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.950" end="00:46:40.490" style="s2">best</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.940" end="00:46:44.200" style="s2">icon and I don&#39;t mean a picture I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.490" end="00:46:48.200" style="s2">an embodied present seeing opening</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.200" end="00:46:50.690" style="s2">transforming that&#39;s our best icon of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.200" end="00:46:53.420" style="s2">ultimate that&#39;s what I think and so I do</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.690" end="00:46:55.880" style="s2">think it acts therefore as a normative</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.420" end="00:47:00.500" style="s2">touchstone for us on coordinating the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.880" end="00:47:02.210" style="s2">four kinds of knowing wow that&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.500" end="00:47:04.220" style="s2">that&#39;s my best attempt they think of</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.210" end="00:47:12.289" style="s2">Ellis isn&#39;t be with the attempts this is</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.220" end="00:47:16.130" style="s2">kind of like as as David White would say</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.289" end="00:47:19.549" style="s2">may we have a kind of conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.130" end="00:47:26.690" style="s2">our our linguistic loop called ourselves</p>

<p begin="00:47:48.549" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">we should have recorded it but we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.260" end="00:47:55.309" style="s2">gonna maybe record the next one but on</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:57.170" style="s2">the other hand there&#39;s good reason why</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.309" end="00:47:59.029" style="s2">we&#39;re waiting but the discussion with</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.170" end="00:48:00.109" style="s2">him and the discussion I&#39;m having with</p>

<p begin="00:48:06.380" end="00:48:10.099" style="s2">see this is the other thing and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.539" end="00:48:12.500" style="s2">wondering if this is part of the forth</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.099" end="00:48:14.510" style="s2">right is you talk about this more sort</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.500" end="00:48:17.299" style="s2">of meta dia logos there&#39;s a there&#39;s a de</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.510" end="00:48:19.010" style="s2">logos happening between the dialogues</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.299" end="00:48:21.170" style="s2">right and you talk if you often do your</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.010" end="00:48:24.970" style="s2">hands furling thing which I really like</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.170" end="00:48:27.920" style="s2">right right right and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.970" end="00:48:29.539" style="s2">such a fantastic gesture because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.920" end="00:48:32.150" style="s2">sort of like a Harry Potter fashion I</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.539" end="00:48:33.950" style="s2">sort of see all these globes there are</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.150" end="00:48:35.839" style="s2">all these different dialogues and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.950" end="00:48:40.400" style="s2">they&#39;re all right they&#39;re all swirling</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.839" end="00:48:42.170" style="s2">together yeah and so yeah I think every</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.400" end="00:48:44.869" style="s2">one of these and then also what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.170" end="00:48:48.980" style="s2">happening between them is helping me</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.869" end="00:48:50.900" style="s2">helping me tremendously and it again</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.980" end="00:48:51.650" style="s2">it&#39;s not just theory because I&#39;m coming</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.900" end="00:48:55.010" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.650" end="00:48:58.460" style="s2">the conclusion that that one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.010" end="00:49:00.950" style="s2">in which the meaning crisis expresses</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.460" end="00:49:03.980" style="s2">itself to us is in our deep forgetting</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.950" end="00:49:06.440" style="s2">of Socrates our deep deep and all of</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.980" end="00:49:08.300" style="s2">this what&#39;s happening in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.440" end="00:49:10.610" style="s2">I talk about in this series of sati this</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.300" end="00:49:16.100" style="s2">is to deeply remember we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.610" end="00:49:18.170" style="s2">deeply remember again right right and it</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.100" end="00:49:20.720" style="s2">seems to me to tell me if this is this</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.170" end="00:49:24.230" style="s2">if this this fits and what we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.720" end="00:49:25.970" style="s2">is that maybe because it&#39;s also in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.230" end="00:49:27.530" style="s2">background you know I&#39;m reading these</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.970" end="00:49:29.330" style="s2">books and all these conversations and</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.530" end="00:49:35.360" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of backdrop of like</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.330" end="00:49:37.780" style="s2">the religion of their religion and and</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.360" end="00:49:40.550" style="s2">I&#39;m getting this sense of this</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.780" end="00:49:44.870" style="s2">remembering right of the switching</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.550" end="00:49:48.080" style="s2">priorities right of where something</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.870" end="00:49:52.670" style="s2">something about this this restoration of</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.080" end="00:49:56.630" style="s2">the right place of theory in that in</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.670" end="00:50:00.680" style="s2">that part in it in that we stand on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.630" end="00:50:03.680" style="s2">theory that becomes our ground right</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.680" end="00:50:07.070" style="s2">that then if it&#39;s good theory right it</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.680" end="00:50:09.890" style="s2">allows us to see to move towards the</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.070" end="00:50:13.460" style="s2">horizon to hear the horizon better right</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.890" end="00:50:15.620" style="s2">and it&#39;s weaving but it&#39;s but that that</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.460" end="00:50:19.490" style="s2">it&#39;s this relational component like this</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.620" end="00:50:23.270" style="s2">this AG agog a this circle the the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.490" end="00:50:25.460" style="s2">Socratic dialogue is though is the</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.270" end="00:50:29.840" style="s2">working of those things out but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.460" end="00:50:32.660" style="s2">really really important not to diminish</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.840" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">theory at all like this no no very much</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.660" end="00:50:40.340" style="s2">very much its rightful like where where</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">it&#39;s powerful right yes and how yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.340" end="00:50:45.230" style="s2">that it&#39;s measure is does it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:51.260" style="s2">it&#39;s measure of whether or not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.230" end="00:50:55.250" style="s2">working is does it allow us to to become</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.260" end="00:50:57.140" style="s2">closer to the mystery right this is and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.250" end="00:50:58.550" style="s2">I think I think this is and this is</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.140" end="00:51:00.980" style="s2">somebody we haven&#39;t talked very much</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.550" end="00:51:03.110" style="s2">about but I&#39;ve mentioned it before I</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.980" end="00:51:05.060" style="s2">think this is the deep inside of James I</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.110" end="00:51:08.030" style="s2">think this is what pragmatism it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.060" end="00:51:12.050" style="s2">votes to be pragmatism I think has been</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.030" end="00:51:14.270" style="s2">sort of that made very thin in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.050" end="00:51:16.040" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a particular theory of truth and</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.270" end="00:51:18.380" style="s2">it&#39;s particularly a theory about sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.040" end="00:51:20.720" style="s2">how you do epistemology I think that</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.380" end="00:51:25.030" style="s2">what you just articulated is no no</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.720" end="00:51:27.350" style="s2">pragmatism because James is much more I</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.030" end="00:51:30.110" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I want to say here like</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.350" end="00:51:33.260" style="s2">religiously a religious sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.110" end="00:51:35.780" style="s2">right but but what never wanting to lose</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.260" end="00:51:37.520" style="s2">never wanting to lose the value in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.780" end="00:51:39.080" style="s2">role of scientific theory that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.520" end="00:51:42.830" style="s2">he&#39;s very much an important figure for</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.080" end="00:51:45.140" style="s2">me as well and so I see pragmatism not</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.830" end="00:51:47.510" style="s2">just as like well you know truth is just</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.140" end="00:51:49.250" style="s2">what&#39;s utility and what we do is we were</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.510" end="00:51:51.470" style="s2">just Alaba loose in our epistemology it</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.250" end="00:51:55.220" style="s2">no I think what you just articulated is</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.470" end="00:51:58.370" style="s2">like no no the deep deep practice of</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.220" end="00:52:00.310" style="s2">getting theory in the right place in</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.370" end="00:52:03.580" style="s2">there and in the right set of</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.310" end="00:52:07.190" style="s2">responsibilities to the other knowings</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.580" end="00:52:09.050" style="s2">that&#39;s what pragmatism is on about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.190" end="00:52:11.540" style="s2">it&#39;s about that the propositional</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.050" end="00:52:13.700" style="s2">knowing is not self-sufficient and has</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.540" end="00:52:16.910" style="s2">to be put into right relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.700" end="00:52:18.950" style="s2">the others and I think that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.910" end="00:52:23.360" style="s2">explored much more when people are</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.950" end="00:52:26.060" style="s2">invoking pragmatism I it&#39;s it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.360" end="00:52:28.070" style="s2">you know now I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m the</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.060" end="00:52:31.970" style="s2">only person saying this there are deep</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.070" end="00:52:35.780" style="s2">readers I think ro ro w/e reads James in</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.970" end="00:52:37.670" style="s2">this way very very deeply so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.780" end="00:52:39.710" style="s2">claiming any sort of exclusivity there</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.670" end="00:52:41.390" style="s2">are there are I think people reading</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.710" end="00:52:46.040" style="s2">James and reading pragmatism this way</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.390" end="00:52:49.220" style="s2">very profoundly but that&#39;s not by by any</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.040" end="00:52:50.750" style="s2">means the sort of most prevalent view of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.220" end="00:52:53.390" style="s2">what pragmatism is or what it means</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.750" end="00:52:55.940" style="s2">right right so it&#39;s like it&#39;s that you</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.390" end="00:52:57.910" style="s2">could say that it&#39;s it&#39;s a and I get to</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.940" end="00:53:01.730" style="s2">sense with James too like it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.910" end="00:53:03.830" style="s2">James&#39;s bet he&#39;s he&#39;s really I read</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.730" end="00:53:06.380" style="s2">James and you kind of like end up</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.830" end="00:53:10.850" style="s2">somewhere that you yep it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.380" end="00:53:13.550" style="s2">circling very interesting like but he</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.850" end="00:53:18.350" style="s2">does seem to be he has deep mystical</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.550" end="00:53:18.860" style="s2">very much much but it sounds like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.350" end="00:53:22.250" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.860" end="00:53:24.860" style="s2">like we&#39;re I think you know America you</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.250" end="00:53:28.400" style="s2">know pragmatism is understood more like</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.860" end="00:53:32.780" style="s2">okay like it&#39;s true enough right in</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.400" end="00:53:35.900" style="s2">relationship to our goal yeah well but</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.780" end="00:53:38.210" style="s2">if we if we replace goal right with like</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.900" end="00:53:40.730" style="s2">like a mystery the phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.210" end="00:53:44.420" style="s2">mystery if the goal is something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.730" end="00:53:46.490" style="s2">what is the is the you could say that</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.420" end="00:53:49.280" style="s2">the the inexhaustible intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.490" end="00:53:50.840" style="s2">that they&#39;re in intimate relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.280" end="00:53:55.730" style="s2">with that and how we know is because</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.840" end="00:54:01.780" style="s2">we&#39;re because people people get closer</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.730" end="00:54:04.550" style="s2">to it and they become they become more</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.780" end="00:54:12.290" style="s2">the world becomes more filled with sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.550" end="00:54:13.430" style="s2">right and I&#39;d go stronger and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.290" end="00:54:16.460" style="s2">trying to bite you I think the world</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.430" end="00:54:18.220" style="s2">gets better and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.460" end="00:54:20.870" style="s2">ultimately what&#39;s driving James</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.220" end="00:54:23.630" style="s2">pragmatism isn&#39;t just you know pick pick</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.870" end="00:54:25.070" style="s2">what&#39;s useful or utility there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.630" end="00:54:26.750" style="s2">in which and it&#39;s not that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.070" end="00:54:30.620" style="s2">good enough no it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.750" end="00:54:35.360" style="s2">making good but but there isn&#39;t any kind</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.620" end="00:54:38.450" style="s2">of final yes propositional</p>

<p begin="00:55:38.790" end="00:55:41.700" style="s2">of the top five books I read in my life</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.140" end="00:55:42.840" style="s2">and I be notified it a couple of times</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.700" end="00:55:45.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve led it with other people</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.840" end="00:55:47.940" style="s2">explicitly because you can see you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.750" end="00:55:50.160" style="s2">see that do you know the way huh</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.940" end="00:55:53.870" style="s2">all these things are coming together in</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.160" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">a really profound way right Wow</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.870" end="00:55:59.910" style="s2">God is the sense of the tension between</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:02.370" style="s2">I&#39;m just present to that just in this</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.910" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">conversation I present to it is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.370" end="00:56:08.430" style="s2">of crescendo but also like what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:11.310" style="s2">talking about like love with the four</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.430" end="00:56:14.640" style="s2">ways of knowing leg and then this sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.310" end="00:56:20.790" style="s2">this citizens deep mystical pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.640" end="00:56:23.130" style="s2">right of that theory like one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.790" end="00:56:26.430" style="s2">measures that makes a good theory is it</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.130" end="00:56:30.840" style="s2">is it we can stand on it to move into</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.430" end="00:56:33.950" style="s2">more so taking James very deeply it</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.840" end="00:56:38.430" style="s2">becomes a viable listen to the word</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.950" end="00:56:40.290" style="s2">viable option for us huh right uh and</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.430" end="00:56:41.970" style="s2">this is very much like what Frankfurt</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.290" end="00:56:43.200" style="s2">talks about when things the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.970" end="00:56:44.760" style="s2">things being unthinkable when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.200" end="00:56:46.770" style="s2">think about for us and he doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.760" end="00:56:49.790" style="s2">inferable or imaginable he means that</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.770" end="00:56:52.440" style="s2">that an agent arena relationship is</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.790" end="00:57:00.950" style="s2">inhabitable and internalized aboe and</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.440" end="00:57:00.950" style="s2">liveable for us yeah so I yeah I I that</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:09.240" style="s2">you have a you have a phrase that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.290" end="00:57:11.820" style="s2">use that I think I think epitomizes what</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.240" end="00:57:14.970" style="s2">you were just saying which is you you</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.820" end="00:57:18.750" style="s2">have this race come to terms yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.970" end="00:57:21.660" style="s2">captures both you know conceptualization</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.750" end="00:57:24.630" style="s2">yeah articulation but also confronting</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.660" end="00:57:27.420" style="s2">being challenged and transformed right</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.630" end="00:57:30.690" style="s2">like really coming into contact with</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.420" end="00:57:33.600" style="s2">something hey right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.690" end="00:57:36.870" style="s2">yes and well yeah you&#39;re right yeah when</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.600" end="00:57:40.440" style="s2">you come to terms the terms you come to</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.870" end="00:57:42.630" style="s2">allow you to stand up to have more power</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.440" end="00:57:45.030" style="s2">on which to come to terms with yeah</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.630" end="00:57:45.900" style="s2">you&#39;re not avoiding your not dissimulate</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.030" end="00:57:48.420" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.900" end="00:57:50.369" style="s2">diluting your cut like we say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.420" end="00:57:52.500" style="s2">coming to terms with something right</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.369" end="00:57:55.319" style="s2">we&#39;re facing it and we&#39;re saying okay</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.500" end="00:57:58.140" style="s2">I&#39;m going to now open myself up to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.319" end="00:58:00.630" style="s2">reality of this and but we&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.140" end="00:58:02.369" style="s2">saying that I what I&#39;m doing in that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.630" end="00:58:04.349" style="s2">confrontation is I&#39;m not going into it</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.369" end="00:58:06.750" style="s2">with horror I&#39;m going into it with the</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.349" end="00:58:09.029" style="s2">real expectation of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.750" end="00:58:11.309" style="s2">being possible articulation being</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.029" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">possible within that I love that phrase</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.309" end="00:58:15.270" style="s2">I love it when you use it and you use it</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:17.730" style="s2">in a perspicacious manner you will use</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.270" end="00:58:19.200" style="s2">it at Kairat ik moment within a</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.730" end="00:58:21.510" style="s2">conversation you&#39;ll bring it out and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.200" end="00:58:23.549" style="s2">what it does is it gives it gives a</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.510" end="00:58:25.500" style="s2">turning that it&#39;s often needed in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.549" end="00:58:28.680" style="s2">conversation and your use of that is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.500" end="00:58:40.829" style="s2">really really really wonderful Wow how</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.680" end="00:58:42.059" style="s2">procedural of me yeah actually that one</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.829" end="00:58:43.559" style="s2">of the things I want at some point I</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.059" end="00:58:45.900" style="s2">want to talk with you about how you came</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.559" end="00:58:47.220" style="s2">to the four ways of knowing like because</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.900" end="00:58:51.559" style="s2">it&#39;s it they&#39;re just one of those things</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.220" end="00:58:55.170" style="s2">where it&#39;s it&#39;s funny I&#39;ve tried to like</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.559" end="00:58:57.900" style="s2">try to apart but it does seem like</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.170" end="00:59:01.799" style="s2">there&#39;s something really you keep you</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.900" end="00:59:06.270" style="s2">kid everything I think of implies one of</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.799" end="00:59:09.329" style="s2">them great so I mean the best answer to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.270" end="00:59:11.789" style="s2">that is I came and this and this is not</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.329" end="00:59:14.430" style="s2">meant to be coy or I came to it in</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.789" end="00:59:16.710" style="s2">dialog with my students I came to it</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.430" end="00:59:19.079" style="s2">from discussing and working out and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.710" end="00:59:20.819" style="s2">know and you know there was already this</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.079" end="00:59:22.500" style="s2">distinction between the proposition of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.819" end="00:59:25.260" style="s2">the procedural already existed within</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.500" end="00:59:27.329" style="s2">philosophy and psychology and then as I</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.260" end="00:59:29.880" style="s2">started to work with it one of my</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.329" end="00:59:32.220" style="s2">students like in dialogue with him yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.880" end="00:59:33.900" style="s2">great cos Horace you know this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.220" end="00:59:36.390" style="s2">the perspectival aspect he brought it</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.900" end="00:59:40.349" style="s2">and all right and then you know and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.390" end="00:59:41.940" style="s2">I was talking with another student I was</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.349" end="00:59:43.710" style="s2">doing an independent study project with</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.940" end="00:59:45.329" style="s2">her and she was saying I get it but what</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.710" end="00:59:47.670" style="s2">about the the participatory and it like</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.329" end="00:59:49.140" style="s2">she had a very nascent notion of it but</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.670" end="00:59:51.150" style="s2">it sort of it was like somebody brought</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.140" end="00:59:54.539" style="s2">them matching the tinder in my mind I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.150" end="00:59:56.789" style="s2">was off right and so then I like and</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.539" end="00:59:58.570" style="s2">then I really started diving very deeply</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.789" end="01:00:00.940" style="s2">into that and but you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.570" end="01:00:03.880" style="s2">and this all the stuff with Hado and</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.940" end="01:00:08.040" style="s2">then you know and then how was that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.880" end="01:00:15.340" style="s2">period of time when was that ah so I</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.040" end="01:00:17.470" style="s2">guess starting around 2006 seven that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.340" end="01:00:20.530" style="s2">what I&#39;m starting to do that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.470" end="01:00:23.200" style="s2">that&#39;s when I start yeah it&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.530" end="01:00:25.540" style="s2">start teaching the Buddhism in Kansai</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.200" end="01:00:27.160" style="s2">course and the meaning crisis argument</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.540" end="01:00:29.410" style="s2">starts to gel so those things are sort</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.160" end="01:00:33.490" style="s2">of Co emergent and they&#39;re talking to</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.410" end="01:00:35.170" style="s2">each other at the same time the what the</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.490" end="01:00:38.980" style="s2">COG site of course that you put you put</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.170" end="01:00:44.020" style="s2">up on YouTube a few years back is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.980" end="01:00:46.030" style="s2">like how many of how many of you so that</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.020" end="01:00:55.840" style="s2">the Buddhism and Caucasoid course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.030" end="01:00:58.690" style="s2">I think that was from 2000 and 15 or 16</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.840" end="01:01:01.480" style="s2">and by that time I had been teaching the</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.690" end="01:01:04.560" style="s2">course often twice a year for over ten</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.480" end="01:01:08.470" style="s2">years so that course had come to quite</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.560" end="01:01:10.060" style="s2">you know a kind of I don&#39;t want to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.470" end="01:01:12.310" style="s2">consistency because that&#39;s done static</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.060" end="01:01:18.900" style="s2">but it had come to a kind of coherence</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.310" end="01:01:21.940" style="s2">rain but then when when that happened</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.900" end="01:01:26.290" style="s2">kind of the responses I was getting from</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.940" end="01:01:28.540" style="s2">people the series when I originally just</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.290" end="01:01:29.740" style="s2">uploaded this series just to put it out</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.540" end="01:01:31.630" style="s2">there my students would have it it would</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.740" end="01:01:34.000" style="s2">be it was more of a pedagogical tool but</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.630" end="01:01:38.080" style="s2">when I when I saw the response beyond</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.000" end="01:01:40.030" style="s2">just my students um it sort of made me</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.080" end="01:01:41.470" style="s2">think and then one of my students again</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.030" end="01:01:42.730" style="s2">after he had done the course with me and</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.470" end="01:01:45.220" style="s2">finished another quote he came up and he</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.730" end="01:01:48.090" style="s2">said it was Allen Keon who whose name</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.220" end="01:01:51.520" style="s2">appears in the credits of every episode</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.090" end="01:01:56.950" style="s2">he said you know you&#39;ve got something</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.520" end="01:01:59.770" style="s2">here and but the previous series the way</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.950" end="01:02:02.050" style="s2">the you know the production value is so</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.770" end="01:02:03.250" style="s2">poor it&#39;s actually it&#39;s imprisoning what</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.050" end="01:02:05.440" style="s2">you have to say is preventing it from</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.250" end="01:02:07.990" style="s2">being work and he said you know I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.440" end="01:02:10.150" style="s2">professional my dad&#39;s a professional and</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.990" end="01:02:12.370" style="s2">he&#39;s got friends let&#39;s really raise the</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.150" end="01:02:14.310" style="s2">production quality</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.370" end="01:02:20.290" style="s2">and so I thought about that and I said</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.310" end="01:02:22.030" style="s2">okay but I want and I came to as I said</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.290" end="01:02:23.710" style="s2">like I want a real I want you to really</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.030" end="01:02:25.780" style="s2">understand that this is I&#39;m gonna ask</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.710" end="01:02:27.490" style="s2">for bigger commitment because I want to</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.780" end="01:02:29.770" style="s2">incorporate the whole argument that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.490" end="01:02:31.150" style="s2">never presented because I have different</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.770" end="01:02:33.160" style="s2">arguments different parts of the whole</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.150" end="01:02:35.050" style="s2">argument in different courses and I want</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.160" end="01:02:37.630" style="s2">to put them all together and also with</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.050" end="01:02:39.400" style="s2">all of my ongoing recent research</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.630" end="01:02:40.720" style="s2">because the best teaching is to share</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.400" end="01:02:43.660" style="s2">your most current and insightful</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.720" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">learning with people right and I said</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.660" end="01:02:46.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what that&#39;s when I said don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:47.560" style="s2">this if you don&#39;t want to but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.600" end="01:02:49.300" style="s2">what I&#39;m gonna ask you to commit to</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.560" end="01:02:51.370" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna not only improve the quality</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.300" end="01:02:54.670" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna increase the scope and the</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.370" end="01:02:56.650" style="s2">depth of this and try to get right and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.670" end="01:02:59.370" style="s2">he said I&#39;m in I&#39;m in so that&#39;s how it</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.650" end="01:03:03.280" style="s2">happened Wow okay got it</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.370" end="01:03:05.140" style="s2">I&#39;m just a you know it&#39;s it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.280" end="01:03:08.580" style="s2">thing I just wanted to kind of ask ask</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.140" end="01:03:11.740" style="s2">you about cuz I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m noticing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.580" end="01:03:15.340" style="s2">as I understand your work more and as</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.740" end="01:03:19.210" style="s2">I&#39;m reading a lot of the the source</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.340" end="01:03:22.030" style="s2">material right that like I can I can</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.210" end="01:03:23.770" style="s2">feel I can feel in reading basically</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.030" end="01:03:25.150" style="s2">because there is this quality of reading</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.770" end="01:03:26.770" style="s2">for me that and I think this has</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.150" end="01:03:29.920" style="s2">something to do with actually my reading</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.770" end="01:03:31.960" style="s2">disability like where where it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.920" end="01:03:35.710" style="s2">little bit more for me it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.960" end="01:03:40.420" style="s2">like I go on a walk with somebody I</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.710" end="01:03:42.760" style="s2">don&#39;t come out with necessarily what</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.420" end="01:03:47.290" style="s2">what it feels like the what I come back</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.760" end="01:03:49.810" style="s2">with is not the facts of the walk but</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.290" end="01:03:51.040" style="s2">with a different person I feel like a</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.810" end="01:03:53.170" style="s2">different person I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.040" end="01:03:55.720" style="s2">differently I&#39;m seeing like the world</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.170" end="01:03:58.570" style="s2">discloses itself differently to me and</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.720" end="01:04:00.550" style="s2">so there&#39;s this anyway where like as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.570" end="01:04:03.250" style="s2">reading part of what I&#39;m part of what</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.550" end="01:04:07.960" style="s2">I&#39;m also appreciating is the ride that</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.250" end="01:04:09.610" style="s2">you&#39;ve been on right coming in coming to</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.960" end="01:04:11.590" style="s2">terms with what you&#39;ve been coming to</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.610" end="01:04:14.110" style="s2">terms with on your videos and listening</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.590" end="01:04:16.390" style="s2">to your lectures right I&#39;m also really</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.110" end="01:04:20.740" style="s2">present to this had you&#39;ve been in kind</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.390" end="01:04:22.870" style="s2">of deep dialogue with some I think some</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.740" end="01:04:25.150" style="s2">authors like some definitely some</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.870" end="01:04:26.260" style="s2">authors and philosophers and but</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.150" end="01:04:28.690" style="s2">although I get this sense</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.260" end="01:04:32.020" style="s2">like after meeting Chris like with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.690" end="01:04:33.910" style="s2">like a lot of students like yeah okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.020" end="01:04:35.560" style="s2">one of the things that chris said was he</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.910" end="01:04:37.630" style="s2">said you know he felt I really</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.560" end="01:04:40.840" style="s2">appreciated he said he said I feel like</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.630" end="01:04:45.240" style="s2">my constitute like I&#39;m constituted by in</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.840" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">some sense all of these deep</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.240" end="01:04:50.680" style="s2">relationships and conversations</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:53.140" style="s2">historically like he&#39;s um he&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.680" end="01:04:56.220" style="s2">yeah I feel like I&#39;m constituted by</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.140" end="01:05:01.180" style="s2">those conversations thank you very much</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.220" end="01:05:04.600" style="s2">as am i and I mean one of the things you</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.180" end="01:05:06.580" style="s2">no doubt seeing is the indebtedness I</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.600" end="01:05:09.490" style="s2">have to the people you&#39;re reading and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.580" end="01:05:12.450" style="s2">what I wanted to want to articulate now</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.490" end="01:05:16.110" style="s2">is the indebtedness to my students for</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.450" end="01:05:18.970" style="s2">where I am and what I&#39;m capable of doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.110" end="01:05:20.590" style="s2">and and you know and many of these</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.970" end="01:05:23.640" style="s2">students go on to be much more than</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.590" end="01:05:27.270" style="s2">students like Chris and Jen song and</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.640" end="01:05:29.950" style="s2">Talia and Leo Ferraro and you know</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.270" end="01:05:38.800" style="s2">there&#39;s so many of my students who go on</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.950" end="01:05:42.070" style="s2">to be so much more and Anderson Todd I</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.800" end="01:05:44.290" style="s2">mean I did many of my my students go on</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.070" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">to be people who become constitutive of</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.290" end="01:05:50.350" style="s2">what I&#39;m capable of doing in the way you</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:56.020" style="s2">were just articulating III I am deeply</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.350" end="01:06:03.220" style="s2">grateful that&#39;s why I try so often to to</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.020" end="01:06:05.380" style="s2">share yeah credit because because it</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.220" end="01:06:07.060" style="s2">because the reality of the distributed</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.380" end="01:06:11.230" style="s2">cognition and the dialectic is more</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.060" end="01:06:12.880" style="s2">important than John breaking yeah I I</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.230" end="01:06:15.570" style="s2">think I just felt I think I just didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.880" end="01:06:18.790" style="s2">really appreciate it what you just</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.570" end="01:06:20.980" style="s2">replace where they live in you right</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.790" end="01:06:23.110" style="s2">it&#39;s really interesting because we need</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.980" end="01:06:24.700" style="s2">to notice this like like whenever you</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.110" end="01:06:28.690" style="s2">talk about the people that you feel</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.700" end="01:06:32.470" style="s2">deeply indebted with right and grateful</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.690" end="01:06:34.690" style="s2">for there is a there&#39;s a dropping back</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.470" end="01:06:37.870" style="s2">and there&#39;s like ever and they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.690" end="01:06:39.320" style="s2">slowing down and you&#39;re just like you</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.870" end="01:06:43.100" style="s2">feel in the present</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.320" end="01:06:46.790" style="s2">it&#39;s very much the movie you and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.100" end="01:06:49.940" style="s2">interesting is like I can if I if I if I</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.790" end="01:06:53.870" style="s2">hold that in mind when you&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.940" end="01:06:57.260" style="s2">precipice of the thing like I can feel</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.870" end="01:06:59.090" style="s2">very much this in a certain sense</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.260" end="01:07:01.610" style="s2">something like something like the-- or</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.090" end="01:07:03.410" style="s2">like the the theory in some way in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.610" end="01:07:05.500" style="s2">role that we&#39;re talking about theory of</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.410" end="01:07:11.510" style="s2">like on some level all those</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.500" end="01:07:15.290" style="s2">relationships right you stand on and</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.510" end="01:07:19.670" style="s2">they allow for more right yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.290" end="01:07:22.700" style="s2">very much a legacy right like sort of</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.670" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">within me kind of thing yeah I feel</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.700" end="01:07:30.880" style="s2">those those people that I mentioned as</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:36.800" style="s2">well as as my partnership with Messara</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.880" end="01:07:39.710" style="s2">which is a soui generous as we talked</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.800" end="01:07:44.060" style="s2">about on the last dialogue but those are</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.710" end="01:07:47.090" style="s2">those I don&#39;t want to get too out of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.060" end="01:07:50.930" style="s2">biographical here but those around me in</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.090" end="01:07:53.690" style="s2">a way that keeps that creative tension</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.930" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">with the stepping to the precipice right</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.690" end="01:08:01.640" style="s2">they give me a groundedness so that I</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:08:02.840" style="s2">can go even closer to the edge and so</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.640" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">this is something I was going to mention</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.840" end="01:08:06.860" style="s2">there&#39;s something I like about Tillich</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:08.570" style="s2">and how he when he integrated Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.860" end="01:08:11.330" style="s2">and Christianity together he emphasizes</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.570" end="01:08:13.670" style="s2">you know the tonus the tensions the</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.330" end="01:08:20.150" style="s2">tensions that need to be maintained</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.670" end="01:08:22.190" style="s2">always and so so like I don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.150" end="01:08:23.720" style="s2">use a term like anchor cuz anchor sounds</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.190" end="01:08:26.150" style="s2">like you know it&#39;s holding you back</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.720" end="01:08:28.880" style="s2">that&#39;s not what it is it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.150" end="01:08:32.450" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s this counterbalancing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.880" end="01:08:35.240" style="s2">like you know you take a good stance in</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.450" end="01:08:39.710" style="s2">a martial art and in order to make sure</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.240" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">that you can strike and defend right so</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.710" end="01:08:43.130" style="s2">you you you you have to be like I often</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:44.240" style="s2">warned my students I said you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.130" end="01:08:45.589" style="s2">you&#39;re something if somebody&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.240" end="01:08:47.720" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of jumping around</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.589" end="01:08:49.190" style="s2">chances are you all right but if you see</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.720" end="01:08:51.380" style="s2">them sort of think and take a route</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.190" end="01:08:52.750" style="s2">you&#39;re a lot of trouble that&#39;s the word</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.380" end="01:08:55.570" style="s2">I want rootedness</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.750" end="01:08:58.330" style="s2">yeah see that&#39;s it and they they give me</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.570" end="01:09:00.730" style="s2">a rootedness yeah so that like a tree</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.330" end="01:09:02.620" style="s2">right it&#39;s rooted near the precipice so</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.730" end="01:09:04.480" style="s2">that it can bring out its branches over</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.620" end="01:09:07.030" style="s2">the precipice to get light that has not</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.480" end="01:09:09.130" style="s2">been gotten before right but that&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.030" end="01:09:11.290" style="s2">to the depth of the rootedness that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.130" end="01:09:13.120" style="s2">you if you&#39;re provided you&#39;ll pardon the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.290" end="01:09:14.880" style="s2">very clumsy metaphor that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.120" end="01:09:16.380" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to articulate yeah</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.880" end="01:09:19.200" style="s2">totally</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.380" end="01:09:23.440" style="s2">that&#39;s what those people are for me yes</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.200" end="01:09:26.280" style="s2">yes and that I just appreciate that back</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.440" end="01:09:28.900" style="s2">and forth Ness of yeah yeah and then</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.280" end="01:09:32.200" style="s2">drop down and the move in this and that</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.900" end="01:09:34.360" style="s2">it just well just seems to disclose your</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.200" end="01:09:38.260" style="s2">heart but it also seems to disclose</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.360" end="01:09:41.260" style="s2">heart right yeah yeah that sense of just</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.260" end="01:09:45.340" style="s2">that like that the uniting of both of</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.260" end="01:09:47.170" style="s2">those things very much one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.340" end="01:09:48.640" style="s2">I was wondering too about was and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.170" end="01:09:50.710" style="s2">wanted to cut I didn&#39;t being come back</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.640" end="01:09:52.470" style="s2">to this in our you know when I&#39;ll we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.710" end="01:09:55.210" style="s2">had five conversations or something like</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.470" end="01:09:56.590" style="s2">what in the first one at the very end of</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.210" end="01:09:59.490" style="s2">the first one I just remember feeling</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.590" end="01:10:02.410" style="s2">quite struck by this thing that you were</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.490" end="01:10:03.850" style="s2">I don&#39;t think it was the first time you</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.410" end="01:10:06.030" style="s2">had seen it but there was a particular</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.850" end="01:10:07.870" style="s2">light in which he was showing itself</p>
<p begin="01:10:06.030" end="01:10:12.420" style="s2">which I&#39;ve been thinking about ever</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.870" end="01:10:16.240" style="s2">since which is we were talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.420" end="01:10:18.850" style="s2">fundamentalist like place that you grew</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.240" end="01:10:24.490" style="s2">up in right things that you said that</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.850" end="01:10:26.020" style="s2">was really striking to me was where you</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.490" end="01:10:29.170" style="s2">were talking and I actually didn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.020" end="01:10:30.880" style="s2">understand you at first as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.170" end="01:10:33.490" style="s2">talking about then when you reveal it</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.880" end="01:10:36.340" style="s2">really kind of struck me in a in a big</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.490" end="01:10:40.560" style="s2">way which was like yeah I said I have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.340" end="01:10:44.560" style="s2">be careful not to go back there because</p>
<p begin="01:10:40.560" end="01:10:46.930" style="s2">there was this almond --nt sense of</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.560" end="01:10:48.940" style="s2">danger right and where you could be</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.930" end="01:10:53.230" style="s2">rejected at any moment by this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.940" end="01:10:57.760" style="s2">like I got a fearful kind of God right</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.230" end="01:10:59.620" style="s2">or fearsome God and and then you said</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.760" end="01:11:02.280" style="s2">but the thing that it sounded like it</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.620" end="01:11:05.030" style="s2">was difficult to not go back to was they</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.280" end="01:11:08.470" style="s2">the this</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.030" end="01:11:13.010" style="s2">of this your position in in that arena</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.470" end="01:11:16.190" style="s2">right was so clear until meaningful that</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.010" end="01:11:18.530" style="s2">it that it it there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.190" end="01:11:23.150" style="s2">that clarity of the of the self</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.530" end="01:11:25.430" style="s2">narrative in relationship to that was</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.150" end="01:11:28.250" style="s2">tricky did not go back to well yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.430" end="01:11:30.440" style="s2">because like I say the brain prefers</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.250" end="01:11:32.630" style="s2">familiarity over anything else you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.440" end="01:11:34.910" style="s2">like I said people will seek out</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.630" end="01:11:38.630" style="s2">familiar sadness over unfamiliar</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.910" end="01:11:41.960" style="s2">happiness and so there&#39;s an attractor</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.630" end="01:11:44.510" style="s2">there like in the state space idea I</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.960" end="01:11:46.730" style="s2">think of it is there&#39;s two things that I</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.510" end="01:11:50.290" style="s2">have to be careful about one is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.730" end="01:11:54.530" style="s2">want to get drawn back into that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.290" end="01:11:56.930" style="s2">because of its seductive familiarity but</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.530" end="01:11:59.000" style="s2">the other is to have a reactive thing</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.930" end="01:12:01.970" style="s2">where I just reject anybody who wants to</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.000" end="01:12:04.130" style="s2">talk to me about God yeah yeah and and</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.970" end="01:12:07.010" style="s2">so it&#39;s like there&#39;s the two of them are</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.130" end="01:12:08.510" style="s2">always sort of like you know like the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.010" end="01:12:10.340" style="s2">like more like my hands are doing</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.510" end="01:12:13.640" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.340" end="01:12:16.490" style="s2">constraints that hold me well almost</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.640" end="01:12:18.770" style="s2">like to bring him back Aristotle&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.490" end="01:12:21.290" style="s2">of a virtue as being between two kinds</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.770" end="01:12:22.790" style="s2">of vices right and and so well you what</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.290" end="01:12:25.310" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to do is set up you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.790" end="01:12:26.900" style="s2">sets of constraints so that right the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.310" end="01:12:29.330" style="s2">golden mean isn&#39;t an average of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.900" end="01:12:31.370" style="s2">golden mean is - you know sensitize</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.330" end="01:12:34.220" style="s2">yourself to excess and sensitize</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.370" end="01:12:36.680" style="s2">yourself to deficit to defect so that</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.220" end="01:12:42.260" style="s2">you&#39;re constantly steering between them</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.680" end="01:12:46.480" style="s2">right in and so in that sense that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.260" end="01:12:50.170" style="s2">that that&#39;s sort of how it works for me</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.480" end="01:12:53.900" style="s2">of constantly between these two things</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.170" end="01:12:58.800" style="s2">when I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.900" end="01:13:01.140" style="s2">many live out live from live out from my</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.800" end="01:13:04.020" style="s2">religious legacy so it&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.140" end="01:13:05.610" style="s2">from the way and he did such a beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.020" end="01:13:08.460" style="s2">job it&#39;s very different from the way</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.610" end="01:13:11.340" style="s2">Chris talks about how he&#39;s wrestling</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.460" end="01:13:11.790" style="s2">with his religious heritage is very very</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.340" end="01:13:14.660" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.790" end="01:13:17.610" style="s2">um but you actually which actually means</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.660" end="01:13:20.190" style="s2">because we both wrestle we can come into</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.610" end="01:13:21.870" style="s2">dialogue but because we have this</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.190" end="01:13:25.970" style="s2">significant difference it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.870" end="01:13:28.650" style="s2">fruitful dialogue because we we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.970" end="01:13:30.120" style="s2">compensate for each some what not not</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.650" end="01:13:32.730" style="s2">any kind of complete fashion but we</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.120" end="01:13:34.530" style="s2">compensate for each other&#39;s deficits and</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.730" end="01:13:36.960" style="s2">biases when we bring to the when we come</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.530" end="01:13:39.480" style="s2">to the discussion of sacredness and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.960" end="01:13:43.140" style="s2">sacred I I don&#39;t know if I could do such</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.480" end="01:13:45.030" style="s2">a good job without without Chris or you</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.140" end="01:13:48.600" style="s2">know like I said or Anderson Todd who is</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.030" end="01:13:51.330" style="s2">somebody I talk about these things quite</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.600" end="01:13:54.360" style="s2">quite deeply he also has a different way</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.330" end="01:13:58.830" style="s2">in which he relates to all of this so</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.360" end="01:14:00.540" style="s2">that again I&#39;m I am constituted like the</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.830" end="01:14:02.370" style="s2">the sets of constraints that are the</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.540" end="01:14:05.550" style="s2">virtual engine of John drove a key are</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.370" end="01:14:08.100" style="s2">constituted in these relationships to</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.550" end="01:14:10.080" style="s2">other people and totally and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.100" end="01:14:11.340" style="s2">something about to the thing that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.080" end="01:14:14.160" style="s2">talked about last time which is just</p>
<p begin="01:14:11.340" end="01:14:16.940" style="s2">really striking to me would to is wait I</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.160" end="01:14:22.250" style="s2">think you had talked a little bit about</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.940" end="01:14:25.650" style="s2">your experience of being where you were</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.250" end="01:14:27.320" style="s2">you burn you burn some people out like</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.650" end="01:14:32.790" style="s2">because is he sorry</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.320" end="01:14:35.430" style="s2">yes right I think you are them but that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.790" end="01:14:39.600" style="s2">you were hard on them right yeah I was</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.430" end="01:14:43.590" style="s2">hard on one of my previous partners yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.600" end="01:14:47.610" style="s2">and yeah I wasn&#39;t malicious but it was</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.590" end="01:14:51.480" style="s2">very very draining for people that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.610" end="01:14:54.420" style="s2">that&#39;s something for which I bear a</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.480" end="01:14:56.880" style="s2">sense of in the moral sense of and I</p>
<p begin="01:14:54.420" end="01:15:00.810" style="s2">bear guilt and I bear a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.880" end="01:15:01.950" style="s2">responsibility again I think it would be</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.810" end="01:15:03.630" style="s2">unfair to me to say that there was any</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.950" end="01:15:06.090" style="s2">malicious intent but I was caught up in</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.630" end="01:15:08.699" style="s2">something that had a hold of me</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.090" end="01:15:09.960" style="s2">and you know this the Nietzschean you</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.699" end="01:15:13.050" style="s2">look too long into the abyss and it</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.960" end="01:15:15.599" style="s2">starts looked back through you and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.050" end="01:15:16.949" style="s2">it&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t let it go in</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.599" end="01:15:18.960" style="s2">though in the sense like you know they</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.949" end="01:15:22.380" style="s2">addict can&#39;t let go of his crack it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:15:18.960" end="01:15:25.429" style="s2">no if I felt a sense of a calling on of</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.380" end="01:15:28.949" style="s2">allegiance of something more that needed</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.429" end="01:15:30.119" style="s2">my devotion the you know Yadin has a</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.949" end="01:15:31.409" style="s2">book I just bought it I haven&#39;t started</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.119" end="01:15:33.659" style="s2">reading it that sense of being called</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.409" end="01:15:35.429" style="s2">yeah that sense of being called and you</p>
<p begin="01:15:33.659" end="01:15:37.409" style="s2">you you you mention it often when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.429" end="01:15:43.699" style="s2">talk about harkening so I was harkening</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.409" end="01:15:43.699" style="s2">to something but you know regardless of</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.030" end="01:15:49.530" style="s2">my I don&#39;t what to call my ontological</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.090" end="01:15:51.510" style="s2">responsibilities nevertheless other</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.530" end="01:15:53.760" style="s2">people weren&#39;t harkening it who were</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.510" end="01:15:55.440" style="s2">nevertheless bound to me because they</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.760" end="01:15:59.520" style="s2">were doing what they needed to be doing</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.440" end="01:16:03.659" style="s2">in their lives and I think like you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:59.520" end="01:16:06.330" style="s2">a tree that is we would&#39;ve shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.659" end="01:16:07.710" style="s2">sort of you know I don&#39;t know pushing</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.330" end="01:16:10.349" style="s2">other things that aren&#39;t rooted that way</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.710" end="01:16:14.699" style="s2">over the precipice that&#39;s just not right</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.349" end="01:16:16.080" style="s2">right yeah so I think that people who</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.699" end="01:16:18.960" style="s2">try to embrace me at that time often</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.080" end="01:16:22.349" style="s2">found themselves flung out footless over</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.960" end="01:16:24.300" style="s2">uh avoid and say why the hell am I here</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.349" end="01:16:26.520" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to be here and that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.300" end="01:16:27.780" style="s2">and I can you know and it was very hard</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.520" end="01:16:30.420" style="s2">for me to understand that at the time</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.780" end="01:16:32.820" style="s2">because I experienced that given again</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.420" end="01:16:35.130" style="s2">the fundamentalism as rejection but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.820" end="01:16:37.590" style="s2">come to see now oh that was what was</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.130" end="01:16:40.260" style="s2">going on I was I was drawing people to a</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.590" end="01:16:43.139" style="s2">place that which I was not affording</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.260" end="01:16:44.639" style="s2">them the proper grounding for the place</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.139" end="01:16:47.099" style="s2">that I was drawing them to and that was</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.639" end="01:16:50.940" style="s2">really I think very hard on people very</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.099" end="01:16:53.520" style="s2">hard on people yeah I mean the one</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.940" end="01:16:59.280" style="s2">person I think I did that the most I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.520" end="01:17:02.159" style="s2">apologized to her and and I have really</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.280" end="01:17:04.170" style="s2">tried to make amends in the proper sense</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.159" end="01:17:05.790" style="s2">of policies without making amends is</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.170" end="01:17:10.050" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing right</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.790" end="01:17:14.670" style="s2">and so I I&#39;ve tried very much to make</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.050" end="01:17:19.440" style="s2">amends in my action and my relationship</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.670" end="01:17:20.670" style="s2">to her because I feel yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.440" end="01:17:22.440" style="s2">I feel a tremendous sense of</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.670" end="01:17:25.590" style="s2">responsibility for all of that so yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.440" end="01:17:28.370" style="s2">that&#39;s something that&#39;s also a template</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.590" end="01:17:30.510" style="s2">in my mind of what not to do with people</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.370" end="01:17:34.560" style="s2">and there I think there&#39;s a time when I</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.510" end="01:17:38.239" style="s2">might have done that again and I made I</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.560" end="01:17:41.310" style="s2">made that mistake again and so I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.239" end="01:17:42.900" style="s2">with a particular student although</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.310" end="01:17:44.489" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s a much more murkier</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.900" end="01:17:50.219" style="s2">situation and I don&#39;t want to go into it</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.489" end="01:17:51.780" style="s2">for confidentiality reasons but both of</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.219" end="01:17:53.699" style="s2">those especially the first that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.780" end="01:17:56.159" style="s2">talked to have made me that the first</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.699" end="01:17:57.840" style="s2">sort of time in my life made me very</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.159" end="01:18:01.860" style="s2">very sensitive to that there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.840" end="01:18:03.420" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a responsibility above</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.860" end="01:18:06.750" style="s2">and beyond teaching and the</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.420" end="01:18:07.949" style="s2">disseminating of information it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.750" end="01:18:10.380" style="s2">hard for me to articulate and put in</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.949" end="01:18:12.270" style="s2">words but to be very very to to</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.380" end="01:18:15.030" style="s2">cultivate the appropriate virtue in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.270" end="01:18:17.010" style="s2">Aristotelian sense so that right people</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.030" end="01:18:18.870" style="s2">are drawn into the zone of proximal</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.010" end="01:18:21.570" style="s2">development but not drawn over the</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.870" end="01:18:23.760" style="s2">precipice yeah totally</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.570" end="01:18:25.980" style="s2">and was this a talk you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.760" end="01:18:28.969" style="s2">interesting cuz if I if I when you talk</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.980" end="01:18:33.360" style="s2">about like staring into the abyss right</p>
<p begin="01:18:28.969" end="01:18:35.580" style="s2">it&#39;s a she I don&#39;t get the sense I still</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.360" end="01:18:37.920" style="s2">I would imagine you&#39;re looking right in</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.580" end="01:18:40.469" style="s2">the same place but I don&#39;t get the sense</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.920" end="01:18:44.520" style="s2">that I don&#39;t get from you that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.469" end="01:18:46.530" style="s2">staring into an abyss it&#39;s remember I</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.520" end="01:18:49.440" style="s2">said I&#39;m not stuck anymore right you</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.530" end="01:18:51.630" style="s2">know and that&#39;s very different so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.440" end="01:18:56.280" style="s2">gone from being the abyss to being the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.630" end="01:18:58.050" style="s2">inexhaustible huh and that that&#39;s lunch</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.280" end="01:19:00.389" style="s2">dad that&#39;s what that&#39;s that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.050" end="01:19:02.790" style="s2">that nishitani talks about the whole</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.389" end="01:19:04.560" style="s2">point about religion and nothingness is</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.790" end="01:19:08.760" style="s2">the West because of its commitment to</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.560" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">you know answer theology of Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.760" end="01:19:15.000" style="s2">sort of substance and and you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:16.770" style="s2">giving exclusive realness to actuality</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.000" end="01:19:18.870" style="s2">and all that sort of stuff I&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.770" end="01:19:21.199" style="s2">about in parts of my series nishitani</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.870" end="01:19:24.840" style="s2">says that because the because the</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.199" end="01:19:27.150" style="s2">Asiatic especially Buddhism doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.840" end="01:19:29.100" style="s2">that commitment that Taoism doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.150" end="01:19:31.860" style="s2">that commitment that that the potential</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.100" end="01:19:32.429" style="s2">and the possible are just as if not more</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.860" end="01:19:35.130" style="s2">real</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.429" end="01:19:38.429" style="s2">the actual like that what you could do</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.130" end="01:19:40.409" style="s2">is you you could he says what Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.429" end="01:19:42.510" style="s2">can&#39;t do and we&#39;re back to how I said I</p>
<p begin="01:19:40.409" end="01:19:44.309" style="s2">found Nietzsche stock like what made she</p>
<p begin="01:19:42.510" end="01:19:45.329" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do yes the abyss is looking</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.309" end="01:19:47.880" style="s2">back through them but it&#39;s still the</p>
<p begin="01:19:45.329" end="01:19:50.099" style="s2">abyss but nishitani says is no no you</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.880" end="01:19:52.590" style="s2">can go from the the no thickness being</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.099" end="01:19:56.639" style="s2">an abyss to the no thickness being the</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.590" end="01:19:59.099" style="s2">inexhaustible yes and that shift and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.639" end="01:20:01.769" style="s2">that&#39;s not a propositional shift that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.099" end="01:20:03.929" style="s2">like the shift within Tolstoy where he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.769" end="01:20:05.760" style="s2">you know where without the story of Ivan</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.929" end="01:20:08.219" style="s2">Illich you know Ivan Ellicott always</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.760" end="01:20:09.630" style="s2">known he was gonna die but one day you</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.219" end="01:20:12.179" style="s2">know wifey falls and hurts himself</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.630" end="01:20:14.249" style="s2">Ivan ill ik knew he was going to die</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.179" end="01:20:16.139" style="s2">right and that&#39;s the proposition is the</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.249" end="01:20:18.269" style="s2">same but it means all the difference in</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.139" end="01:20:20.789" style="s2">the world it&#39;s that kind of fundamental</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.269" end="01:20:23.820" style="s2">aspect shift yes right so that the no</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.789" end="01:20:27.150" style="s2">thickness of nihilism becomes there no</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.820" end="01:20:29.070" style="s2">thickness of Shunyata right that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.150" end="01:20:32.159" style="s2">that&#39;s what I saw in this attorney but</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.070" end="01:20:35.309" style="s2">and because I you know I also saw I see</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.159" end="01:20:37.860" style="s2">it in in in Plato I don&#39;t see it in</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.309" end="01:20:40.409" style="s2">Aristotle yeah I think we love sort of</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.860" end="01:20:43.050" style="s2">made a move but I see it I see it in</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.409" end="01:20:44.820" style="s2">Plato and in Neoplatonism dot and and</p>
<p begin="01:20:43.050" end="01:20:46.679" style="s2">you can you know in hiding her try it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.820" end="01:20:48.570" style="s2">trying to get out of - he talks about</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.679" end="01:20:51.539" style="s2">the know thing and the way thoughts and</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.570" end="01:20:53.400" style="s2">stuff like that yeah totally it does it</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.539" end="01:20:55.439" style="s2">I want to put a bookmark on the on the</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.400" end="01:20:58.139" style="s2">Aristotle thing cuz I&#39;m I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.439" end="01:21:00.300" style="s2">been cracking open Heidegger&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.139" end="01:21:04.400" style="s2">back into Aristotle I had done that</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.300" end="01:21:08.309" style="s2">before I&#39;m like well that&#39;s a hole right</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.400" end="01:21:10.800" style="s2">there it sounds like a lot of what a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.309" end="01:21:16.679" style="s2">of my understandings a lot of Aristotle</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.800" end="01:21:18.570" style="s2">that we think of now is is through a lot</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.679" end="01:21:21.209" style="s2">of like it&#39;s is through a lot of other</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.570" end="01:21:23.639" style="s2">different frames that I think Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.209" end="01:21:27.570" style="s2">is going back and unconcealed these</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.639" end="01:21:29.099" style="s2">moments of these ambiguities again</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.570" end="01:21:31.739" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.099" end="01:21:34.860" style="s2">difference because for Aristotle the</p>
<p begin="01:21:31.739" end="01:21:37.079" style="s2">unmoved mover is the ultimate yeah so at</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.860" end="01:21:39.389" style="s2">the unmoved mover it this is Platonist</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.079" end="01:21:41.099" style="s2">as great critique of Aristotle right and</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.389" end="01:21:42.869" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s finally at the</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.099" end="01:21:45.690" style="s2">level right of</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.869" end="01:21:48.360" style="s2">of the idose but Plato says no the one</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.690" end="01:21:48.960" style="s2">is beyond being the one is beyond</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.360" end="01:21:50.580" style="s2">essence</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.960" end="01:21:53.699" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s political and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:21:50.580" end="01:21:56.820" style="s2">Platonists points to as paint in Plato</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.699" end="01:21:58.110" style="s2">that&#39;s not in Aristotle oh you know what</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.820" end="01:22:00.449" style="s2">I think you know what it is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.110" end="01:22:01.590" style="s2">sense I get now I have to go back and</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.449" end="01:22:03.389" style="s2">probably read this three or four times</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.590" end="01:22:06.179" style="s2">to kind of even track the terms that</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.389" end="01:22:08.219" style="s2">they&#39;re using he&#39;s Greek Greek thing I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.179" end="01:22:09.900" style="s2">like I don&#39;t I have to learn great</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.219" end="01:22:12.630" style="s2">ancient Greek I think it&#39;s gonna it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.900" end="01:22:17.429" style="s2">be helpful but the UM my sense was that</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.630" end="01:22:19.889" style="s2">actually that the unmoved mover was more</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.429" end="01:22:23.760" style="s2">like it was more like the sense the</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.889" end="01:22:26.400" style="s2">sense of two beyond that both revealed</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.760" end="01:22:28.110" style="s2">and concealed in its unfolded mist like</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.400" end="01:22:31.190" style="s2">there&#39;s this kind of just sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.110" end="01:22:36.619" style="s2">the I got the sense of not negation of</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.190" end="01:22:42.000" style="s2">of the beyond but that it it revealed in</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.619" end="01:22:44.010" style="s2">it it it what this is word that he used</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.000" end="01:22:46.050" style="s2">this kind of way of the sea you really</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.010" end="01:22:49.219" style="s2">gotta get it&#39;s funny I could really get</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.050" end="01:22:51.989" style="s2">where like a lot of Heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.219" end="01:22:54.480" style="s2">phenomenological sure sure off there is</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.989" end="01:22:56.280" style="s2">right out of Aristotle I had no idea cuz</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.480" end="01:22:58.590" style="s2">he has the Salah he has the scholastic</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.280" end="01:23:00.960" style="s2">training before he meets her all right</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.590" end="01:23:04.170" style="s2">yeah so that that&#39;s deeply deeply</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.960" end="01:23:06.719" style="s2">informing him but this kind of like</p>

<p begin="01:23:06.719" end="01:23:12.420" style="s2">of this of I think it&#39;s where Heidegger</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.320" end="01:23:16.670" style="s2">starts to get a sense of ecstatic time I</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.420" end="01:23:16.670" style="s2">think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.679" end="01:23:21.869" style="s2">so Platonists argues that you know even</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.530" end="01:23:24.270" style="s2">in even in the Eternity of thought</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.869" end="01:23:26.730" style="s2">thinking itself which is what which was</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.270" end="01:23:30.719" style="s2">what the unmoved mover is you still have</p>

<p begin="01:23:34.110" end="01:23:39.510" style="s2">to what ultimately grounds the relation</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.840" end="01:23:41.969" style="s2">itself between the subject and the</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.510" end="01:23:44.400" style="s2">object alright so China says that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.969" end="01:23:47.580" style="s2">something that must therefore transcend</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.400" end="01:23:51.989" style="s2">right the unmoved mover in a deep</p>

<p begin="01:23:51.989" end="01:23:55.440" style="s2">both minuses critique of Aristotle right</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.199" end="01:23:56.700" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.440" end="01:23:58.290" style="s2">after we ought to read more</p>
<p begin="01:23:56.700" end="01:24:00.300" style="s2">more of it I&#39;ve just given different</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.290" end="01:24:03.270" style="s2">since reading if any of you up because</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.300" end="01:24:07.020" style="s2">the the sense in which oh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.270" end="01:24:08.700" style="s2">interesting when you just said that like</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.020" end="01:24:11.400" style="s2">I&#39;m a little couple things I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.700" end="01:24:13.260" style="s2">interested I&#39;m I&#39;m noticing it&#39;s so easy</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.400" end="01:24:15.210" style="s2">to go within this conversation to go</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.260" end="01:24:17.160" style="s2">into talking about like your personal</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.210" end="01:24:20.970" style="s2">life right in their appearances and</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.160" end="01:24:22.500" style="s2">these ideas are and that&#39;s what you see</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.970" end="01:24:26.400" style="s2">in the Socratic dialogues right the way</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.500" end="01:24:29.100" style="s2">they move between the personal and like</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.400" end="01:24:31.950" style="s2">and and and and sort of the abstract</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.100" end="01:24:34.380" style="s2">theoretical in this fluid mutually</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.950" end="01:24:36.150" style="s2">disclosing fashion yes very much</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.380" end="01:24:39.110" style="s2">and that&#39;s what I meant what I said I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.150" end="01:24:40.290" style="s2">so interested if we could you know bring</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.110" end="01:24:43.980" style="s2">philosophy a--</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.290" end="01:24:47.010" style="s2">yes and circling together yes right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.980" end="01:24:49.650" style="s2">totally and there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.010" end="01:24:53.910" style="s2">where I do when I do it it happens</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.650" end="01:24:55.890" style="s2">implicitly experience it when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.910" end="01:24:57.180" style="s2">talking with you yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.890" end="01:25:00.450" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing I want to start to get</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.180" end="01:25:02.910" style="s2">under is what more of the theory yeah</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.450" end="01:25:05.250" style="s2">underpinning this particular piece of</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.910" end="01:25:08.430" style="s2">something like as the divine double of</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.250" end="01:25:11.070" style="s2">the we well yeah very good I like that</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.430" end="01:25:13.620" style="s2">that&#39;s good that&#39;s good right ingenious</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.070" end="01:25:15.810" style="s2">I know that that&#39;s a very perspicacious</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.620" end="01:25:18.270" style="s2">way of putting it thank you I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.810" end="01:25:19.830" style="s2">savor that that&#39;s good the divine double</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.270" end="01:25:21.990" style="s2">of the week that&#39;s very good that&#39;s very</p>

<p begin="01:25:21.990" end="01:25:26.310" style="s2">yeah I really like looking for a term</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.810" end="01:25:28.950" style="s2">because there&#39;s a like since we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.310" end="01:25:31.320" style="s2">talking there&#39;s of that yeah right and</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.950" end="01:25:32.880" style="s2">like I&#39;m like what but there are there</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.320" end="01:25:34.950" style="s2">words for it what is that thing that</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.880" end="01:25:36.960" style="s2">kind of comes up and is like set but it</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.950" end="01:25:39.780" style="s2">seems to function very similar to like</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.960" end="01:25:42.240" style="s2">this way in which you could spend your</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.780" end="01:25:44.640" style="s2">whole life getting clearer and clearer</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.240" end="01:25:47.640" style="s2">about the talos that is calling you</p>

<p begin="01:26:08.310" end="01:26:15.760" style="s2">that and how that relates to I think</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.250" end="01:26:18.670" style="s2">agnus collards notion of how in in when</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.760" end="01:26:20.739" style="s2">we&#39;re aspiring we have to relate to the</p>

<p begin="01:27:21.580" end="01:27:27.910" style="s2">dialogue a moment ago about the fluid</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.489" end="01:27:32.590" style="s2">movement between theory and theory that</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.910" end="01:27:35.620" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s of that&#39;s central to to</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.590" end="01:27:40.660" style="s2">try to get clear about the logos really</p>
<p begin="01:27:35.620" end="01:27:42.700" style="s2">because if like I said if I could I see</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.660" end="01:27:44.350" style="s2">it in you and I don&#39;t mean this in any</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.700" end="01:27:48.850" style="s2">criticism of the people I&#39;m circling</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.350" end="01:27:50.530" style="s2">with alright but what what I want is</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.850" end="01:27:54.430" style="s2">what I&#39;m looking for it in order to</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.530" end="01:27:56.230" style="s2">understand Socratic dialogue and afford</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.430" end="01:28:00.219" style="s2">responding to the meeting crisis is a</p>
<p begin="01:27:56.230" end="01:28:02.080" style="s2">deep integration between circling and</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.219" end="01:28:04.540" style="s2">philosophy of like we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.080" end="01:28:05.969" style="s2">exemplifying here and I think what you</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.540" end="01:28:09.730" style="s2">talked about the difference between</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.969" end="01:28:12.910" style="s2">transformation and healing yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.730" end="01:28:14.590" style="s2">one of the things that it just there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.910" end="01:28:16.600" style="s2">lot of stuff that comes into into</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.590" end="01:28:18.160" style="s2">circling right and this is wooder but</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.600" end="01:28:20.860" style="s2">some of the difficulty I have had it in</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.160" end="01:28:23.110" style="s2">it spreading is that like a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.860" end="01:28:24.789" style="s2">people are drawn to that which this</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.110" end="01:28:26.349" style="s2">isn&#39;t a criticism pray</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.789" end="01:28:27.760" style="s2">no no I get what you&#39;re gonna say Yeah</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.349" end="01:28:32.349" style="s2">right but they bring a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.760" end="01:28:38.139" style="s2">therapeutic kind of therapy oriented</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.349" end="01:28:41.489" style="s2">healing Grothe kinds of things that is</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.139" end="01:28:47.800" style="s2">is is like it ends up it ends up kind of</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.489" end="01:28:49.300" style="s2">guiding what is or isn&#39;t Wow later and</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.800" end="01:28:51.820" style="s2">so like one of the things I really want</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.300" end="01:28:53.909" style="s2">to do is it&#39;s called open up the get</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.820" end="01:28:57.849" style="s2">that sense of just like no this is like</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.909" end="01:28:59.590" style="s2">this is it like this is a this is</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.849" end="01:29:02.110" style="s2">mirroring about like being confronted</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.590" end="01:29:04.989" style="s2">with the fact that you are and that we</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.110" end="01:29:07.750" style="s2">are not mystery or and getting closer to</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.989" end="01:29:09.699" style="s2">it right but it&#39;s a way that you can do</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.750" end="01:29:11.230" style="s2">that but there&#39;s a way there&#39;s a way for</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.699" end="01:29:12.489" style="s2">me any ways of doing that over and over</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.230" end="01:29:14.800" style="s2">and over and over and over again where</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.489" end="01:29:17.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like I can do it in multiple</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.800" end="01:29:19.090" style="s2">contexts is because it&#39;s a taste of</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.170" end="01:29:21.340" style="s2">something that you can orient towards</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.090" end="01:29:26.559" style="s2">right yes very much further okay but</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.340" end="01:29:29.590" style="s2">there&#39;s something I think about about</p>
<p begin="01:29:26.559" end="01:29:32.469" style="s2">what what&#39;s still available in our</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.590" end="01:29:34.989" style="s2">technological era right they can&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.469" end="01:29:38.440" style="s2">can&#39;t seems like technique can&#39;t can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.989" end="01:29:41.920" style="s2">you can&#39;t optimize relationship there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.440" end="01:29:44.920" style="s2">something still available right</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.920" end="01:29:47.369" style="s2">that happens in relationship that and an</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.920" end="01:29:50.590" style="s2">experiential level that can reveal that</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.369" end="01:29:52.300" style="s2">that we&#39;re still that we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.590" end="01:29:54.280" style="s2">available for we&#39;re still available to</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.300" end="01:29:56.559" style="s2">be reached so I think that there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.280" end="01:29:58.030" style="s2">of the reasons why I think my attention</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.559" end="01:30:02.019" style="s2">is gone our relationship is I&#39;m an only</p>

<p begin="01:30:04.269" end="01:30:09.760" style="s2">like but but I think why I&#39;m drawn to</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.360" end="01:30:13.059" style="s2">that particular space is because that</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.760" end="01:30:15.329" style="s2">there&#39;s still something alive that</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.059" end="01:30:21.039" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been reached by our modern age</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.329" end="01:30:22.869" style="s2">that they it when people experience it</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.039" end="01:30:24.789" style="s2">can it still has transformational power</p>
<p begin="01:30:22.869" end="01:30:27.039" style="s2">I agree with that</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.789" end="01:30:32.019" style="s2">I agree with that I mailed you some</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.039" end="01:30:35.260" style="s2">papers and about some side about</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.019" end="01:30:37.659" style="s2">this about how grains get into a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.260" end="01:30:41.409" style="s2">synchrony when</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.659" end="01:30:45.010" style="s2">you get deep dialogue going and that and</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.409" end="01:30:48.309" style="s2">then and then but also some terrifying</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.010" end="01:30:50.679" style="s2">stuff where they&#39;ve actually physically</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.309" end="01:30:52.149" style="s2">linked some rat brains together and what</p>
<p begin="01:30:50.679" end="01:30:53.619" style="s2">you get is you get a distributed</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.149" end="01:30:55.599" style="s2">cognition that can solve problems that</p>
<p begin="01:30:53.619" end="01:30:57.969" style="s2">no individual rat brain can solve so</p>
<p begin="01:30:55.599" end="01:31:00.369" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of a a proof of concept of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:57.969" end="01:31:02.199" style="s2">of the processing power of distributed</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.369" end="01:31:04.320" style="s2">cognition and then what what is</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.199" end="01:31:06.639" style="s2">terrifying in the high daguerreian sense</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.320" end="01:31:08.649" style="s2">is they&#39;ve done that now with some human</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.639" end="01:31:10.179" style="s2">beings where they&#39;ve directly linked</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.649" end="01:31:13.510" style="s2">brains together and got the</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.179" end="01:31:15.550" style="s2">communication going so there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.510" end="01:31:17.409" style="s2">stuff looming on the horizon that&#39;s both</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.550" end="01:31:19.149" style="s2">pregnant with possibility but pregnant</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.409" end="01:31:22.209" style="s2">with threat that we definitely need to</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.149" end="01:31:23.739" style="s2">bring into this discussion now one of</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.209" end="01:31:25.809" style="s2">the things that&#39;s like interesting about</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.739" end="01:31:30.789" style="s2">this is like with relationship there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.809" end="01:31:34.059" style="s2">feedback loop that that I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.789" end="01:31:36.969" style="s2">regulates can regulate that what like</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.059" end="01:31:40.449" style="s2">going evil or good bring us good right</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.969" end="01:31:42.579" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s our it&#39;s our it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.449" end="01:31:45.519" style="s2">sense of obligation to the other that</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.579" end="01:31:47.889" style="s2">much about like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.519" end="01:31:49.749" style="s2">that to the constraint of that right</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.889" end="01:31:53.530" style="s2">that phenomenological sense of morality</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.749" end="01:31:55.449" style="s2">of the other that and and face facing</p>
<p begin="01:31:53.530" end="01:31:58.300" style="s2">people that 11 else talks about the face</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.449" end="01:32:00.879" style="s2">right and there&#39;s an on Twitter yeah</p>
<p begin="01:31:58.300" end="01:32:03.909" style="s2">yeah yeah and I and one of my concerns</p>

<p begin="01:32:03.909" end="01:32:06.639" style="s2">genies out of the bottle once this</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.079" end="01:32:09.280" style="s2">direct linkage stuff becomes available</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.639" end="01:32:11.949" style="s2">we&#39;re going to lose the face to face</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.280" end="01:32:14.409" style="s2">constraining which often carries a lot</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.949" end="01:32:16.959" style="s2">of the moral relationship they&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="01:32:14.409" end="01:32:18.429" style="s2">been articulating well anyways I say you</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.959" end="01:32:23.709" style="s2">some papers you can take a look at them</p>
