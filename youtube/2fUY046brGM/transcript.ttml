<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:09.230" style="s2">so we&#39;ve started to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.529" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">existentialism from the perspective of</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.230" end="00:00:16.130" style="s2">the individual but it&#39;s necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:21.060" style="s2">also understand the individual in</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.130" end="00:00:24.170" style="s2">relationship to the whole and when</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.060" end="00:00:28.080" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking about existential</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.170" end="00:00:31.320" style="s2">personality theory it&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.080" end="00:00:34.559" style="s2">important to place the individual in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.320" end="00:00:39.450" style="s2">broader context and the reason for that</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.559" end="00:00:41.370" style="s2">at least in part is because it&#39;s while</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.450" end="00:00:44.850" style="s2">it&#39;s for two reasons is it&#39;s that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:46.590" style="s2">initial existential theorists most</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.850" end="00:00:49.579" style="s2">particularly Nietzsche and Dostoevsky</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.590" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">were very interested in the political</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.579" end="00:00:58.739" style="s2">consequences of inauthenticity</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:01:01.020" style="s2">now Nietzsche believed that it was the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.739" end="00:01:03.420" style="s2">drive for truth that had been hyper</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.020" end="00:01:06.210" style="s2">developed in Europe at least from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.420" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">technical perspective by Europeans</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.210" end="00:01:11.299" style="s2">submission to Catholicism for for</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:15.900" style="s2">thousands of years that eventually</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.299" end="00:01:19.860" style="s2">overthrew Christianity in them in its</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.900" end="00:01:24.799" style="s2">dogmatic form but he also believed that</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.860" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">the consequences of that would be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.799" end="00:01:30.119" style="s2">weakening of the individual human being</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:32.520" style="s2">at least initially who was then more or</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.119" end="00:01:35.970" style="s2">less cast adrift but even more</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.520" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">importantly that there would be dire</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.970" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">political consequences and he was</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">particularly concerned about the</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:50.180" style="s2">potential for collective collectivist</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:54.210" style="s2">thinking to exert a murderous hold over</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.180" end="00:01:57.149" style="s2">the modern world now interestingly at</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.210" end="00:02:00.119" style="s2">exactly the same time it&#39;s so remarkable</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.149" end="00:02:01.979" style="s2">how much Nietzsche&#39;s life in</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.119" end="00:02:05.460" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s life paralleled one</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.979" end="00:02:07.910" style="s2">another it&#39;s really as if they were two</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.460" end="00:02:11.039" style="s2">sides of the same person because</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.910" end="00:02:13.980" style="s2">Nietzsche was philosophizing more or</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.039" end="00:02:16.080" style="s2">less explicitly well das Neves</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.980" end="00:02:19.830" style="s2">he was exploring exactly the same themes</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.080" end="00:02:24.440" style="s2">in his writing and there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.830" end="00:02:27.060" style="s2">forms of this parallelism so for example</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.440" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">when Nietzsche was the ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.060" end="00:02:32.310" style="s2">Nietzsche was working out and beyond</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:34.950" style="s2">good and evil were the same ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.310" end="00:02:37.670" style="s2">possessed in many ways that possessed</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.950" end="00:02:40.110" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s character Raskolnikov in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.670" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">crime and punishment which is a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.110" end="00:02:49.099" style="s2">nice parallel title to beyond good and</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:51.209" style="s2">evil and then even more interestingly</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.099" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">Dostoevsky wrote a novel called the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.209" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">possessed or The Devil&#39;s which I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:03:00.079" style="s2">is the least accessible of his great</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:02.310" style="s2">novels it takes about you know</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.079" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">Dostoyevsky&#39;s great novels are very long</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.310" end="00:03:07.500" style="s2">like great Russian novels tend to be and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:09.150" style="s2">they have a very large cast of</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.500" end="00:03:10.319" style="s2">characters and all of the characters</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.150" end="00:03:13.379" style="s2">have three names</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.319" end="00:03:15.000" style="s2">plus they have nicknames and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.379" end="00:03:19.230" style="s2">quite difficult to keep track of them</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.000" end="00:03:21.239" style="s2">and it takes quite a long time I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.230" end="00:03:24.569" style="s2">for a modern reader especially one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.239" end="00:03:28.410" style="s2">not familiar with with with Russia or</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.569" end="00:03:30.060" style="s2">Russian literature to to have it all</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.410" end="00:03:32.760" style="s2">come together in a coherent narrative</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.060" end="00:03:37.079" style="s2">hole and that&#39;s most pronounced I think</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.760" end="00:03:40.130" style="s2">in his book the devil&#39;s but the devil&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.079" end="00:03:43.169" style="s2">is an unbelievably interesting book</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.130" end="00:03:45.329" style="s2">because it describes individual</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.169" end="00:03:47.099" style="s2">psychopathology and in some ways the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.329" end="00:03:50.989" style="s2">same way that Dostoevsky does in notes</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.099" end="00:03:54.680" style="s2">from underground but it links it to this</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.989" end="00:03:59.190" style="s2">susceptibility to a certain kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.680" end="00:04:02.310" style="s2">political extremism and utopianism in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.190" end="00:04:05.489" style="s2">very direct way and so it notes for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.310" end="00:04:10.040" style="s2">underground for example the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.489" end="00:04:12.090" style="s2">character is very psychologically weak</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.040" end="00:04:14.639" style="s2">partly because he doesn&#39;t believe in</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.090" end="00:04:15.959" style="s2">anything and so because he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.639" end="00:04:19.400" style="s2">believe in anything even if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.959" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">offended even if he finds something</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.400" end="00:04:24.630" style="s2">unacceptable personally he finds it very</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:26.400" style="s2">difficult to stand up in a in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.630" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">to it or even to stand up for himself</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.400" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:32.940" style="s2">he&#39;s so full of doubt that he questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:34.890" style="s2">everything he he does and Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.940" end="00:04:37.490" style="s2">presents the main character in notes</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.890" end="00:04:39.720" style="s2">from underground as someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.490" end="00:04:44.790" style="s2">fragmented to the point of radical</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.720" end="00:04:47.610" style="s2">uncertainty now his characters in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.790" end="00:04:50.190" style="s2">devil&#39;s have the same underlying problem</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.610" end="00:04:52.770" style="s2">which is in some sense the demolition of</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.190" end="00:04:57.630" style="s2">the integrity of their personalities by</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.770" end="00:04:59.130" style="s2">the collapse of their formal individual</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.630" end="00:05:02.640" style="s2">and collective belief systems but</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.130" end="00:05:05.850" style="s2">instead of becoming riven by uncertainty</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.640" end="00:05:09.060" style="s2">uncertainty and doubt they become</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.850" end="00:05:10.710" style="s2">possessed by certainty and hence the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.060" end="00:05:13.610" style="s2">name the Devils or the possessed I</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.710" end="00:05:16.260" style="s2">mentioned to you at one point that Jung</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.610" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">famously claimed that people didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.260" end="00:05:21.810" style="s2">ideas that ideas had people which i</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:23.730" style="s2">think is one of the loveliest lines I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.810" end="00:05:26.700" style="s2">ever come across it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.730" end="00:05:30.840" style="s2">brilliant but Dostoyevsky&#39;s novel the</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.700" end="00:05:34.980" style="s2">possessed is about how ideas have people</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.840" end="00:05:38.400" style="s2">and his main character in that novel if</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.980" end="00:05:42.210" style="s2">I recollect properly is named stavrogin</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.400" end="00:05:45.030" style="s2">and stavrogin is the kind of nihilistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.210" end="00:05:47.490" style="s2">thinker who turns to totalitarianism and</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.030" end="00:05:50.280" style="s2">basically what happens in the Devils is</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.490" end="00:05:53.310" style="s2">that he turns to precisely the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.280" end="00:05:56.070" style="s2">that also manifested themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.310" end="00:05:57.720" style="s2">radical Marxism and then later because</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.070" end="00:06:00.780" style="s2">the possessed was written quite a bit</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.720" end="00:06:01.800" style="s2">before the death of the czar in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.780" end="00:06:03.960" style="s2">Russian Revolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.800" end="00:06:06.810" style="s2">you know it&#39;s several decades before</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.960" end="00:06:09.300" style="s2">that but Dostoevsky felt that these</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.810" end="00:06:12.750" style="s2">ideas were in the air in some sense as</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.300" end="00:06:17.100" style="s2">an alternative to classical European</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.750" end="00:06:18.690" style="s2">thought including not only classical or</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.100" end="00:06:22.050" style="s2">religious thought but also classical</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.690" end="00:06:23.880" style="s2">enlightenment thought now Tolstoy wrote</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.050" end="00:06:26.669" style="s2">a book called confessions which I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.880" end="00:06:28.950" style="s2">very much recommend reading it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.669" end="00:06:31.740" style="s2">short book and in confessions what</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.950" end="00:06:35.580" style="s2">happens to Tolstoy is he talks about his</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.740" end="00:06:37.890" style="s2">experience in Russia when the news of</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.580" end="00:06:40.700" style="s2">the death of God in some sense swept</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.890" end="00:06:42.890" style="s2">across Russia in a in us</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.700" end="00:06:45.110" style="s2">a sudden storm the Russians had been</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.890" end="00:06:47.420" style="s2">feudal for a very long period of time</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.110" end="00:06:50.300" style="s2">and they were backwards in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.420" end="00:06:56.060" style="s2">compared to the rest of Europe and they</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.300" end="00:06:58.100" style="s2">had stuck in their medieval cultural</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.060" end="00:06:59.540" style="s2">form far longer than most European</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.100" end="00:07:02.900" style="s2">states but when that collapsed it</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.540" end="00:07:06.320" style="s2">collapsed with amazing sudden with with</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.900" end="00:07:09.680" style="s2">amazing instant 1080 and Tolstoy writes</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.320" end="00:07:12.080" style="s2">in the confessions about remembering</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.680" end="00:07:14.530" style="s2">when the idea first dawned on him and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.080" end="00:07:16.970" style="s2">many other people simultaneously that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.530" end="00:07:19.730" style="s2">the entire edifice of Orthodox</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.970" end="00:07:21.320" style="s2">Christianity was no longer tenable and</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.730" end="00:07:23.150" style="s2">then what happens with Tolstoy in</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.320" end="00:07:26.240" style="s2">confession is that he describes his</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.150" end="00:07:28.430" style="s2">absolute collapse as a integrated</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.240" end="00:07:30.260" style="s2">psychological being and his descent into</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.430" end="00:07:32.960" style="s2">the underworld roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.260" end="00:07:35.030" style="s2">Tolstoy at the height of his success and</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.960" end="00:07:37.790" style="s2">he was the most successful author in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.030" end="00:07:39.560" style="s2">world at one point certainly and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.790" end="00:07:41.270" style="s2">you know people still argue that maybe</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.270" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">lived although I think Dostoyevsky</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.040" end="00:07:46.880" style="s2">deserves that title but I&#39;m more of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:50.380" style="s2">psychologist and a sociologist and</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.880" end="00:07:52.970" style="s2">Tolstoy was a sociologist Tolstoy was</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.380" end="00:07:56.540" style="s2">unwilling to wander around his estates</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.970" end="00:07:57.950" style="s2">with either a gun or with a rope nearby</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.540" end="00:08:00.500" style="s2">because he was afraid that he would</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.950" end="00:08:04.160" style="s2">either shoot or hang himself and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.500" end="00:08:07.700" style="s2">because he despite his fame and his</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.160" end="00:08:10.160" style="s2">great estates and his political his</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.700" end="00:08:11.930" style="s2">political work he was very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.160" end="00:08:16.190" style="s2">the emancipation of the serfs for</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.930" end="00:08:18.470" style="s2">example he concluded in some sense that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.190" end="00:08:21.200" style="s2">life was an evil joke it was as if life</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.470" end="00:08:24.830" style="s2">was an evil joke being played on mankind</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.200" end="00:08:28.900" style="s2">by a cruel creator and that everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.830" end="00:08:32.630" style="s2">was ultimately meaningless but finitely</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.900" end="00:08:34.849" style="s2">terrible and and and generating nothing</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.630" end="00:08:41.030" style="s2">but pointless suffering and Tolstoy said</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.849" end="00:08:42.880" style="s2">very very clearly that a a man with</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.030" end="00:08:46.910" style="s2">conviction who came to that conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.880" end="00:08:50.650" style="s2">could only continue to live by deluding</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.910" end="00:08:53.660" style="s2">himself and he thought in such a thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.650" end="00:08:54.200" style="s2">he couldn&#39;t think himself out of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.660" end="00:08:57.860" style="s2">proper</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.200" end="00:09:00.410" style="s2">that his unwillingness to kill himself</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.860" end="00:09:02.779" style="s2">was a form of cowardice once he had come</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.410" end="00:09:06.290" style="s2">to that realization and so confession is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.779" end="00:09:07.579" style="s2">about that and you know he tries to turn</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.290" end="00:09:09.170" style="s2">to the kind of religion that</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.579" end="00:09:11.720" style="s2">characterized the Russian peasantry</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.170" end="00:09:14.120" style="s2">which would be you know in some sense an</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.720" end="00:09:15.829" style="s2">ignorant immersion in beliefs that</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.120" end="00:09:18.290" style="s2">intellect have superseded but of course</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.829" end="00:09:20.839" style="s2">that wasn&#39;t available to him and at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.290" end="00:09:23.449" style="s2">end of confession something happens to</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.839" end="00:09:26.630" style="s2">Tolstoy to redeem him in a sense but all</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.449" end="00:09:28.790" style="s2">it is is a dream and he dreams of this</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.630" end="00:09:32.209" style="s2">he dreams that he&#39;s suspended over a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.790" end="00:09:33.560" style="s2">great abyss by a rope and as far down as</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.209" end="00:09:35.779" style="s2">he can look there&#39;s nothing but empty</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.560" end="00:09:37.910" style="s2">space but then he turns to look up and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.779" end="00:09:40.310" style="s2">he can see the same rope above him</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.910" end="00:09:42.740" style="s2">stretching up into the sky as far as it</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.310" end="00:09:44.990" style="s2">can reach and that&#39;s basically how the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.740" end="00:09:48.440" style="s2">book ends and you know the inference is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.990" end="00:09:50.839" style="s2">something like Tolstoy dream revealed to</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.440" end="00:09:54.290" style="s2">him the proposition that although there</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.839" end="00:09:55.310" style="s2">were abysmal depths beneath mankind so</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.290" end="00:09:57.589" style="s2">to speak from a psychological</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.310" end="00:09:59.720" style="s2">perspective that we were also supported</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.589" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">by something infinite but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.720" end="00:10:06.610" style="s2">articulated like the whole book just</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:11.149" style="s2">ends with the dream so well so</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.610" end="00:10:12.740" style="s2">Dostoevsky lays out the underground</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.149" end="00:10:16.790" style="s2">political movements that were</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.740" end="00:10:20.410" style="s2">characteristic of late the late nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.790" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">or the late 1800s in Russia and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.410" end="00:10:27.589" style="s2">describes the emergence of the type of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:30.610" style="s2">person who ends up after the Russian</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.589" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">Revolution after the first world war</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.610" end="00:10:38.740" style="s2">becoming committed and involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:41.319" style="s2">collectivization process in Russia and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.740" end="00:10:44.329" style="s2">it&#39;s virtually impossible to overstate</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.319" end="00:10:48.410" style="s2">how terrible the collectivization</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.329" end="00:10:51.699" style="s2">process was right from its onset you</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.410" end="00:10:54.319" style="s2">know you&#39;ll still hear apologists for</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.699" end="00:10:56.660" style="s2">Marxism and communism talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.319" end="00:10:59.779" style="s2">fact that the Soviet Union was captured</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.660" end="00:11:02.839" style="s2">by a cult of personality under Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.779" end="00:11:07.190" style="s2">and that that&#39;s why the ethical</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.839" end="00:11:08.420" style="s2">presuppositions of Marxism transformed</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.190" end="00:11:11.390" style="s2">into political our</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.420" end="00:11:13.760" style="s2">became so corrupted but I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.390" end="00:11:16.070" style="s2">absolute nonsense and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.760" end="00:11:19.250" style="s2">nonsense of the most dangerous and</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.070" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">reprehensible type and I think that for</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.250" end="00:11:26.240" style="s2">two reasons the first reason was Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:27.740" style="s2">was unbelievably murderous thug he</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.240" end="00:11:30.650" style="s2">pretty much killed everyone he knew</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.740" end="00:11:31.070" style="s2">including almost all of the they called</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.650" end="00:11:34.820" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.070" end="00:11:37.160" style="s2">what were they I don&#39;t remember the term</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.820" end="00:11:42.830" style="s2">there were old revolutionaries all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.160" end="00:11:44.990" style="s2">the Bolsheviks who ran the revolution</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.830" end="00:11:47.420" style="s2">who didn&#39;t die during the revolution or</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.990" end="00:11:50.150" style="s2">of natural causes afterwards they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.420" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">all killed by Stalin he probably killed</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.150" end="00:11:56.330" style="s2">his wife he killed pretty much everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:11:58.310" style="s2">he knew I mean he was and he was a like</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.330" end="00:12:00.110" style="s2">an underground operative for Lenin</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.310" end="00:12:02.780" style="s2">during the revolution itself where he</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.110" end="00:12:05.030" style="s2">learned to be committed from an</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.780" end="00:12:06.800" style="s2">ideological perspective he&#39;d come from</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.030" end="00:12:07.960" style="s2">quite an intensely religious background</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.800" end="00:12:10.130" style="s2">committed from an ideological</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.960" end="00:12:13.460" style="s2">perspective but then basically asked</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.130" end="00:12:15.770" style="s2">acting as a guerrilla assassin during</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.460" end="00:12:17.690" style="s2">the revolution itself and then later he</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.770" end="00:12:20.590" style="s2">rose to power it he certainly used</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.690" end="00:12:24.950" style="s2">Lenin&#39;s political machinations as</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.590" end="00:12:27.530" style="s2">machinations as a as a template for his</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.950" end="00:12:33.250" style="s2">later activity but Lenin was no [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.530" end="00:12:39.370" style="s2">when it came to extraordinarily brutal</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.250" end="00:12:42.140" style="s2">activity motivated by utopian dreams now</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.370" end="00:12:45.080" style="s2">what seemed to happen in some sense is</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.140" end="00:12:47.750" style="s2">that you can imagine and we&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.080" end="00:12:49.580" style="s2">at the political structure the political</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.750" end="00:12:51.260" style="s2">movements of whole Nations we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.580" end="00:12:53.300" style="s2">down to the bottom to look at it from a</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.260" end="00:12:54.920" style="s2">psychological perspective instead of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.300" end="00:12:57.590" style="s2">thinking it of it from an economic</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.920" end="00:12:59.830" style="s2">perspective or a power perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.590" end="00:13:03.680" style="s2">some sense it&#39;s a it&#39;s a Jungian</p>

<p begin="00:13:03.680" end="00:13:12.290" style="s2">movements in in Europe and across the</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.340" end="00:13:14.540" style="s2">world with an existential spin you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.290" end="00:13:16.640" style="s2">imagine that what classical Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.540" end="00:13:20.540" style="s2">had set up for people was not only a</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.640" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">belief in in a shared moral reality that</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.540" end="00:13:24.589" style="s2">that everyone was super</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:28.399" style="s2">to be participating in but also some</p>

<p begin="00:13:31.910" end="00:13:37.070" style="s2">then the promise of a kind of perfection</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.240" end="00:13:39.589" style="s2">after death and of course people like</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.070" end="00:13:43.610" style="s2">Freud and people like Marx considered</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.589" end="00:13:45.380" style="s2">that an illusion designed either to</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.040" end="00:13:49.910" style="s2">so that would be Freud&#39;s argument or</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.630" end="00:13:53.660" style="s2">Marx&#39;s argument would be well that that</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.910" end="00:13:55.970" style="s2">was a conspiracy in some sense promoted</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.660" end="00:13:57.350" style="s2">by the political and religious elite to</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.970" end="00:14:02.149" style="s2">keep the people who are being oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.350" end="00:14:04.130" style="s2">in their place well of course there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.149" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">some truth to both of those but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.130" end="00:14:09.350" style="s2">a difference between some truth and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.440" end="00:14:11.390" style="s2">truth and any extraordinarily complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.350" end="00:14:13.940" style="s2">phenomena has multiple causal elements</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.390" end="00:14:17.990" style="s2">and those are two important ones because</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.940" end="00:14:21.140" style="s2">of course anxiety about death and power</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.990" end="00:14:23.270" style="s2">are two very important psychological</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.140" end="00:14:26.570" style="s2">phenomena and they play their role in</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.270" end="00:14:29.029" style="s2">determining any important collective or</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.570" end="00:14:31.790" style="s2">individual activity but you can&#39;t forget</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.029" end="00:14:34.550" style="s2">about the rest of the the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.790" end="00:14:37.790" style="s2">story now so this collapses and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.550" end="00:14:40.010" style="s2">leaves a void and that void is a void in</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.790" end="00:14:41.779" style="s2">people&#39;s souls so to speak it makes them</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.010" end="00:14:43.070" style="s2">nihilistic for example because they</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.779" end="00:14:44.500" style="s2">don&#39;t have any they can&#39;t see any</p>

<p begin="00:14:44.500" end="00:14:51.050" style="s2">but it also simultaneously makes them</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.450" end="00:14:53.810" style="s2">more susceptible to utopian mass</p>

<p begin="00:14:53.810" end="00:14:57.950" style="s2">course that&#39;s exactly what happened with</p>

<p begin="00:14:57.950" end="00:15:02.510" style="s2">to the fascist so what Hitler offered</p>

<p begin="00:17:59.030" end="00:18:04.130" style="s2">interesting about Dostoyevsky&#39;s book The</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.100" end="00:18:06.520" style="s2">Devil&#39;s is that it&#39;s segways almost</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.130" end="00:18:09.650" style="s2">perfectly into Alexander Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.520" end="00:18:11.900" style="s2">scription of the emergence of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.650" end="00:18:14.870" style="s2">Russian prisoners the Soviet prison</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.900" end="00:18:15.980" style="s2">camps after the Revolution so basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.870" end="00:18:18.650" style="s2">what happened and this is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.980" end="00:18:21.650" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn revealed in the 1970s was</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.650" end="00:18:24.440" style="s2">that because the communist system was so</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.650" end="00:18:26.180" style="s2">financially untenable the principles</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.440" end="00:18:29.150" style="s2">just didn&#39;t work for all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.180" end="00:18:31.610" style="s2">reasons the the system ended up running</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.150" end="00:18:34.550" style="s2">basically on a system of work camps and</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.610" end="00:18:36.200" style="s2">so much of what the Russians produced</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.550" end="00:18:37.610" style="s2">the Soviets produced which wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.200" end="00:18:39.920" style="s2">much by the way although they got</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.610" end="00:18:41.360" style="s2">industrialized very very rapidly was</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.920" end="00:18:44.690" style="s2">produced by people who were basically</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.360" end="00:18:46.870" style="s2">enslaved and that&#39;s the only way the</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.690" end="00:18:50.330" style="s2">system could continue to function now</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.870" end="00:18:53.870" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn estimated that between</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.330" end="00:18:56.720" style="s2">nineteen and 1919 which is basically the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.870" end="00:18:58.910" style="s2">end of the first world war and 1959</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.720" end="00:19:01.130" style="s2">which is basically when the Stalinist</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.910" end="00:19:05.240" style="s2">era came to an end so that&#39;s only 40</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.130" end="00:19:08.180" style="s2">years that 60 million people were killed</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.240" end="00:19:10.970" style="s2">in the Soviet Union as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.180" end="00:19:12.160" style="s2">internal repression I didn&#39;t count the</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.970" end="00:19:15.430" style="s2">Second World War</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.160" end="00:19:18.740" style="s2">now people debate these figures and</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.430" end="00:19:20.930" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn is surprisingly to me a</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.740" end="00:19:23.240" style="s2">controversial figure because I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.930" end="00:19:26.840" style="s2">where the controversy is people complain</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.240" end="00:19:29.750" style="s2">about his numbers claiming that death</p>

<p begin="00:19:29.750" end="00:19:35.600" style="s2">period of time is mathematically</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.000" end="00:19:37.100" style="s2">untenable but reason more reasonable</p>

<p begin="00:19:37.100" end="00:19:42.440" style="s2">put it up to 20 or 30 million and though</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.980" end="00:19:44.420" style="s2">the truth of the matter is that no one</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.440" end="00:19:48.830" style="s2">knows and that even makes it worse I</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.420" end="00:19:51.200" style="s2">mean we do know for example that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.830" end="00:19:55.420" style="s2">the attempts at collectivization in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.200" end="00:20:00.110" style="s2">1920s led to the creation of a</p>

<p begin="00:22:43.460" end="00:22:48.770" style="s2">jean-paul Sartre and Foucault and a very</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.940" end="00:22:51.500" style="s2">large group of French intellectuals who</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.770" end="00:22:53.750" style="s2">were involved in the student radical</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.500" end="00:22:56.750" style="s2">left student movements in the late 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.750" end="00:22:59.240" style="s2">and who ended up barricading the streets</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.750" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">of Paris in 1968 which is when the</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.240" end="00:23:03.669" style="s2">student movement sort of peaked and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:07.309" style="s2">and then fell away um</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.669" end="00:23:10.970" style="s2">they never apologized in any real sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.309" end="00:23:14.149" style="s2">for their the fact of being enamored of</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.970" end="00:23:17.740" style="s2">well at least in part the policies of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.149" end="00:23:21.370" style="s2">Stalin and also the policies of Mao and</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.740" end="00:23:24.820" style="s2">there&#39;s no excuse for that</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.370" end="00:23:27.350" style="s2">so now the problem is of course is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.820" end="00:23:29.809" style="s2">left-wing radical left-wing political</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.350" end="00:23:33.080" style="s2">and economic ideas are intellectually</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.809" end="00:23:35.899" style="s2">quite coherent like they make sense once</p>

<p begin="00:23:47.059" end="00:23:52.010" style="s2">which is roughly anyone who owns</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.980" end="00:23:55.490" style="s2">anything only owns what they own because</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.010" end="00:23:57.350" style="s2">they&#39;ve stolen it from someone else so</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.490" end="00:23:59.419" style="s2">that there&#39;s labor is productive but</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.350" end="00:24:01.490" style="s2">nothing else is productive everything</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.419" end="00:24:03.320" style="s2">else is a secondary derivation of labor</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.490" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">and you know that&#39;s an absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.320" end="00:24:09.380" style="s2">moronic economic theory because</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:11.330" style="s2">obviously there&#39;s work that has value</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.380" end="00:24:13.250" style="s2">there&#39;s work that has no value the fact</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.330" end="00:24:14.840" style="s2">that it&#39;s difficult has almost no</p>

<p begin="00:24:17.390" end="00:24:21.799" style="s2">like the political system or the</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.010" end="00:24:26.139" style="s2">economic system is a perfect mirror of</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.799" end="00:24:26.139" style="s2">effort it&#39;s not like that at all so</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.389" end="00:24:31.960" style="s2">you might say that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.210" end="00:24:43.990" style="s2">well I would say really what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.700" end="00:24:48.379" style="s2">the 20th century is once people stopped</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.990" end="00:24:50.899" style="s2">worshipping and externalize deity they</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.379" end="00:24:52.779" style="s2">started to worship if they were</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.899" end="00:24:56.330" style="s2">intelligent they started to worship</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.779" end="00:24:58.279" style="s2">rational utopian ideas and if they</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.330" end="00:25:01.129" style="s2">weren&#39;t as intelligent they turned to</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.279" end="00:25:03.470" style="s2">the state like identification with the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.129" end="00:25:05.629" style="s2">state like the Nazis for example</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.470" end="00:25:08.809" style="s2">identification with the state as an</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.629" end="00:25:14.619" style="s2">alternative source of collective power</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.809" end="00:25:18.230" style="s2">and both of those were in</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.619" end="00:25:19.549" style="s2">comprehensively devastating and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.230" end="00:25:21.590" style="s2">not done with it yet</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.549" end="00:25:23.230" style="s2">you know I mean one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.590" end="00:25:26.929" style="s2">happened in the Soviet Union and</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.230" end="00:25:29.059" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn one of who&#39;s I have you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.929" end="00:25:30.499" style="s2">read one of his the chapters of The</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.059" end="00:25:33.470" style="s2">Gulag Archipelago which is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.499" end="00:25:36.049" style="s2">piece of writing one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.470" end="00:25:37.940" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn Solzhenitsyn points out is</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.049" end="00:25:39.710" style="s2">there was this extensive prison camp</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.940" end="00:25:41.419" style="s2">system in the Soviet Union that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.710" end="00:25:43.940" style="s2">called the gulag archipelago it was this</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.419" end="00:25:45.740" style="s2">chain of camps all across the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.940" end="00:25:47.269" style="s2">Union and if you were thrown in there</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.740" end="00:25:49.990" style="s2">because you were a political prisoner</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.269" end="00:25:51.950" style="s2">you were the worst kind of prisoner and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.990" end="00:25:53.690" style="s2">you could be thrown in there as a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.950" end="00:25:55.639" style="s2">political prisoner pretty much for</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.690" end="00:25:57.619" style="s2">expressing any opinion whatsoever about</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.639" end="00:25:59.779" style="s2">the state which is we&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.619" end="00:26:02.509" style="s2">back to that as we tie this together</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.779" end="00:26:04.789" style="s2">with existentialism now the Communists</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.509" end="00:26:07.070" style="s2">we regarded the murderers and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.789" end="00:26:10.009" style="s2">rapists and the thieves as socially</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.070" end="00:26:12.259" style="s2">friendly elements because it was a it</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.009" end="00:26:13.820" style="s2">was part of Marxist doctrine that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.259" end="00:26:16.399" style="s2">only reason that you would become a</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.820" end="00:26:18.110" style="s2">murderer or a thief or a rapist was</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.399" end="00:26:20.600" style="s2">because you were part of an oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.110" end="00:26:22.999" style="s2">class and your poverty was what</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.600" end="00:26:24.649" style="s2">generated your crime so in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.999" end="00:26:27.409" style="s2">you couldn&#39;t be held personally</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.649" end="00:26:29.179" style="s2">responsible for it an upshot of that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.409" end="00:26:33.919" style="s2">that the thieves and the rapists and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.179" end="00:26:37.070" style="s2">murderers ran the prisons well Russia</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.919" end="00:26:39.590" style="s2">right now is a mafia state there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.070" end="00:26:43.269" style="s2">evidence for example that Putin is the</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.590" end="00:26:47.149" style="s2">richest man in the world and he has</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.269" end="00:26:49.159" style="s2">almost singular power over this over the</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.149" end="00:26:50.440" style="s2">affairs of the Soviet Union the former</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.159" end="00:26:53.290" style="s2">Soviet Union</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.440" end="00:26:55.240" style="s2">the Russians the Soviets killed anybody</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.290" end="00:26:58.540" style="s2">that had any capacity for independent</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.240" end="00:27:00.580" style="s2">thought and they raised the thugs to to</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.580" end="00:27:05.590" style="s2">you guys are going to be dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.440" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">that for the rest of your life so and if</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.590" end="00:27:08.470" style="s2">you think that that&#39;s changed you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.020" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.470" end="00:27:13.420" style="s2">it hasn&#39;t changed at all Russia&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.020" end="00:27:15.670" style="s2">transformed from a totalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.420" end="00:27:20.200" style="s2">communist state into a mafia state and</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.670" end="00:27:25.060" style="s2">that&#39;s a big problem so we&#39;re not done</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.200" end="00:27:28.690" style="s2">with this yet and one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.060" end="00:27:31.840" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn he was this is why I use</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.690" end="00:27:36.480" style="s2">him as a psychological thinker you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.840" end="00:27:41.970" style="s2">people generally consider Viktor Frankl</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:44.260" style="s2">that the primary existential</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.970" end="00:27:46.600" style="s2">psychologist or psychiatrist now Viktor</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.260" end="00:27:49.870" style="s2">Frankl came through the Nazi prison</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.600" end="00:27:52.420" style="s2">camps and he developed logotherapy as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.870" end="00:27:54.160" style="s2">consequence of that and logotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.420" end="00:27:56.080" style="s2">what part of the principles of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.160" end="00:27:58.510" style="s2">logotherapy were laid forth in his book</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.080" end="00:28:00.670" style="s2">man&#39;s search for meaning and one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.510" end="00:28:03.880" style="s2">Frankel&#39;s propositions was essentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.670" end="00:28:06.040" style="s2">that because life is suffering and can</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.880" end="00:28:09.420" style="s2">be unbearable suffering that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.040" end="00:28:11.950" style="s2">necessary for people to have a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.420" end="00:28:14.260" style="s2">countervailing meaning to buttress</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.950" end="00:28:17.680" style="s2">themselves against the tragedy of</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.260" end="00:28:20.200" style="s2">existence and Frankel basically claimed</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.680" end="00:28:23.530" style="s2">and this is an existential claim that if</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.200" end="00:28:26.230" style="s2">you that you could find that meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.530" end="00:28:28.150" style="s2">collective belief but that there were</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.230" end="00:28:31.060" style="s2">terrible dangers associated with that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.150" end="00:28:33.520" style="s2">and so your moral obligation was to find</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.060" end="00:28:36.280" style="s2">that meaning within the confines of your</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.520" end="00:28:39.010" style="s2">own authentic individual life and you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.280" end="00:28:41.230" style="s2">can see that sort of idea also arising</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.010" end="00:28:43.270" style="s2">in the thought of Carl Rogers for</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.230" end="00:28:44.800" style="s2">example and it&#39;s also there in Jung</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.270" end="00:28:46.870" style="s2">because of course Jung believed that</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.800" end="00:28:49.420" style="s2">there was this path he called</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.870" end="00:28:52.060" style="s2">individuation which was the flowering</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.420" end="00:28:55.060" style="s2">and manifestation of the healthy and</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.060" end="00:29:00.120" style="s2">integrated fundamental human personality</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.220" end="00:29:02.620" style="s2">of course Piaget believed something</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.120" end="00:29:04.300" style="s2">similar although more collective because</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.620" end="00:29:06.730" style="s2">for Piaget</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.300" end="00:29:08.710" style="s2">the hammering of your psyche into</p>

<p begin="00:29:08.710" end="00:29:13.780" style="s2">also had to be done in active concert</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.070" end="00:29:14.890" style="s2">with all of the people around you you</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.780" end="00:29:18.100" style="s2">know because you were organizing</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.890" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">yourself into a coherent internal game</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.100" end="00:29:22.350" style="s2">where all your little sub personalities</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:25.030" style="s2">could find their place well</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.350" end="00:29:27.490" style="s2">simultaneously doing that with other</p>

<p begin="00:29:27.490" end="00:29:31.000" style="s2">can see this the theme there&#39;s a theme</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.230" end="00:29:32.770" style="s2">that emerges in all of those thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.000" end="00:29:35.320" style="s2">and one of the themes is this that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.770" end="00:29:38.710" style="s2">are healthy pathways to psychological</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.320" end="00:29:40.420" style="s2">development and the existentialists in</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.710" end="00:29:43.120" style="s2">particular although this was also the</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.420" end="00:29:44.950" style="s2">case with young young worked as a secret</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.130" end="00:29:57.040" style="s2">discovered until about three years ago</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.190" end="00:30:00.190" style="s2">so all of these thinkers were concerned</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.040" end="00:30:01.929" style="s2">about collective pathology and at the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.190" end="00:30:03.280" style="s2">same time concerned about individual</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.929" end="00:30:05.410" style="s2">development and I don&#39;t think you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.280" end="00:30:07.630" style="s2">really separate those things and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.410" end="00:30:12.760" style="s2">reason that I use Solzhenitsyn is</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.630" end="00:30:16.270" style="s2">because he basically takes the same tack</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.760" end="00:30:18.250" style="s2">as Viktor Frankl especially in the gulag</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.270" end="00:30:20.380" style="s2">archipelago but it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.250" end="00:30:22.270" style="s2">thoroughly developed body of thought</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.380" end="00:30:23.800" style="s2">like I&#39;m an admirer of Frankel I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.270" end="00:30:27.640" style="s2">man&#39;s search for meaning is an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.800" end="00:30:30.190" style="s2">book but it&#39;s a good book whereas the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.640" end="00:30:32.290" style="s2">Gulag Archipelago is a devastatingly</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.190" end="00:30:35.080" style="s2">profound book they&#39;re not in the same</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.290" end="00:30:41.110" style="s2">they&#39;re not in the same league you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.080" end="00:30:43.870" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s like Solzhenitsyn is - Viktor</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.110" end="00:30:45.970" style="s2">Frankl what Dostoevsky is - virtually</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.870" end="00:30:47.380" style="s2">any other author you know there&#39;s this I</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.970" end="00:30:50.710" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is about the damn</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.380" end="00:30:52.900" style="s2">Russians maybe their suffering has done</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.710" end="00:30:54.670" style="s2">something to them over the hundreds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.900" end="00:30:56.830" style="s2">years that it&#39;s been in place but they</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.670" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">can produce people of unbelievable</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.830" end="00:31:02.050" style="s2">profundity as well as you know crooks</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:06.040" style="s2">who are crooked and and had murderous</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.050" end="00:31:08.400" style="s2">beyond comprehension so you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.040" end="00:31:11.200" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn was very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.400" end="00:31:13.150" style="s2">trying to understand what happened to</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.200" end="00:31:15.160" style="s2">the Soviet Union was how that it could</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.150" end="00:31:17.270" style="s2">how could it transform itself into a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.160" end="00:31:19.670" style="s2">state that</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.270" end="00:31:22.520" style="s2">powered the majority or a vast minority</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.670" end="00:31:24.890" style="s2">of its citizens and often the best of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.520" end="00:31:26.780" style="s2">the citizenry I mean it was very common</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.890" end="00:31:28.910" style="s2">in the Soviet Union and this is through</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.780" end="00:31:31.220" style="s2">the entire Soviet bloc I mean you were</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.910" end="00:31:32.930" style="s2">required to be an informer roughly</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.220" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">speaking you were certainly taught to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.930" end="00:31:37.490" style="s2">an informer at school and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:39.290" style="s2">Soviets made much of children who were</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.490" end="00:31:41.690" style="s2">patriotic enough to turn in their own</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.290" end="00:31:44.030" style="s2">parents you know they were held up as</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.690" end="00:31:46.490" style="s2">models of behavior and it was very</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.030" end="00:31:48.260" style="s2">frequently the case that if you denounce</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.490" end="00:31:50.600" style="s2">the neighbor that was a really good</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.260" end="00:31:52.430" style="s2">waste way for your family to get their</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.600" end="00:31:56.240" style="s2">apartment and of course apartments were</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.430" end="00:31:58.220" style="s2">an incredibly scarce supply and far too</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.240" end="00:32:00.530" style="s2">many people generally lived in the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.220" end="00:32:02.810" style="s2">locale and so if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.530" end="00:32:04.910" style="s2">three-generation family living in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.810" end="00:32:06.710" style="s2">one-bedroom apartment one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.910" end="00:32:08.240" style="s2">effective ways to get your children a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.710" end="00:32:10.280" style="s2">new apartment was to denounce the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.240" end="00:32:13.130" style="s2">neighbor down the hallway and as a</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.280" end="00:32:14.690" style="s2">reward you&#39;d be given the apartment well</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.130" end="00:32:17.960" style="s2">you can imagine who would take advantage</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.690" end="00:32:19.910" style="s2">of that kind of offer now what happened</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.960" end="00:32:23.390" style="s2">in the 1920s during the collectivization</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.910" end="00:32:25.700" style="s2">so here it here&#39;s the idea how the serfs</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.390" end="00:32:28.570" style="s2">had been emancipated in the late 1800s</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.700" end="00:32:31.640" style="s2">and they were basically feudal</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.570" end="00:32:34.640" style="s2">inhabitants of parcels of land who were</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.640" end="00:32:37.220" style="s2">more or less owned by the nobility it</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.640" end="00:32:39.620" style="s2">wasn&#39;t exactly slavery but because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.220" end="00:32:42.830" style="s2">serfs had certain sets of rights but it</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.620" end="00:32:44.060" style="s2">was it was culture to slavery then to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.830" end="00:32:45.950" style="s2">anything else that you would</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.060" end="00:32:48.260" style="s2">conceptualize from a modern perspective</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.950" end="00:32:51.500" style="s2">the serfs were emancipated in the late</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.260" end="00:32:53.720" style="s2">1800s actually at about the same time</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.500" end="00:32:55.910" style="s2">that slavery was abolished in the United</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.720" end="00:33:00.950" style="s2">States approximately the same period of</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.910" end="00:33:02.660" style="s2">time anyways and so there was and of</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.950" end="00:33:04.820" style="s2">course Russia had a very rich</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.660" end="00:33:06.590" style="s2">aristocracy and it had a monarchy and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.820" end="00:33:09.400" style="s2">the idea that and then it went through</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.590" end="00:33:11.240" style="s2">the First World War and was viciously</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.400" end="00:33:14.740" style="s2">demolished during the first world war</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.240" end="00:33:18.490" style="s2">the idea that there was an underclass of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.740" end="00:33:23.960" style="s2">impoverished people and an over class of</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.490" end="00:33:26.330" style="s2">aristocratic parasites was a compelling</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.960" end="00:33:29.000" style="s2">idea and it was a compelling idea in</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.330" end="00:33:30.919" style="s2">many places other than Russia especially</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.000" end="00:33:32.389" style="s2">at the turn of the century and</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.919" end="00:33:34.340" style="s2">that was partly because the Industrial</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.389" end="00:33:36.470" style="s2">Revolution was brutal and farm life was</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.340" end="00:33:38.809" style="s2">very difficult and there was a massive</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.470" end="00:33:41.619" style="s2">gap between rich and poor and you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.809" end="00:33:44.899" style="s2">that was that was an attractive</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.619" end="00:33:46.489" style="s2">political explanation and it had partial</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.899" end="00:33:49.190" style="s2">truth because of course people are</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.489" end="00:33:50.989" style="s2">exploited and often poor people are poor</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.190" end="00:33:52.820" style="s2">because they&#39;re exploited but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.989" end="00:33:55.429" style="s2">lots of other reasons to be poor and</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.820" end="00:33:56.929" style="s2">rich people are sometimes rich because</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.429" end="00:34:01.960" style="s2">they exploit but of course there&#39;s lots</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.929" end="00:34:01.960" style="s2">of other reasons to be rich as well so</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.649" end="00:34:11.329" style="s2">these ideas were put into practice by</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.779" end="00:34:16.119" style="s2">the Bolshevik revolutionaries and one of</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.329" end="00:34:19.250" style="s2">the most one of the most comprehensive</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.119" end="00:34:22.520" style="s2">manifestations of that idea took place</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.250" end="00:34:24.049" style="s2">in the 1920s when the Soviets underwent</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.520" end="00:34:27.679" style="s2">a process that they called</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.049" end="00:34:30.290" style="s2">dekulakization now so imagine this so in</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.679" end="00:34:32.440" style="s2">the in the late 1800s the serfs were</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.290" end="00:34:34.909" style="s2">emancipated what that meant was that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.440" end="00:34:36.740" style="s2">some people started to own their own</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.909" end="00:34:38.599" style="s2">land you know they weren&#39;t Nobles that</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.740" end="00:34:40.700" style="s2">owned it owned the states they were more</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.599" end="00:34:43.429" style="s2">like what we would consider sort of</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.700" end="00:34:45.559" style="s2">middle-class farmers so they owned some</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.429" end="00:34:47.960" style="s2">land they owned some animals they might</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.559" end="00:34:51.710" style="s2">own a half-decent house in the town and</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.960" end="00:34:54.470" style="s2">they might have done enough or been</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.710" end="00:34:56.629" style="s2">fortunate enough to have collected</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.470" end="00:34:58.190" style="s2">enough money and enough property and</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.629" end="00:35:00.500" style="s2">enough stability so that they could hire</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.190" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">one or two people to help them with</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.500" end="00:35:06.290" style="s2">their crops so they were by no means</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:10.819" style="s2">rich but they were they were the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.290" end="00:35:11.470" style="s2">successful farming class of the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.819" end="00:35:16.099" style="s2">Union</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.470" end="00:35:18.470" style="s2">okay now the Communists put forward the</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.099" end="00:35:21.170" style="s2">idea that there was no way that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.470" end="00:35:23.960" style="s2">could have a brick house in town and</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.170" end="00:35:26.270" style="s2">owned more cows than your neighbor and</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.960" end="00:35:28.579" style="s2">have some productive land put aside and</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.270" end="00:35:31.520" style="s2">worst of all hire someone to work for</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.579" end="00:35:34.339" style="s2">you unless you had essentially stolen</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.520" end="00:35:36.410" style="s2">that from your neighbors so then the</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.339" end="00:35:37.940" style="s2">Communists would send out activists from</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.410" end="00:35:40.790" style="s2">the cities and they would go to these</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.940" end="00:35:42.559" style="s2">towns and start spreading this doctrine</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.790" end="00:35:44.640" style="s2">okay now you&#39;ve got to think this</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.559" end="00:35:48.220" style="s2">through now</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.640" end="00:35:52.630" style="s2">who is going to be most responsive to</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.220" end="00:35:53.680" style="s2">that doctrine well it&#39;s going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.630" end="00:35:56.499" style="s2">most jealous</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.680" end="00:35:58.660" style="s2">useless jealous and resentful people in</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.499" end="00:36:00.670" style="s2">town it&#39;s going to be the guys that are</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.660" end="00:36:02.950" style="s2">hanging around in the local bar drinking</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.670" end="00:36:04.690" style="s2">themselves half to death every day who</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:07.749" style="s2">feel that they&#39;ve been totally screwed</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.690" end="00:36:09.849" style="s2">over by life that are that hate the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.749" end="00:36:12.489" style="s2">people who have come up with a modicum</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.849" end="00:36:14.950" style="s2">of prosperity and then someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.489" end="00:36:17.470" style="s2">along and says hey as far as our</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.950" end="00:36:20.259" style="s2">doctrine goes those people you hate</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.470" end="00:36:23.140" style="s2">they&#39;re nothing better than thieves it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:36:25.390" end="00:36:30.970" style="s2">exactly what happened so during the</p>

<p begin="00:36:30.970" end="00:36:36.720" style="s2">be mobs of jealous and resentful thugs</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.849" end="00:36:39.579" style="s2">who would go into the houses of these</p>

<p begin="00:36:55.329" end="00:36:59.229" style="s2">allowed them to take they were going to</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.229" end="00:37:03.249" style="s2">there was no settlements in Siberia so</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:06.130" style="s2">basically what they meant what that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.249" end="00:37:07.690" style="s2">meant was hastily built rail lines would</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.130" end="00:37:10.269" style="s2">take them in in the middle of the winter</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.690" end="00:37:13.749" style="s2">with their families and dump them on the</p>

<p begin="00:37:13.749" end="00:37:19.390" style="s2">children would die and everybody more or</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.729" end="00:37:21.069" style="s2">less would freeze to death and so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.390" end="00:37:23.289" style="s2">know the Communists said while you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.069" end="00:37:25.029" style="s2">take two months worth of food with you</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.289" end="00:37:27.309" style="s2">but of course they didn&#39;t make any</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.029" end="00:37:29.229" style="s2">provisions for having that two months of</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.309" end="00:37:31.539" style="s2">food and after you had gone through the</p>

<p begin="00:37:33.190" end="00:37:37.930" style="s2">two months of food left that you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.140" end="00:37:39.609" style="s2">take when you were suddenly bundled onto</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.930" end="00:37:43.119" style="s2">the trains and driven to the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.609" end="00:37:45.309" style="s2">nowhere well you know after a number of</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.119" end="00:37:48.339" style="s2">years of that which which also involved</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.309" end="00:37:50.259" style="s2">the forced collectivization of all the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.339" end="00:37:52.420" style="s2">remaining people the distribution of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.259" end="00:37:54.579" style="s2">land in principle to everyone and then</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.420" end="00:37:57.910" style="s2">collective farming while the entire</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.579" end="00:37:59.589" style="s2">agricultural economy fell apart and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.910" end="00:38:01.329" style="s2">particularly the case in the Ukraine</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.589" end="00:38:03.430" style="s2">which is a very very fertile part of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.329" end="00:38:05.559" style="s2">world and which was the breadbasket of</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.430" end="00:38:08.500" style="s2">Russia roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.559" end="00:38:10.690" style="s2">well everybody starved the Communists</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.500" end="00:38:12.630" style="s2">had to put up posters telling people</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.690" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">that eating their children was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.630" end="00:38:17.470" style="s2">they would kill people if they went out</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:19.180" style="s2">in the fields after the harvest so</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.470" end="00:38:22.180" style="s2">they&#39;d go out with her big harvesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.180" end="00:38:23.950" style="s2">machines vacuum up all the grain ship it</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.180" end="00:38:26.440" style="s2">to the cities because the cities were</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.950" end="00:38:28.390" style="s2">also starving and leave nothing for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.440" end="00:38:29.710" style="s2">people behind and then if you went out</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.390" end="00:38:31.270" style="s2">there in the field like if you were a</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.710" end="00:38:32.770" style="s2">mother and your child was starving to</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.270" end="00:38:34.750" style="s2">death and you went out there in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.770" end="00:38:37.210" style="s2">field and you picked up individual</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.750" end="00:38:39.160" style="s2">kernels of grains so that you gather</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.210" end="00:38:42.250" style="s2">them in a cup and bring them home to</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.160" end="00:38:44.829" style="s2">feed their fat your family that was an</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.250" end="00:38:46.539" style="s2">executable crime because you were</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.829" end="00:38:48.430" style="s2">suppose you&#39;re stealing from the state</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.539" end="00:38:50.410" style="s2">if you were going to go out there and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.430" end="00:38:52.119" style="s2">bloody well pick up the wretched little</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.410" end="00:38:54.250" style="s2">kernels that are left you know calf</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.119" end="00:38:56.710" style="s2">crushed into the ground that it was your</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.250" end="00:38:58.630" style="s2">moral obligation to turn those over to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.710" end="00:39:00.700" style="s2">the state because I suppose that was</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.630" end="00:39:04.170" style="s2">part of your ability and the need</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.700" end="00:39:04.170" style="s2">somewhere else was greater</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.430" end="00:39:09.700" style="s2">well Solzhenitsyn was very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.289" end="00:39:10.480" style="s2">how the hell this sort of thing could</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:12.760" style="s2">even happen</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.480" end="00:39:14.680" style="s2">you know because and he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.760" end="00:39:16.390" style="s2">interested in it precisely from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.680" end="00:39:18.609" style="s2">political perspective I mean I would say</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.390" end="00:39:20.740" style="s2">he started being interested in it from a</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.609" end="00:39:23.200" style="s2">political perspective analyzing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.740" end="00:39:24.819" style="s2">actions of people like Lenin and Stalin</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.200" end="00:39:27.309" style="s2">he wrote a very interesting book on</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.819" end="00:39:30.220" style="s2">Lenin which was one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.309" end="00:39:32.740" style="s2">documents that made Lenin out to be the</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.220" end="00:39:34.270" style="s2">same sort of person that Stalin was even</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.740" end="00:39:36.849" style="s2">though I think now the historical</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.270" end="00:39:39.130" style="s2">evidence for that is crystal clear but</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.849" end="00:39:41.650" style="s2">it soldier Nansen ended up more by doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.130" end="00:39:44.890" style="s2">a psychological analysis and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.650" end="00:39:47.230" style="s2">because as he considered what had</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.890" end="00:39:49.960" style="s2">happened to his country he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.230" end="00:39:51.880" style="s2">escape the proposition that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.960" end="00:39:54.490" style="s2">it had become so corrupt was because all</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.880" end="00:39:57.839" style="s2">of the individuals within it had allowed</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.490" end="00:40:01.240" style="s2">themselves to become corrupt and so one</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.839" end="00:40:03.490" style="s2">if you&#39;re wondering for example how you</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.240" end="00:40:05.319" style="s2">know your political system has become</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.490" end="00:40:07.270" style="s2">corrupt or or let&#39;s let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.319" end="00:40:09.220" style="s2">differently how you know that any system</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.270" end="00:40:11.710" style="s2">that you happen to be embedded in has</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.220" end="00:40:14.800" style="s2">become corrupt one way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.710" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">of assessing that judging that is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.800" end="00:40:20.380" style="s2">determine for yourself whether or not</p>

<p begin="00:40:20.380" end="00:40:25.150" style="s2">know I mean you can genuinely think</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.650" end="00:40:27.670" style="s2">something without it being right</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.150" end="00:40:30.490" style="s2">obviously but if you genuinely think</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.670" end="00:40:32.559" style="s2">something that&#39;s your truth and you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.490" end="00:40:34.869" style="s2">in the marketplace of free ideas</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.559" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">everyone is allowed to express their</p>

<p begin="00:40:40.630" end="00:40:45.369" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t grant you any access to power</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.880" end="00:40:48.220" style="s2">but at least you get to say what you</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.369" end="00:40:49.690" style="s2">think and if that&#39;s withheld from you or</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.220" end="00:40:51.940" style="s2">you&#39;re punished for it you can bloody</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.690" end="00:40:54.630" style="s2">well be certain that the system has</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.940" end="00:40:57.010" style="s2">started to take a vicious turn towards</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.630" end="00:40:59.170" style="s2">oppression and repression and that the</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.010" end="00:41:02.440" style="s2">outcome of that&#39;s going to be bad even</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.170" end="00:41:04.119" style="s2">if your thoughts are reprehensible you</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.440" end="00:41:06.010" style="s2">should be allowed to put them forward</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.119" end="00:41:07.720" style="s2">not least because the rest of the</p>

<p begin="00:41:42.760" end="00:41:48.069" style="s2">then you know what they&#39;re thinking and</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.710" end="00:41:50.020" style="s2">it&#39;s and well and it&#39;s also often the</p>

<p begin="00:41:59.160" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn&#39;s conclusion was that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.799" end="00:42:07.809" style="s2">there was no way that the terrors of the</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.740" end="00:42:51.400" style="s2">god-given soul over to human Dogma so</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.040" end="00:42:55.569" style="s2">the basic idea is well you&#39;re left in it</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.400" end="00:42:58.359" style="s2">you&#39;re left in a sphere that it is is as</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.569" end="00:43:00.130" style="s2">the absence of a well-defined meaning so</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.359" end="00:43:02.619" style="s2">that&#39;s a consequence of the collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.130" end="00:43:06.309" style="s2">the previous belief systems and because</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.619" end="00:43:08.650" style="s2">you&#39;re torn apart by that in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.309" end="00:43:10.569" style="s2">you don&#39;t know where to turn in one</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.650" end="00:43:12.190" style="s2">direction is of course nihilistic and</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.569" end="00:43:14.500" style="s2">the other direction perhaps is</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.190" end="00:43:16.240" style="s2">totalitarian now another direction might</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.500" end="00:43:19.380" style="s2">be that you try to figure things out on</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.240" end="00:43:22.660" style="s2">your own and still live a life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.380" end="00:43:24.099" style="s2">truthful and and and that has integrity</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.660" end="00:43:26.710" style="s2">but we&#39;re going to leave that alone for</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.099" end="00:43:28.660" style="s2">a moment because it&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.710" end="00:43:30.280" style="s2">even conceptualize that might exist if</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.660" end="00:43:32.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve already swallowed the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.280" end="00:43:35.079" style="s2">presupposition that all the values have</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.170" end="00:43:37.540" style="s2">fallen apart you turn to totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.079" end="00:43:39.250" style="s2">okay well it tells you what to think it</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.540" end="00:43:41.980" style="s2">tells you how to act it tells you how</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.250" end="00:43:44.130" style="s2">your society should be structured but it</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.980" end="00:43:47.500" style="s2">does some things that are even more</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.130" end="00:43:49.930" style="s2">subtle and subtly destructive than that</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.500" end="00:43:53.500" style="s2">because what it also does is positive</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.930" end="00:43:55.660" style="s2">future utopia which is an organization</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.500" end="00:43:58.390" style="s2">of the state where everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.660" end="00:44:00.160" style="s2">everything they want permanently now</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.390" end="00:44:02.260" style="s2">Dostoyevsky when he wrote Snow --tz--</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.160" end="00:44:04.180" style="s2">from underground he basically said well</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.260" end="00:44:06.280" style="s2">this was way before the Communist</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.180" end="00:44:11.460" style="s2">revolution he said he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.280" end="00:44:14.200" style="s2">these sorts of utopian egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.460" end="00:44:16.420" style="s2">communitarians he said they&#39;ve got human</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.200" end="00:44:18.579" style="s2">beings completely wrong right right from</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.420" end="00:44:20.859" style="s2">the bottom up because if you took the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.579" end="00:44:22.869" style="s2">typical person he says you if you gave</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.859" end="00:44:24.490" style="s2">them everything they possibly wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.869" end="00:44:26.559" style="s2">eat so that all they had to ever do was</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.490" end="00:44:29.290" style="s2">eat delicious cakes and they didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.559" end="00:44:30.480" style="s2">any other responsibilities than What did</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.290" end="00:44:33.130" style="s2">he say</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.480" end="00:44:35.619" style="s2">indulging in the continuation of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.130" end="00:44:37.329" style="s2">human species and so that if they were</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.619" end="00:44:38.450" style="s2">so happy that if you put them under</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.329" end="00:44:39.890" style="s2">water nothing but</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.450" end="00:44:42.290" style="s2">people&#39;s of bliss would float up to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.890" end="00:44:43.849" style="s2">surface the first thing that people who</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.290" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">were put in that situation would do</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.849" end="00:44:48.260" style="s2">would be to wander around smashing</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:51.109" style="s2">things just so that something unexpected</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.260" end="00:44:53.450" style="s2">and interesting would happen you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.109" end="00:44:55.400" style="s2">it&#39;s a brilliant critique of utopianism</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.450" end="00:44:58.609" style="s2">because it&#39;s exactly right he said he</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.400" end="00:45:03.609" style="s2">basically Dostoyevsky said people are so</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.609" end="00:45:06.829" style="s2">crazy that they&#39;d rather be subjected to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.609" end="00:45:09.320" style="s2">inconvenient and unexpected occurrences</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.829" end="00:45:11.329" style="s2">than just to lay there all saw per if</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.320" end="00:45:13.099" style="s2">acquit bliss and so that there was</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.329" end="00:45:15.650" style="s2">something wrong with the whole utopia</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.099" end="00:45:17.119" style="s2">notion right from the get-go because</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.650" end="00:45:19.640" style="s2">that&#39;s just not what people are like</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.119" end="00:45:22.940" style="s2">they&#39;d rather have interesting trouble</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.640" end="00:45:24.290" style="s2">than non interesting perfection you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.940" end="00:45:27.710" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.290" end="00:45:29.240" style="s2">powerful idea but anyways this you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.710" end="00:45:31.250" style="s2">just think about that in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.240" end="00:45:33.020" style="s2">your own character I mean how often do</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.250" end="00:45:35.119" style="s2">you do something that&#39;s trouble just to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.020" end="00:45:38.420" style="s2">see what happens I mean it&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.119" end="00:45:41.150" style="s2">what people are like you know even</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.420" end="00:45:43.640" style="s2">chimpanzees juvenile chimps if they see</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.150" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">an old male sleeping underneath the tree</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.640" end="00:45:47.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll go and poke him with a stick</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.440" end="00:45:49.819" style="s2">just to see what happens you know and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.960" end="00:45:51.290" style="s2">it&#39;s like well if you can&#39;t see human</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.819" end="00:45:54.260" style="s2">Humanity in that sort of behavior</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.290" end="00:45:56.329" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with you so but</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.260" end="00:45:58.339" style="s2">the utopians offered this vision of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.329" end="00:46:00.440" style="s2">future which was basically paradise on</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.339" end="00:46:01.819" style="s2">earth but they also proposed that it was</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.440" end="00:46:04.339" style="s2">something that could be attained through</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.819" end="00:46:06.200" style="s2">certain types of you know direct</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.339" end="00:46:08.750" style="s2">political action which usually meant</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.200" end="00:46:10.579" style="s2">well fix your neighbor up or even worse</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.750" end="00:46:12.380" style="s2">meant steal what he has because he</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.579" end="00:46:14.150" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t have it anyways and the</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.380" end="00:46:16.970" style="s2">problem with the utopian vision</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.150" end="00:46:19.099" style="s2">essentially was that if my theory is</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.970" end="00:46:21.109" style="s2">associated with the future utopia in a</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.099" end="00:46:23.569" style="s2">logical way so I can make a case to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.109" end="00:46:25.400" style="s2">that if you do this and we do that and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.569" end="00:46:28.490" style="s2">they do this and we organising things</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.400" end="00:46:31.550" style="s2">this way then will usher in a period of</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.490" end="00:46:34.280" style="s2">prosperity that&#39;s almost heavenly in its</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.550" end="00:46:35.569" style="s2">in its promise the problem with that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.280" end="00:46:37.579" style="s2">it means we can do any bloody thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.569" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">bloody thing we want right now because</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.579" end="00:46:42.109" style="s2">the end product is so valuable that it</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:44.359" style="s2">justifies it and so what happens is that</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.109" end="00:46:47.329" style="s2">the utopian vision turns into a</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.359" end="00:46:50.210" style="s2">rationale for the most destructive forms</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.329" end="00:46:52.040" style="s2">of behavior in the here and now and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.210" end="00:46:53.090" style="s2">when someone is called to task for</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.040" end="00:46:54.890" style="s2">it&#39;s like what the hell do you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.090" end="00:46:56.600" style="s2">you&#39;re doing you know they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.890" end="00:46:59.630" style="s2">something like well you can&#39;t make an</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.600" end="00:47:00.980" style="s2">omelet without breaking eggs you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.630" end="00:47:02.720" style="s2">and that&#39;s all well and good if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.980" end="00:47:04.610" style="s2">happen to be making the omelet but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.720" end="00:47:07.070" style="s2">not so damn good if you happen to be one</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.610" end="00:47:09.530" style="s2">of the eggs and there were plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.070" end="00:47:12.560" style="s2">eggs broken on the way to you know the</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.530" end="00:47:14.960" style="s2">Soviet vision of success well and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.560" end="00:47:19.430" style="s2">know there&#39;s good evidence Stalin by the</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.960" end="00:47:21.350" style="s2">time the mid-1950s came around there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.430" end="00:47:23.750" style="s2">pretty decent evidence from the KGB</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.350" end="00:47:25.970" style="s2">archives that he was preparing to launch</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.750" end="00:47:27.770" style="s2">a thermonuclear war against Europe I</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.970" end="00:47:30.110" style="s2">mean he&#39;d already killed god only knows</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.770" end="00:47:32.360" style="s2">how many million people by that point a</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.110" end="00:47:33.800" style="s2">few more hundred million weren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.360" end="00:47:35.990" style="s2">going to weigh that heavily on his</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.800" end="00:47:39.140" style="s2">conscience the last book I read on</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.990" end="00:47:41.090" style="s2">Stalin which was published which was</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.140" end="00:47:44.390" style="s2">called Stalin it was written by a guy</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.090" end="00:47:45.740" style="s2">who had access to the KGB and communist</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.390" end="00:47:47.900" style="s2">party archives</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.740" end="00:47:49.820" style="s2">he claimed that Khrushchev and three</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.900" end="00:47:52.780" style="s2">other people killed Stalin in the late</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.820" end="00:47:57.910" style="s2">1950s to stop him from invading Europe</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.780" end="00:48:01.010" style="s2">so I mean you know in the battle between</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.910" end="00:48:03.050" style="s2">the Communists utopians and the West we</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.010" end="00:48:10.010" style="s2">came this close to wiping everything out</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.050" end="00:48:12.770" style="s2">several times so now what happened in</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.010" end="00:48:15.620" style="s2">some sense was this is that this theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.770" end="00:48:17.900" style="s2">was laid out to cover the world so the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.620" end="00:48:20.720" style="s2">Marxist theory was presented itself as a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.900" end="00:48:22.670" style="s2">scientific theory an inevitable theory</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.720" end="00:48:26.600" style="s2">of history and the theory of history was</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.670" end="00:48:28.700" style="s2">that the warfare between the oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.600" end="00:48:31.400" style="s2">and the oppressor was the primary fact</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.700" end="00:48:34.280" style="s2">of life and that that needed to</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.400" end="00:48:35.960" style="s2">transform itself into a egalitarian</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.280" end="00:48:38.570" style="s2">utopia and that there were certain</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.960" end="00:48:40.160" style="s2">states that political states that</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.570" end="00:48:42.980" style="s2">mankind would have to go through to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.160" end="00:48:45.410" style="s2">reach that end ok so that was basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.980" end="00:48:47.450" style="s2">the theory and part of the theory was</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.410" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">that in order to get to that point then</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.450" end="00:48:52.490" style="s2">resources had to be distributed equally</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.000" end="00:48:54.410" style="s2">to all which sounds fine in principle</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.490" end="00:48:56.810" style="s2">but then again the devil is always in</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.410" end="00:48:59.890" style="s2">the details and how to distribute</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.810" end="00:49:01.970" style="s2">resources equally is by no means</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.890" end="00:49:04.220" style="s2">self-evident you know part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.970" end="00:49:05.760" style="s2">that the English came up with the idea</p>

<p begin="00:49:08.340" end="00:49:14.310" style="s2">figured out that trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.010" end="00:49:16.970" style="s2">what things were worth is so complicated</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.310" end="00:49:19.710" style="s2">that you can&#39;t actually calculate it so</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.970" end="00:49:22.710" style="s2">then we would say well what&#39;s your coat</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.710" end="00:49:29.820" style="s2">worth I&#39;d say well would you give me</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.710" end="00:49:33.300" style="s2">your coat for five dollars $2 thousand</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.820" end="00:49:36.360" style="s2">dollars okay so so but so the point</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.300" end="00:49:38.490" style="s2">being is that you know there&#39;s no way of</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.360" end="00:49:41.280" style="s2">establishing the worth of things because</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.490" end="00:49:43.410" style="s2">the worth of one thing is it&#39;s worth in</p>

<p begin="00:49:43.410" end="00:49:48.420" style="s2">worth like it&#39;s a continual interaction</p>

<p begin="00:49:48.420" end="00:49:53.640" style="s2">way you can make that calculation is by</p>

<p begin="00:49:53.640" end="00:49:58.830" style="s2">micro choices and that the value of</p>

<p begin="00:50:03.120" end="00:50:07.800" style="s2">something about some that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.740" end="00:50:09.900" style="s2">like distributed cognition you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.800" end="00:50:11.910" style="s2">like you&#39;re outsourcing a price decision</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.900" end="00:50:14.670" style="s2">to the marketplace what&#39;s this thing</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.910" end="00:50:17.580" style="s2">worth well the answer is whatever people</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.670" end="00:50:20.220" style="s2">will trade for it and it&#39;s not a cop-out</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.580" end="00:50:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an illustration indication of</p>

<p begin="00:50:24.330" end="00:50:30.270" style="s2">determine what something is worth so I</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.710" end="00:50:32.160" style="s2">mean I can give you an example of that</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.270" end="00:50:34.850" style="s2">from my own life trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.160" end="00:50:38.580" style="s2">what something is worth I developed some</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.850" end="00:50:41.550" style="s2">software to help people hire employees</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.580" end="00:50:43.470" style="s2">and we did the mathematical calculations</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.550" end="00:50:46.110" style="s2">and figured out that if people use this</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.470" end="00:50:48.690" style="s2">particular software instead of going</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.110" end="00:50:50.820" style="s2">through a interview process which</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.690" end="00:50:53.700" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work very well that it would</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.820" end="00:50:56.280" style="s2">basically if they used if they gave it</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.700" end="00:50:59.280" style="s2">to ten people to select one employee</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.280" end="00:51:02.100" style="s2">that it would save them about thirty</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.280" end="00:51:05.640" style="s2">five percent of the salary of the hired</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.100" end="00:51:07.620" style="s2">person per year so if you hired someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.640" end="00:51:09.780" style="s2">who was being paid a hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.620" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">dollars then the return on investment</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.780" end="00:51:15.570" style="s2">would be thirty five thousand dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:17.070" style="s2">year and we could sell this for say well</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.570" end="00:51:18.930" style="s2">we didn&#39;t know what how much do you</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.070" end="00:51:19.820" style="s2">charge for the tests then so you might</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.930" end="00:51:22.260" style="s2">say well if it</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.820" end="00:51:23.700" style="s2">$35,000 a year you&#39;re going to have this</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.260" end="00:51:25.410" style="s2">person around for four years because</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.700" end="00:51:27.570" style="s2">that&#39;s how long the average person stays</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.410" end="00:51:30.780" style="s2">in their job that&#39;s a hundred and fifty</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.570" end="00:51:32.880" style="s2">thousand dollars and so then you only</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.780" end="00:51:35.310" style="s2">have to use ten tests and so maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.880" end="00:51:37.020" style="s2">could take half of the first year so</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.310" end="00:51:38.580" style="s2">that would be $17,000 so it&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.020" end="00:51:41.070" style="s2">seventeen hundred and fifty dollars a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.580" end="00:51:43.740" style="s2">test and you&#39;d get like a thirty what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.070" end="00:51:45.960" style="s2">it you get a eight times return on your</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.740" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">investment well you should be just</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.960" end="00:51:49.440" style="s2">jumping at that well it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.030" style="s2">like that at all we ended up having to</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.440" end="00:51:52.500" style="s2">sell it for about twenty dollars a test</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.030" end="00:51:55.230" style="s2">and we could hardly sell it to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.500" end="00:51:58.620" style="s2">because well for reasons that are far</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.230" end="00:52:01.680" style="s2">too complex to go into but my point is</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.620" end="00:52:04.590" style="s2">is that it&#39;s impossible to make a</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.680" end="00:52:06.780" style="s2">pricing decision it&#39;s really really</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.590" end="00:52:10.190" style="s2">difficult and to think that you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.780" end="00:52:12.990" style="s2">make a conscious and pre-programmed</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.190" end="00:52:15.000" style="s2">pricing decision for every single</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.990" end="00:52:16.050" style="s2">commodity is completely insane and</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.000" end="00:52:18.630" style="s2">that&#39;s what they tried to do in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.050" end="00:52:20.730" style="s2">Soviet Union and I read at one point</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.630" end="00:52:22.350" style="s2">that the central purse up right pricing</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.730" end="00:52:25.470" style="s2">committee had to make ten thousand</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.350" end="00:52:27.120" style="s2">pricing decisions a day well you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.470" end="00:52:29.280" style="s2">even come up with the price of one you</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.120" end="00:52:31.080" style="s2">put things on Kijiji you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.280" end="00:52:32.820" style="s2">well what&#39;s it worth well you look at</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.080" end="00:52:34.950" style="s2">what everyone else is paying for it</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.820" end="00:52:36.420" style="s2">roughly speaking and then it depends on</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.950" end="00:52:38.070" style="s2">how quickly you want to sell it what</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.420" end="00:52:40.320" style="s2">kind of shape it&#39;s in and you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.070" end="00:52:42.090" style="s2">complicated and you have a pricing</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.320" end="00:52:44.130" style="s2">guideline you just have to look the damn</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.090" end="00:52:46.020" style="s2">thing up it&#39;s still hard to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.130" end="00:52:48.030" style="s2">what the price is but imagine you have</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.020" end="00:52:51.570" style="s2">no comparative information at all</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.030" end="00:52:53.040" style="s2">what&#39;s a hypodermic needle worth well I</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.570" end="00:52:54.900" style="s2">guess it depends on whether you need it</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.040" end="00:52:56.310" style="s2">to inject the penicillin that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.900" end="00:52:58.830" style="s2">save your life or if you&#39;re just putting</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.310" end="00:53:01.290" style="s2">it in your cupboard to store it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.830" end="00:53:03.900" style="s2">a complicated decision alright so</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.290" end="00:53:06.720" style="s2">anyways this utopian scheme was set up</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.900" end="00:53:08.670" style="s2">and we&#39;re acting on the proposition that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.720" end="00:53:11.070" style="s2">people used it at least in part as a</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.670" end="00:53:12.510" style="s2">replacement for their alternative for</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.070" end="00:53:14.910" style="s2">their old belief systems which i think</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.510" end="00:53:16.440" style="s2">is a perfectly reasonable proposition</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.910" end="00:53:18.270" style="s2">but we&#39;re also going to take a</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.440" end="00:53:20.460" style="s2">psychoanalytic approach and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.270" end="00:53:24.420" style="s2">to say well it also allowed people to</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.460" end="00:53:27.420" style="s2">manifest bad faith because if your worth</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.420" end="00:53:29.250" style="s2">can be determined by how good a cog you</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.420" end="00:53:31.500" style="s2">are in the fascist or communist</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.250" end="00:53:33.270" style="s2">machinery it pretty much alleviates you</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.500" end="00:53:33.450" style="s2">of any responsibility that you have to</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.270" end="00:53:36.349" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.450" end="00:53:38.820" style="s2">for your own life so that for every</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.349" end="00:53:40.890" style="s2">positive reason that you might join a</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.820" end="00:53:43.200" style="s2">utopian movement there&#39;s a negative</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.890" end="00:53:45.060" style="s2">reason which as well you can benefit</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.200" end="00:53:46.890" style="s2">from its exploitive nature and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.060" end="00:53:49.859" style="s2">have to take any responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.890" end="00:53:52.260" style="s2">well Solzhenitsyn and Frankel both</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.859" end="00:53:53.910" style="s2">talked about that a lot as did Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.260" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">but Frankel and Solzhenitsyn are more</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.910" end="00:53:58.470" style="s2">interesting because they actually happen</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:00.180" style="s2">to live through the imposition of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.470" end="00:54:01.579" style="s2">systems like that and could see them</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.180" end="00:54:04.170" style="s2">from the inside</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.579" end="00:54:07.560" style="s2">Soulja Vincent&#39;s first observation was</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.170" end="00:54:10.140" style="s2">Marxist economics didn&#39;t work well that</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.560" end="00:54:11.670" style="s2">was a big problem because it was</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.140" end="00:54:13.490" style="s2">supposed to work and not only was it</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.670" end="00:54:16.859" style="s2">supposed to work it was supposed to work</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.490" end="00:54:19.349" style="s2">perfectly and what that basically meant</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.859" end="00:54:21.240" style="s2">was that if it didn&#39;t work you only had</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.349" end="00:54:23.430" style="s2">one of two options you could either</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.240" end="00:54:24.869" style="s2">abandon the damn system and start to</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.430" end="00:54:26.579" style="s2">complain about the fact that you had to</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.869" end="00:54:29.849" style="s2">line up for bread for four hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.579" end="00:54:31.980" style="s2">which was perfectly typical daily</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.849" end="00:54:33.900" style="s2">activity for people for example in</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.980" end="00:54:36.270" style="s2">Poland and in Russia before the wall</p>

<p begin="00:54:36.270" end="00:54:39.869" style="s2">there wasn&#39;t anything to buy so it</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.310" end="00:54:41.790" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very much of a bargain and</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.869" end="00:54:44.190" style="s2">instead of paying for your bread with</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.790" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">money you just paid for it with time you</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.190" end="00:54:48.180" style="s2">stayed in line for two hours or three</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:50.040" style="s2">hours or five hours and when you got to</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.180" end="00:54:51.450" style="s2">the front of the line at the department</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.040" end="00:54:53.160" style="s2">store you took whatever the hell was</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.450" end="00:54:54.329" style="s2">there because you didn&#39;t even know what</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.160" end="00:54:56.579" style="s2">it was that you were going to be buying</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.329" end="00:54:58.440" style="s2">when you joined the line up and so it</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.579" end="00:55:00.980" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like it was free you just paid</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.440" end="00:55:04.680" style="s2">for it with your time</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.980" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">so Solzhenitsyn noted that what happened</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.680" end="00:55:09.180" style="s2">as the system continued to manifest its</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:11.010" style="s2">counterproductive properties was that</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.180" end="00:55:14.130" style="s2">either people had the choice of saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.010" end="00:55:16.940" style="s2">oh this isn&#39;t working worth a damn there</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.130" end="00:55:18.839" style="s2">must be something rotten in Denmark or</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.940" end="00:55:21.329" style="s2">pretending that everything was all right</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.839" end="00:55:24.119" style="s2">and lying about everything and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.329" end="00:55:25.859" style="s2">what they did they lied about everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.119" end="00:55:28.170" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve got to you got the</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.859" end="00:55:30.210" style="s2">situation up to the point where in East</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.170" end="00:55:31.650" style="s2">Germany before the wall came down one</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.210" end="00:55:34.349" style="s2">out of every three people was a</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.650" end="00:55:36.150" style="s2">government informer that meant if you</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.349" end="00:55:37.859" style="s2">had a family of six people two of them</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.150" end="00:55:40.200" style="s2">were telling the government what you</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.859" end="00:55:42.930" style="s2">were talking about at dinner and that</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.200" end="00:55:44.730" style="s2">was their duty and so what that meant in</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.930" end="00:55:47.030" style="s2">these societies was no one ever said</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.730" end="00:55:48.950" style="s2">anything that they meant ever</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.030" end="00:55:50.780" style="s2">and if they did the probability that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.950" end="00:55:52.340" style="s2">KGB was going to kick down their door at</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.780" end="00:55:54.410" style="s2">4:00 in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.340" end="00:55:56.390" style="s2">and take them off to the Central Prison</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.410" end="00:55:57.920" style="s2">before dumping them in some damn camp</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.390" end="00:55:59.300" style="s2">where they&#39;d never see anybody they ever</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.920" end="00:56:01.760" style="s2">do for the rest of their life was</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.300" end="00:56:03.470" style="s2">extraordinarily high so you watched</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.760" end="00:56:05.930" style="s2">everything you said and everything you</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.470" end="00:56:08.180" style="s2">thought around your wife around your</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.930" end="00:56:11.090" style="s2">brother around your sister around your</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.180" end="00:56:15.350" style="s2">children and the whole system ground</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.090" end="00:56:18.740" style="s2">onward in a mire of absolute deception</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.350" end="00:56:22.250" style="s2">and lie and Solzhenitsyn&#39;s point as well</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.740" end="00:56:26.060" style="s2">and this is one of Frankel&#39;s main points</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.250" end="00:56:29.120" style="s2">is that if people had had if people had</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.060" end="00:56:30.980" style="s2">decided to stop lying the system would</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.120" end="00:56:33.950" style="s2">have ground to a halt but that isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.980" end="00:56:35.510" style="s2">what people did they just kept lying now</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.950" end="00:56:37.280" style="s2">he noticed when he was in the prison</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.510" end="00:56:40.040" style="s2">camps because he was in them for a long</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:41.990" style="s2">time he did encounter people inside the</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.040" end="00:56:44.510" style="s2">camps like Frankel did who were</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.990" end="00:56:46.850" style="s2">absolutely unwilling to falsify their</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.510" end="00:56:48.380" style="s2">experience so for example one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.850" end="00:56:50.960" style="s2">things that had to happen if you were</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.380" end="00:56:52.880" style="s2">arrested by the KGB and sentenced to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.960" end="00:56:55.490" style="s2">prison camp was that it was necessary</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.880" end="00:56:58.010" style="s2">for you to sign a confession and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.490" end="00:57:00.680" style="s2">so peculiar you think huh they&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.010" end="00:57:03.590" style="s2">to arrest you arbitrarily and put you on</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.680" end="00:57:05.780" style="s2">trial for trumped-up nonsense</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.590" end="00:57:07.730" style="s2">why couldn&#39;t they just Forge your damn</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.780" end="00:57:10.070" style="s2">signature it&#39;s like why did they care if</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.730" end="00:57:12.590" style="s2">you confessed and the answer to that was</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.070" end="00:57:14.420" style="s2">well it was part of the way the system</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.590" end="00:57:16.610" style="s2">kept itself validated because the people</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.420" end="00:57:18.440" style="s2">who were torturing you could justify the</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.610" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">torture if you agreed that you were</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.440" end="00:57:22.550" style="s2">actually at fault and so rather than</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:25.010" style="s2">face the fact that they were just doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.550" end="00:57:27.110" style="s2">something corrupt innocent people they&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.010" end="00:57:28.940" style="s2">extract a confession out of you so that</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.110" end="00:57:32.300" style="s2">they could convince themselves that you</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.940" end="00:57:34.190" style="s2">deserved exactly what you got now</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.300" end="00:57:36.020" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn said at one time that one</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.190" end="00:57:37.880" style="s2">person who stopped lying to bring down a</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.020" end="00:57:40.250" style="s2">tyranny now that&#39;s a pretty radical</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.880" end="00:57:43.040" style="s2">statement but you know when he wrote the</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.250" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">Gulag Archipelago I mean he memorized</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.040" end="00:57:47.090" style="s2">that damn book when he was in one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.440" end="00:57:49.490" style="s2">prison camps because they didn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.090" end="00:57:50.720" style="s2">him pencil or paper and even if they did</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.490" end="00:57:52.780" style="s2">they wouldn&#39;t been able to carry the</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.720" end="00:57:56.810" style="s2">damn manuscript around so he basically</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.780" end="00:58:00.369" style="s2">memorized it 2700 pages you know written</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.810" end="00:58:02.920" style="s2">at the volume of a very loud screen</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.369" end="00:58:05.349" style="s2">when he got out of the prison camps he</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.920" end="00:58:07.359" style="s2">had two copies of it typed up one by one</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.349" end="00:58:09.190" style="s2">typist and one by another they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.359" end="00:58:10.690" style="s2">know each other the KGB broke into the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.190" end="00:58:12.339" style="s2">one typists home and stole the</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.690" end="00:58:15.009" style="s2">manuscript and she killed herself</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.339" end="00:58:16.180" style="s2">then the guellen you can understand why</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.009" end="00:58:18.009" style="s2">you know what she thought this was a</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.180" end="00:58:20.109" style="s2">tremendously valuable piece of work and</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.009" end="00:58:23.289" style="s2">she thought it was the only copy and</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.109" end="00:58:24.759" style="s2">they destroyed it well he couldn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.289" end="00:58:26.619" style="s2">tell her that there was another one</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.759" end="00:58:29.640" style="s2">because they would have got it too</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.619" end="00:58:31.720" style="s2">well then it was exported to the West in</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.640" end="00:58:33.759" style="s2">unpublished form and published in</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.720" end="00:58:36.789" style="s2">English to begin with and it was an</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.759" end="00:58:39.789" style="s2">absolute bombshell like and it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.789" end="00:58:41.589" style="s2">published in 1974 was at that point</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.789" end="00:58:43.990" style="s2">anyone who had any moral integrity</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.589" end="00:58:47.019" style="s2">whatsoever and who was also literate</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.990" end="00:58:49.690" style="s2">read that and said oh okay game over all</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.019" end="00:58:53.349" style="s2">those propositions they&#39;re wrong beyond</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.690" end="00:58:56.859" style="s2">belief and that part of what we thought</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.349" end="00:58:58.779" style="s2">might be possible is done well you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.859" end="00:59:00.849" style="s2">that happened to some degree it</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.779" end="00:59:02.470" style="s2">communism lost a tremendous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.849" end="00:59:03.940" style="s2">its intellectual credibility and that</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.470" end="00:59:06.369" style="s2">was part of the reason that it fell over</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.940" end="00:59:08.650" style="s2">in 1989 but you know it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.369" end="00:59:10.930" style="s2">everybody has shaken their no it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.650" end="00:59:13.390" style="s2">as if everyone&#39;s faith and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.930" end="00:59:15.489" style="s2">thing is being shaken you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.390" end="00:59:17.549" style="s2">this massive stream of Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.489" end="00:59:19.900" style="s2">utopianism that&#39;s still running through</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.549" end="00:59:21.279" style="s2">post-modernism and that&#39;s that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.900" end="00:59:23.799" style="s2">know made its way to Western</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.279" end="00:59:27.039" style="s2">universities all over the world so</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.799" end="00:59:29.230" style="s2">despite all of this despite these tens</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.039" end="00:59:31.989" style="s2">of millions of deaths and this total</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.230" end="00:59:34.420" style="s2">moral corruption and no one even knows</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.989" end="00:59:37.980" style="s2">about it and I don&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.420" end="00:59:39.369" style="s2">it&#39;s completely it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.980" end="00:59:41.739" style="s2">unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.369" end="00:59:43.960" style="s2">it&#39;s the biggest lesson of the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.739" end="00:59:45.940" style="s2">century you know and we hear a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.960" end="00:59:48.130" style="s2">the Holocaust and no wonder it was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.940" end="00:59:50.380" style="s2">truly terrible thing but there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.130" end="00:59:52.859" style="s2">these other events of the 20th century</p>

<p begin="00:59:52.859" end="00:59:59.410" style="s2">they&#39;re not part of general knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.140" end="01:00:02.380" style="s2">and you have to ask yourself why because</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.410" end="01:00:04.930" style="s2">if we can&#39;t learn from that if we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.380" end="01:00:06.730" style="s2">learn from all those tens of millions of</p>

<p begin="01:00:06.730" end="01:00:11.799" style="s2">and and and ruined in political prisons</p>

<p begin="01:00:15.440" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">things that Solzhenitsyn wrote he</p>

<p begin="01:02:06.740" end="01:02:11.270" style="s2">was tens of thousands of people in them</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.540" end="01:02:13.850" style="s2">the most ghastly moment of the 24 hours</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.270" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">of camp life was the awakening when at a</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.850" end="01:02:17.930" style="s2">still nocturnal hour the three shrill</p>

<p begin="01:02:24.800" end="01:02:29.750" style="s2">could scarcely force our feet which</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.630" end="01:02:31.460" style="s2">sore and swollen with edema and there</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.750" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">were the usual moans and groans about</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.460" end="01:02:36.380" style="s2">petty troubles such as the snapping of</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:38.329" style="s2">wires which replaced shoelaces one</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.380" end="01:02:40.569" style="s2">morning I heard someone whom I knew to</p>

<p begin="01:02:40.569" end="01:02:44.839" style="s2">because he finally had to go to the</p>

<p begin="01:02:44.839" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">as his shoes were too shrunken for him</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.329" end="01:02:52.279" style="s2">to wear in these ghastly moments I found</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:54.559" style="s2">a little bit of comfort a small piece of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.279" end="01:02:56.799" style="s2">bread which I drilled my pocket and</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.559" end="01:03:01.789" style="s2">munched with absorbed delight</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.799" end="01:03:03.769" style="s2">this is Solzhenitsyn so in these camps</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.789" end="01:03:05.599" style="s2">people were set out to work and it would</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.769" end="01:03:07.400" style="s2">depend on where they were what they were</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.599" end="01:03:09.289" style="s2">working on but maybe it was the digging</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.400" end="01:03:12.470" style="s2">of a canal or maybe they were setting up</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.289" end="01:03:14.390" style="s2">a factory or or they were doing</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.470" end="01:03:18.460" style="s2">something that required the generally</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.390" end="01:03:22.240" style="s2">required intense physical effort and</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.460" end="01:03:24.650" style="s2">each of these camps had a they had a</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.240" end="01:03:27.079" style="s2">goal right that was established from</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.650" end="01:03:28.940" style="s2">above it&#39;s like a 5-year plan your camp</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.079" end="01:03:30.410" style="s2">is to produce this much in this period</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.940" end="01:03:32.390" style="s2">of time and then if you didn&#39;t produce</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.410" end="01:03:34.279" style="s2">that much in that period of time then</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.390" end="01:03:35.779" style="s2">the people who ran the camp were going</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.279" end="01:03:36.920" style="s2">to be held accountable which generally</p>
<p begin="01:03:35.779" end="01:03:39.529" style="s2">meant that they were going to be put in</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.920" end="01:03:41.299" style="s2">some camp themselves and so there was</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.529" end="01:03:43.220" style="s2">every reason to drive people to their</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.299" end="01:03:44.690" style="s2">death in order to fulfill the work norms</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.220" end="01:03:46.430" style="s2">and when that didn&#39;t happen they just</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.690" end="01:03:48.910" style="s2">falsified the records anyways because</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.430" end="01:03:50.839" style="s2">what the hell was their choice and</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.910" end="01:03:54.650" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn talks about how they got</p>

<p begin="01:04:03.500" end="01:04:08.299" style="s2">not gone out to work well so then you</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.809" end="01:04:11.990" style="s2">can tell a bit about the benevolence of</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.299" end="01:04:13.519" style="s2">the Soviet state if it was 55 below well</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.990" end="01:04:16.430" style="s2">then you could go out to work but if it</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.519" end="01:04:18.589" style="s2">was 60 below you got to stay home while</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.430" end="01:04:20.960" style="s2">that isn&#39;t even how it worked in other</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.589" end="01:04:22.519" style="s2">words on 60-below days the record showed</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.960" end="01:04:24.859" style="s2">that the workers had not gone to work</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.519" end="01:04:26.720" style="s2">but they chased them out anyways and</p>

<p begin="01:04:26.720" end="01:04:32.000" style="s2">those days was added to the other days</p>
