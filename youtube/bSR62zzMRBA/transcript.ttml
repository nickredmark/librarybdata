<p begin="00:00:00.800" end="00:00:05.460" style="s2">it is almost a bedtime</p>
<p begin="00:00:03.000" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">I&#39;ve yet to put up a video today because</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.460" end="00:00:10.769" style="s2">I&#39;ve been playing around with this</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">analogy that I&#39;m taking pictures I can</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.769" end="00:00:17.460" style="s2">do a Twitter post tomorrow because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:20.430" style="s2">not happening tonight but I have this</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.460" end="00:00:21.990" style="s2">idea and I that we&#39;re all equal and how</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.430" end="00:00:22.920" style="s2">to actually explain that in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.990" end="00:00:26.010" style="s2">makes sense to people</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.920" end="00:00:29.090" style="s2">my background is ecology and so I like</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.010" end="00:00:32.189" style="s2">to explain it like every individual is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.090" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">species in and of themselves you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.189" end="00:00:36.239" style="s2">broken just because you sleep all day</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">you&#39;re a cat you&#39;re not you know like we</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.239" end="00:00:41.100" style="s2">all have different niches within the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:42.690" style="s2">ecosystem the issue with that like all</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.100" end="00:00:46.430" style="s2">of the analogies that I want a cup with</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.690" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">to explain it is that our connotation is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.430" end="00:00:55.430" style="s2">different for different species we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:58.469" style="s2">think of an ant or a fly or a plant or a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.430" end="00:01:00.149" style="s2">tiger as equal to one another</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.469" end="00:01:02.219" style="s2">we don&#39;t talk about them like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.149" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">equal to one another even though they</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.219" end="00:01:09.630" style="s2">are all how an ecosystem runs you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:13.350" style="s2">have an ecosystem without all of it the</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.630" end="00:01:17.100" style="s2">same with the analogy of a machine a car</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.350" end="00:01:20.070" style="s2">there&#39;s an engine and fuel gauges and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.100" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">only works when it comes together so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.070" end="00:01:26.460" style="s2">have been playing with children&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:28.320" style="s2">puzzles all evening because that to me</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.460" end="00:01:33.030" style="s2">right now is the perfect dinner watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.320" end="00:01:34.380" style="s2">a and it&#39;s still working out I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.030" end="00:01:36.439" style="s2">gonna be written tomorrow but I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.380" end="00:01:39.450" style="s2">to do a video today to torque it to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.439" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">explain this and showcase how well my</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.450" end="00:01:44.369" style="s2">brain works in the evening I guess but</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:47.399" style="s2">there&#39;s just so much about it that like</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.369" end="00:01:49.619" style="s2">each puzzle piece depending on what your</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.399" end="00:01:51.299" style="s2">puzzle is you&#39;re going to be a different</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.619" end="00:01:55.020" style="s2">color a different size a different shape</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.299" end="00:01:57.030" style="s2">and yet none of them are better sure you</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.020" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">start a puzzle with the with the edge</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.030" end="00:02:00.630" style="s2">pieces or you start it with the corner</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:04.979" style="s2">pieces and you work your way in and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.630" end="00:02:07.439" style="s2">find light colors together and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.979" end="00:02:09.959" style="s2">also how we are gonna do this and create</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.439" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">the global cooperative it&#39;s about well</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.959" end="00:02:13.290" style="s2">everyone else is arguing about who is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:15.450" style="s2">the best piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.290" end="00:02:17.609" style="s2">who is the best didn&#39;t actually realize</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.450" end="00:02:19.349" style="s2">their pieces they&#39;re arguing who is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.609" end="00:02:21.930" style="s2">best without realizing that they</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.349" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">actually fit together that if they just</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">found their neighbor they just found the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:28.349" style="s2">person that they connect to it somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:30.209" style="s2">who has a lot of the same color but a</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.349" end="00:02:32.489" style="s2">slightly different pattern and got</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.209" end="00:02:34.079" style="s2">together and then found somebody else to</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.489" end="00:02:36.359" style="s2">connect to and somebody else to connect</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.079" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">to eventually a picture emerges and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.359" end="00:02:41.129" style="s2">can see a higher form a higher function</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.269" end="00:02:43.290" style="s2">and when you&#39;re big enough everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.129" end="00:02:45.269" style="s2">around you can see it as well and more</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.290" end="00:02:48.269" style="s2">pieces are at it and more pieces are at</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.269" end="00:02:51.329" style="s2">it until you are an entire puzzle the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.269" end="00:02:55.319" style="s2">same time it&#39;s not that 7.5 billion of</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.329" end="00:02:57.510" style="s2">us make up one puzzle we are hundreds</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.319" end="00:03:01.470" style="s2">and hundreds of thousands of puzzles and</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.510" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">so you have a place to fit within your</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.470" end="00:03:06.659" style="s2">puzzle but if you don&#39;t fulfill that</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:08.639" style="s2">role there will be other puzzles that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.659" end="00:03:11.099" style="s2">that are still able to be built without</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.639" end="00:03:13.829" style="s2">you fulfilling your role but your puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.099" end="00:03:15.480" style="s2">won&#39;t be I no matter how damaged you are</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.829" end="00:03:18.060" style="s2">as a puzzle piece your whole entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.480" end="00:03:20.579" style="s2">puzzle is wrecked by you not being part</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.060" end="00:03:24.750" style="s2">of it by you being missing that puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.579" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">yours gets thrown out and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.750" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">wanted to come on and share that so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:32.579" style="s2">there is a video for today because I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:36.169" style="s2">made a commitment to do a video six days</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.579" end="00:03:36.169" style="s2">a week Sunday being my day off</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.840" end="00:03:45.599" style="s2">and so I am going to go to bed now and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.290" end="00:03:48.510" style="s2">think about puzzle pieces and more of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">this analogy as well as I have written</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.510" end="00:03:52.979" style="s2">down here that like my role in this</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:55.440" style="s2">although I am my own puzzle piece I can</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.979" end="00:03:58.949" style="s2">see the puzzle piece but that I can see</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.440" end="00:04:00.959" style="s2">the image that is so much to this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.949" end="00:04:02.159" style="s2">piece analogy like even just the puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.959" end="00:04:04.859" style="s2">piece knowledge I won&#39;t explain so much</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.159" end="00:04:06.269" style="s2">for that like if you&#39;re walking through</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.859" end="00:04:07.109" style="s2">life as your puzzle piece you actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.269" end="00:04:08.849" style="s2">don&#39;t even know what you look like</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.109" end="00:04:10.259" style="s2">there&#39;s no mirror to show you so you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.849" end="00:04:12.030" style="s2">don&#39;t know which puzzle you&#39;re a part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.259" end="00:04:14.269" style="s2">everyone else is telling you were wrong</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.030" end="00:04:16.359" style="s2">maybe you actually are wrong in that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.269" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">you&#39;re born in the wrong puzzle box</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.359" end="00:04:19.940" style="s2">telling you that you&#39;re inferior but</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:22.340" style="s2">you&#39;re just in the wrong puzzle box you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.940" end="00:04:24.560" style="s2">got to leave and go and find your your</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.340" end="00:04:26.449" style="s2">space and what I have to offer the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.560" end="00:04:28.910" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about with the global</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.449" end="00:04:31.460" style="s2">cooperative is that I see the image I</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.910" end="00:04:36.139" style="s2">can actually see how we all fit together</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.460" end="00:04:38.570" style="s2">and I don&#39;t know I&#39;m excited about my</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.139" end="00:04:41.210" style="s2">analogy so I will be doing a new video</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.570" end="00:04:43.220" style="s2">tomorrow Turin will be on and I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.210" end="00:04:47.300" style="s2">doing this Twitter thread or maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.220" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">better video on this take care please</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.300" end="00:04:49.780" style="s2">like and subscribe</p>
