<p begin="00:08:20.220" end="00:08:26.130" style="s2">in Vermont mmm well it&#39;s it&#39;s after your</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.180" end="00:08:28.020" style="s2">storm but before our storm here in</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.130" end="00:08:29.160" style="s2">Austin Texas which is due to hit us</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.020" end="00:08:33.060" style="s2">sometime this afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.160" end="00:08:36.360" style="s2">so we exist you might say between things</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.060" end="00:08:38.669" style="s2">then right between worlds this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.360" end="00:08:42.529" style="s2">are we after the storm or before the</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.669" end="00:08:46.080" style="s2">storm is something that I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.529" end="00:08:48.510" style="s2">characterizes our our moment right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.080" end="00:08:50.940" style="s2">like a moment sort of where we&#39;ve we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.510" end="00:08:54.150" style="s2">taken apart I&#39;m doing a very awkward</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.940" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">painful segue into your your work here</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.150" end="00:08:59.160" style="s2">but we like it at that moment where it</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:02.000" style="s2">you know the question of have we just</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.160" end="00:09:05.610" style="s2">survived this sort of shattering of</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.000" end="00:09:07.740" style="s2">reality of the postmodern philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.610" end="00:09:12.020" style="s2">project or are we only preparing</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.740" end="00:09:15.029" style="s2">ourselves for the magmatic nonsense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.020" end="00:09:17.430" style="s2">you know what is to come and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.029" end="00:09:20.430" style="s2">that I told you this before the call we</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.430" end="00:09:21.930" style="s2">didn&#39;t get into I didn&#39;t make it all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.430" end="00:09:26.220" style="s2">way through your paper which I found</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.930" end="00:09:29.100" style="s2">very disappointing as far as my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.220" end="00:09:32.220" style="s2">discipline is concerned but your piece</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.100" end="00:09:35.190" style="s2">on on on the metaphysics of Eros I found</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.220" end="00:09:38.880" style="s2">really stimulating because these issues</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.190" end="00:09:42.450" style="s2">around reality what is real are popping</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.880" end="00:09:46.560" style="s2">up in everything now and it&#39;s becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.450" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">prime concern of your average person I</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.560" end="00:09:50.700" style="s2">feel like in our time and it&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:53.040" style="s2">I think that&#39;s a really important thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.700" end="00:09:55.970" style="s2">to be riding on so why don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.040" end="00:09:58.410" style="s2">introduce this piece to people Oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.970" end="00:10:00.089" style="s2">wonderful yeah thank you</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.410" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a great pleasure to be in her</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.089" end="00:10:02.580" style="s2">podcast too I have to say I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:04.070" style="s2">waiting to talk to you for a long time I</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.580" end="00:10:06.900" style="s2">feel like it&#39;s a conversation we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.070" end="00:10:07.640" style="s2">both wanting to have that for whatever</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.900" end="00:10:08.870" style="s2">reason has</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.640" end="00:10:12.620" style="s2">and yeah now it&#39;s happening so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.870" end="00:10:14.300" style="s2">exciting yes so the the paper</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.620" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just published an integral review</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.300" end="00:10:17.870" style="s2">you can find that online or probably be</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:20.779" style="s2">linked on your on your site there</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.870" end="00:10:23.870" style="s2">Michael I the paper stems fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.779" end="00:10:27.170" style="s2">from my collaboration with mark Gaffney</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.870" end="00:10:31.730" style="s2">and my long-standing movement in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.170" end="00:10:34.010" style="s2">kind of world of integrals theory but</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.730" end="00:10:35.570" style="s2">the reason I even was in that world of</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.010" end="00:10:38.209" style="s2">integral theory and the reason I</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.570" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">continue to work with mark who&#39;s a rabbi</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.209" end="00:10:43.880" style="s2">and has a doctor Tom Oxford in religious</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:45.950" style="s2">studies and the reason why I do even as</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.880" end="00:10:47.600" style="s2">a psychologist dabble in metaphysics is</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.950" end="00:10:50.180" style="s2">because of what you just said that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.600" end="00:10:53.180" style="s2">actually live in a time between worlds</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.180" end="00:10:54.440" style="s2">and the time in which the deepest</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.180" end="00:10:56.540" style="s2">questions about what it means to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.440" end="00:10:58.610" style="s2">human are kind of on the table again</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.540" end="00:11:00.529" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s neuroscience it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.610" end="00:11:03.490" style="s2">seriously suggesting we don&#39;t have free</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.529" end="00:11:06.350" style="s2">will and arguing we can like change the</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.490" end="00:11:08.990" style="s2">legal system which is predicated upon</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.350" end="00:11:10.610" style="s2">free will by the way like we can change</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.990" end="00:11:12.050" style="s2">the legal system we can change the legal</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.610" end="00:11:14.660" style="s2">system to say that there is enough room</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.050" end="00:11:17.120" style="s2">well like serious suggestions and also</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.660" end="00:11:20.480" style="s2">of course does God exist is there an</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.120" end="00:11:23.180" style="s2">afterlife is the reincarnation the</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.480" end="00:11:26.209" style="s2">nature of illness nature healing all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.180" end="00:11:29.870" style="s2">these things are scattered in this kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.209" end="00:11:33.260" style="s2">of post truth cultural desert where</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.870" end="00:11:35.709" style="s2">you&#39;re not sure which ones you know with</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.260" end="00:11:37.760" style="s2">a thriving oasis and which ones</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.709" end="00:11:42.290" style="s2">basically a mirage</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.760" end="00:11:44.870" style="s2">and part of that student to the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.290" end="00:11:46.850" style="s2">and I talk about the kind of structural</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.870" end="00:11:48.290" style="s2">way that the post truth culture has been</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.850" end="00:11:51.110" style="s2">generated by the very logic of</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.290" end="00:11:52.850" style="s2">communication technology but it&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.110" end="00:11:55.130" style="s2">moment properly speaking in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.850" end="00:11:57.820" style="s2">evolution of culture which is to say</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.130" end="00:12:01.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a rightful overcoming of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.820" end="00:12:05.839" style="s2">singular logic and logo centrism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.370" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">mano centrosome of modernity and so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.839" end="00:12:11.810" style="s2">postmodern proliferation of perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:14.269" style="s2">and the and the concomitant confusion is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.810" end="00:12:17.000" style="s2">is par for the course but it&#39;s of course</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.269" end="00:12:19.940" style="s2">a dangerous critical global path now</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.000" end="00:12:20.690" style="s2">through the confusion back to reality</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.940" end="00:12:23.570" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.690" end="00:12:25.850" style="s2">talk about a return to eros and a return</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.570" end="00:12:29.330" style="s2">to a metaphysics in which not just</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.850" end="00:12:31.490" style="s2">physical things are real but also the</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.330" end="00:12:33.740" style="s2">things that populate the human interiors</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.490" end="00:12:36.170" style="s2">and especially the constellation of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.740" end="00:12:39.980" style="s2">emotions around love that these things</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.170" end="00:12:42.290" style="s2">are as real as any of the physical</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.980" end="00:12:44.420" style="s2">properties and so this gets to again the</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.290" end="00:12:46.610" style="s2">nature of reality and the need to have</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.420" end="00:12:49.310" style="s2">it more nuance to metaphysics that</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.610" end="00:12:51.770" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just materiality and meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.310" end="00:12:56.330" style="s2">matter in motion and Darwinian dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.770" end="00:13:00.530" style="s2">but that includes meaning value the</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.330" end="00:13:04.760" style="s2">interior is consciousness etc yeah let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.530" end="00:13:08.450" style="s2">I mean you do this by sort of starting</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.760" end="00:13:13.850" style="s2">from the philosophical position of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.450" end="00:13:15.830" style="s2">meta moderna strands which I you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.850" end="00:13:19.700" style="s2">I&#39;m not as deep in this sort of culture</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.830" end="00:13:21.920" style="s2">of the post postmodern as I used to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.700" end="00:13:25.520" style="s2">as I was when you and I encountered each</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.920" end="00:13:27.140" style="s2">other for the first time but it seems as</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.520" end="00:13:30.710" style="s2">though it&#39;s very much in keeping with</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.140" end="00:13:32.690" style="s2">and sort of growing beyond the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.710" end="00:13:37.160" style="s2">conversation around integral philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.690" end="00:13:40.480" style="s2">and this desire to recognize all forms</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.160" end="00:13:45.110" style="s2">of knowledge as socially constructed and</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:46.220" style="s2">it bound by this interpretive framing</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.110" end="00:13:50.060" style="s2">that you know everything is an</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.220" end="00:13:53.750" style="s2">interpretation but that it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.060" end="00:13:55.580" style="s2">satisfy itself in stopping there right</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.750" end="00:13:59.330" style="s2">so it&#39;s like if we just assume that</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.580" end="00:14:01.040" style="s2">everything is equally illusory then</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.330" end="00:14:04.130" style="s2">we&#39;re left with no sort of practical</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.040" end="00:14:06.440" style="s2">action and so you start this paper with</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.130" end="00:14:08.690" style="s2">like a list articulating the meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.440" end="00:14:11.000" style="s2">modernist perspective on science and on</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.690" end="00:14:12.800" style="s2">reality but what do you think the the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.000" end="00:14:15.410" style="s2">quicks that you know that the takeaways</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.800" end="00:14:17.900" style="s2">are for people listening to this who are</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.410" end="00:14:22.850" style="s2">struggling with the idea that we could</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.900" end="00:14:24.080" style="s2">place consciousness on a ontological</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.850" end="00:14:26.839" style="s2">e-equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.080" end="00:14:29.450" style="s2">plane with matter or you know that kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.839" end="00:14:30.980" style="s2">of thing right totally so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.450" end="00:14:32.290" style="s2">absolutely I mean the framing of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.980" end="00:14:36.279" style="s2">papers in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.290" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">the cultural epic or kind of historical</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.279" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">period designation right which is saying</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:44.470" style="s2">slice history into consistory is a very</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.739" style="s2">complicated stream you can slice it in</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.470" end="00:14:52.569" style="s2">two periods or box and so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.739" end="00:14:54.039" style="s2">group that is you know mostly in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.569" end="00:14:56.799" style="s2">Europe and there there&#39;s some American</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.039" end="00:15:00.339" style="s2">representatives who have kind of dubbed</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.799" end="00:15:05.889" style="s2">the emerging period of history that we</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.339" end="00:15:08.679" style="s2">are entering as meta mater and I think</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.889" end="00:15:10.749" style="s2">it&#39;s an important conversation because I</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.679" end="00:15:12.129" style="s2">was convinced long ago by Habermas and</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.749" end="00:15:14.739" style="s2">others that what we call a</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.129" end="00:15:16.569" style="s2">post-modernism is actually most of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.739" end="00:15:18.759" style="s2">traits of modernity just with the volume</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.569" end="00:15:21.249" style="s2">turned really way up like his subjects</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.759" end="00:15:23.829" style="s2">you know subjectivity increases you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.249" end="00:15:25.869" style="s2">contextualization and increases instead</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.829" end="00:15:28.979" style="s2">of one perspective you get many</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.869" end="00:15:32.379" style="s2">perspectives not the pre perspectival</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.979" end="00:15:33.729" style="s2">pre-modern where the individual and the</p>

<p begin="00:16:12.399" end="00:16:17.319" style="s2">there were many varieties of meta modern</p>

<p begin="00:16:34.749" end="00:16:39.789" style="s2">period a period is that there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.049" end="00:16:41.169" style="s2">coherence to the structure of it and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.789" end="00:16:42.640" style="s2">this list you talk about in the</p>

<p begin="00:16:47.560" end="00:16:51.610" style="s2">historical periods view of reality in</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.020" end="00:16:53.650" style="s2">science and it&#39;s distinctly different</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.610" end="00:16:55.210" style="s2">from the postmodern in the modern right</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.650" end="00:16:58.450" style="s2">so the modern view of science is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.210" end="00:17:01.000" style="s2">science is truth period like in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.450" end="00:17:03.070" style="s2">period it&#39;s very definite the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.000" end="00:17:06.459" style="s2">view of science is like science is one</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.070" end="00:17:09.400" style="s2">view dot dot dot right like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.459" end="00:17:10.900" style="s2">actually many and Sciences one the meta</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.400" end="00:17:13.240" style="s2">monter view essentially tries to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.900" end="00:17:15.000" style="s2">that both of those are true and as you</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.240" end="00:17:17.410" style="s2">were saying within specific context</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.000" end="00:17:19.089" style="s2">science works and actually discovers</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.410" end="00:17:21.310" style="s2">things the problem is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.089" end="00:17:22.990" style="s2">overstepped its context and so it takes</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.310" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">for example an experiment that was done</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.990" end="00:17:26.980" style="s2">in a very closed condition in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:29.050" style="s2">laboratory and pretends that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.980" end="00:17:30.340" style="s2">discovered there applies to radically</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.050" end="00:17:32.500" style="s2">open systems outside the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.340" end="00:17:35.380" style="s2">right you get pharmaceuticals in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.500" end="00:17:36.190" style="s2">drinking water because we&#39;re cisely push</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.380" end="00:17:37.990" style="s2">this thing through</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.190" end="00:17:39.730" style="s2">no that&#39;s and that&#39;s perfect example you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.990" end="00:17:42.310" style="s2">know and that&#39;s exactly the danger of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.730" end="00:17:44.260" style="s2">the modern view which is correct in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.310" end="00:17:46.060" style="s2">laboratory guys like don&#39;t take em this</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.260" end="00:17:48.670" style="s2">other postmodern sees that moment of</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.060" end="00:17:50.770" style="s2">error in the modern and then wants to</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.670" end="00:17:52.450" style="s2">throw science out the window completely</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.770" end="00:17:53.970" style="s2">the meta modernist says hold on</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.450" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">something happened in the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.970" end="00:17:58.420" style="s2">like we we have to actually pay</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:18:01.270" style="s2">attention to the moment of truth in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.420" end="00:18:04.020" style="s2">modern and then you know contextualize</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.270" end="00:18:07.300" style="s2">it with the postmodern you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.020" end="00:18:08.740" style="s2">alternative which says well let&#39;s do a</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.300" end="00:18:09.600" style="s2">bunch of other experiments let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.740" end="00:18:12.220" style="s2">things that don&#39;t even look like</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.600" end="00:18:14.350" style="s2">experiments right and let&#39;s look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.220" end="00:18:15.900" style="s2">methodologies that are non quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.350" end="00:18:17.620" style="s2">and methodologies that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.900" end="00:18:20.160" style="s2">phenomenological and purely subjective</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.620" end="00:18:22.660" style="s2">which a modernist would never even touch</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.160" end="00:18:24.490" style="s2">so you get this proliferation of methods</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.660" end="00:18:27.490" style="s2">proliferation of perspectives all good</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.490" end="00:18:30.340" style="s2">but now a total fragmentation and like</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.490" end="00:18:32.620" style="s2">out of the Academy comes totally</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.340" end="00:18:34.870" style="s2">confusing gobbledygook about what is the</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.620" end="00:18:37.090" style="s2">nature of the human you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.870" end="00:18:39.040" style="s2">humanities will say what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.090" end="00:18:41.740" style="s2">saying since ancient Rome which doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.040" end="00:18:42.940" style="s2">apply and the sciences will say in same</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.740" end="00:18:45.100" style="s2">things like there&#39;s no free will or</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.940" end="00:18:47.950" style="s2">we&#39;re just crazy monkeys that want to</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.100" end="00:18:51.430" style="s2">like kill and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.950" end="00:18:53.290" style="s2">and so that fragmentation of the the</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.430" end="00:18:55.600" style="s2">weird combination of the modern and the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.290" end="00:18:58.120" style="s2">postmodern without a recent</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.600" end="00:19:01.120" style="s2">this is without a meta modern</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.120" end="00:19:02.799" style="s2">reconvergence which is what neutral</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.120" end="00:19:04.929" style="s2">theory attempts to do and interfere is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.799" end="00:19:06.610" style="s2">very early attempt by the way in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.929" end="00:19:10.330" style="s2">modern in the meta modern historical</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.610" end="00:19:11.110" style="s2">period one of the first really charles</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.330" end="00:19:14.380" style="s2">sanders first</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.110" end="00:19:16.360" style="s2">charles sanders purse from the 1890s I</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.380" end="00:19:18.910" style="s2">think being actual first and I mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.360" end="00:19:21.640" style="s2">him in this paper and that we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.910" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">about so yeah so the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.640" end="00:19:27.640" style="s2">characterizes this new period is in fact</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">the integration of the modern and the</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.640" end="00:19:33.220" style="s2">postmodern in some new view of science</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:35.470" style="s2">specifically right and so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.220" end="00:19:38.440" style="s2">a science that includes interior teas</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.470" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">and that puts all methods and contexts</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.440" end="00:19:42.280" style="s2">and this is what we&#39;re getting into this</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:45.130" style="s2">list now so there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.280" end="00:19:48.520" style="s2">characteristics that would allow for the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.130" end="00:19:50.140" style="s2">best most rigorous science to then be</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.520" end="00:19:52.780" style="s2">put through the kind of culturally</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.140" end="00:19:54.370" style="s2">sensitive kind of matrix of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.780" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">post-modernism and then to result in</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.370" end="00:19:59.860" style="s2">action in an actionable and coherent</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:04.210" style="s2">worldview and there are very few</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.860" end="00:20:06.460" style="s2">examples of this kind of science but</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.210" end="00:20:09.539" style="s2">it&#39;s a very distinct possibility for a</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.020" end="00:20:22.330" style="s2">think the new paradigm and so we know</p>

<p begin="00:20:22.330" end="00:20:27.580" style="s2">is a is a factor that needs to be dealt</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.830" end="00:20:33.280" style="s2">at the laboratory we actually need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.030" end="00:20:35.830" style="s2">look at chaotic phenomena that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.280" end="00:20:38.320" style="s2">meta modern view um the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.830" end="00:20:41.289" style="s2">distributed causality your right not</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.320" end="00:20:42.730" style="s2">just one-to-one causal systems but where</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.289" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">there are systems with many multiple</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.240" end="00:21:06.730" style="s2">right now is in aesthetics and politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.850" end="00:21:08.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s not a coincidence because in</p>

<p begin="00:23:38.690" end="00:23:43.070" style="s2">specifically this thing and you go it</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.120" end="00:23:47.090" style="s2">into this integrate detail about this in</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.070" end="00:23:48.409" style="s2">the paper why is this thing that we it</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.090" end="00:23:50.870" style="s2">seems like we&#39;re saving it from the</p>

<p begin="00:24:08.299" end="00:24:12.140" style="s2">stuff is this the kind of metaphysics</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.760" end="00:24:16.039" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking about bringing back</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.140" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">into the conversation about these much</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.039" end="00:24:22.760" style="s2">more rigorous and robust practice of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:24.770" style="s2">science yeah yes and Rudolf Steiners an</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.760" end="00:24:28.760" style="s2">interesting example because he&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.770" end="00:24:30.320" style="s2">close to the realm of Education and you</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.760" end="00:24:34.299" style="s2">know I say yes because what Steiner</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.320" end="00:24:36.200" style="s2">offered was a a complex metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.299" end="00:24:40.279" style="s2">characterization of the human and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.200" end="00:24:43.279" style="s2">humans place in the universe and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.279" end="00:24:46.520" style="s2">essential for education unless you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.279" end="00:24:51.080" style="s2">to make education about getting a job or</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.520" end="00:24:53.929" style="s2">being a citizen and so I was a you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.080" end="00:24:56.270" style="s2">graduate student and a teacher at the</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.929" end="00:24:59.539" style="s2">Harvard School of Education I had a</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.270" end="00:25:02.330" style="s2">student who came from Egypt who was</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.539" end="00:25:05.390" style="s2">raised in a traditional Islamic context</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.330" end="00:25:07.909" style="s2">they&#39;re very intelligent very</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.390" end="00:25:08.929" style="s2">progressive thinker actually I lost</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.909" end="00:25:09.710" style="s2">touch with him and I wonder what</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.929" end="00:25:12.380" style="s2">happened to him</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.710" end="00:25:14.090" style="s2">sometimes during the political upheaval</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.380" end="00:25:15.950" style="s2">in Egypt but in any case he said to me</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.090" end="00:25:17.690" style="s2">once after this long course that we were</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.950" end="00:25:19.549" style="s2">teaching and constructivist education</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.690" end="00:25:21.980" style="s2">which is like the calls of cutting-edge</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.549" end="00:25:23.539" style="s2">theory in education he said to me this</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.980" end="00:25:25.850" style="s2">is never gonna work he said the problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.539" end="00:25:27.260" style="s2">with modern education and with what is</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.850" end="00:25:31.010" style="s2">happening here is that there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.260" end="00:25:32.960" style="s2">conception of what is the human rights</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.010" end="00:25:34.340" style="s2">like there&#39;s there&#39;s no answer to what</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.960" end="00:25:34.870" style="s2">is the human or what is the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.340" end="00:25:36.480" style="s2">life and</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.870" end="00:25:39.160" style="s2">putting on this whole complex</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.480" end="00:25:42.010" style="s2">institutional arrangement and giving</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.160" end="00:25:43.809" style="s2">people direction and actually spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.010" end="00:25:45.430" style="s2">instruction in a way by shaping their</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.809" end="00:25:47.590" style="s2">skills and shaping their capacities and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.430" end="00:25:49.059" style="s2">potentialities and yet you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.590" end="00:25:52.090" style="s2">answering the most fundamental question</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.059" end="00:25:53.470" style="s2">which is what is a human and that was a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.090" end="00:25:57.370" style="s2">question that Steiner set out to answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.470" end="00:26:00.520" style="s2">and answered it well enough to give</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.370" end="00:26:02.670" style="s2">teachers a pedagogy to create one of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.520" end="00:26:05.530" style="s2">most successful international</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.670" end="00:26:08.290" style="s2">independent schools and so it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.530" end="00:26:09.790" style="s2">phenomenon and whether you believe his</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.290" end="00:26:12.580" style="s2">metaphysics or not you have to see that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.790" end="00:26:13.870" style="s2">the pedagogy is incredibly effective and</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.580" end="00:26:16.270" style="s2">one of the reasons effective is because</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.870" end="00:26:19.360" style="s2">it relies on a science of interior tease</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:22.840" style="s2">it says precisely that the meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.360" end="00:26:27.900" style="s2">the ideas and the sense making as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.840" end="00:26:30.010" style="s2">child is as important as any of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.900" end="00:26:33.490" style="s2">reading writing and arithmetic as it</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.010" end="00:26:36.100" style="s2">were right so you need to mend and pay</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.490" end="00:26:39.900" style="s2">attention to the soul its qualities of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.100" end="00:26:41.800" style="s2">interior T and not just the external</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.900" end="00:26:46.000" style="s2">personality that will eventually fit</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.800" end="00:26:49.809" style="s2">into the modern world system and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:53.020" style="s2">again the bringing up the Islamic</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.809" end="00:26:56.080" style="s2">student that I had and then the sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.020" end="00:26:59.920" style="s2">that we have in general that truth is</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.080" end="00:27:03.070" style="s2">not readily available you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.920" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">resurgence of fundamentalist religion</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.070" end="00:27:09.970" style="s2">for example there&#39;s a resurgence of</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:13.540" style="s2">racism justified through pretense of</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.970" end="00:27:15.940" style="s2">biology right there&#39;s a reassertion of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.540" end="00:27:18.660" style="s2">kind of nationalism that espouses an</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.940" end="00:27:22.179" style="s2">essential ISM that is basically uh a</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.660" end="00:27:23.740" style="s2">metaphysics of the person so if we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.179" end="00:27:25.720" style="s2">provide a metaphysics of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.740" end="00:27:26.920" style="s2">to be human and we don&#39;t provide a way</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.720" end="00:27:29.200" style="s2">of understanding the relation between</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.920" end="00:27:31.270" style="s2">the human of the universe it&#39;ll be given</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.200" end="00:27:33.940" style="s2">to us it could be coming from a movie or</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.270" end="00:27:36.700" style="s2">a comic book for a lot of people but we</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.940" end="00:27:40.870" style="s2">need a story a universe story a story of</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.700" end="00:27:43.660" style="s2">self story of cosmos and so in the long</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.870" end="00:27:45.910" style="s2">absence of that through modernity which</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.660" end="00:27:47.290" style="s2">is predicated upon not worrying about</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.910" end="00:27:48.870" style="s2">how many angels dance on the head of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.290" end="00:27:51.970" style="s2">pin it anymore right</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.870" end="00:27:54.520" style="s2">we&#39;re modernity was predicated upon you</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.970" end="00:27:55.960" style="s2">know no more witch trials at least not</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.520" end="00:27:57.429" style="s2">that kind of witch trial where there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.960" end="00:27:59.740" style="s2">actual witches and demons and things we</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.429" end="00:28:03.070" style="s2">just don&#39;t believe that and so science</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.740" end="00:28:05.140" style="s2">became the replacement and the absence</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.070" end="00:28:07.630" style="s2">of metaphysics is what&#39;s characterized</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.140" end="00:28:09.730" style="s2">the capitalist world system so in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.630" end="00:28:11.770" style="s2">absence of metaphysics there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.730" end="00:28:15.070" style="s2">vacuum of meaning a kind of element in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.770" end="00:28:17.500" style="s2">vacuum of power and yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.070" end="00:28:18.940" style="s2">what can step into that is not always</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.500" end="00:28:20.850" style="s2">pretty and so there you know the reason</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.940" end="00:28:23.410" style="s2">why I actually wrote this paper and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.850" end="00:28:25.419" style="s2">think I made to continue to work in</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.410" end="00:28:28.750" style="s2">metaphysics and perhaps even leaning on</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.419" end="00:28:31.630" style="s2">Steiner because of his because of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.750" end="00:28:33.669" style="s2">power go to this um you know is to</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.630" end="00:28:35.950" style="s2">answer these irrational metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.669" end="00:28:37.059" style="s2">views that are just popping into</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.950" end="00:28:39.160" style="s2">people&#39;s minds because there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.059" end="00:28:40.240" style="s2">vacuum right like it&#39;s a historically</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.160" end="00:28:43.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a historically unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.240" end="00:28:45.870" style="s2">situation to have a whole global society</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.150" end="00:28:48.820" style="s2">predicated upon the absence of a shared</p>

<p begin="00:30:04.940" end="00:30:10.220" style="s2">where I think years ago Tony Blair and</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.340" end="00:30:13.310" style="s2">Christopher Hitchens had a a televised</p>

<p begin="00:30:17.660" end="00:30:26.150" style="s2">that it&#39;s funny how science seems to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.890" end="00:30:27.590" style="s2">open us up into this kind of discovery</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.150" end="00:30:29.930" style="s2">where we realize that you know like the</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.590" end="00:30:32.510" style="s2">people who have something to believe in</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.930" end="00:30:36.770" style="s2">are happier people they live longer</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.510" end="00:30:43.430" style="s2">healthier lives you know so I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.770" end="00:30:46.850" style="s2">curious how you see this contest over</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.430" end="00:30:49.900" style="s2">the definition of humanity going in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.850" end="00:30:51.860" style="s2">next couple of decades and then also</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.900" end="00:30:55.700" style="s2">whether you think we&#39;re actually ever</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.860" end="00:30:57.800" style="s2">going to arrive at a new like globally</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.700" end="00:31:00.350" style="s2">shared definition or whether you think</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.800" end="00:31:02.720" style="s2">we&#39;ll end up in in some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.350" end="00:31:03.920" style="s2">synthesis or I mean I know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.720" end="00:31:08.870" style="s2">one of the that&#39;s actually one of these</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.920" end="00:31:10.940" style="s2">sort of piers of or like tenets of meta</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.870" end="00:31:13.370" style="s2">modernism is that things are held in a</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.940" end="00:31:15.350" style="s2">sort of provisional loose proto</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.370" end="00:31:17.900" style="s2">synthetic way that we can come to a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.350" end="00:31:20.210" style="s2">conclusion but we we never crushed the</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.900" end="00:31:21.620" style="s2">egg in our hand so I mean how do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.210" end="00:31:27.350" style="s2">think this is gonna go as far as</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.620" end="00:31:29.690" style="s2">defining the human I mean the last thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.350" end="00:31:31.880" style="s2">you just said is it&#39;s just correct</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.690" end="00:31:35.360" style="s2">I mean if after post monitors and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.880" end="00:31:37.310" style="s2">can&#39;t return to some kind of pad</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.360" end="00:31:39.890" style="s2">totalizing answer for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.310" end="00:31:42.890" style="s2">I mean after post-modernism when we</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.890" end="00:31:46.130" style="s2">begin to kind of build a new coherence</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.890" end="00:31:49.810" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a polycentric and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.130" end="00:31:52.640" style="s2">and always renegotiated coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.810" end="00:31:54.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what science ought to be and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.640" end="00:31:57.260" style="s2">it which is to say this knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.410" end="00:32:01.960" style="s2">building not knowledge finding period</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.260" end="00:32:06.230" style="s2">and so the new metaphysics or the new</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.960" end="00:32:08.900" style="s2">kind of humanism as it were that would</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.230" end="00:32:10.880" style="s2">bring some consensus would need to work</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.900" end="00:32:13.340" style="s2">with a new definition of empirical right</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.880" end="00:32:14.840" style="s2">now to dismiss someone czar</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.340" end="00:32:16.850" style="s2">out of hand and kind of shut down a</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.840" end="00:32:18.980" style="s2">conversation as is done by some</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.850" end="00:32:21.440" style="s2">scientists to me is always more sounded</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.980" end="00:32:22.910" style="s2">like a personality trait then like us</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.440" end="00:32:24.260" style="s2">then like a structure in the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.910" end="00:32:26.150" style="s2">because you can always hear somebody out</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.260" end="00:32:27.770" style="s2">and be curious even about why they would</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.150" end="00:32:29.330" style="s2">say something or what their emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.770" end="00:32:32.120" style="s2">and holding a belief so to just shut</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.330" end="00:32:35.420" style="s2">someone down this is uh it&#39;s not great</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.120" end="00:32:37.880" style="s2">but to claim that the nature of what it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.420" end="00:32:42.040" style="s2">means to be empirical is to be verified</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.880" end="00:32:45.260" style="s2">we&#39;re actually literally seen physically</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.040" end="00:32:48.820" style="s2">is also tremendously naive philosophy of</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.260" end="00:32:51.850" style="s2">science and there&#39;s a whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.820" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">bouquet of methods in the human sciences</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.850" end="00:32:58.480" style="s2">in which there&#39;s nothing like simple</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.830" end="00:33:01.160" style="s2">visual verification or that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.480" end="00:33:03.920" style="s2">confirmation that many simplistic</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.160" end="00:33:06.620" style="s2">materialists empiricists would demand</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.920" end="00:33:08.540" style="s2">and so in fact part of building the new</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.620" end="00:33:11.930" style="s2">metaphysics is expanding that definition</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.540" end="00:33:14.510" style="s2">of empirical like what does it mean to</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.930" end="00:33:16.960" style="s2">do empiricism William James Wright</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.510" end="00:33:20.090" style="s2">claimed to be a radical empiricist and</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.960" end="00:33:22.520" style="s2">exactly because he included the data of</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.090" end="00:33:25.190" style="s2">consciousness right it&#39;s actually more</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.520" end="00:33:26.990" style="s2">radically empirical to include what</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.190" end="00:33:28.910" style="s2">you&#39;re actually living with every day</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.990" end="00:33:32.150" style="s2">right so for example if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.910" end="00:33:34.610" style="s2">neuroscientist and you write a paper</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.150" end="00:33:37.340" style="s2">where you claim that love for example is</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.610" end="00:33:39.800" style="s2">just certain hormonal tendencies and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.340" end="00:33:42.500" style="s2">try to basically explain love away as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.800" end="00:33:44.390" style="s2">materialistic kind of epiphenomenon that</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.500" end="00:33:47.990" style="s2">kind of excretion of the limbic system</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.390" end="00:33:49.300" style="s2">and bright but then you go home and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.990" end="00:33:54.470" style="s2">look at your kid at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.300" end="00:33:55.550" style="s2">right and you&#39;ve experienced love what</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.470" end="00:33:58.100" style="s2">do you do in the moment as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.550" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">neuroscientist right and so this is Hume</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.100" end="00:34:00.530" style="s2">and a whole bunch of other people like</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:01.850" style="s2">Charles dangerous purse and other</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.530" end="00:34:03.860" style="s2">philosophers who said listen once you</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.850" end="00:34:06.710" style="s2">leave the laboratory once you leave the</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.860" end="00:34:08.840" style="s2">study leave the armchair can you still</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.710" end="00:34:11.210" style="s2">deny the reality of interior tea and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.840" end="00:34:13.310" style="s2">value and do you still want to claim to</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.210" end="00:34:14.540" style="s2">have no free will and that the love you</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.310" end="00:34:15.800" style="s2">have for your wife and your child or</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.540" end="00:34:17.810" style="s2">some kind of illusion and some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.800" end="00:34:20.750" style="s2">epiphenomenon so there&#39;s a lack of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.810" end="00:34:22.420" style="s2">seriousness to these types of proposals</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.750" end="00:34:25.010" style="s2">that come from the radical empiricists</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.420" end="00:34:26.450" style="s2">and it shows you know that others</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.010" end="00:34:28.909" style="s2">things are at stake when you publish</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.450" end="00:34:29.960" style="s2">papers than the truth because the truth</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.909" end="00:34:32.630" style="s2">is sitting there at the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.960" end="00:34:35.720" style="s2">with them every night not in the fMRI</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.630" end="00:34:37.010" style="s2">scanner now part of the truth and a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.720" end="00:34:39.470" style="s2">important part of the truth is in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.010" end="00:34:42.169" style="s2">fMRI scanner right so this is about the</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.470" end="00:34:44.300" style="s2">meta modern contextualization of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.169" end="00:34:46.520" style="s2">limited moments of scientific truth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.300" end="00:34:47.810" style="s2">that allows for including a science of</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.520" end="00:34:49.490" style="s2">interior tease and then you start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.810" end="00:34:52.429" style="s2">build this very complex picture of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.490" end="00:34:55.580" style="s2">human as both a dynamical complex</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.429" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">physical object but also a dynamical</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.580" end="00:35:01.400" style="s2">complex emotional and ID aiding and</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:03.080" style="s2">imagining what&#39;s an object and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.400" end="00:35:05.030" style="s2">again this is for example what Rudolf</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.080" end="00:35:06.980" style="s2">Steiner was working with very rigorous</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.030" end="00:35:09.110" style="s2">understanding of human anatomy and</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.980" end="00:35:11.060" style="s2">physiology Steiner was actually a</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.110" end="00:35:13.370" style="s2">student of Goethe and a student of all</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.060" end="00:35:14.990" style="s2">the leading physical scientists of his</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.370" end="00:35:17.840" style="s2">day there was probably actually note</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.990" end="00:35:19.820" style="s2">book on metaphysics and neuroscientist</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.840" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">that was published that in that time</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.820" end="00:35:24.200" style="s2">that that Steiner hadn&#39;t read and was</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:26.360" style="s2">respected actually in the mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.200" end="00:35:28.100" style="s2">discourse about biology because of his</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.360" end="00:35:29.750" style="s2">work with Goethe kind of actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.100" end="00:35:32.660" style="s2">bringing Goethe scientific writings to</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.750" end="00:35:34.310" style="s2">light and so he knew the physiology of</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.660" end="00:35:39.230" style="s2">the human and actually the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.310" end="00:35:41.570" style="s2">dynamics of its current kind of form and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.230" end="00:35:43.120" style="s2">yet also had this deep understanding of</p>

<p begin="00:37:09.930" end="00:37:13.920" style="s2">like the idea the technologies ation of</p>

<p begin="00:37:21.869" end="00:37:25.470" style="s2">that you can&#39;t separate information from</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.059" end="00:37:27.960" style="s2">disinformation that people are spreading</p>

<p begin="00:37:38.609" end="00:37:44.930" style="s2">I mean it really is like as simple as</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.549" end="00:37:46.710" style="s2">finding a way to break that cycle of</p>

<p begin="00:37:46.710" end="00:37:50.039" style="s2">advertisement revenue then you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.359" end="00:37:54.049" style="s2">look at something and say okay now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.039" end="00:37:56.910" style="s2">back to the old position of you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.049" end="00:37:58.170" style="s2">looking at the merit of something not</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.910" end="00:38:00.299" style="s2">its ability to just capture my attention</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.170" end="00:38:02.430" style="s2">but actually the merit of what&#39;s written</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.299" end="00:38:04.829" style="s2">so yeah so what we&#39;re even losing that</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.430" end="00:38:09.499" style="s2">ability to use our consider judgment</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.829" end="00:38:11.579" style="s2">around complex texts and claims and so</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.499" end="00:38:13.529" style="s2">there&#39;s a longer discussion about what</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.579" end="00:38:15.269" style="s2">happened to the human during modernity</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.529" end="00:38:18.269" style="s2">and postmodernity but one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.269" end="00:38:21.839" style="s2">was that we gave our choice making power</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.269" end="00:38:24.720" style="s2">over to authorities and experts kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.839" end="00:38:26.369" style="s2">gladly and with great relief can we go</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.720" end="00:38:28.470" style="s2">to a doctor and just totally understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.369" end="00:38:31.890" style="s2">trust what they say okay glad read</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.470" end="00:38:33.799" style="s2">advertisements for exhibit yeah a pack</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.890" end="00:38:36.749" style="s2">of cigs in his lap you know smoking</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.799" end="00:38:39.210" style="s2">right exactly gladly do we give our kids</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.749" end="00:38:40.859" style="s2">to the expert teacher gladly do we bring</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.210" end="00:38:43.140" style="s2">our car to the mechanic you know this</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.859" end="00:38:46.230" style="s2">idea that many of our choices which are</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.140" end="00:38:47.670" style="s2">instrumental to our life we give the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.230" end="00:38:50.790" style="s2">choice making power over to others and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.670" end="00:38:52.680" style="s2">we lose our sovereignty and autonomy but</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.790" end="00:38:55.290" style="s2">we gain the expertise and lighten the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.680" end="00:38:57.090" style="s2">cognitive load so there&#39;s a weird flip</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.290" end="00:38:58.740" style="s2">taking place now with the availability</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.090" end="00:39:01.140" style="s2">of information on the internet and the</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.740" end="00:39:03.120" style="s2">radical questioning of expertise and the</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.140" end="00:39:06.330" style="s2">wanting to reclaim sovereignty or choice</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.120" end="00:39:09.000" style="s2">making power at the same time we have no</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.330" end="00:39:12.690" style="s2">idea if the experts were always lying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.000" end="00:39:14.040" style="s2">us or not and we have no idea if the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.690" end="00:39:16.260" style="s2">current people who are in those</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.040" end="00:39:17.310" style="s2">positions who would say they don&#39;t go on</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.260" end="00:39:21.930" style="s2">the internet looking for medical</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.310" end="00:39:23.970" style="s2">information or or whatever yeah yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.930" end="00:39:26.040" style="s2">that&#39;s again this crisis of post truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.970" end="00:39:27.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a good there&#39;s a good moment in</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.040" end="00:39:29.640" style="s2">this but it&#39;s this dangerous moment</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.360" end="00:39:31.080" style="s2">right so it&#39;s good people are reclaiming</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.640" end="00:39:33.990" style="s2">sovereignty over their choice making</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.080" end="00:39:38.580" style="s2">power and yet experts have expertise</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.990" end="00:39:41.580" style="s2">often even more necessary for us to rely</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.580" end="00:39:42.420" style="s2">on experts in the right time and again</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.580" end="00:39:44.550" style="s2">it&#39;s so just like you would</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.420" end="00:39:45.330" style="s2">contextualize these scientific finding</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.550" end="00:39:47.190" style="s2">in the laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.330" end="00:39:51.260" style="s2">you must really contextualize the</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.190" end="00:39:53.540" style="s2">exercise of expertise um and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.260" end="00:39:55.620" style="s2">engage an expert without being</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.540" end="00:39:57.570" style="s2">infantilized right</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.620" end="00:39:59.310" style="s2">that&#39;s possible you can engage a</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.570" end="00:40:01.890" style="s2">bureaucratic system without being</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.310" end="00:40:04.410" style="s2">dehumanized possible but it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.890" end="00:40:06.180" style="s2">happen a lot often part of what it means</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.410" end="00:40:07.740" style="s2">to get involved in these things is to</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.180" end="00:40:10.410" style="s2">have the choice making power actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.740" end="00:40:14.520" style="s2">kind of taken from you a little bit too</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.410" end="00:40:16.440" style="s2">strongly as it were and again there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.520" end="00:40:18.090" style="s2">deep hermeneutic of suspicion that runs</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.440" end="00:40:20.100" style="s2">through the psychiatric and medical</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.090" end="00:40:22.830" style="s2">profession this world is a distrusting</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.100" end="00:40:26.970" style="s2">of patients it&#39;s a long history of this</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.830" end="00:40:29.490" style="s2">but you know the point being is is that</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.970" end="00:40:33.180" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to reclaim sovereignty in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.490" end="00:40:35.490" style="s2">context when experts still reign were we</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.180" end="00:40:37.730" style="s2">to find a way to better democratize the</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.490" end="00:40:40.170" style="s2">availability of access to expertise</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.730" end="00:40:42.630" style="s2">change the incentive structures under</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.170" end="00:40:44.640" style="s2">which the experts work change the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.630" end="00:40:46.080" style="s2">insurance structures under which the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.640" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">patients are brought to the experts etc</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.080" end="00:40:50.310" style="s2">you can imagine a situation in which</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:53.640" style="s2">there&#39;s actually co-education between</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.310" end="00:40:55.950" style="s2">patient and doctor she&#39;s use one example</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.640" end="00:40:59.640" style="s2">that type of</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.950" end="00:41:03.900" style="s2">modern dialogical relationship as</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.640" end="00:41:06.330" style="s2">opposed to the modern monological and it</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.900" end="00:41:09.930" style="s2">is very important right now we&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.330" end="00:41:11.280" style="s2">between in this a perspectival madness</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.930" end="00:41:12.660" style="s2">when you don&#39;t trust the expert but you</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.280" end="00:41:14.070" style="s2">also can&#39;t trust the information gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.660" end="00:41:16.230" style="s2">online and you certainly can&#39;t trust</p>

<p begin="00:41:20.220" end="00:41:25.110" style="s2">just watch the news they know CNN knows</p>

<p begin="00:41:25.110" end="00:41:28.380" style="s2">like whoa no CNN doesn&#39;t know and</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.970" end="00:41:30.570" style="s2">neither does the Washington Post and</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.380" end="00:41:32.220" style="s2">neither does Fox News you know if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.740" end="00:43:51.780" style="s2">reminds me of this story I heard from</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.660" end="00:43:56.120" style="s2">the guy selling me a guitar a few years</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.780" end="00:43:58.230" style="s2">ago yes I know you&#39;re a musician&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.120" end="00:44:01.410" style="s2">conversations buying guitars actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.230" end="00:44:05.280" style="s2">they were very profound I there were two</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.410" end="00:44:07.500" style="s2">of these koa Taylor&#39;s right next to each</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.280" end="00:44:09.330" style="s2">other the same model the same the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.500" end="00:44:11.640" style="s2">tone wood and one of them sounded</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.330" end="00:44:13.650" style="s2">dramatically better looked better to it</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.640" end="00:44:15.870" style="s2">had this gorgeous shimmer to the wood</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.650" end="00:44:19.080" style="s2">and I asked him about it I was like what</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.870" end="00:44:20.850" style="s2">why is one of these guitars with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.080" end="00:44:21.540" style="s2">same within the same price so much nicer</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.850" end="00:44:24.390" style="s2">than the other</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.540" end="00:44:26.430" style="s2">and he said well koa is a funny thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.390" end="00:44:30.750" style="s2">koa can only be harvested after its</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.430" end="00:44:32.820" style="s2">fallen as a tone wood and I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.750" end="00:44:34.530" style="s2">maybe possibly because it&#39;s protected</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.820" end="00:44:36.630" style="s2">because it you know it&#39;s very limited in</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.530" end="00:44:38.040" style="s2">range I&#39;m not sure but he said it can</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.630" end="00:44:41.430" style="s2">only be harvested after its fallen and</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.040" end="00:44:44.240" style="s2">so you just sort of spined it you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.430" end="00:44:46.950" style="s2">and depending on the conditions of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.240" end="00:44:49.080" style="s2">wood at the time that the koa grew you</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.950" end="00:44:51.270" style="s2">get different kinds of koa things like</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.080" end="00:44:54.750" style="s2">this koa that you like this is the curly</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.270" end="00:44:57.000" style="s2">koa and this stuff happens when a tree</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.750" end="00:45:00.900" style="s2">falls and suddenly there&#39;s an open patch</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.000" end="00:45:03.630" style="s2">of sunlight in the woods and all of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.900" end="00:45:06.990" style="s2">saplings around it compete they have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:03.630" end="00:45:10.860" style="s2">rush so it grows the wood in a different</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.990" end="00:45:12.930" style="s2">way the wood itself is nonlinear it</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.860" end="00:45:15.570" style="s2">doesn&#39;t form these long straight fibers</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.930" end="00:45:18.690" style="s2">it like bundles and and like curbs on</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.570" end="00:45:20.190" style="s2">itself and forms what produces a much</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.690" end="00:45:22.790" style="s2">more complex like</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.190" end="00:45:26.069" style="s2">acoustic character something you call</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.790" end="00:45:27.839" style="s2">you know it&#39;s got its got more soul to</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.069" end="00:45:29.160" style="s2">it right and so it&#39;s funny you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.839" end="00:45:33.480" style="s2">there&#39;s just something in there I feel</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.160" end="00:45:35.190" style="s2">about the the decay of authority and</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.480" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">expertise so like the crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.190" end="00:45:41.280" style="s2">legitimacy that we&#39;re going through this</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:44.130" style="s2">and the the reassertion or the</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.280" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">resurgence of the considerations whose</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.130" end="00:45:48.960" style="s2">soul in this but and yet like you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:51.390" style="s2">fifty different versions of that</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.960" end="00:45:53.310" style="s2">everyone that&#39;s racing for the Sun</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.390" end="00:45:54.869" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly right and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.310" end="00:45:56.609" style="s2">there&#39;s this actually even though we</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.869" end="00:45:58.560" style="s2">don&#39;t know it right now it&#39;s taking</p>

<p begin="00:45:58.560" end="00:46:03.810" style="s2">metaphysics it&#39;s a race for the answer</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.839" end="00:46:05.430" style="s2">of what is the human as we&#39;re kind of</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.810" end="00:46:08.790" style="s2">like transition within what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.430" end="00:46:13.079" style="s2">gonna be a very dynamic and complex set</p>

<p begin="00:47:42.220" end="00:47:46.020" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s the coming of a new</p>

<p begin="00:47:49.270" end="00:47:56.920" style="s2">of of confusion and the kind of the fog</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.470" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">of war in fact as we shape that new that</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.920" end="00:48:03.330" style="s2">new sense of what the world is about so</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:06.190" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a it is an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.330" end="00:48:08.500" style="s2">historical moment and this is what the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.190" end="00:48:10.600" style="s2">papers about yeah that in a sense we</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.500" end="00:48:12.900" style="s2">need to we need to seize the moment and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.600" end="00:48:15.190" style="s2">create a vision of a human that is</p>

<p begin="00:48:15.190" end="00:48:22.270" style="s2">regressive returns - kind of weird</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.600" end="00:48:24.880" style="s2">amalgams of pre-modern metaphysics and</p>

<p begin="00:48:41.800" end="00:48:45.700" style="s2">see we haven&#39;t had politics like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.150" end="00:48:47.500" style="s2">for a long time learning aspect that</p>

<p begin="00:49:14.290" end="00:49:20.140" style="s2">changing and so it just is something new</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.920" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">is emerging and so they have a new meta</p>

<p begin="00:51:34.270" end="00:51:42.760" style="s2">you know and so war was the first global</p>

<p begin="00:51:42.760" end="00:51:48.760" style="s2">biosphere in some sense but then I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:51:48.760" end="00:51:52.270" style="s2">seems to me like you might be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.289" end="00:51:53.200" style="s2">trace a lot of the development of</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.270" end="00:51:56.280" style="s2">technologies sort of</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.200" end="00:51:58.660" style="s2">up a spiral from for lack of a better</p>

<p begin="00:52:14.380" end="00:52:20.080" style="s2">next space race is I mean right now what</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.160" end="00:52:23.800" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing is like vezo sand blue</p>

<p begin="00:54:08.920" end="00:54:12.820" style="s2">so in Cosmo erotic humanism became the</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.540" end="00:54:15.930" style="s2">Stettin and it became a theme about yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.820" end="00:54:19.800" style="s2">this new positive evolutionarily</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.930" end="00:54:23.470" style="s2">optimistic form of humanism which was</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.800" end="00:54:25.750" style="s2">wedded to a metaphysics of eros which is</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.470" end="00:54:28.690" style="s2">to say a metaphysics that believes that</p>

<p begin="00:54:28.690" end="00:54:33.640" style="s2">chaotic material process but that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.000" end="00:54:35.500" style="s2">evolution has a certain teleology and</p>

<p begin="00:54:35.500" end="00:54:42.340" style="s2">increases in the quality like love which</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.970" end="00:54:44.830" style="s2">is to say intensity of interconnection</p>

<p begin="00:54:51.220" end="00:54:56.250" style="s2">had all reduced the erotic to sex but I</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.070" end="00:55:00.100" style="s2">think your idea is actually amazing one</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.450" end="00:55:14.080" style="s2">realize that the point of erotic energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.340" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">and the point of Tantra for example is</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.080" end="00:55:20.230" style="s2">that not it&#39;s it&#39;s not about sex per se</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.200" end="00:55:22.470" style="s2">it&#39;s about the emotional energy that can</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.230" end="00:55:25.180" style="s2">be invested in sex the erotic energy</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.470" end="00:55:27.400" style="s2">right which is to say the feeling of</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.180" end="00:55:31.830" style="s2">total significance and and utter</p>

<p begin="00:55:39.820" end="00:55:44.440" style="s2">and we have this experience of basically</p>

<p begin="00:55:44.440" end="00:55:49.180" style="s2">like a book that we were reading</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.750" end="00:55:50.890" style="s2">right we&#39;re going or going out into the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.180" end="00:55:53.110" style="s2">wilderness and feeling kind of ravaged</p>

<p begin="00:56:11.980" end="00:56:15.790" style="s2">gets into some of the details of the</p>

<p begin="00:56:15.790" end="00:56:19.570" style="s2">know we we truncate the erotic to the</p>

<p begin="00:56:19.570" end="00:56:27.520" style="s2">and so we make the kind of dyadic sexual</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.080" end="00:56:29.500" style="s2">relationship the core of all our most</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.520" end="00:56:31.480" style="s2">important emotional energies and we we</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.500" end="00:56:33.220" style="s2">kind of don&#39;t allow ourselves to office</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.480" end="00:56:34.960" style="s2">eyes the other parts of our lives I&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:56:34.960" end="00:56:38.610" style="s2">partners at all I&#39;m talking about like</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.250" end="00:56:41.710" style="s2">having around relationships in the books</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.610" end="00:56:44.980" style="s2">outside your marriage right having</p>

<p begin="00:56:44.980" end="00:56:50.650" style="s2">mysticism um right so these forms of</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.100" end="00:56:53.200" style="s2">erotic expression and deep emotional</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.650" end="00:56:55.210" style="s2">investment and deep emotional expression</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.200" end="00:56:57.910" style="s2">you know where are those available in</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.210" end="00:57:02.500" style="s2">our culture outside of this outside of</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.910" end="00:57:04.390" style="s2">the kind of soul mate the sex of that</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.500" end="00:57:07.600" style="s2">subjectivity when you erase the subject</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.390" end="00:57:10.510" style="s2">from the educational curriculum you lose</p>

<p begin="00:57:13.030" end="00:57:18.550" style="s2">erotic encounter right totally and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.480" end="00:57:23.520" style="s2">and I&#39;m talking about erotic encounters</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.550" end="00:57:26.950" style="s2">with treats and ideas and people who</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.520" end="00:57:28.780" style="s2">again so this is what&#39;s what is a human</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.950" end="00:57:30.970" style="s2">relationship so there&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.780" end="00:57:32.760" style="s2">question what&#39;s the human which we were</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.970" end="00:57:34.840" style="s2">saying is a metaphysical issue and then</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.760" end="00:57:37.570" style="s2">there&#39;s this other metaphysical show</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.840" end="00:57:41.560" style="s2">what is the relationship what is the we</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.570" end="00:57:43.660" style="s2">write to us write the co person write</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.560" end="00:57:45.340" style="s2">the shared subjectivity that develops</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.660" end="00:57:48.250" style="s2">between people when they&#39;re for simple</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.340" end="00:57:52.000" style="s2">and low or deep collaboration and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.250" end="00:57:55.690" style="s2">there&#39;s this whole space of merger and</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:57.910" style="s2">cooperation beyond the personal which</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.690" end="00:57:59.620" style="s2">has been a part of human existence for a</p>

<p begin="00:57:59.620" end="00:58:02.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t quite know what to do with it you</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.030" end="00:58:05.110" style="s2">know there&#39;s been a lot of collective</p>

<p begin="00:59:03.069" end="00:59:07.809" style="s2">like the modern and the postmodern would</p>

<p begin="00:59:18.130" end="00:59:23.920" style="s2">of one another and social media allows</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.549" end="00:59:26.140" style="s2">us to forget that and we treat one</p>

<p begin="00:59:30.279" end="00:59:34.990" style="s2">the conversation would probably be quite</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.140" end="00:59:38.769" style="s2">polite - hmm and so there&#39;s this sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.990" end="00:59:40.960" style="s2">of the missing humanity and that has to</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.769" end="00:59:42.299" style="s2">do with misunderstanding what a</p>

<p begin="00:59:42.299" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">and we misunderstand what it&#39;s like to</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.890" end="00:59:48.279" style="s2">meet a person because we don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:51.029" style="s2">a person that&#39;s a person is just this</p>

<p begin="00:59:51.029" end="00:59:54.460" style="s2">billions of years why should I show them</p>

<p begin="00:59:56.049" end="01:00:02.140" style="s2">them person a person has a soul you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.279" end="01:00:03.549" style="s2">like just saying that in a modern</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.140" end="01:00:05.230" style="s2">context you get laughed out of the room</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.549" end="01:00:06.819" style="s2">you say a person has a soul in a</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.230" end="01:00:09.420" style="s2">postmodern context no believe whatever</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.819" end="01:00:12.009" style="s2">you want that you can ask your truths</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.420" end="01:00:13.390" style="s2">right totally but if you say a person</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.009" end="01:00:15.670" style="s2">has a soul and you meet it in this kind</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.390" end="01:00:17.319" style="s2">of strict for example Asafa consents</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.670" end="01:00:19.119" style="s2">then the implication of the soul is that</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.319" end="01:00:21.819" style="s2">the person has reincarnated many times</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.119" end="01:00:24.819" style="s2">right that one is done to them and what</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.819" end="01:00:28.089" style="s2">they do will impact future lives and</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.819" end="01:00:29.920" style="s2">it&#39;s also the result of prior lives etc</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.089" end="01:00:32.019" style="s2">etc etc you know you talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.920" end="01:00:34.150" style="s2">of in the piece about object-oriented</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.019" end="01:00:36.369" style="s2">ontology which is you know I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.150" end="01:00:37.220" style="s2">delighted by the writing of Timothy</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.369" end="01:00:39.680" style="s2">Morton</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.220" end="01:00:42.200" style="s2">yeah this notion that I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.680" end="01:00:45.339" style="s2">he puts that in what he calls the</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.200" end="01:00:47.839" style="s2">strange stranger or the future future</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.339" end="01:00:51.349" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s you know the</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.839" end="01:00:53.660" style="s2">withdrawn and unknowable mystery of even</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.349" end="01:00:55.450" style="s2">your own body right and and that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.660" end="01:00:58.250" style="s2">where the soul enters the conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.450" end="01:01:00.500" style="s2">yeah I mean it&#39;s a it&#39;s a soul is</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.250" end="01:01:02.540" style="s2">certainly a hyper object in that sense</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.500" end="01:01:05.720" style="s2">right which is to say the this object</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.540" end="01:01:08.060" style="s2">that no matter how hard you study it it</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.720" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">will exhaust your attempts to fully</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.060" end="01:01:13.880" style="s2">capture it and you know an airplane is a</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:15.890" style="s2">hyper object you could break an airplane</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.880" end="01:01:17.990" style="s2">down all of its however many hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.890" end="01:01:20.359" style="s2">thousands component parts and ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.990" end="01:01:22.609" style="s2">have just a complex system you can fully</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.359" end="01:01:26.829" style="s2">understand the airplane as a closed</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.609" end="01:01:30.670" style="s2">system but something like a rainforest</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.829" end="01:01:33.400" style="s2">right or the hue or a single human body</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.670" end="01:01:36.109" style="s2">or your brain even just a stinking brain</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.400" end="01:01:39.020" style="s2">let alone something like the universe</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.109" end="01:01:40.849" style="s2">where the whole earth these are what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.020" end="01:01:43.520" style="s2">been called an object-oriented ontology</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.849" end="01:01:45.079" style="s2">hyper objects so that&#39;s a first step</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.520" end="01:01:47.329" style="s2">towards a meta modern ontology where a</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.079" end="01:01:49.790" style="s2">certain epistemic humility is at play</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.329" end="01:01:50.900" style="s2">right and and we allow ourselves to say</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.790" end="01:01:54.109" style="s2">listen we&#39;re never we&#39;re gonna know</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.900" end="01:01:56.119" style="s2">exactly how your body works right so how</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.109" end="01:01:57.950" style="s2">dare I have the hubris to make an</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.119" end="01:02:02.210" style="s2">intervention that could form irreparable</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.950" end="01:02:04.069" style="s2">damage why not do no harm first and and</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.210" end="01:02:05.690" style="s2">work in a state of not-knowing</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.069" end="01:02:07.940" style="s2">and approach the hyper object with sort</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.690" end="01:02:10.400" style="s2">of reverence right and so you have soul</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.940" end="01:02:12.609" style="s2">qualities certainly have that and anyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.400" end="01:02:15.020" style="s2">who has been an educator and work with</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.609" end="01:02:18.859" style="s2">students over almost any age if you</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.020" end="01:02:21.520" style="s2">really let in the student you realize</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.859" end="01:02:23.510" style="s2">that this is a very complex</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.520" end="01:02:25.760" style="s2">responsibility being an educator or a</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.510" end="01:02:27.589" style="s2">parent for example because the</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.760" end="01:02:29.839" style="s2">individual is a hyper object and this</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.589" end="01:02:32.480" style="s2">gets to that the metaphysical importance</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.839" end="01:02:34.339" style="s2">of uniqueness as a category now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.480" end="01:02:36.230" style="s2">back to cosmo around humanism which</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.339" end="01:02:38.000" style="s2">would posit that that evolution actually</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.230" end="01:02:40.339" style="s2">developed towards increasing uniqueness</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.000" end="01:02:42.410" style="s2">so that evolutions in the business of</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.339" end="01:02:45.190" style="s2">creating ever more complex hyper objects</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.410" end="01:02:49.130" style="s2">the human being in our local environment</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.190" end="01:02:51.850" style="s2">obviously the most complex hyper object</p>

<p begin="01:02:51.850" end="01:02:57.560" style="s2">raining as you said that nice and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.150" end="01:03:00.590" style="s2">like the question of why did it start</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.560" end="01:03:05.420" style="s2">raining is confronts us with a hyper</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.590" end="01:03:07.100" style="s2">object of the global ecosystems the</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.420" end="01:03:10.120" style="s2">question of why it started raining away</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.100" end="01:03:12.350" style="s2">when I said that confronts us with</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.120" end="01:03:14.930" style="s2">potentially other metaphysical realities</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.350" end="01:03:17.990" style="s2">and this gets into other conversations</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.930" end="01:03:21.200" style="s2">about like Colin Wilson and and those</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.990" end="01:03:24.220" style="s2">people who&#39;ve studied the scientific</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.200" end="01:03:27.590" style="s2">realities of synchronicity and</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.220" end="01:03:29.810" style="s2">occurrences that defy chance and seem to</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.590" end="01:03:31.910" style="s2">imply a relationship between human</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.810" end="01:03:34.190" style="s2">intentionality and the material</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.910" end="01:03:36.260" style="s2">substrate of the universe right so again</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.190" end="01:03:38.000" style="s2">and there&#39;s good evidence that the mind</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.260" end="01:03:39.380" style="s2">affects the body in your own life every</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.000" end="01:03:41.030" style="s2">day because you move your arm by</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.380" end="01:03:42.970" style="s2">thinking about it</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.030" end="01:03:46.090" style="s2">and what you eat can change your mood</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.970" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">and yet we think that that&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.090" end="01:03:55.820" style="s2">mind ends and matter begins but in fact</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:58.370" style="s2">the mind extends far beyond the skin</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.820" end="01:04:00.320" style="s2">encapsulated ego as it were right you</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.370" end="01:04:03.410" style="s2">brought up synchronicity so we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.320" end="01:04:05.690" style="s2">we&#39;re going there because it would be I</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.410" end="01:04:08.180" style="s2">would be remiss if I didn&#39;t give you an</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.690" end="01:04:12.100" style="s2">opportunity to talk about what a meta</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.180" end="01:04:15.170" style="s2">modern understanding of time looks like</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.100" end="01:04:17.150" style="s2">yeah I actually don&#39;t have a super</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.170" end="01:04:20.510" style="s2">coherent answer to this um you know</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.150" end="01:04:23.050" style="s2">before the call I I said that time is</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.510" end="01:04:26.570" style="s2">probably the most complex metaphysical</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.050" end="01:04:29.780" style="s2">subject you know if you read a book like</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.570" end="01:04:33.560" style="s2">for example Alfred White Alfred North</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.780" end="01:04:36.350" style="s2">Whitehead &#39;he&#39;s process a reality that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.560" end="01:04:39.110" style="s2">a metaphysics that place is essentially</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.350" end="01:04:41.990" style="s2">time or sequence at the heart of</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.110" end="01:04:45.760" style="s2">creation itself which is to say that the</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.990" end="01:04:48.920" style="s2">universe is by definition temporal or</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.760" end="01:04:50.240" style="s2">sequentially unfolding so that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.920" end="01:04:55.730" style="s2">get a universe without getting something</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.240" end="01:04:58.370" style="s2">like evolution and compounding or non</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.730" end="01:05:00.560" style="s2">arbitrary sequence or kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.370" end="01:05:05.750" style="s2">unfolding um</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.560" end="01:05:08.150" style="s2">now in the paper I write about how as I</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.750" end="01:05:10.670" style="s2">just mentioned that the mind itself is</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.150" end="01:05:12.380" style="s2">actually extended beyond the nervous</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.670" end="01:05:14.600" style="s2">system this is very important point it</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.380" end="01:05:18.230" style="s2">was raised in the cognitive sciences in</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.600" end="01:05:20.180" style="s2">the late 90s and it was under the fear</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.230" end="01:05:22.010" style="s2">of the extended mind David Chalmers was</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.180" end="01:05:23.630" style="s2">involved in the conversation and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.010" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">basic idea being that once I&#39;m used to</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.630" end="01:05:29.480" style="s2">my phone were either used to the library</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:33.200" style="s2">that I have in my house my mind ceases</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.480" end="01:05:36.590" style="s2">to be limited by what I have like within</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.200" end="01:05:38.540" style="s2">my skin in intradermally and the mind</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.590" end="01:05:41.240" style="s2">now actually includes the books and</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.540" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">includes the affordances of my cell</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.240" end="01:05:45.080" style="s2">phone for example now and so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:47.990" style="s2">thing that humans have been doing for a</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.080" end="01:05:50.660" style="s2">long time we&#39;ve actually been using the</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.990" end="01:05:53.630" style="s2">environment as a way to offload and</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.660" end="01:05:56.810" style="s2">capture cognitive stuff and so if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.630" end="01:05:59.840" style="s2">look at sundials and things like</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.810" end="01:06:02.630" style="s2">Stonehenge or the pyramids or other</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.840" end="01:06:05.030" style="s2">sacred archaeological sites built by</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.630" end="01:06:08.180" style="s2">ancient humans most of what these were</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.030" end="01:06:12.680" style="s2">were actually architectural II designed</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.180" end="01:06:14.180" style="s2">time capture devices right and so what</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.680" end="01:06:17.450" style="s2">this shows is one of the first attempts</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.180" end="01:06:19.970" style="s2">of humanity to touch the real beyond the</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.450" end="01:06:22.370" style="s2">imagination and beyond the ego-syntonic</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.970" end="01:06:25.190" style="s2">defense mechanisms and beyond you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.370" end="01:06:26.660" style="s2">the illusions of the the nervous system</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.190" end="01:06:29.480" style="s2">itself and to try to cash your</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.660" end="01:06:31.490" style="s2">subjective time which we all feel is</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.480" end="01:06:33.920" style="s2">this kind of like temporal duration</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.490" end="01:06:35.570" style="s2">something&#39;s far away and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.920" end="01:06:38.240" style="s2">odd the more you try to feel into time</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.570" end="01:06:40.190" style="s2">but that&#39;s another topic so their</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.240" end="01:06:41.720" style="s2">subjective time which is tricky and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.190" end="01:06:43.940" style="s2">which is why we have timers and</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.720" end="01:06:46.160" style="s2">calendars and so the some of the first</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.940" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">things ancient humans did were to codify</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.160" end="01:06:51.320" style="s2">subjective time into objective time</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:53.330" style="s2">through the creation of technologies</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.320" end="01:06:54.650" style="s2">that were basically externalized time</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.330" end="01:06:58.610" style="s2">capture like a sundial</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.650" end="01:07:00.080" style="s2">for example works and so yes precisely</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.610" end="01:07:02.630" style="s2">that&#39;s actually William Aaron Thompson</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.080" end="01:07:05.210" style="s2">he suggests that the first measurement</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.630" end="01:07:06.980" style="s2">instrument ever found was on a medicine</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.210" end="01:07:09.860" style="s2">woman and she was essentially marking</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.980" end="01:07:13.390" style="s2">for her menstrual period and the moon</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.860" end="01:07:14.920" style="s2">cycles for ritual purposes</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.390" end="01:07:17.200" style="s2">but again it was like you need to have</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.920" end="01:07:19.060" style="s2">the you know the chalk marks on the wall</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.200" end="01:07:21.190" style="s2">with a slash through room for the five</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.060" end="01:07:25.270" style="s2">if you&#39;re the prisoner you know I mean</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.190" end="01:07:27.760" style="s2">like you time needs to be captured kind</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.270" end="01:07:31.630" style="s2">of outside the mind in a way and the</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.760" end="01:07:33.340" style="s2">objectivity of time is tricky no more so</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.630" end="01:07:35.890" style="s2">than the objectivity of Iraq hitting you</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.340" end="01:07:38.740" style="s2">ahead is how long were you unconscious</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.890" end="01:07:40.780" style="s2">for when you wake up right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.740" end="01:07:43.330" style="s2">it&#39;s this traffic unis because has to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.780" end="01:07:45.700" style="s2">with awareness and kind of the alertness</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.330" end="01:07:48.310" style="s2">and consciousness that characterizes the</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.700" end="01:07:50.350" style="s2">human so you&#39;ll note that the animals do</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.310" end="01:07:53.170" style="s2">not build sundials even though they</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.350" end="01:07:54.460" style="s2">could benefit greatly from them and so</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.170" end="01:07:56.770" style="s2">one of the things that actually sets the</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.460" end="01:07:59.890" style="s2">human apart is that the human can make</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.770" end="01:08:03.940" style="s2">metaphysics they relate to things that</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.890" end="01:08:07.150" style="s2">are objectively real like time did we</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.940" end="01:08:08.830" style="s2">just go tautological here did are we are</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.150" end="01:08:10.630" style="s2">we suggesting that the ability to make</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.830" end="01:08:14.770" style="s2">metaphysics is what separates us</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.630" end="01:08:17.470" style="s2">metaphysically from that could be a</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.770" end="01:08:19.300" style="s2">tautology it could it could be I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.470" end="01:08:21.250" style="s2">think maybe dolphins probably have some</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.300" end="01:08:22.780" style="s2">very complex views about the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.250" end="01:08:25.150" style="s2">the universe and they live in I would</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.780" end="01:08:26.560" style="s2">actually totally believe it so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.150" end="01:08:27.970" style="s2">trying to and I say this in the paper</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.560" end="01:08:30.700" style="s2">you know I&#39;m not trying to draw a stark</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.970" end="01:08:34.120" style="s2">line between animals and humans but I</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.700" end="01:08:36.160" style="s2">but I would suggest yes that in the kind</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.120" end="01:08:38.770" style="s2">of hierarchy of beings as it were in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.160" end="01:08:42.910" style="s2">evolutionary chain there was this moment</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.770" end="01:08:44.470" style="s2">when the humans became kind of radically</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.910" end="01:08:45.240" style="s2">separate almost a good glitch in the</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.470" end="01:08:48.310" style="s2">matrix</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.240" end="01:08:51.490" style="s2">due to this reflectivity and due to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.310" end="01:08:52.950" style="s2">ability to externalize the mind into its</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.490" end="01:08:57.820" style="s2">environment and a kind of very</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.950" end="01:09:00.190" style="s2">cognitively powerful way and yeah so and</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.820" end="01:09:02.350" style="s2">that led to the seeking of understanding</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.190" end="01:09:05.140" style="s2">the nature of causality which led us to</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.350" end="01:09:07.600" style="s2">where we are now question past you just</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.140" end="01:09:09.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s my hope that in every one</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.600" end="01:09:11.800" style="s2">of these episodes we can quote-unquote</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.430" end="01:09:13.690" style="s2">break a little new ground on the topic</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.800" end="01:09:17.170" style="s2">and you know this particular issue of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.690" end="01:09:19.000" style="s2">the issue of of time in a you know what</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.170" end="01:09:21.010" style="s2">at least Ken Wilber was calling it at</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.000" end="01:09:22.270" style="s2">the time I post metaphysical meaning you</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.010" end="01:09:24.700" style="s2">know like I think he&#39;s just trying to</p>

<p begin="01:09:24.700" end="01:09:26.830" style="s2">people because even that stuff was</p>

<p begin="01:10:32.680" end="01:10:38.410" style="s2">looking at time one is I think more</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.790" end="01:10:41.590" style="s2">intuitive and conventional that the real</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.410" end="01:10:45.670" style="s2">sort of accretes or compresses out of</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.590" end="01:10:48.660" style="s2">the actual in some sort of step-by-step</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.670" end="01:10:51.480" style="s2">fashion that&#39;s the you know whiteheads</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.660" end="01:10:53.770" style="s2">exact sort of view of things and then</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.480" end="01:10:55.960" style="s2">but you know before our conversation you</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.770" end="01:10:59.890" style="s2">suggested that you thought that the</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.960" end="01:11:03.940" style="s2">accretion view was mistaken I think</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.890" end="01:11:05.830" style="s2">there&#39;s another view which is that maybe</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.940" end="01:11:07.990" style="s2">there&#39;s like a spatialized way of</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.830" end="01:11:13.270" style="s2">looking at this where past and future</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.990" end="01:11:17.200" style="s2">are on horizons of the present at which</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.270" end="01:11:19.680" style="s2">our observer is located and that on the</p>

<p begin="01:11:19.680" end="01:11:26.470" style="s2">possibility is the unthinkable and at</p>

<p begin="01:11:29.680" end="01:11:34.300" style="s2">know the origin and destiny of our</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.030" end="01:11:36.670" style="s2">narrative and then you know around the</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.300" end="01:11:38.500" style="s2">horizon we have a sort of that that</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.670" end="01:11:40.000" style="s2">spectrum of what we ordinarily call the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.500" end="01:11:40.810" style="s2">possible but the pasta that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.000" end="01:11:44.020" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.810" end="01:11:44.920" style="s2">one axis of several in which you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.020" end="01:11:47.110" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the difference</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.920" end="01:11:49.870" style="s2">between the possible and the actual and</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.110" end="01:11:52.660" style="s2">so we stand on like this this notion</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.870" end="01:11:56.380" style="s2">that the actual may be somehow less real</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.660" end="01:11:58.930" style="s2">than the potential reminds me of to call</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.380" end="01:12:03.730" style="s2">into the idea of the life of a soul</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.930" end="01:12:04.600" style="s2">beyond the life of a person that you</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.730" end="01:12:06.430" style="s2">know sorry about this is my friend the</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.600" end="01:12:09.280" style="s2">other day that if you do sort of accept</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.430" end="01:12:11.560" style="s2">like Timothy Morton says about the body</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.280" end="01:12:14.410" style="s2">as a hyper object that it&#39;s made out of</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.560" end="01:12:15.580" style="s2">all this stuff that&#39;s dead in at least</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.410" end="01:12:17.290" style="s2">in you know the traditional sense of</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.580" end="01:12:19.360" style="s2">thinking of it and it has existed for</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.290" end="01:12:22.060" style="s2">vastly longer than you have and will for</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.360" end="01:12:24.610" style="s2">vastly longer than you have that the</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.060" end="01:12:28.480" style="s2">majority of your sort of life as stuff</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.610" end="01:12:31.840" style="s2">is actually dead that like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.480" end="01:12:34.720" style="s2">actually much vastly more dead one</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.840" end="01:12:37.270" style="s2">perspective than you are alive a Steiner</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.720" end="01:12:41.140" style="s2">said basically the same thing yeah so I</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.270" end="01:12:45.700" style="s2">mean do you see in a way that that sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.140" end="01:12:46.720" style="s2">of suggests a time of like a universal</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.700" end="01:12:50.620" style="s2">simultaneity</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.720" end="01:12:53.710" style="s2">in which the ancestors and the the</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.620" end="01:12:55.270" style="s2">unborn are present in every moment I</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.710" end="01:12:57.900" style="s2">don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;m getting a little</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.270" end="01:13:00.490" style="s2">flowery here but I feel like this is</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.900" end="01:13:04.060" style="s2">this is great this is exactly because</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.490" end="01:13:06.370" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like you know sleep and</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.060" end="01:13:07.870" style="s2">death right this is what Steiner talked</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.370" end="01:13:10.450" style="s2">a lot about this because this is where</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.870" end="01:13:13.480" style="s2">time gets really weird because time</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.450" end="01:13:17.290" style="s2">seems to stop for those who die and for</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.480" end="01:13:21.240" style="s2">those who are asleep and this question</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.290" end="01:13:24.430" style="s2">of you know is there some kind of a</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.240" end="01:13:27.100" style="s2">temporal simultaneity in which</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.430" end="01:13:29.710" style="s2">everything exists at once you know that</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.100" end="01:13:32.110" style="s2">has been a resounding I think yes from</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.710" end="01:13:34.630" style="s2">the great esoteric sides of the</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.110" end="01:13:36.550" style="s2">religious traditions and the theologies</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.630" end="01:13:38.700" style="s2">from a bunch of different traditions</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.550" end="01:13:41.890" style="s2">that there&#39;s there&#39;s kind of an internal</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.700" end="01:13:45.250" style="s2">in excuse me internal to the material</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.890" end="01:13:47.260" style="s2">there&#39;s an internal eternal so if you go</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.250" end="01:13:52.990" style="s2">into the material you&#39;ll find something</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.260" end="01:13:53.920" style="s2">that is timeless and yet in the in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.990" end="01:13:55.870" style="s2">dead matter in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.920" end="01:13:57.969" style="s2">the mineral kingdom and his diner would</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.870" end="01:13:59.170" style="s2">say you know you participate in the</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.969" end="01:14:00.670" style="s2">mineral kingdom you&#39;re like moving</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.170" end="01:14:04.750" style="s2">around with Stardust like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.670" end="01:14:06.520" style="s2">organized it magically to do things that</p>
<p begin="01:14:04.750" end="01:14:10.270" style="s2">you call you with your hands but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.520" end="01:14:12.340" style="s2">actually this ancient stuff which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.270" end="01:14:15.340" style="s2">dead and dying and then a process of</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.340" end="01:14:17.710" style="s2">decay which is continually rien de</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.340" end="01:14:21.190" style="s2">kind of influxes of novelty and</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.710" end="01:14:22.510" style="s2">creativity at the edge of time so you</p>
<p begin="01:14:21.190" end="01:14:25.660" style="s2">have to say that both are correct</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.510" end="01:14:29.530" style="s2">there&#39;s both in a temporal simultaneity</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.660" end="01:14:32.110" style="s2">in which in quotation marks also all</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.530" end="01:14:34.800" style="s2">souls are in communion right with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.110" end="01:14:38.260" style="s2">one but then there&#39;s this radically</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.800" end="01:14:41.830" style="s2">contingent temporal unfolding which is</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.260" end="01:14:44.350" style="s2">kind of like trickles down from the from</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.830" end="01:14:46.120" style="s2">the a temporal and eternal and so the</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.350" end="01:14:49.300" style="s2">eternal is different from the</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.120" end="01:14:52.780" style="s2">everlasting the everlasting is the soul</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.300" end="01:14:55.630" style="s2">that moves forever through time right</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.780" end="01:14:58.060" style="s2">and again so it&#39;s like if you begin to</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.630" end="01:14:59.290" style="s2">work with this type of metaphysics which</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.060" end="01:15:00.940" style="s2">is very in holding what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.290" end="01:15:03.190" style="s2">anthroposophical or rudolf steiner</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.940" end="01:15:05.739" style="s2">tradition then when you when a child is</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.190" end="01:15:09.640" style="s2">born it comes to your school this child</p>
<p begin="01:15:05.739" end="01:15:12.910" style="s2">has an everlasting soul right be careful</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.640" end="01:15:13.900" style="s2">like like have reverence and likewise</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.910" end="01:15:16.650" style="s2">with yourself when you look in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.900" end="01:15:19.719" style="s2">mirror so there&#39;s this sense of a</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.650" end="01:15:21.550" style="s2">inviolable dignity to every being</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.719" end="01:15:24.190" style="s2">because it participates in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.550" end="01:15:26.920" style="s2">everlastingness of time and the eternal</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.190" end="01:15:29.530" style="s2">so again it&#39;s like am I allowed to stay</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.920" end="01:15:31.540" style="s2">this stuff in a post right seriously in</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.530" end="01:15:34.090" style="s2">a postmodern and modern context not</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.540" end="01:15:36.489" style="s2">really allowed to say this stuff now if</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.090" end="01:15:37.870" style="s2">I like got some kind of degree or did</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.489" end="01:15:39.330" style="s2">something in religion then maybe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.870" end="01:15:42.640" style="s2">allowed to so there&#39;s this question of</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.330" end="01:15:45.100" style="s2">who gets to decide and how do we as</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.640" end="01:15:47.380" style="s2">individuals decide on the answer to</p>

<p begin="01:15:47.380" end="01:15:51.429" style="s2">I&#39;m saying it&#39;s how you treat a child in</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.179" end="01:15:53.949" style="s2">a school for example right do you treat</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.429" end="01:15:58.510" style="s2">them as basically something to be used</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.949" end="01:16:01.050" style="s2">for economic efficiency right or do you</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.510" end="01:16:03.940" style="s2">treat them as somehow this much more</p>

<p begin="01:16:10.579" end="01:16:16.519" style="s2">maybe in a modern thing it&#39;s both right</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.059" end="01:16:18.439" style="s2">right well I mean it&#39;s potentially both</p>

<p begin="01:18:36.869" end="01:18:41.099" style="s2">questions about like one&#39;s the human</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.669" end="01:18:42.510" style="s2">what are we here on earth to do what is</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.099" end="01:18:43.439" style="s2">a relationship how important our</p>

<p begin="01:18:51.780" end="01:18:59.820" style="s2">human and we are relegating them yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.840" end="01:19:01.439" style="s2">I could just keep going so I&#39;ll pause</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.820" end="01:19:02.760" style="s2">I&#39;ll pause I think you&#39;re getting you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:19:06.689" end="01:19:14.820" style="s2">getting close here I think to a bowtie</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.679" end="01:19:19.769" style="s2">on this let&#39;s map out what we kind of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.820" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">know for sure just based on the general</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.769" end="01:19:24.959" style="s2">tendency and I will argue this with</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:25.459" style="s2">sceptics if necessary and I&#39;m sure you</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.959" end="01:19:30.419" style="s2">would too</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.459" end="01:19:35.659" style="s2">towards that greater more complex hyper</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.419" end="01:19:38.760" style="s2">object we know that poly centrism is</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.659" end="01:19:40.380" style="s2">ecologically resilient and robust so</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.760" end="01:19:42.599" style="s2">that that&#39;s sort of Trent that&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:19:42.599" end="01:19:49.650" style="s2">biosphere you know we know that again</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.099" end="01:19:53.070" style="s2">like resilience is itself an attractor</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.650" end="01:19:58.199" style="s2">pulling everything toward it what do we</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.070" end="01:20:02.369" style="s2">see as the characteristics that we can</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.199" end="01:20:06.570" style="s2">kind of sketch out as more or less</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.369" end="01:20:08.789" style="s2">guaranteed about a future that has found</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.570" end="01:20:10.139" style="s2">its new you know a planetary human</p>
<p begin="01:20:08.789" end="01:20:13.439" style="s2">culture that&#39;s found a new equilibrium</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.139" end="01:20:16.380" style="s2">in this meta-narrative how do you think</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.439" end="01:20:18.719" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna look how do you think we feel</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.380" end="01:20:22.019" style="s2">not just look right not just to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.719" end="01:20:25.019" style="s2">not just the science of the visible but</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.019" end="01:20:27.510" style="s2">how will it feel you know I mean so the</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.019" end="01:20:31.450" style="s2">most like when I try to think about</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.510" end="01:20:33.820" style="s2">future it&#39;s quite scary</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.450" end="01:20:36.660" style="s2">you know the most potent sense I have</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.820" end="01:20:39.180" style="s2">for what like the other side will be a</p>

<p begin="01:20:46.420" end="01:20:50.320" style="s2">socio-political and I can talk a lot</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.000" end="01:20:51.700" style="s2">about that and I have this whole thing</p>
<p begin="01:20:50.320" end="01:20:54.580" style="s2">in my book that&#39;s coming about these</p>

<p begin="01:20:54.580" end="01:20:59.970" style="s2">things like basic income guarantee and</p>

<p begin="01:21:08.260" end="01:21:13.260" style="s2">of stuff that would have to happen to</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.690" end="01:21:15.370" style="s2">have something like a sustainable just</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.260" end="01:21:17.290" style="s2">civilization on the other side of what I</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.370" end="01:21:19.660" style="s2">see as the kind of crisis of the</p>

<p begin="01:21:24.610" end="01:21:30.970" style="s2">kind of the bridge of fire to the cosmic</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.220" end="01:21:32.680" style="s2">age that Sun would say yeah so when I so</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.970" end="01:21:34.390" style="s2">when I think about the other side I</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.680" end="01:21:38.680" style="s2">think mostly about what it takes to live</p>
<p begin="01:21:34.390" end="01:21:40.510" style="s2">in a post tragic culture right this is</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.680" end="01:21:42.550" style="s2">one of the facets of cosmic humanism</p>
<p begin="01:21:40.510" end="01:21:45.750" style="s2">this teaching by gaffney on the post</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.550" end="01:21:49.270" style="s2">tragic and so this question of you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.750" end="01:21:51.190" style="s2">modernity was pre tragic right modernity</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.270" end="01:21:54.220" style="s2">was just like triumphant meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.190" end="01:21:55.870" style="s2">massive historical progress boom like</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.220" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">don&#39;t listen to the people we colonial</p>

<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.370" style="s2">the duelists like just go be happy</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.990" end="01:22:02.830" style="s2">because we&#39;re progressing technology</p>

<p begin="01:22:05.440" end="01:22:09.850" style="s2"> modernity yes like a positive</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.680" end="01:22:11.680" style="s2">pre tragic you don&#39;t even look at the</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.850" end="01:22:13.180" style="s2">tragedy like you that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.680" end="01:22:15.880" style="s2">thing is keeping the tragedy out of</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.180" end="01:22:18.250" style="s2">public a high in fact post modernity</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.880" end="01:22:21.840" style="s2">flips the script entirely post modernity</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.250" end="01:22:24.310" style="s2">is stuck in the tragic entirely and</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.840" end="01:22:26.410" style="s2">anyone who&#39;s experienced tragedy knows</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.310" end="01:22:28.510" style="s2">that there&#39;s a moment to be in tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.410" end="01:22:31.510" style="s2">and there&#39;s a moment to actually really</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.510" end="01:22:33.250" style="s2">process tragedy and to not avoid the</p>
<p begin="01:22:31.510" end="01:22:36.190" style="s2">emotion and the intensity of tragedy but</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.250" end="01:22:39.700" style="s2">then you need to get after the tragic</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.190" end="01:22:42.070" style="s2">and find a way to love and laugh again</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.700" end="01:22:43.840" style="s2">and to think optimistically</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.070" end="01:22:44.650" style="s2">even though you know that tragedy is the</p>

<p begin="01:22:44.650" end="01:22:49.960" style="s2">world No and so the situation with post</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.770" end="01:22:51.790" style="s2">modernity in the postmodern identity is</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.960" end="01:22:54.699" style="s2">often one of getting encased and</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.790" end="01:22:57.340" style="s2">entrapped tragic without a larger metal</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.699" end="01:23:00.280" style="s2">narrative that can frame it and then</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.340" end="01:23:06.250" style="s2">provide an exit into the post tragic and</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.280" end="01:23:09.880" style="s2">so when you&#39;re in a pre tragic culture</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.250" end="01:23:12.310" style="s2">like modernity you confront tragedy by</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.880" end="01:23:14.080" style="s2">essentially ignoring it occluding it</p>

<p begin="01:23:49.179" end="01:23:55.570" style="s2">it&#39;s a real actual tragedy so getting</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.920" end="01:23:57.820" style="s2">stuck in the conversation you can</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.570" end="01:23:59.800" style="s2">possibly have as well any people well</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.820" end="01:24:01.719" style="s2">and it&#39;s also emotionally a very</p>
<p begin="01:23:59.800" end="01:24:02.679" style="s2">dangerous position because tragedy is</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.719" end="01:24:04.719" style="s2">actually something that needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.679" end="01:24:07.120" style="s2">processed which is why the moment that</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.719" end="01:24:08.830" style="s2">post modernity is stuck in is actually</p>
<p begin="01:24:07.120" end="01:24:12.010" style="s2">it&#39;s excellent sometimes called</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.830" end="01:24:15.850" style="s2">complicated grief right yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.010" end="01:24:17.830" style="s2">this very delicate and difficult</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.850" end="01:24:19.810" style="s2">emotional transition that needs to take</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.830" end="01:24:22.150" style="s2">place where we need to say essentially</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.810" end="01:24:26.770" style="s2">yes tried to take human history tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.150" end="01:24:29.650" style="s2">yes and in fact make reparations in some</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.770" end="01:24:31.179" style="s2">cases and then somehow find a way to</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.650" end="01:24:34.390" style="s2">look each other in the eye again and</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.179" end="01:24:36.460" style="s2">laugh and and build a positive future</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.390" end="01:24:37.929" style="s2">and that requires again a return to some</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.460" end="01:24:39.699" style="s2">kind of metaphysical narrative that can</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.929" end="01:24:41.350" style="s2">make sense of the evil that happened it</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.699" end="01:24:43.989" style="s2">can make sense of human folly a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.350" end="01:24:46.989" style="s2">right creed say this of all of these</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.989" end="01:24:48.460" style="s2">things that are part of the tragedy how</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.989" end="01:24:50.050" style="s2">do we make sense of that if we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.460" end="01:24:52.010" style="s2">monkeys that evolved in a meaningless</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.050" end="01:24:53.809" style="s2">material universe</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.010" end="01:24:55.429" style="s2">can&#39;t we&#39;re just just tragic to all the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.809" end="01:24:58.250" style="s2">things is tragic there&#39;s no escape from</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.429" end="01:25:00.889" style="s2">the postmodern tragic critique unless we</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.250" end="01:25:03.349" style="s2">go back to a triumphant pre tragic</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.889" end="01:25:06.440" style="s2">scientism right which isn&#39;t again the</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.349" end="01:25:09.530" style="s2">transhumanists escaped they escaped the</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.440" end="01:25:11.840" style="s2">postmodern tragedy into the basically</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.530" end="01:25:20.869" style="s2">hyper-modern pre tragic view where you</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.840" end="01:25:24.170" style="s2">can explain away yeah but so I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.869" end="01:25:27.320" style="s2">the future has to be some culture of of</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.170" end="01:25:29.269" style="s2">the post tragic some way of again</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.320" end="01:25:33.889" style="s2">telling a broader metadata that allows</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.269" end="01:25:37.159" style="s2">us to basically all lose face and then</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.889" end="01:25:38.719" style="s2">regain face together oh you know because</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.159" end="01:25:42.110" style="s2">the more tragedy is a great leveler</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.719" end="01:25:46.219" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing like tragedy is</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.110" end="01:25:48.920" style="s2">something all humans share no and you</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.219" end="01:25:50.139" style="s2">know the the needs and again this is why</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.920" end="01:25:52.519" style="s2">every religion has always existed</p>
<p begin="01:25:50.139" end="01:25:55.429" style="s2">because religion provides narrative</p>
<p begin="01:25:52.519" end="01:25:56.840" style="s2">beyond the tragedy I&#39;m in Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.429" end="01:25:58.969" style="s2">being the greatest example of a post</p>
<p begin="01:25:56.840" end="01:26:00.650" style="s2">tragic religion I mean they didn&#39;t nail</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.969" end="01:26:04.460" style="s2">Buddha to the cross but it died</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.650" end="01:26:07.340" style="s2">peacefully lying on the side uh uh a</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.460" end="01:26:08.960" style="s2">shock you moon a Buddha anyway whereas</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.340" end="01:26:11.659" style="s2">Christ on the cross</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.960" end="01:26:14.380" style="s2">and so there&#39;s this way in which we need</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.659" end="01:26:17.420" style="s2">culturally to think about a resurrection</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.380" end="01:26:19.250" style="s2">if I can speak in these terms because</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.420" end="01:26:20.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s gonna be a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:26:19.250" end="01:26:23.239" style="s2">tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.360" end="01:26:25.610" style="s2">both are revealed in terms of what has</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.239" end="01:26:28.610" style="s2">happened in the recent history that we</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.610" end="01:26:30.469" style="s2">don&#39;t know about yet and ongoing and</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.610" end="01:26:32.960" style="s2">escalating into the near future decades</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.469" end="01:26:36.619" style="s2">and so whole groups of people need to</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.960" end="01:26:38.420" style="s2">think about how to get into a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.619" end="01:26:42.110" style="s2">post tragic consciousness to remain</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.420" end="01:26:43.429" style="s2">productive creative positive solution</p>
<p begin="01:26:42.110" end="01:26:45.429" style="s2">building because there will be a</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.429" end="01:26:48.429" style="s2">tendency especially amplified by the</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.429" end="01:26:51.889" style="s2">commodity market dies social media etc</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.429" end="01:26:53.719" style="s2">to to wallow in the tragedy to the</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.889" end="01:26:55.309" style="s2">extent of this week decimating the</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.719" end="01:26:56.599" style="s2">morale of the entire culture if that</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.309" end="01:26:57.889" style="s2">hasn&#39;t already happened as a result of</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.599" end="01:27:00.440" style="s2">post modernist but it may have already</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.889" end="01:27:03.159" style="s2">happened that we&#39;re we&#39;re so mired in</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.440" end="01:27:04.640" style="s2">the tragedy that it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.159" end="01:27:08.330" style="s2">something&#39;s have to</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.640" end="01:27:10.070" style="s2">get out of it and so these are what my</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.330" end="01:27:11.600" style="s2">reflections yeah the whole technical</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.070" end="01:27:14.030" style="s2">question about how do we weather this</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.600" end="01:27:16.520" style="s2">transition through the kind of birth of</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.030" end="01:27:20.090" style="s2">a Anthropocene into the into the kind of</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.520" end="01:27:21.380" style="s2">new earth and then the technical</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.090" end="01:27:23.330" style="s2">questions of what that post transition</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.380" end="01:27:24.320" style="s2">civilization looks like I mean these are</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.330" end="01:27:27.260" style="s2">some of the conversations I have with</p>
<p begin="01:27:24.320" end="01:27:30.140" style="s2">she walked in Bergeron Landry and green</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.260" end="01:27:32.300" style="s2">Hall and there&#39;s this there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.140" end="01:27:34.340" style="s2">needing to answer those questions very</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.300" end="01:27:36.410" style="s2">carefully both how do we get there how</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.340" end="01:27:38.930" style="s2">do we weather the storm and then what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.410" end="01:27:41.060" style="s2">the other side look like and what do</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.930" end="01:27:42.490" style="s2">these post transition technologies look</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.060" end="01:27:45.320" style="s2">like both social and material</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.490" end="01:27:47.060" style="s2">technologies and the key social</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.320" end="01:27:50.360" style="s2">technology is going to be building a</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.060" end="01:27:53.560" style="s2">kind of meaning-making culture that has</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.360" end="01:27:55.670" style="s2">a certain resilience and coherency to it</p>
<p begin="01:27:53.560" end="01:27:57.320" style="s2">and you know the Middle Ages are</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.670" end="01:28:00.260" style="s2">interesting like they were terrible and</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.320" end="01:28:03.230" style="s2">of course many ways when you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.260" end="01:28:06.260" style="s2">monastic traditions that spread you see</p>
<p begin="01:28:03.230" end="01:28:09.860" style="s2">during these times of darkness there</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.260" end="01:28:12.680" style="s2">also are attempts to preserve access to</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.860" end="01:28:16.190" style="s2">a very important truths especially true</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.680" end="01:28:18.490" style="s2">Civ the interior so I foresee a new</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.190" end="01:28:21.620" style="s2">monasticism as part of the transition I</p>
<p begin="01:28:18.490" end="01:28:23.780" style="s2">foresee many modes of alternative</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.620" end="01:28:27.350" style="s2">education and kind of mystery schools in</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.780" end="01:28:31.160" style="s2">the wilderness I see a number of</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.350" end="01:28:33.550" style="s2">intentional communities and basic</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.160" end="01:28:36.250" style="s2">questionings of democratic process</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.550" end="01:28:39.650" style="s2">experimentations with domestic</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.250" end="01:28:41.810" style="s2">collaboration households and so I think</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.650" end="01:28:45.050" style="s2">a lot of what we&#39;ve taken for granted in</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.810" end="01:28:47.030" style="s2">modernity especially in America will be</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.050" end="01:28:50.440" style="s2">shifting some of it by choice some of it</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.030" end="01:28:53.420" style="s2">on the back goes climate change induced</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.440" end="01:28:55.160" style="s2">disaster or political conflict that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.420" end="01:28:59.810" style="s2">the you know the refugee crisis alone</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.160" end="01:29:02.210" style="s2">makes this world a new world in which we</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.810" end="01:29:06.710" style="s2">need to find a way to house millions of</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.210" end="01:29:09.740" style="s2">people on an ongoing basis and so again</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.710" end="01:29:12.350" style="s2">we need a metaphysics of love or will</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.740" end="01:29:13.730" style="s2">fail at that because but then we will</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.350" end="01:29:15.440" style="s2">house these people and they will be seen</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.730" end="01:29:17.390" style="s2">as parasites on the productive people</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.440" end="01:29:18.340" style="s2">and the tent cities will be these</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.390" end="01:29:20.080" style="s2">terrible places</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.340" end="01:29:22.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not love it&#39;s a competitive</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.080" end="01:29:24.840" style="s2">Darwinian universe these are the losers</p>
<p begin="01:29:22.120" end="01:29:28.990" style="s2">that film looper kind of portrays the</p>
<p begin="01:29:24.840" end="01:29:30.880" style="s2">climate change refugees yes you know yes</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.990" end="01:29:33.730" style="s2">totally totally and so there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.880" end="01:29:37.590" style="s2">sense of needing to give ourselves the</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.730" end="01:29:42.310" style="s2">moral courage to embrace the stranger</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.590" end="01:29:44.470" style="s2">and to hold humanity as one family even</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.310" end="01:29:47.940" style="s2">when they&#39;re misbehaving members of the</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.470" end="01:29:50.230" style="s2">family you know and so it&#39;s you have the</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.940" end="01:29:52.120" style="s2">resurgence of hate and the resurgence of</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.230" end="01:29:54.100" style="s2">dehumanization on both the left and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.120" end="01:29:59.100" style="s2">right yeah both the modernists and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.100" end="01:30:02.740" style="s2">post modernists are missing in the point</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.100" end="01:30:04.240" style="s2">essentially which is the point were</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.740" end="01:30:05.590" style="s2">being called to by the global crisis</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.240" end="01:30:08.440" style="s2">which is that we need to return somehow</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.590" end="01:30:11.350" style="s2">to our humanity some kind of humanism</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.440" end="01:30:14.200" style="s2">some kind of love based a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.350" end="01:30:18.910" style="s2">based sovereignty paced way of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.200" end="01:30:21.880" style="s2">about who we are what we do otherwise it</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.910" end="01:30:24.580" style="s2">will be just basically a kind of a race</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.880" end="01:30:28.060" style="s2">to the high ground you know or like who</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.580" end="01:30:29.920" style="s2">gets on the ark as the world burns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.060" end="01:30:32.350" style="s2">just or floods or whatever it ends up</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.920" end="01:30:33.550" style="s2">being like this was expressed recently</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.350" end="01:30:37.380" style="s2">in a conversation I had with my father</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.550" end="01:30:40.300" style="s2">who is he&#39;s a retired successful</p>

<p begin="01:34:20.229" end="01:34:25.030" style="s2">and so we need to be concerned about</p>

<p begin="01:37:32.610" end="01:37:36.900" style="s2">externalities that&#39;s why we came if I</p>
<p begin="01:37:34.890" end="01:37:38.100" style="s2">wars anymore like a reasonably and</p>
<p begin="01:37:36.900" end="01:37:40.500" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing is that at some point</p>
<p begin="01:37:38.100" end="01:37:42.660" style="s2">it&#39;ll it&#39;ll click even for people who</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.500" end="01:37:45.960" style="s2">are purely selfish and just want to</p>
<p begin="01:37:42.660" end="01:37:47.790" style="s2">survive actually there&#39;s it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:37:45.960" end="01:37:49.110" style="s2">it&#39;s like a nice hippie idea like this</p>
<p begin="01:37:47.790" end="01:37:50.640" style="s2">is a warm fuzzy idea there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.110" end="01:37:52.530" style="s2">externality it&#39;s like it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:37:50.640" end="01:37:56.370" style="s2">literally true about the nature of</p>
<p begin="01:37:52.530" end="01:37:58.530" style="s2">material reality and the eCos and and so</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.370" end="01:38:00.360" style="s2">it&#39;s this will eventually at some point</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.530" end="01:38:02.160" style="s2">have to dawn like that&#39;s the nice thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:00.360" end="01:38:03.960" style="s2">about reality is that as charles sanders</p>
<p begin="01:38:02.160" end="01:38:06.960" style="s2">purse this was his best definition of</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.960" end="01:38:11.040" style="s2">reality reality is that which resists</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.960" end="01:38:14.300" style="s2">interpretation you can only go on so</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.040" end="01:38:18.900" style="s2">long in a reality avoidant culture</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.300" end="01:38:21.030" style="s2">eventually it bites back as it were and</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.900" end="01:38:23.610" style="s2">so the externalities things this is as</p>
<p begin="01:38:21.030" end="01:38:25.290" style="s2">part of that and I think again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.610" end="01:38:27.630" style="s2">about the tragic in the post tragic</p>
<p begin="01:38:25.290" end="01:38:30.420" style="s2">onboarding a ton of guilt to the point</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.630" end="01:38:32.730" style="s2">of disabling your own agency and</p>
<p begin="01:38:30.420" end="01:38:34.590" style="s2">sovereignty because you know about a fox</p>
<p begin="01:38:32.730" end="01:38:36.330" style="s2">gone that&#39;s not the answer</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.590" end="01:38:38.460" style="s2">but you do need to know about Fox Cal</p>
<p begin="01:38:36.330" end="01:38:41.250" style="s2">right so it&#39;s like how do you hold this</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.460" end="01:38:43.980" style="s2">sense of living in the midst of tragedy</p>
<p begin="01:38:41.250" end="01:38:45.510" style="s2">and yet still participating in the</p>
<p begin="01:38:43.980" end="01:38:49.710" style="s2">creation of some kind of post tragic</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.510" end="01:38:51.390" style="s2">world that&#39;s a very deep emotional thing</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.710" end="01:38:55.650" style="s2">that I knew a lot of people personally</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.390" end="01:38:56.700" style="s2">just work at you know and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.650" end="01:38:59.070" style="s2">some kind of new metaphysics of the</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.700" end="01:39:01.110" style="s2">human is part of that work it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:38:59.070" end="01:39:03.780" style="s2">thinking about reshaping our emotional</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.110" end="01:39:06.320" style="s2">lives and allowing a better world to</p>
<p begin="01:39:03.780" end="01:39:10.590" style="s2">emerge through our choices and</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.320" end="01:39:12.030" style="s2">relationships yeah</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.590" end="01:39:15.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s you know that&#39;s probably a</p>
<p begin="01:39:12.030" end="01:39:16.890" style="s2">good place to to call it man I really</p>
<p begin="01:39:15.360" end="01:39:19.190" style="s2">there&#39;s so much more that I would like</p>
