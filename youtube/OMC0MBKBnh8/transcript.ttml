<p begin="00:00:13.470" end="00:00:18.779" style="s2">for coming out I know you&#39;ve got plenty</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.110" end="00:00:23.189" style="s2">of stuff to do on a Thursday evening in</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.779" end="00:00:25.380" style="s2">San Diego so what we&#39;re gonna do is</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.189" end="00:00:27.509" style="s2">we&#39;re going to just talk a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.380" end="00:00:28.829" style="s2">about nootropics optimization but I want</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.509" end="00:00:32.730" style="s2">to make sure that this is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.829" end="00:00:35.460" style="s2">collaborative process so if you have</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.730" end="00:00:40.170" style="s2">questions in the middle feel free raise</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.460" end="00:00:43.380" style="s2">your hand just don&#39;t feel bashful and</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.170" end="00:00:46.770" style="s2">any sense so to start off with I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.380" end="00:00:47.850" style="s2">to let my fellow panelists introduce</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.770" end="00:00:50.010" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.850" end="00:00:52.440" style="s2">he&#39;ll tell me a little bit tell us a</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.010" end="00:00:56.300" style="s2">little bit about themselves and what</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.440" end="00:00:59.520" style="s2">they&#39;re working on so Mike right on um</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.300" end="00:01:03.210" style="s2">my name&#39;s Mike Bledsoe I&#39;m the host of a</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.520" end="00:01:05.360" style="s2">show called barbells Shrugged and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.210" end="00:01:09.360" style="s2">been in the game for about six years</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.360" end="00:01:11.729" style="s2">health and fitness and my job is super</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.360" end="00:01:14.880" style="s2">cool and the things I&#39;m up to are great</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.729" end="00:01:17.219" style="s2">because I get to mix it up with the best</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.880" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">in the world so I get exposed to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.219" end="00:01:23.219" style="s2">best coaches the best athletes the best</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:27.319" style="s2">people that are seeking performance in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.219" end="00:01:30.780" style="s2">lot of different areas so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.319" end="00:01:34.649" style="s2">really what it&#39;s really fun exciting</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.780" end="00:01:37.679" style="s2">that&#39;s what I get to do and I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.649" end="00:01:39.780" style="s2">inspired to do better because if you all</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.679" end="00:01:46.969" style="s2">I&#39;m surrounded by so of course and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.780" end="00:01:52.639" style="s2">have to like up it up somehow yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.969" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty loud okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.639" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">just to add Mike is actually being a</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:02.039" style="s2">little bit modest his his podcast as the</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:03.840" style="s2">number one Fitness related podcast in</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.039" end="00:02:05.849" style="s2">iTunes and that&#39;s why he could sort with</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.840" end="00:02:09.090" style="s2">the best people in the world it&#39;s epic</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.849" end="00:02:11.640" style="s2">worth listening to and it was my first</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.090" end="00:02:12.870" style="s2">time to see this today I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.640" end="00:02:16.620" style="s2">it was your first time it was fun</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.870" end="00:02:18.060" style="s2">getting to watch with everybody so I run</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.620" end="00:02:20.100" style="s2">research and development at neuro hacker</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.060" end="00:02:21.960" style="s2">collective and we&#39;re working on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.100" end="00:02:23.090" style="s2">tropics is just one category the tropics</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.960" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">means come</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.090" end="00:02:29.360" style="s2">cognitive enhancement but all things</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">mind brain optimization and health and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.360" end="00:02:32.750" style="s2">moments related and then not just mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:33.980" style="s2">brain but kind of future of medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.750" end="00:02:38.319" style="s2">within the scope of things that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.980" end="00:02:41.569" style="s2">working on so it&#39;s a great segue so</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.319" end="00:02:43.580" style="s2">speaking of future of Medicine one of</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.569" end="00:02:47.360" style="s2">the topics that I brought up was this</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.580" end="00:02:50.540" style="s2">idea that nootropics in some way could</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.360" end="00:02:53.600" style="s2">lead to Humanity solving greater</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.540" end="00:02:56.930" style="s2">challenges how could we make that a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.600" end="00:03:00.050" style="s2">reality how is that possible yeah it was</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.930" end="00:03:02.930" style="s2">a fun way to end the movie this is hi</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.050" end="00:03:09.070" style="s2">reverb for me is it alright if I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.930" end="00:03:09.070" style="s2">share that with you yeah that is better</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.120" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">so the question is can no Tropics really</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.709" end="00:03:21.110" style="s2">play a significant role in solving world</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:23.180" style="s2">challenges yeah it&#39;s not a yes-or-no</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.110" end="00:03:27.410" style="s2">question too nuanced one so hang in with</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.180" end="00:03:29.870" style="s2">me a little bit most of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.410" end="00:03:31.340" style="s2">that we face globally or have as a</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.870" end="00:03:33.920" style="s2">common denominator that they&#39;re caused</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.340" end="00:03:35.840" style="s2">by human action whether we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.920" end="00:03:38.299" style="s2">climate change or species extinction or</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.840" end="00:03:41.180" style="s2">war or slavery like these are human</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.299" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">action induced issues and even the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.180" end="00:03:46.010" style="s2">things like natural disasters that</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:47.870" style="s2">aren&#39;t human action induced still have</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.010" end="00:03:51.170" style="s2">to be human action modulated right like</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.870" end="00:03:52.970" style="s2">we knew that the tsunami was going to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.170" end="00:03:54.769" style="s2">hit Japan five years before Fukushima</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.970" end="00:03:56.720" style="s2">happen we just didn&#39;t preemptively</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.769" end="00:04:00.500" style="s2">respond appropriately that happens all</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.720" end="00:04:01.910" style="s2">the time and so pretty much all of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.500" end="00:04:03.620" style="s2">major issues in the world are going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.910" end="00:04:04.880" style="s2">be addressed by humans they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.620" end="00:04:09.140" style="s2">to be addressed that we made worse</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.880" end="00:04:11.600" style="s2">better etc and so human physiology is</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.140" end="00:04:13.280" style="s2">one of the things that predisposes</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.600" end="00:04:16.340" style="s2">patterns of human behavior human</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.280" end="00:04:19.010" style="s2">psychology in terms of their education</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.340" end="00:04:21.440" style="s2">their media their culture their trauma</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.010" end="00:04:23.870" style="s2">is all part of it what macroeconomics</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.440" end="00:04:25.250" style="s2">incentivizes and what the social systems</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.870" end="00:04:26.600" style="s2">incentivize as a part of it so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.250" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">lot of things that influence human</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.600" end="00:04:29.660" style="s2">behavior the physiology is one of them</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">and typically when we think of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.660" end="00:04:33.590" style="s2">physiology and human behavior we&#39;re used</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:35.060" style="s2">to thinking of it as a Analia Bowl</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.590" end="00:04:36.020" style="s2">genetic thing you have people who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.060" end="00:04:37.370" style="s2">genetically</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.020" end="00:04:40.190" style="s2">prone towards psychopathy or</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.370" end="00:04:42.410" style="s2">Compassion&#39;s is mostly nonsense there</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.190" end="00:04:44.540" style="s2">are genetic predispositions but they</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.410" end="00:04:46.250" style="s2">still are going to those genes are going</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.540" end="00:04:47.990" style="s2">to express or not based on things that</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.250" end="00:04:50.150" style="s2">are modulated well and things like</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.990" end="00:04:52.220" style="s2">hormones and neural chemistry and gut</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.150" end="00:04:53.750" style="s2">brain access affect people&#39;s mood and</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.220" end="00:04:56.180" style="s2">their quality of life but also their</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.750" end="00:04:58.820" style="s2">behavior pretty radically and those are</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.180" end="00:05:01.370" style="s2">inducible things and so like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.820" end="00:05:03.530" style="s2">pose a whole driving motive for neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.370" end="00:05:05.960" style="s2">hackers that when we can help people</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.530" end="00:05:08.120" style="s2">optimize their chemistry and their</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.960" end="00:05:10.220" style="s2">physiology that doesn&#39;t just increase</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.120" end="00:05:12.920" style="s2">quality of life subjectively it also</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.220" end="00:05:15.800" style="s2">increases their capacity and that can be</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.920" end="00:05:17.810" style="s2">capacity and disposition right so like</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.800" end="00:05:20.120" style="s2">not just general capacity but capacity</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.810" end="00:05:21.740" style="s2">and orientation towards some things</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.120" end="00:05:24.020" style="s2">versus others like as as soon as you get</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.740" end="00:05:25.550" style="s2">that empathy runs on certain neural</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.020" end="00:05:27.350" style="s2">networks and is mediated by certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.550" end="00:05:30.290" style="s2">kinds of chemistry you can either up or</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.350" end="00:05:32.780" style="s2">down regulate it and there are like many</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.290" end="00:05:35.690" style="s2">of the smart drugs that increase focus</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.780" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">our attention also decrease empathy that</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.690" end="00:05:39.530" style="s2">would increase the capacity to do the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:42.650" style="s2">wrong things right so that would be</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.530" end="00:05:44.660" style="s2">exactly the wrong direction so looking</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.650" end="00:05:46.330" style="s2">at human physiology comprehensively and</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.660" end="00:05:49.310" style="s2">saying can we increase our ability for</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.330" end="00:05:50.900" style="s2">complex problem-solving right if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.310" end="00:05:52.580" style="s2">think about how do you solve the</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.900" end="00:05:54.410" style="s2">increasing radicalization between the</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.580" end="00:05:56.630" style="s2">left and the right you have to be able</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.410" end="00:05:58.430" style="s2">to hold multiple different perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.630" end="00:05:59.660" style="s2">that are very different simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.430" end="00:06:00.740" style="s2">to find solutions if you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.660" end="00:06:02.750" style="s2">enough working memory you just can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.740" end="00:06:04.970" style="s2">actually do that if you don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.750" end="00:06:06.920" style="s2">hardware substrate for complex thinking</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.970" end="00:06:09.590" style="s2">you can&#39;t do that we also have to have</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.920" end="00:06:11.240" style="s2">the emotional disposition to feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.590" end="00:06:12.890" style="s2">you can address very hard things so</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.240" end="00:06:15.620" style="s2">emotional resilience and drive and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.890" end="00:06:18.530" style="s2">motivation and empathy and those are not</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.620" end="00:06:20.630" style="s2">caused by chemistry they&#39;re influenced</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.530" end="00:06:23.060" style="s2">by it in a complex system like human</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.630" end="00:06:24.260" style="s2">physiology the concept of cause actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.060" end="00:06:26.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t make sense there are too many</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.260" end="00:06:29.270" style="s2">causal vectors interacting so we think</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.120" end="00:06:30.980" style="s2">about disposition and chemists neural</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.270" end="00:06:33.050" style="s2">chemistry creates different kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.980" end="00:06:35.150" style="s2">human dispositions so the whole reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.050" end="00:06:36.800" style="s2">that we created it was can we decrease</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.150" end="00:06:38.180" style="s2">individual human suffering and increase</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.800" end="00:06:40.850" style="s2">their subjective quality of life and</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.850" end="00:06:43.130" style="s2">ways that decrease suffering and</p>

<p begin="00:06:43.130" end="00:06:47.840" style="s2">everything else at the effect so it</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.230" end="00:06:49.430" style="s2">sounds like in your judgment at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.840" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">neuro a core collective</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.430" end="00:06:53.690" style="s2">changing the the physiology is one of</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.380" end="00:06:56.509" style="s2">the most important first steps for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.690" end="00:06:59.750" style="s2">solving the global challenges it is a</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.509" end="00:07:02.949" style="s2">necessary step yeah and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.750" end="00:07:05.210" style="s2">things you mentioned empathy has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.949" end="00:07:06.949" style="s2">you know one of the one the most</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.210" end="00:07:11.020" style="s2">important learning experiences for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.949" end="00:07:13.280" style="s2">has come from psychedelic compounds and</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.020" end="00:07:15.740" style="s2">somebody who I know has a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.280" end="00:07:18.470" style="s2">experience thorough experience with</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.740" end="00:07:23.870" style="s2">psychedelics is Mike can you tell me</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.470" end="00:07:26.080" style="s2">about some of the tell me about the the</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.870" end="00:07:29.150" style="s2">most profound experience that you&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.080" end="00:07:31.639" style="s2">with the psychedelics and specifically</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.150" end="00:07:34.190" style="s2">the empathy component because I I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.639" end="00:07:38.590" style="s2">that speaks to the the solving of global</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.190" end="00:07:41.380" style="s2">challenges yeah the the most profound</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.590" end="00:07:44.360" style="s2">that one&#39;s a hard one to put a finger on</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.380" end="00:07:49.070" style="s2">but I would say my first major</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.360" end="00:07:50.509" style="s2">psychedelic experience you know was was</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.070" end="00:07:55.190" style="s2">probably the most major paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.509" end="00:07:57.590" style="s2">that I that I had and empathy played a</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.190" end="00:08:00.289" style="s2">really big part or was a was a huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.590" end="00:08:06.229" style="s2">result of that first psychedelic journey</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.289" end="00:08:08.930" style="s2">and I I actually was the week prior had</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.229" end="00:08:12.020" style="s2">been attending a marketing conference so</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.930" end="00:08:14.659" style="s2">I think about psychedelics that I found</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.020" end="00:08:17.690" style="s2">is you have a seed what you want to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.659" end="00:08:19.789" style="s2">out of the experience beforehand and you</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.690" end="00:08:23.030" style="s2">can do that intentionally or it might</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.789" end="00:08:24.590" style="s2">get snuck in on you and so for me I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.030" end="00:08:27.889" style="s2">attending a marketing conference and we</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.590" end="00:08:30.400" style="s2">were I&#39;m good at business until I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.889" end="00:08:34.430" style="s2">doing this empathy exercise and then I</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.400" end="00:08:36.950" style="s2">couldn&#39;t do it for some reason I had</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.430" end="00:08:38.990" style="s2">this hit that I should eat mushrooms and</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.950" end="00:08:41.659" style="s2">I get home and I had never eaten</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.990" end="00:08:44.020" style="s2">mushrooms before but I knew that my</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.659" end="00:08:46.040" style="s2">little brother grew them and I always</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.020" end="00:08:49.730" style="s2">always thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.040" end="00:08:52.490" style="s2">oh my little brother he he&#39;s a hippie I</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.730" end="00:08:54.170" style="s2">used to make fun of him for doing it and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.490" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">then next thing I know I&#39;m asking him</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.170" end="00:09:01.040" style="s2">for some and I got lucky I I did it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:03.050" style="s2">right most people don&#39;t do it well the</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.040" end="00:09:03.440" style="s2">first time so I got lucky in a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.050" end="00:09:06.949" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.440" end="00:09:11.600" style="s2">you know and I had good intentions going</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.949" end="00:09:13.129" style="s2">in and I went to a dog park don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.600" end="00:09:19.569" style="s2">go to a dog park for your first time on</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.129" end="00:09:19.569" style="s2">mushrooms but I go to a dog park and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.579" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">I eat probably you know two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:26.870" style="s2">three grams of mushrooms and I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.459" style="s2">an incredible experience and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.870" end="00:09:31.220" style="s2">listening some music and I&#39;m looking at</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.459" end="00:09:33.529" style="s2">the sky the entire sky goes fractal and</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.220" end="00:09:35.870" style="s2">then it falls inside of my head and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.529" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">realized that everything that I&#39;m seeing</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.870" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">in the world is just simply my own</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.670" end="00:09:44.000" style="s2">personal view of the world and that was</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:46.699" style="s2">like mind blowing and then people start</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.000" end="00:09:47.870" style="s2">getting off work and it&#39;s great thing</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.699" end="00:09:49.240" style="s2">about being an entrepreneur is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.870" end="00:09:53.209" style="s2">meeting mushrooms on a Tuesday afternoon</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.240" end="00:09:55.459" style="s2">you know 3 o&#39;clock but other people are</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.209" end="00:09:57.769" style="s2">getting off work and they&#39;re bringing</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.459" end="00:09:59.089" style="s2">their dogs to the dog park and I see</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.769" end="00:10:00.920" style="s2">that they&#39;re not giving me their dogs</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.089" end="00:10:03.980" style="s2">the full attention they&#39;re on the phone</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.920" end="00:10:05.329" style="s2">and they&#39;re or they&#39;re texting and</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.980" end="00:10:08.120" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of giving their dog just</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.329" end="00:10:09.769" style="s2">like some attention but I can tell the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.120" end="00:10:11.480" style="s2">dog didn&#39;t pin up all day not getting</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.769" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">any attention it&#39;s freaking out I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.480" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">going hey pay attention your dogs people</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.540" end="00:10:20.000" style="s2">but it was then that I realized that I</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:22.100" style="s2">did the same thing to my dog when I</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.000" end="00:10:24.380" style="s2">bring my dog doc Park and then I do the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.100" end="00:10:27.350" style="s2">same thing to my wife and I do the same</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.380" end="00:10:29.689" style="s2">thing to my mom and my clients I realize</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.350" end="00:10:34.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t actually listen to anybody</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.689" end="00:10:40.069" style="s2">I&#39;m always just waiting to like impose</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.420" end="00:10:42.380" style="s2">myself on what&#39;s happening and that day</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.069" end="00:10:48.350" style="s2">was the first day I actually stopped and</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.380" end="00:10:51.350" style="s2">listened to people and I got home and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.350" end="00:10:53.990" style="s2">talked to my wife and she cried within</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.350" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">five minutes of seeing me because for</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.990" end="00:10:57.529" style="s2">the first time I was listening to her</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:11:00.949" style="s2">and we&#39;d been married for like four</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.529" end="00:11:02.990" style="s2">years at that point and it was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.949" end="00:11:05.300" style="s2">really incredible and I remember going</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.990" end="00:11:08.509" style="s2">to bed that night worried that it was</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.300" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">going to wear off that I was gonna wake</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.509" end="00:11:12.860" style="s2">up the next day and I wasn&#39;t gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:15.740" style="s2">the awareness I wasn&#39;t going to have the</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.860" end="00:11:17.000" style="s2">ability to to engage and listen and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.740" end="00:11:19.459" style="s2">really connect</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.000" end="00:11:24.189" style="s2">with other people I woke up the next day</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.459" end="00:11:27.860" style="s2">and I was fine I I it really stuck and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.189" end="00:11:29.990" style="s2">yeah that was you know that was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.860" end="00:11:32.360" style="s2">start you know and I say I&#39;m lucky</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.990" end="00:11:37.750" style="s2">because my first experience was so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.360" end="00:11:42.290" style="s2">positive and I did it I did it well and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.750" end="00:11:44.389" style="s2">I for whatever reason did a good job of</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.290" end="00:11:47.899" style="s2">integrating the experience into my daily</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.389" end="00:11:49.699" style="s2">life afterwards and after that I said to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.899" end="00:11:52.129" style="s2">myself man there&#39;s something really to</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.699" end="00:11:54.769" style="s2">this and began experimenting and trying</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.129" end="00:11:56.689" style="s2">to recreate that situation in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.769" end="00:12:00.019" style="s2">different ways for myself and for</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.689" end="00:12:02.750" style="s2">friends and I would say for for me and</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.019" end="00:12:07.790" style="s2">the people who I&#39;ve done things with</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.750" end="00:12:10.600" style="s2">it&#39;s been a real positive experience so</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.790" end="00:12:16.370" style="s2">with the with such a profound experience</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.600" end="00:12:19.810" style="s2">I think there&#39;s still plenty of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.370" end="00:12:23.460" style="s2">misconceptions around psychedelics</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.810" end="00:12:25.970" style="s2">Daniel how do</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.460" end="00:12:29.100" style="s2">- not only dispel the misconceptions</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.970" end="00:12:32.339" style="s2">about psychedelics but even just</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.100" end="00:12:35.550" style="s2">nootropics even using nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.339" end="00:12:40.500" style="s2">as kind of the stepping stone to</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.550" end="00:12:47.190" style="s2">improving people&#39;s feelings of safety</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.500" end="00:12:50.690" style="s2">with these kind of substances um one</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.190" end="00:12:52.950" style="s2">small distinction that&#39;s worth making is</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.690" end="00:12:54.029" style="s2">psychedelics and in pathogens have an</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.950" end="00:12:57.209" style="s2">overlap but they&#39;re not the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.029" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">and so there are psychedelics that</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.209" end="00:13:02.339" style="s2">commonly improve people&#39;s empathy some</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.200" style="s2">people can actually have a collapse of</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.339" end="00:13:07.529" style="s2">empathy on psychedelics because they d</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.200" end="00:13:09.000" style="s2">personalize and then they can&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.529" end="00:13:10.680" style="s2">don&#39;t even take themselves as real and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.000" end="00:13:11.970" style="s2">then nobody else is real and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.680" end="00:13:15.990" style="s2">everything&#39;s a video game right so they</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.970" end="00:13:18.540" style="s2">actually have to know how to integrate</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.990" end="00:13:20.220" style="s2">that and personalize it and then there</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.540" end="00:13:21.990" style="s2">are empathic genic chemicals that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.220" end="00:13:24.029" style="s2">very oriented towards increasing</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.990" end="00:13:27.690" style="s2">endogenous empathy process like oxytocin</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.029" end="00:13:31.140" style="s2">and vasopressin and then some of the</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.690" end="00:13:33.540" style="s2">phenyl acyl amines so MDMA classically</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.140" end="00:13:35.190" style="s2">and that sub psychedelic doses that</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.540" end="00:13:36.890" style="s2">really increase people&#39;s sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.190" end="00:13:39.510" style="s2">feeling and are connected with and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.890" end="00:13:42.060" style="s2">vicarious experience of other people so</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.510" end="00:13:44.310" style="s2">if people are wanting to explore empathy</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.060" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">it is a specific set of ways to go about</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.310" end="00:13:50.640" style="s2">doing it and then with any state</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.750" style="s2">altering thing the cognitive models</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.640" end="00:13:53.310" style="s2">through which you interpret the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.750" end="00:13:57.180" style="s2">experience and ZUP being the big thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.310" end="00:13:58.770" style="s2">right because if you have an experience</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.180" end="00:14:01.700" style="s2">where you kind of melt into everything</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.770" end="00:14:03.540" style="s2">right and then you come back and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.700" end="00:14:05.550" style="s2">interpretation is this is a video game</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.540" end="00:14:07.230" style="s2">projected by my mind we can actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.550" end="00:14:09.360" style="s2">damage empathy because nobody else is</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.230" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">real they&#39;re projections of your mind or</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.360" end="00:14:11.700" style="s2">if you say oh there&#39;s a field of energy</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:13.650" style="s2">that we&#39;re all interconnected</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.700" end="00:14:16.020" style="s2">expressions of you can have increased</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.650" end="00:14:17.100" style="s2">sense of empathy so working with making</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.020" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">sure you get the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.100" end="00:14:21.360" style="s2">interpretation of the experience right</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:23.520" style="s2">it&#39;s key that actually relates to the</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.360" end="00:14:25.140" style="s2">safety topic the safety is not just the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.520" end="00:14:27.480" style="s2">safety of the chemical it&#39;s the chemical</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.140" end="00:14:29.010" style="s2">and the dose it&#39;s done in and the purity</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.480" end="00:14:30.180" style="s2">of it and the set and setting and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.010" end="00:14:32.990" style="s2">model through which it&#39;s interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.180" end="00:14:35.750" style="s2">right it&#39;s like all of those things</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.990" end="00:14:37.710" style="s2">that&#39;s true for anything right like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.750" end="00:14:40.170" style="s2">said a minute</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.710" end="00:14:42.780" style="s2">small amounts when you have a fever can</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.170" end="00:14:45.810" style="s2">be useful and in large amounts can cause</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.780" end="00:14:49.740" style="s2">liver damage so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.810" end="00:14:52.950" style="s2">true across the board in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.740" end="00:14:55.290" style="s2">people&#39;s sense of safety I think like</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.950" end="00:14:57.960" style="s2">what maps is doing with actual clinical</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.290" end="00:15:01.170" style="s2">trials is super valuable we need a lot</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.960" end="00:15:03.030" style="s2">more clinical trials showing that Maps</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.170" end="00:15:05.100" style="s2">is the multidisciplinary Association for</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.030" end="00:15:06.440" style="s2">psychedelic science and they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.100" end="00:15:09.240" style="s2">that are doing mdma-assisted</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.440" end="00:15:13.190" style="s2">psychotherapy right now and curing PTSD</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.240" end="00:15:15.810" style="s2">and anxiety disorders</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.190" end="00:15:18.660" style="s2">so when psychedelic science first</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.810" end="00:15:23.190" style="s2">started in the 40s 50s and 60s it was a</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.660" end="00:15:25.820" style="s2">different time in the pharma company</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.190" end="00:15:28.800" style="s2">history and there was a pretty strong</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.820" end="00:15:31.350" style="s2">suppression of psychedelics being able</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.800" end="00:15:31.860" style="s2">to be utilized as pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.350" end="00:15:34.170" style="s2">medicines</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.860" end="00:15:35.910" style="s2">so like when Stan Grof was showing that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.170" end="00:15:37.710" style="s2">they could cure depression and radically</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.910" end="00:15:39.660" style="s2">faster with LSD psychedelic assisted</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.710" end="00:15:41.910" style="s2">psychotherapy in University of Budapest</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.660" end="00:15:43.890" style="s2">in the 40s just got completely shut down</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.910" end="00:15:46.740" style="s2">here and the research didn&#39;t get it</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.890" end="00:15:49.550" style="s2">happen and there there are different</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.740" end="00:15:56.280" style="s2">reasons but one of the big reasons is</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.550" end="00:15:59.490" style="s2">patentability so I think doing proper</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.280" end="00:16:02.370" style="s2">trials and is good but that&#39;s just going</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.490" end="00:16:04.200" style="s2">to be able to bring them into drugs for</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.370" end="00:16:05.720" style="s2">psychiatric purposes that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.200" end="00:16:08.610" style="s2">different than people&#39;s experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.720" end="00:16:11.970" style="s2">as far as just jurisprudence goes they</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.610" end="00:16:13.860" style="s2">should all be legal and all drugs even</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.970" end="00:16:17.070" style="s2">the really shitty ones should be legal</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.860" end="00:16:18.840" style="s2">and then effective methods of</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.070" end="00:16:20.910" style="s2">encouraging healthy choice should happen</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.840" end="00:16:22.860" style="s2">at the societal level right because</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.910" end="00:16:24.390" style="s2">making something illegal from what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.860" end="00:16:25.740" style="s2">have found and pretty much all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.390" end="00:16:27.480" style="s2">social science across all the countries</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.740" end="00:16:30.030" style="s2">doesn&#39;t decrease use it just increases</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.480" end="00:16:32.340" style="s2">risky black market Association impure</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.030" end="00:16:33.960" style="s2">stuff and for teenagers and people in</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.340" end="00:16:35.880" style="s2">rebellion that she increases the lure of</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.960" end="00:16:37.890" style="s2">the forbidden and so when you</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.880" end="00:16:39.990" style="s2">decriminalize like happen in Portugal in</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.890" end="00:16:43.380" style="s2">different places you actually get less</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.990" end="00:16:44.400" style="s2">death less addiction even for the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.380" end="00:16:45.930" style="s2">that we really don&#39;t want people using</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.400" end="00:16:47.430" style="s2">because they say before you like heroin</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.930" end="00:16:51.120" style="s2">I know in criminalize across the border</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.430" end="00:16:55.550" style="s2">and then increase education and</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.120" end="00:16:57.960" style="s2">and psychotherapy supported all things I</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.550" end="00:17:00.839" style="s2">think there&#39;s another another key thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.960" end="00:17:02.880" style="s2">is like most people weren&#39;t most people</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.839" end="00:17:04.860" style="s2">don&#39;t trip out of a Tylenol even though</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.880" end="00:17:07.680" style="s2">we have 18,000 deaths associated per</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.860" end="00:17:10.020" style="s2">year with Tylenol that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.680" end="00:17:12.000" style="s2">and the same is true with sugar even</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.020" end="00:17:13.980" style="s2">though sugar absolutely increases cancer</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.000" end="00:17:15.480" style="s2">Alzheimer&#39;s like many serious</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.980" end="00:17:18.449" style="s2">life-threatening diseases so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.480" end="00:17:20.309" style="s2">just like and then you look at TSA and</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.449" end="00:17:23.240" style="s2">all that goes into TSA for healthy</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.309" end="00:17:26.910" style="s2">people have ever died associated with</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.240" end="00:17:28.439" style="s2">plane crashes from terrorism and then</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.910" end="00:17:30.780" style="s2">you look at how many people die peanut</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.439" end="00:17:32.550" style="s2">allergies per year right which it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.780" end="00:17:36.000" style="s2">the tens of thousands and we just have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.550" end="00:17:38.220" style="s2">wrong way of way risk-benefit ratio and</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.000" end="00:17:40.110" style="s2">so part of Empowered responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.220" end="00:17:41.460" style="s2">that people just study on their own they</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.110" end="00:17:44.130" style="s2">don&#39;t just defer to an authority like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.460" end="00:17:45.900" style="s2">doctor they actually and they don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.130" end="00:17:47.850" style="s2">shitty study like they study well enough</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.900" end="00:17:50.160" style="s2">to actually understand cause and effect</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.850" end="00:17:54.809" style="s2">and consequence and then be able to make</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.160" end="00:17:58.830" style="s2">their own in our choices so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.809" end="00:18:00.870" style="s2">play devil&#39;s advocate here we want to</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.830" end="00:18:03.300" style="s2">improve our cognitive performance</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.870" end="00:18:09.870" style="s2">whether it be through just nootropics</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.300" end="00:18:12.929" style="s2">or pathogens like a telex so if we would</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.870" end="00:18:15.840" style="s2">benefit from being enhanced cognitively</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.929" end="00:18:22.679" style="s2">why haven&#39;t we evolved to be that way as</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.840" end="00:18:24.030" style="s2">of now one of the biggest questions in</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.679" end="00:18:26.580" style="s2">evolutionary biology is why we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.030" end="00:18:29.850" style="s2">these huge cortices mm-hmm like</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.580" end="00:18:33.480" style="s2">we have that&#39;s kind of the point is if</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.850" end="00:18:35.100" style="s2">you if you like think about LA when</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.480" end="00:18:37.860" style="s2">you&#39;re flying into LA and think about</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.100" end="00:18:39.510" style="s2">the what you see right the sprawl and so</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:41.160" style="s2">many miles as far as you can see if just</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.510" end="00:18:43.200" style="s2">orthogonal grid the humans have made and</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.160" end="00:18:44.700" style="s2">then realize that next to us the most</p>

<p begin="00:20:37.140" end="00:20:41.230" style="s2">seeing what chemicals are associated</p>

<p begin="00:20:43.000" end="00:20:47.800" style="s2">involved in that and look at how do we</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.920" end="00:20:49.480" style="s2">support and aid those so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.800" end="00:20:52.030" style="s2">interesting things is we are the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.480" end="00:20:54.070" style="s2">creature that can actually understand</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.030" end="00:20:55.630" style="s2">consciously all those dynamics and then</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.070" end="00:20:59.080" style="s2">consciously participate with them and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.630" end="00:21:02.010" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean hacking nature or</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.080" end="00:21:04.780" style="s2">being above nature it means that nature</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.010" end="00:21:06.070" style="s2">evolved increasing orderly complexity</p>

<p begin="00:21:07.630" end="00:21:14.620" style="s2">with it what I initially was alluding to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.130" end="00:21:16.390" style="s2">was maybe you&#39;re familiar with the paper</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.620" end="00:21:17.730" style="s2">by Nick Bostrom where he essentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.390" end="00:21:22.010" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.730" end="00:21:25.380" style="s2">you know if we have all these optimizers</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.010" end="00:21:28.770" style="s2">perhaps we shouldn&#39;t be that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.380" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">optimized and from what I&#39;m hearing it</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.770" end="00:21:32.940" style="s2">sounds like there&#39;s we still have you</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:36.030" style="s2">know plenty of opportunity especially in</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.940" end="00:21:38.220" style="s2">the realm of empathy well Nick&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.030" end="00:21:40.020" style="s2">statement is true and it&#39;s important and</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.220" end="00:21:42.240" style="s2">it&#39;s related to Tim&#39;s statement of no</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.020" end="00:21:44.730" style="s2">biologic free lunch and it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.240" end="00:21:49.590" style="s2">related the concept of optimization so</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.730" end="00:21:51.690" style="s2">if if I take adderall which is going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.590" end="00:21:53.790" style="s2">increase dopamine it is a presynaptic</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.690" end="00:21:55.950" style="s2">dopamine agonist that&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.790" end="00:21:57.420" style="s2">increase focus and attention right focus</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.950" end="00:22:03.200" style="s2">and concentration in particular and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.420" end="00:22:05.640" style="s2">motivation now I am increasing my</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.200" end="00:22:07.230" style="s2">neurologic orientation towards focus and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.640" end="00:22:09.480" style="s2">concentration but I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.230" end="00:22:12.210" style="s2">decreasing my body&#39;s ability to produce</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.480" end="00:22:14.250" style="s2">its own dopamine if I do that ongoingly</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.210" end="00:22:16.110" style="s2">I&#39;m decreasing the sensitivity of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.250" end="00:22:18.210" style="s2">dopamine receptors and since I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.110" end="00:22:20.160" style="s2">flooding so much dopamine into those</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.210" end="00:22:21.510" style="s2">receptors I&#39;m also decreasing activity</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.160" end="00:22:23.370" style="s2">in the synapse of a whole bunch of other</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.510" end="00:22:25.200" style="s2">chemicals including things like</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.370" end="00:22:27.960" style="s2">acetylcholine that are mediating memory</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.200" end="00:22:29.850" style="s2">right so I&#39;m optimizing for one thing at</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.960" end="00:22:32.490" style="s2">the expense of another in a zero-sum</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.850" end="00:22:35.240" style="s2">fashion but notice that dopamine is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.490" end="00:22:38.010" style="s2">single molecule focused on egg</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.240" end="00:22:41.880" style="s2">externally exogenously overriding a</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.010" end="00:22:44.130" style="s2">single pathway as opposed to how do we</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.880" end="00:22:45.990" style="s2">actually increase the efficiency and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.130" end="00:22:48.000" style="s2">effectiveness of the entire system so</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.990" end="00:22:50.760" style="s2">that it&#39;s more adaptive across the scope</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.000" end="00:22:52.440" style="s2">of everything that it does and so if you</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.760" end="00:22:54.360" style="s2">think about someone who is very out of</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.440" end="00:22:57.240" style="s2">shape and then they start exercising and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.360" end="00:22:59.670" style="s2">they do CrossFit they lose weight they</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.240" end="00:23:01.560" style="s2">get fit they can actually have their</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.670" end="00:23:03.120" style="s2">just a more adaptive being across the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.560" end="00:23:04.710" style="s2">scope of everything right now if they</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.120" end="00:23:06.810" style="s2">start going too heavily into heavy</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.710" end="00:23:08.160" style="s2">weights and they lose flexibility now</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.810" end="00:23:08.910" style="s2">they&#39;re optimizing one thing at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.160" end="00:23:10.830" style="s2">expense of another</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.910" end="00:23:13.680" style="s2">that&#39;s why cross-leg kind of got popular</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.830" end="00:23:15.270" style="s2">and the idea of generalized increase of</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.680" end="00:23:18.060" style="s2">the capacity of the whole system for all</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.270" end="00:23:20.340" style="s2">functions you can think of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.060" end="00:23:22.080" style="s2">biochemically as well if we increase the</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.340" end="00:23:25.140" style="s2">efficiency of cellular metabolism and</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:27.420" style="s2">cellular process if we increase the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.140" end="00:23:28.800" style="s2">die-off of old cells at AA the G and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.420" end="00:23:30.900" style="s2">production of new neural stem cells</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.800" end="00:23:33.720" style="s2">that&#39;s basically just a healthier</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.900" end="00:23:36.780" style="s2">system so if we think of optimizing in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.720" end="00:23:38.160" style="s2">zero-sum way where we&#39;re over earring</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.780" end="00:23:39.810" style="s2">the system towards one thing at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.160" end="00:23:43.200" style="s2">expense of others that&#39;s a problem and</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.810" end="00:23:44.670" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty much almost all drugs</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.200" end="00:23:47.100" style="s2">which is why you would want to use them</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.670" end="00:23:49.440" style="s2">not that often right and not that often</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.100" end="00:23:52.070" style="s2">is fun but if you think about how do we</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.440" end="00:23:54.060" style="s2">increase system health and resilience</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.070" end="00:23:56.490" style="s2">physiologically and neural</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.060" end="00:23:58.350" style="s2">then you can get nonzero-sum and so then</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.490" end="00:24:01.080" style="s2">you&#39;re you can increase the adaptive</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.350" end="00:24:04.500" style="s2">capacity to go from like classic example</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.080" end="00:24:06.390" style="s2">is when I want focus I want the ability</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.500" end="00:24:09.030" style="s2">to hold attention on something and not</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.390" end="00:24:11.340" style="s2">get distracted but task switching is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.030" end="00:24:13.110" style="s2">ability to fluidly move between tasks as</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.340" end="00:24:15.900" style="s2">I need you to be adaptive most things</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.110" end="00:24:18.750" style="s2">will give you one or the other but my</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.900" end="00:24:21.360" style="s2">own ideal flow state would be that I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.750" end="00:24:23.430" style="s2">focus intensely and ignore things that</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.360" end="00:24:25.230" style="s2">are noise but also be able to still</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.430" end="00:24:28.080" style="s2">discern is it noise or is it not noise</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.230" end="00:24:31.080" style="s2">and then be able to tasks switch fluidly</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.080" end="00:24:32.580" style="s2">and so given that those are operating</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.080" end="00:24:36.420" style="s2">through totally different circuits in</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.580" end="00:24:38.610" style="s2">the brain if you would want to be you</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.420" end="00:24:40.500" style="s2">would want to be optimizing for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.610" end="00:24:43.590" style="s2">overall capacity of the system to move</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.500" end="00:24:46.740" style="s2">between those kinds of states how would</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.590" end="00:24:49.190" style="s2">you for a beginner who&#39;s just introduced</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.740" end="00:24:52.770" style="s2">to new topics how would you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.190" end="00:24:55.320" style="s2">somebody understand especially those two</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.770" end="00:24:56.400" style="s2">different you know switching states of</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.320" end="00:24:58.350" style="s2">the brain how would you recommend</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.400" end="00:25:01.170" style="s2">because I mean many people just believe</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.350" end="00:25:06.990" style="s2">that one thing one drug consistently is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.170" end="00:25:09.420" style="s2">the solution how would I recommend that</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.990" end="00:25:12.270" style="s2">they they what are the kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.420" end="00:25:14.580" style="s2">beginning steps of understanding these</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.270" end="00:25:16.560" style="s2">two different processes that you explain</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.580" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">one thing focus and concentration the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.560" end="00:25:24.330" style="s2">other being kind of being able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:30.930" style="s2">discern you know various tasks those</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.330" end="00:25:32.490" style="s2">terms I&#39;m not exactly sure had an answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.930" end="00:25:34.350" style="s2">I mean if you want to think about task</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.490" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">switching there are a number of networks</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.350" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">in the brain that are involved in task</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:39.090" style="s2">switching there&#39;s a number of things</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:41.400" style="s2">from a computational point of view like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.090" end="00:25:42.690" style="s2">which brain frequencies you&#39;re in and</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.400" end="00:25:44.149" style="s2">from a neurochemical point of view that</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.690" end="00:25:47.419" style="s2">are in</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.149" end="00:25:49.700" style="s2">and they quote all those same things of</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.419" end="00:25:51.470" style="s2">course that we can identify with focus</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.700" end="00:25:53.769" style="s2">and concentration but that&#39;s just one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.470" end="00:25:56.419" style="s2">the dialectics right there&#39;s many like</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.769" end="00:25:58.309" style="s2">but we want to be able to learn new</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.419" end="00:26:01.490" style="s2">things we also want to be able to forget</p>

<p begin="00:26:01.490" end="00:26:07.399" style="s2">actually kind of selective loss of</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.389" end="00:26:08.990" style="s2">Association so when you sleep at night</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.399" end="00:26:11.389" style="s2">one of the things that happens is your</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.990" end="00:26:13.100" style="s2">astrocytes or microglia to go in and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.389" end="00:26:15.110" style="s2">cleave old synapses that are no longer</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.100" end="00:26:16.940" style="s2">useful so that you don&#39;t have these</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.149" end="00:26:23.990" style="s2">but it&#39;s also super critical so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.340" end="00:26:26.419" style="s2">like do we want to build new synapses to</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.580" end="00:26:51.230" style="s2">ability to be outside of ourselves like</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.649" end="00:26:53.659" style="s2">Jamie wheel was talking about and have a</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.230" end="00:26:55.549" style="s2">sense of no self just being flow and our</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.659" end="00:26:58.669" style="s2">ability to be very self-reflective and</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.549" end="00:27:00.320" style="s2">with a more functional sense of self so</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.669" end="00:27:02.120" style="s2">what I would say is whatever you think</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.320" end="00:27:03.590" style="s2">is the thing top demise fine with the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.120" end="00:27:05.899" style="s2">opposite thing of that that also seems</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.590" end="00:27:07.250" style="s2">meaningful is and make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.899" end="00:27:10.600" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re doing is actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.250" end="00:27:14.360" style="s2">addressing both sides of that dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.600" end="00:27:17.929" style="s2">so speaking of healing I want to come</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:21.940" style="s2">back to you Mike and I want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.929" end="00:27:25.059" style="s2">about ayahuasca which has definitely</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.940" end="00:27:29.840" style="s2">entered the mainstream consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.059" end="00:27:32.659" style="s2">lately and you&#39;ve been somewhat of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.840" end="00:27:35.299" style="s2">proponent of using it can you speak to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.659" end="00:27:37.760" style="s2">your experience with ayahuasca maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.299" end="00:27:42.889" style="s2">some of the pitfalls that are the</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.760" end="00:27:47.049" style="s2">following people today yeah and into</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.889" end="00:27:49.070" style="s2">what Daniel was saying a lot of its</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.049" end="00:27:50.929" style="s2">forgetting no maybe not forgetting but</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.070" end="00:27:52.429" style="s2">having a different association with</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.929" end="00:27:55.940" style="s2">something that happened in the past and</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.429" end="00:27:56.780" style="s2">so a lot of a lot of my psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.940" end="00:27:59.690" style="s2">experiences</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.780" end="00:28:02.030" style="s2">me is just that and especially I think</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.690" end="00:28:05.180" style="s2">ayahuasca is especially good at that</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.030" end="00:28:07.070" style="s2">which is helping you go back to the past</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.180" end="00:28:10.040" style="s2">see a situation from a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.070" end="00:28:15.100" style="s2">perspective and have a different</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.040" end="00:28:22.100" style="s2">association with it for me there was I</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.100" end="00:28:23.720" style="s2">was I went to do ayahuasca to optimize</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.100" end="00:28:25.490" style="s2">you know someone asked me before I was</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.720" end="00:28:27.980" style="s2">going to Peru oh you&#39;re gonna go to I</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.490" end="00:28:31.550" style="s2">was like I don&#39;t know you know it seems</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.980" end="00:28:35.090" style="s2">like I mean honestly I went down to Peru</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.550" end="00:28:36.850" style="s2">because I wanted to get there before</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.090" end="00:28:40.070" style="s2">everyone else did</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.850" end="00:28:41.630" style="s2">so uh this is getting popular you know I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.070" end="00:28:46.010" style="s2">want to go before it becomes too</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.630" end="00:28:48.080" style="s2">touristy and and I want like the the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.010" end="00:28:52.550" style="s2">gold-standard experience and I</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.080" end="00:28:55.910" style="s2">definitely got that and you know in my</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.550" end="00:28:59.150" style="s2">my first experience I went back and</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.910" end="00:29:00.650" style="s2">really got to look at my childhood which</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.150" end="00:29:02.690" style="s2">most people don&#39;t take the time to</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.650" end="00:29:05.720" style="s2">reflect on what happened to them as a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.690" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">child and how that might impact who they</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.720" end="00:29:13.100" style="s2">are today and you know I spent an entire</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:16.840" style="s2">night in really deep reflection and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.100" end="00:29:21.250" style="s2">was a really painful agonizing process</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.840" end="00:29:26.030" style="s2">it was I purged over a dozen times</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.250" end="00:29:29.480" style="s2">throwing up and it was it was really</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.030" end="00:29:30.920" style="s2">terrifying in nature really and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.480" end="00:29:32.510" style="s2">done a lot of things that people would</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.920" end="00:29:36.980" style="s2">consider terrifying in my life and</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.510" end="00:29:39.710" style="s2">that&#39;s definitely a top five probably</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.980" end="00:29:43.250" style="s2">number one yeah be completely honest</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.710" end="00:29:47.480" style="s2">because there is this you have to go</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.250" end="00:29:49.640" style="s2">through a death and rebirth that to know</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.480" end="00:29:51.890" style="s2">if you have to but my experience was</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.640" end="00:29:55.310" style="s2">going through a death and rebirth with</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.890" end="00:29:57.560" style="s2">ayahuasca and every time I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.310" end="00:30:01.340" style="s2">ayahuasca there&#39;s been a complete</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.560" end="00:30:04.460" style="s2">letting go of who I thought I was going</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.340" end="00:30:07.400" style="s2">into nothingness reintegrating and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.460" end="00:30:10.010" style="s2">really feels like a defrag you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.400" end="00:30:10.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all your memories spread out</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.010" end="00:30:12.810" style="s2">over your heart</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.680" end="00:30:14.970" style="s2">drive and every time you&#39;re trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.810" end="00:30:18.150" style="s2">something you&#39;re tripping over you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.970" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">these memories and what I like to really</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.150" end="00:30:24.060" style="s2">think about what it does is helps you</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:25.980" style="s2">see all the memories put them in a nice</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.060" end="00:30:28.770" style="s2">orderly fashion and then that way you</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.980" end="00:30:30.510" style="s2">can like step on top of them and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.770" end="00:30:32.310" style="s2">creates a really nice solid foundation</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.510" end="00:30:34.470" style="s2">for you to move forward instead of it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.310" end="00:30:39.150" style="s2">being in your way and in the way of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.470" end="00:30:41.040" style="s2">path and creating barriers but yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.150" end="00:30:43.800" style="s2">think ayahuasca super helpful I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.040" end="00:30:46.530" style="s2">most I&#39;m not sure everybody is supposed</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.800" end="00:30:50.690" style="s2">to do it you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.530" end="00:30:53.670" style="s2">adventurous thing to take on and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.690" end="00:30:55.830" style="s2">you know I would say the the year year</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.670" end="00:30:57.990" style="s2">and a half after I get it I did feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.830" end="00:31:00.440" style="s2">like everybody should do it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.990" end="00:31:03.600" style="s2">anyone who has a huge life-changing</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.440" end="00:31:05.670" style="s2">experience can get excited about that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.600" end="00:31:07.290" style="s2">and that that&#39;s just in line with my</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.670" end="00:31:08.370" style="s2">personality that&#39;s who I am I discover</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.290" end="00:31:10.200" style="s2">things and I like to tell everybody</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.370" end="00:31:12.960" style="s2">about it like how you should do this too</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.200" end="00:31:14.130" style="s2">and I&#39;m now live long enough to know</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.960" end="00:31:18.900" style="s2">that not everybody should do everything</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.130" end="00:31:20.340" style="s2">but it&#39;s I think for I think of enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.900" end="00:31:24.300" style="s2">people where to do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.340" end="00:31:28.730" style="s2">the there&#39;d be enough healing and enough</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.300" end="00:31:32.070" style="s2">people walking around holding that that</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.730" end="00:31:35.550" style="s2">improved perspective that would you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.070" end="00:31:38.940" style="s2">raise the global consciousness so I saw</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.550" end="00:31:44.730" style="s2">you shaking your head there can you</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.940" end="00:31:49.010" style="s2">elaborate on a maybe who might consider</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.730" end="00:31:52.380" style="s2">not doing it and then for someone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.010" end="00:31:53.910" style="s2">curious what kind of process they can go</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.380" end="00:31:58.860" style="s2">through to determine if it&#39;s right for</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.910" end="00:32:00.510" style="s2">them sure ayahuasca specifically yes but</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.860" end="00:32:04.980" style="s2">you can elaborate on others as well as</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.510" end="00:32:07.410" style="s2">you see that yeah outside outside of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.980" end="00:32:10.710" style="s2">like water there&#39;s not that many things</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.410" end="00:32:14.340" style="s2">that are right for everybody if you even</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.710" end="00:32:16.410" style="s2">just think about diet and something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.340" end="00:32:18.240" style="s2">lectin sensitivity right how many people</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.410" end="00:32:19.620" style="s2">do really and on a whole plant diet</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.240" end="00:32:21.270" style="s2">versus how many people and it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.620" end="00:32:23.820" style="s2">anti-inflammatory thing and other people</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.270" end="00:32:24.509" style="s2">have a specific type of sensitivity and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.820" end="00:32:26.879" style="s2">they get inflamed on</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.509" end="00:32:28.829" style="s2">plans and that&#39;s true for pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.879" end="00:32:31.259" style="s2">any diet that you can think of any food</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.829" end="00:32:34.289" style="s2">type and it&#39;s the same for most types of</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.259" end="00:32:35.609" style="s2">chemistry so you know if you if you go</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.289" end="00:32:37.379" style="s2">to our website and look at quality it</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.609" end="00:32:40.529" style="s2">says do not take if you have and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.379" end="00:32:43.259" style="s2">a bunch of things where it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.529" end="00:32:45.899" style="s2">recommended for everybody now as you get</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.259" end="00:32:47.999" style="s2">into more and more potent things those</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.899" end="00:32:50.009" style="s2">not recommended for get more important</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.999" end="00:32:57.199" style="s2">and ayahuasca is about as potent as you</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.009" end="00:33:01.379" style="s2">can get so a few things if people have</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.199" end="00:33:03.299" style="s2">anxiety issues they&#39;re dealing with if</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.379" end="00:33:06.389" style="s2">they have PTSD that they&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.299" end="00:33:09.359" style="s2">if they have any schizophrenic kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.389" end="00:33:13.919" style="s2">tendencies I don&#39;t recommend doing it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.359" end="00:33:15.659" style="s2">without psychiatrist supervision there</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.919" end="00:33:17.759" style="s2">are some psychiatrists psychologists</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.659" end="00:33:20.419" style="s2">that are well trained in both the kind</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.759" end="00:33:23.219" style="s2">of ancient traditions the</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.419" end="00:33:26.759" style="s2">psychopharmacology of it and also how to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.219" end="00:33:28.979" style="s2">do the right therapy DEQ&#39;s with it but</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.759" end="00:33:31.229" style="s2">across the board without that I just</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.979" end="00:33:32.639" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t recommend because it&#39;s those</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.229" end="00:33:35.369" style="s2">are the conditions that make it too easy</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.639" end="00:33:37.769" style="s2">to go into terror or existential breaks</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.369" end="00:33:39.869" style="s2">now you can actually help heal some of</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.769" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">those benefits of those conditions done</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.869" end="00:33:43.109" style="s2">rightly with the right psychedelics but</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:44.969" style="s2">it&#39;s much more sensitive scenario</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.109" end="00:33:48.209" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot the risk is higher so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.969" end="00:33:49.889" style="s2">needs to be handled more carefully you</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.209" end="00:33:51.419" style="s2">know you&#39;ve also got that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.889" end="00:33:54.509" style="s2">ingredients in ayahuasca is an MAO B</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.419" end="00:33:57.029" style="s2">inhibitor and mao-b inhibitors are great</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.509" end="00:34:00.019" style="s2">for a lot of people the mao-b levels</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.029" end="00:34:02.069" style="s2">raise with age across the board so</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.019" end="00:34:04.129" style="s2">pharmaceutical mao-b inhibitors like</p>

<p begin="00:34:04.129" end="00:34:08.669" style="s2">anti-aging and some of the best state</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.509" end="00:34:11.099" style="s2">anti-aging drugs but for people who have</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.669" end="00:34:12.509" style="s2">already low mao-b levels genetically</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.099" end="00:34:16.559" style="s2">which is chunk of the population has</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.509" end="00:34:18.690" style="s2">they&#39;ll have a pretty bad experience so</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.559" end="00:34:20.609" style="s2">the main thing I would say is find</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.690" end="00:34:23.789" style="s2">someone to do it with it&#39;s very well</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.609" end="00:34:29.339" style="s2">trained and they should ask you all</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.789" end="00:34:30.839" style="s2">these questions so one question that you</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.339" end="00:34:33.210" style="s2">touched on in the documentary that I</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.839" end="00:34:35.160" style="s2">want to come back to for elaboration is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.210" end="00:34:38.070" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.160" end="00:34:40.590" style="s2">fear associated with taking many of</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.070" end="00:34:44.730" style="s2">these nootropic supplements when there</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.590" end="00:34:46.220" style="s2">isn&#39;t direct research or data because</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.730" end="00:34:48.690" style="s2">we&#39;ve kind of are in a different</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.220" end="00:34:52.350" style="s2">paradigm as far as funding research is</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.690" end="00:34:55.410" style="s2">concerned how do we or have an intro fix</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.350" end="00:35:03.870" style="s2">users feel safe in using these</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.410" end="00:35:09.300" style="s2">substances over the long term it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.870" end="00:35:11.580" style="s2">actually a very nuanced question in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.300" end="00:35:14.520" style="s2">disease State when we&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.580" end="00:35:16.140" style="s2">drugs to cure disease there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.520" end="00:35:19.080" style="s2">consequence of not carrying the disease</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.140" end="00:35:21.120" style="s2">right which is the ongoing pathology of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.080" end="00:35:23.610" style="s2">the disease so there&#39;s a higher risk</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.120" end="00:35:24.960" style="s2">tolerance based on how severe the</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.610" end="00:35:26.130" style="s2">disease is so if we were willing to take</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.960" end="00:35:27.750" style="s2">pretty high risk tolerance for in</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.130" end="00:35:30.150" style="s2">terminal cancer right for what the drug</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.750" end="00:35:32.130" style="s2">might do one of the issues with</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.150" end="00:35:34.500" style="s2">optimization like life extension</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.130" end="00:35:37.710" style="s2">therapies and increase capacity</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.500" end="00:35:40.740" style="s2">therapies is you&#39;re treating well people</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.710" end="00:35:44.100" style="s2">and so how much risk tolerance are you</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.740" end="00:35:46.740" style="s2">willing to have for no disease right</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.100" end="00:35:51.380" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a real and nuanced and</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.740" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">important issue and so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.380" end="00:35:56.130" style="s2">another thing is that when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.520" end="00:35:58.320" style="s2">about how well-known inotropic is this</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.130" end="00:36:01.260" style="s2">again comes to which know tropics and</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.320" end="00:36:02.520" style="s2">how much steady someone does so for</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.260" end="00:36:04.140" style="s2">instance checks you mentioned central</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.520" end="00:36:06.090" style="s2">Phenix seen in their centers actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.140" end="00:36:09.720" style="s2">not a new drug that was developed in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.090" end="00:36:11.670" style="s2">50s and we did a meta-analysis on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.720" end="00:36:14.910" style="s2">we did a structured literature review</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.670" end="00:36:16.800" style="s2">there 186 scientific studies published</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.910" end="00:36:19.470" style="s2">in countries all around the world we</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.800" end="00:36:21.420" style="s2">went and back and found before internet</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.470" end="00:36:23.100" style="s2">when they were still just in libraries</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.420" end="00:36:24.720" style="s2">somewhere in Russian or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.100" end="00:36:26.190" style="s2">language translated them because one of</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.720" end="00:36:28.680" style="s2">the thorough meta-analysis including the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.190" end="00:36:30.870" style="s2">animal trials in human trials and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.680" end="00:36:34.500" style="s2">would say that the safety data on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.870" end="00:36:36.120" style="s2">is extremely clear right it&#39;s it if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.500" end="00:36:37.860" style="s2">actually do a proper structured review</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.120" end="00:36:39.780" style="s2">there are people who misunderstand it</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.860" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">because they didn&#39;t do that well but the</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.780" end="00:36:42.570" style="s2">safety data is actually quite clear it</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:44.610" style="s2">went through the process of becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.570" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">prescription drug during the whole time</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.610" end="00:36:48.900" style="s2">it was a prescription drug it had you</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:52.530" style="s2">know very serious regulatory process</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.900" end="00:36:56.340" style="s2">that went through whereas say if we look</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.530" end="00:36:57.840" style="s2">at soon if Ram it&#39;s been out almost no</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.340" end="00:36:59.550" style="s2">period of time it&#39;s been a couple years</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.840" end="00:37:01.050" style="s2">not that many people have used it we</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.550" end="00:37:04.170" style="s2">have no long-term effects we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.050" end="00:37:05.910" style="s2">done animal trials I I have a very</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.170" end="00:37:07.650" style="s2">different risk tolerance now at least</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.910" end="00:37:10.080" style="s2">with soon if Ram the mechanism that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.650" end="00:37:12.420" style="s2">acting on our mechanisms we know pretty</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.080" end="00:37:16.620" style="s2">well for other things then you take</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.420" end="00:37:17.850" style="s2">something like p21 where it&#39;s operating</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.620" end="00:37:19.530" style="s2">through mechanisms we don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.850" end="00:37:21.780" style="s2">that all and it hasn&#39;t been tested that</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.530" end="00:37:24.300" style="s2">much or SR 9009 I don&#39;t think people</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.780" end="00:37:26.940" style="s2">should be taking those like now that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.300" end="00:37:28.530" style="s2">said there are people who will take them</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.940" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">anyways just like all the early steroid</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.530" end="00:37:33.660" style="s2">users and it&#39;s an interesting thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:36.030" style="s2">because ethically scientists could never</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.660" end="00:37:37.430" style="s2">put people on those things before they</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.030" end="00:37:40.410" style="s2">had done the animal trials and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.430" end="00:37:42.090" style="s2">but the knowledge of endocrinology got</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.410" end="00:37:44.430" style="s2">radically advanced by the steroid users</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.090" end="00:37:46.890" style="s2">because they and some of them like</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.430" end="00:37:48.900" style="s2"> themselves up and method life</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.890" end="00:37:50.370" style="s2">abut we&#39;ve got human data because they</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.900" end="00:37:53.790" style="s2">chose to do it anyways and recorded the</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.370" end="00:37:57.930" style="s2">the info I would say the kind of elite</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.790" end="00:37:59.970" style="s2">athletes hackers have always been who</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.930" end="00:38:01.440" style="s2">who are fast adopters now a high risk</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.970" end="00:38:03.750" style="s2">tolerance have always kind of done that</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.440" end="00:38:05.370" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to encourage that but I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.750" end="00:38:08.310" style="s2">definitely factor the evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.370" end="00:38:10.350" style="s2">comes out of it in further development</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.310" end="00:38:13.650" style="s2">so you know what is right in uh tropics</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.350" end="00:38:15.240" style="s2">use it&#39;s neither like the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.650" end="00:38:17.100" style="s2">stance someone should take is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.240" end="00:38:19.020" style="s2">tremendous amount of respect for how</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.100" end="00:38:23.220" style="s2">complex the regulatory process of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.020" end="00:38:25.440" style="s2">is and but not come at it with fear or</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.220" end="00:38:30.540" style="s2">foolishness right they come at it with</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.440" end="00:38:31.620" style="s2">just appropriate reasonable study and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.540" end="00:38:33.570" style="s2">do think there are categories of</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.620" end="00:38:35.640" style="s2">nootropics that are extremely safe</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.570" end="00:38:37.560" style="s2">benign and well researched and other</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.640" end="00:38:41.250" style="s2">ones that are extremely exciting and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.560" end="00:38:45.780" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t put them in those people yet so</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.250" end="00:38:48.660" style="s2">I want to open it up for any questions</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.780" end="00:38:49.980" style="s2">again before we wrap up if anybody has</p>
