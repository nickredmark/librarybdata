<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:16.800" style="s2">that i think illustrates the point that</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:20.080" style="s2">we are at now</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.800" end="00:02:23.599" style="s2">better than any other and that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:26.720" style="s2">the pre-islamic world</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.599" end="00:02:30.000" style="s2">now before muhammad</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.720" end="00:02:31.519" style="s2">was visited by gabriel the mecca which</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.000" end="00:02:34.400" style="s2">is the big black cube</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.519" end="00:02:36.800" style="s2">that i&#39;m sure everybody has seen before</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.400" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">muhammad there were thousands</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.800" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">of gods that were worshiped at mecca</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">thousands of tiny little idols</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:48.239" style="s2">and each one you know merchants had</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">their own little god</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.239" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">that they worshipped each worshipped at</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:55.280" style="s2">their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">tiny gods some even just gin spirits</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.280" end="00:03:00.720" style="s2">there is no unifying</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.840" style="s2">force there is no unifying belief there</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.720" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">is just countless</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.840" end="00:03:06.640" style="s2">individual uh spirits vying for</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.640" end="00:03:13.840" style="s2">in this uh very diverse culture</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">it&#39;s a culture of merchants and so</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.840" end="00:03:18.319" style="s2">muhammad is himself a merchant after</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">being visited by gabriel</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.319" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">he you know realizes the message</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:26.000" style="s2">of allah the one true god goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.400" style="s2">mecca and destroys</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.000" end="00:03:29.760" style="s2">all of the idols and establishes just</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.400" end="00:03:32.720" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.760" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">this is where we&#39;re at we have in we</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.720" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">have the almost the reverse</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:38.959" style="s2">where we went from many being funneled</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">into one</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.959" end="00:03:44.879" style="s2">meme in the wake of the death of god</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:47.920" style="s2">in the nietzschean sense we have been</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.879" end="00:03:51.360" style="s2">left with many tiny little pieces</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">attempting to assert themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.360" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">as a symbolic language christianity over</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:58.879" style="s2">the past 2000 years</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:03:59.840" style="s2">served as the ultimate symbolic form</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.879" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">which is why</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.840" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">if you read literature it is filled with</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">illusions in reference to christianity</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">because that is the shared symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:11.519" style="s2">language so</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:12.879" style="s2">in christianity&#39;s absence in god&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.519" end="00:04:16.000" style="s2">absence</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.879" end="00:04:18.880" style="s2">we have innumerable attempts at</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.000" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">a unified symbolic language and memes</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.880" end="00:04:24.000" style="s2">represent</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.519" end="00:04:25.520" style="s2">these attempts so what is a meme</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.000" end="00:04:26.880" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s a word that has very</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.520" end="00:04:29.280" style="s2">definitely been maligned it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.880" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">thought of as a silly internet joke</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.280" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">but it is certainly more than that um</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">memes</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:37.199" style="s2">to me are archetypes and symbols in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.759" style="s2">jungian sense</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.199" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">which is to say that they are vessels</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.759" end="00:04:44.960" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:47.360" style="s2">archaic energies psychic energy</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.960" end="00:04:49.280" style="s2">and through making you know through the</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.360" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">vessel being</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.280" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">unassailable to reason that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.759" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">they&#39;re funny</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:56.720" style="s2">if we could think about them they</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:59.520" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be funny just like if you could</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.720" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">clearly see any given symbol it would</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.520" end="00:05:04.639" style="s2">lose its efficacy</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.600" end="00:05:06.400" style="s2">so memes are archetypal symbols and</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.639" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">something that young talked about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.400" end="00:05:11.600" style="s2">is not recognized often</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:12.880" style="s2">is that archetypes are not stagnant</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.600" end="00:05:14.960" style="s2">you hear a lot of people talk about</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.880" end="00:05:16.560" style="s2">archetypes and if even</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.960" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">even teachers teaching about archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.560" end="00:05:20.720" style="s2">they say kind of like they&#39;re stock</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:23.280" style="s2">characters like they&#39;re the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.720" end="00:05:26.960" style="s2">forever they&#39;ve been the same thing from</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.280" end="00:05:30.240" style="s2">you know 2000 to 240</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.960" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">to 2020 and it&#39;s not true if you read</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.240" end="00:05:36.240" style="s2">young you see that they have transformed</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">every generation to make themselves</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.240" end="00:05:42.000" style="s2">as efficient as possible the vessel</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:43.840" style="s2">is changing but the energy is the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.000" end="00:05:46.960" style="s2">it&#39;s an archetypal energy that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.840" end="00:05:49.199" style="s2">expresses itself through forms</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.960" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">and while one might be tempted to say in</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.199" end="00:05:52.560" style="s2">this age of reason that we live that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:54.639" style="s2">we&#39;ve gotten rid of all</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.560" end="00:05:56.240" style="s2">of our little beliefs and all of our</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.639" end="00:05:58.400" style="s2">symbols we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.240" end="00:06:00.000" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone into hiding in the form of</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.199" end="00:06:09.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a really wonderful story about a</p>

<p begin="00:06:09.199" end="00:06:17.360" style="s2">a a man goes to visit his rabbi and says</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:20.400" style="s2">in the past so many men</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.360" end="00:06:24.160" style="s2">spoke to god so many men saw</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.400" end="00:06:27.199" style="s2">god nowadays nobody does</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.160" end="00:06:29.759" style="s2">why is that and the rabbi says today</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.199" end="00:06:33.280" style="s2">nobody bows low enough</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.759" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">so to try and gain insight into the</p>

<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:45.039" style="s2">a great</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.880" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">sewer of information and i&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.039" end="00:06:49.840" style="s2">make sense of it i&#39;m trying to see the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:54.000" style="s2">meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.840" end="00:06:56.000" style="s2">in all of these expressions so</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.000" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">beyond just being an archetypal symbol</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.000" end="00:07:03.120" style="s2">because what does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:04.639" style="s2">we have to look at the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.120" end="00:07:06.720" style="s2">we have a lot of information in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.639" end="00:07:08.880" style="s2">world you have a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.720" end="00:07:10.880" style="s2">just like we have a lot of idols and we</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.880" end="00:07:14.400" style="s2">compress them they&#39;re condensed into</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.880" end="00:07:15.280" style="s2">one perfect form memes take a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.400" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.280" end="00:07:21.120" style="s2">archetypes take a lot of information and</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:25.280" style="s2">condense it into a transmittable form</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.120" end="00:07:26.960" style="s2">the cross for example is christianity</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.280" end="00:07:28.479" style="s2">without the cross there is no</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.960" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">christianity it is the</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.479" end="00:07:33.759" style="s2">sublime symbol and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:36.240" style="s2">this is what memes do as well they take</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.759" end="00:07:38.639" style="s2">a lot of cultural information</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.240" end="00:07:40.400" style="s2">even a lot of personal information and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.639" end="00:07:44.800" style="s2">they transform it into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.400" end="00:07:46.639" style="s2">single easily understood image</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.800" end="00:07:48.960" style="s2">and of course many memes play off of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.639" end="00:07:51.360" style="s2">this they make it very complex</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.960" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">or you know intentionally obtuse there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.360" end="00:07:54.960" style="s2">no way to</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:55.199" style="s2">to get the meaning out of it um but at</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.960" end="00:07:58.400" style="s2">its</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.199" end="00:08:01.199" style="s2">at its very root a meme is simply an</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.400" end="00:08:02.560" style="s2">image or a symbol or a word that</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.199" end="00:08:06.240" style="s2">condenses lots of</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.560" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">ideas and lots of context into a single</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.240" end="00:08:08.560" style="s2">form</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">some really good examples of this would</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.720" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">be kilroy was here</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">which is a a popular piece of graffiti</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:28.640" style="s2">effective symbol</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.920" end="00:09:30.240" style="s2">because it inspires repetition it takes</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.640" end="00:09:31.440" style="s2">something really interesting something</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.640" end="00:09:41.680" style="s2">yeah spock</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">you take an alien with superpowers and</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.760" end="00:09:54.880" style="s2">and then also important now we get into</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.920" end="00:09:56.080" style="s2">the occultism</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.880" end="00:09:57.760" style="s2">because we&#39;ve talked about young and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.080" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">talked about it but we have to see the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.760" end="00:10:02.480" style="s2">occultism applied</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">and we see that in v for victory</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.480" end="00:10:09.200" style="s2">and peace now churchill utilized v</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:10.079" style="s2">for victory to empower britain&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.200" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.079" end="00:10:13.279" style="s2">but what many don&#39;t know is that</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">aleister crowley actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.279" end="00:10:20.079" style="s2">invented v for victory as a weapon</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">against the nazi&#39;s swastika</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.079" end="00:10:26.959" style="s2">the swastika is a reversed solar symbol</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:28.079" style="s2">which is why many now use the black sun</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.959" end="00:10:31.120" style="s2">because the black sun</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.079" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">is another reversed solar symbol</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.120" end="00:10:35.360" style="s2">and the solar god or at least in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:38.480" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.360" end="00:10:41.519" style="s2">is uh ra and</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.480" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">who who is able to attack ra</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.519" end="00:10:48.720" style="s2">is seth apophis and his symbol</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">is v because he&#39;s a destroyer he cuts</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.720" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">um in a video i&#39;d actually explained how</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">rock paper scissors is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">symbolic game and one of the oldest</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:01.920" style="s2">games ever played</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:04.000" style="s2">but that is a magical usage that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.920" end="00:11:06.320" style="s2">that&#39;s such a powerful symbol</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.000" end="00:11:07.279" style="s2">and of course the swastika is still</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.320" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.279" end="00:11:10.240" style="s2">the swastika is still one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:11.440" style="s2">powerful symbols because you know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.240" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">see somebody wearing it and you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.440" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">what it means</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:16.079" style="s2">you know what that symbol means um and</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:20.399" style="s2">the same goes</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.079" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">for racial slurs they condense a culture</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.399" end="00:11:26.399" style="s2">of you know of of racism and of</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:28.240" style="s2">historical oppression into a single word</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.399" end="00:11:31.680" style="s2">which is why those words are so</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.240" end="00:11:34.880" style="s2">sensitive and so powerful</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.680" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">um but this idea of a sensitive of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.880" end="00:11:40.880" style="s2">powerful image and a powerful word</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">um does not have its roots really in</p>

<p begin="00:18:20.559" end="00:18:24.880" style="s2">kind of stole his wife and stole tens of</p>

<p begin="00:18:24.880" end="00:18:28.240" style="s2">but before that they were good friends</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:30.559" style="s2">and did magic together</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.240" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">and so hubbard took all of his magical</p>

<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:35.919" style="s2">hubbard&#39;s son even attests to saying</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.520" end="00:18:44.400" style="s2">is alistair crowley&#39;s it&#39;s black magic</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:48.640" style="s2">so the parts of dianetics that work</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.400" end="00:18:51.200" style="s2">are magical ideas those are infectious</p>

<p begin="00:18:59.840" end="00:19:03.280" style="s2">because that&#39;s how you know the word we</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.280" end="00:19:05.039" style="s2">know the word from the internet</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.280" end="00:19:07.760" style="s2">and so what&#39;s the most important</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.039" end="00:19:10.799" style="s2">internet meme it&#39;s from the song</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.760" end="00:19:14.960" style="s2">that peter played before we were talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.799" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">that is chabylee chatelet</p>

<p begin="00:19:25.679" end="00:19:30.240" style="s2">as a kind of far-right idea as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.520" end="00:19:32.720" style="s2">far-right</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.240" end="00:19:34.880" style="s2">symbol but he&#39;s far more than that and</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.720" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">it&#39;s a mistake to politicize</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.880" end="00:19:38.160" style="s2">symbolism and of course we&#39;re living in</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:40.640" style="s2">an</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.160" end="00:19:41.919" style="s2">era of politicized symbolism but to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.640" end="00:19:44.720" style="s2">so is to deny</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.919" end="00:19:46.960" style="s2">much of its power politics is almost</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.720" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">antithetical to real power</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.960" end="00:19:54.000" style="s2">which is symbolic power but keck</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:58.559" style="s2">is the form of pepe as a god</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.000" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">pepe is initially um a frog from a comic</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.480" end="00:20:36.960" style="s2">effective it speaks to the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:38.480" style="s2">the idea of a frog with feelings</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.960" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">speaks to the collective unconscious in</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.480" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">this very specific way</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:44.080" style="s2">and so all kinds of people on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">internet start making their own drawings</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.080" end="00:20:46.480" style="s2">of him</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">and this gives way over time</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:57.760" style="s2">to him becoming a very chaotic uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">violent brutal character contrasted</p>

<p begin="00:22:32.159" end="00:22:37.440" style="s2">and so it became very very popular many</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.360" end="00:22:38.080" style="s2">people were doing the will of this god</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.440" end="00:22:40.640" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.080" end="00:22:41.600" style="s2">of course they actually saw he had an</p>

<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.280" style="s2">he was actually doing something and</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.080" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the problems with these</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.280" end="00:22:49.039" style="s2">old dead gods</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:50.320" style="s2">these old religious systems it&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.039" end="00:22:53.440" style="s2">impossible to</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.320" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">feel their effect on us</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.440" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">we feel as if these gods are dead but</p>

<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:06.880" style="s2">as you as you pray as you worship him</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">and all it takes is using the internet</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.880" end="00:23:11.120" style="s2">and so synchronicities start arising</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">from this worship</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.120" end="00:23:15.840" style="s2">which is chatelai it&#39;s a song that has a</p>

<p begin="00:23:15.840" end="00:23:19.520" style="s2">and i think the artist is pepe and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">was like</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.520" end="00:23:22.559" style="s2">that was a huge affirmation like oh my</p>

<p begin="00:23:31.679" end="00:23:38.320" style="s2">fact the case i think</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.200" end="00:23:42.240" style="s2">any archetype in its dignified power</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:45.279" style="s2">begins to emit synchronicities which is</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.240" end="00:23:48.320" style="s2">kind of meaningful coincidences</p>

<p begin="00:23:55.840" end="00:24:00.000" style="s2">enough</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.320" end="00:24:02.320" style="s2">are given a kind of vast magical power</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.000" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">because they are where the archetype is</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.320" end="00:24:07.600" style="s2">most intense</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:10.559" style="s2">it&#39;s an intensity of archetypal value</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.600" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">on a meme which is shared by a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.559" end="00:24:14.559" style="s2">strangers</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">it lacks much of the trouble of an</p>

<p begin="00:25:29.840" end="00:25:33.679" style="s2">what is the way out it&#39;s difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.799" end="00:25:36.640" style="s2">say i think</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.679" end="00:25:37.360" style="s2">a lot of conscious attention paying</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.640" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">attention</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.360" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">to memes and that is why my motto on my</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:44.880" style="s2">channel is</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">memes matter if you can just take that</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.880" end="00:25:50.000" style="s2">step to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:51.200" style="s2">memes matter that this word this idea</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.000" end="00:25:55.279" style="s2">this image</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.200" end="00:25:58.080" style="s2">this political concept this character</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.279" end="00:25:59.919" style="s2">they matter it&#39;s not just uh it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.080" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">real but it&#39;s also not something that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:07.679" style="s2">it matters it has power</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">that is the first step to having real</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.679" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">discussions and real progress</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">and not ever remaining possessed by</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:17.600" style="s2">these forces which really are</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:18.559" style="s2">playing with us you can make you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.600" end="00:26:21.919" style="s2">you can make up</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.559" end="00:26:24.640" style="s2">these uh you can make up a whole</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.919" end="00:26:27.200" style="s2">population and you introduce ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.640" end="00:26:29.919" style="s2">you witness them tear each other apart</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.200" end="00:26:31.919" style="s2">that is what archetypes autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.919" end="00:26:34.720" style="s2">forces do for fun</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.919" end="00:26:36.960" style="s2">we are at the whim of these irrational</p>

<p begin="00:26:36.960" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">and to combat it we just have to realize</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.679" end="00:26:42.640" style="s2">that it goes on</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">that there are ideas that are beyond our</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.640" end="00:26:47.440" style="s2">conscious</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">attention and that they affect us</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.440" end="00:26:54.000" style="s2">and that is basically it memes matter</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:55.360" style="s2">cool it means matter um so start</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.000" end="00:26:57.600" style="s2">throwing your questions in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.360" end="00:26:59.840" style="s2">uh i&#39;ll i&#39;ll warm chris up with a few</p>

<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:10.640" style="s2">sort of the trollish reactionary uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.679" end="00:27:13.200" style="s2">memes were</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.640" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">emerged on the chance and uh sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.200" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">social justice memes uh emerge on tumblr</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious if you have any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:21.279" style="s2">as to that</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">and the somewhat adjacent related</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.279" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">question is um</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.520" end="00:27:27.679" style="s2">uh john michael greer that druid uh he</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">was on daniel thornson&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.679" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">podcast it was a really great great</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.159" style="s2">episode and uh he was talking about kind</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:33.840" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.159" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">pepe and how that came online and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.840" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">chance and all that kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:39.039" style="s2">all that strangeness was occurring and</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">he says people are becoming conscious of</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.039" end="00:27:42.880" style="s2">it using these memes as sigils</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:43.919" style="s2">uh and then in the next election there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.880" end="00:27:47.120" style="s2">gonna be uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.919" end="00:27:48.320" style="s2">basically magic warfare uh you know to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.120" end="00:27:51.840" style="s2">fight for the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.320" end="00:27:54.159" style="s2">collective mind and the nose here um</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.840" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">and yeah so and then i was gonna slip in</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.159" end="00:27:57.039" style="s2">some like the left can&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:58.399" style="s2">uh so who you think would win in that</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.039" end="00:28:00.640" style="s2">kind of warfare if that happening that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.399" end="00:28:04.320" style="s2">that is happening on a conscious level</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.640" end="00:28:04.680" style="s2">um so yeah i&#39;ll just throw that at you</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.320" end="00:28:07.789" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.680" end="00:28:07.789" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:12.799" style="s2">i&#39;ll go with the left cam meme for now</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.039" end="00:28:14.240" style="s2">since that was that&#39;s a powerful one</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.799" end="00:28:16.399" style="s2">that&#39;s an important one</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.240" end="00:28:18.240" style="s2">um i think unfortunately there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.399" end="00:28:21.520" style="s2">something to it at the moment</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.240" end="00:28:24.799" style="s2">and that is because right-wing ideas</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.520" end="00:28:28.480" style="s2">um speak to the lowest part of humanity</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.799" end="00:28:29.919" style="s2">they speak to the shadow they speak to</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.480" end="00:28:32.559" style="s2">repressed</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.919" end="00:28:34.640" style="s2">emotions and those are emotions that</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.559" end="00:28:36.799" style="s2">desperately want to express themselves</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.640" end="00:28:40.399" style="s2">they want to come out</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:43.279" style="s2">so that&#39;s why a right-wing meme</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.399" end="00:28:45.760" style="s2">can just be a picture and the n-word and</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.279" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">that is a cathartic release</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.760" end="00:28:50.240" style="s2">for far-right people um and that&#39;s in a</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:52.000" style="s2">way it&#39;s just it&#39;s a cathartic release</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.240" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">for anybody who has</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.000" end="00:28:55.279" style="s2">a concept of the significance of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:58.720" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.279" end="00:29:02.000" style="s2">just by putting a taboo onto a word you</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.720" end="00:29:05.840" style="s2">inspire the opposite you inspire</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.000" end="00:29:08.880" style="s2">a virulent desire to abuse</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.840" end="00:29:10.080" style="s2">so when the left makes its arguments</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.880" end="00:29:14.000" style="s2">from a position</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.080" end="00:29:16.399" style="s2">of um rationality which is always a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.000" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">mistake politics is not rational and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.399" end="00:29:19.120" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t try to make it something it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:20.880" style="s2">not it&#39;s theater</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.120" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s always been theater if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.880" end="00:29:27.120" style="s2">entertaining you can&#39;t win</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:30.399" style="s2">so this idea that we can argue from a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.120" end="00:29:32.159" style="s2">a secular viewpoint is impossible</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.399" end="00:29:33.679" style="s2">i think that this is the real problem</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.159" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">with marx</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.679" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">he is too materialist for his own good</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:40.000" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">even if i don&#39;t know even if we could</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.000" end="00:29:45.200" style="s2">objectively prove that material causes</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.559" end="00:29:46.960" style="s2">were actually the engine of history it</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.200" end="00:29:49.039" style="s2">would still not be a convincing argument</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.960" end="00:29:50.240" style="s2">for most people it still wouldn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.039" end="00:29:53.279" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t speak to the</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.240" end="00:29:55.279" style="s2">unconscious this is what</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.279" end="00:29:56.320" style="s2">wilhelm reich does correctly he</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.279" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">introduces</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.320" end="00:30:01.600" style="s2">orgone energy into the equation</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:05.039" style="s2">introducing freudian ideas to marx</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.600" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">elevates both and even more so mark</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.039" end="00:30:08.480" style="s2">fisher</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:10.480" style="s2">he has the idea of acid communism of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.480" end="00:30:10.880" style="s2">psychedelic communism which is really</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.480" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.880" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">religious meaningful communism that is</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:17.919" style="s2">the only way that the left</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:18.720" style="s2">could mean is by introducing something</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.919" end="00:30:21.200" style="s2">meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.720" end="00:30:22.720" style="s2">the right has everything they have</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.200" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">paganism they have christianity they</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.720" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">have islam</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.600" end="00:30:28.080" style="s2">even judaism they have all the religions</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:30.960" style="s2">because every religion that has been has</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.080" end="00:30:33.279" style="s2">been conservative to a modern viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.960" end="00:30:34.640" style="s2">so they play with conservative ideas and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.279" end="00:30:35.919" style="s2">they they</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.640" end="00:30:38.320" style="s2">prance about with them they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.919" end="00:30:39.600" style="s2">believe in them but they play with it</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.320" end="00:30:40.240" style="s2">because that&#39;s all you need to do to</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.600" end="00:30:44.159" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.240" end="00:30:47.279" style="s2">meaningful intercourse online</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.159" end="00:30:48.480" style="s2">the left is too committed to rational</p>

<p begin="00:30:48.480" end="00:30:54.399" style="s2">to actually make any any way</p>

<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:29.360" style="s2">just your own</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.880" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">it is a mass projection and an inability</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.720" end="00:32:39.519" style="s2">is just all right let&#39;s split it off and</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">we fight the opposite as hard as we can</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.519" end="00:32:42.640" style="s2">no there&#39;s no there&#39;s no thought to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:45.919" style="s2">there&#39;s no reason to it and</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.600" end="00:32:53.120" style="s2">what was another question</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.399" style="s2">um so who would win that kind of the the</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.120" end="00:32:55.679" style="s2">spiritual warfare that&#39;s occurring</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.399" end="00:32:57.360" style="s2">between the left and right and the other</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.679" end="00:32:59.600" style="s2">one is uh how they emerge in different</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.360" end="00:33:02.799" style="s2">platforms and like the tumblr</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.600" end="00:33:04.720" style="s2">social justice and then and i i would i</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.799" end="00:33:05.760" style="s2">would say i&#39;m surprised that um</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.720" end="00:33:07.039" style="s2">you&#39;re saying that left comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.760" end="00:33:08.240" style="s2">rational based argument because some</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.039" end="00:33:08.960" style="s2">people would not say that</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.240" end="00:33:10.720" style="s2">and then they have like these</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.960" end="00:33:11.919" style="s2">shame-based tactics to make you awoke</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.720" end="00:33:14.880" style="s2">and all that type of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.919" end="00:33:15.960" style="s2">so i&#39;d throw out that out there as well</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.880" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">they use</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.960" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">irrationality but they are not possessed</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">by it they are arguing on</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">a humanistic basis</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:30.960" style="s2">their origins are christian and</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.960" end="00:33:32.159" style="s2">christianity is already a relatively</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.960" end="00:33:35.120" style="s2">more rational</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.159" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">religion than or not maybe rational is</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.120" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">not the right word i should say</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">detached from the body uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:47.200" style="s2">cerebral um</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:47.919" style="s2">and i mean that in a bad way the body is</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.200" end="00:33:50.159" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.919" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">the body is the message and for the left</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.159" end="00:33:53.200" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:54.240" style="s2">progress they need to find their bodies</p>

<p begin="00:33:54.240" end="00:33:59.760" style="s2">um as for the and this gets to the point</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.159" end="00:34:02.960" style="s2">about the the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.760" end="00:34:04.159" style="s2">in um tumblr you have the 4chan guys and</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.960" end="00:34:07.519" style="s2">the tumblr girls and</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.159" end="00:34:09.280" style="s2">i knew early on like that these two are</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.519" end="00:34:11.280" style="s2">a divine relationship and that they need</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.280" end="00:34:14.159" style="s2">to be unified to progress</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.280" end="00:34:15.119" style="s2">um for seders which are followers of</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.159" end="00:34:18.240" style="s2">dionysus</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.119" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">there are mainad&#39;s nymphs</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.240" end="00:34:22.000" style="s2">the female followers of dionysus but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:22.639" style="s2">problem is that both are asexual both</p>

<p begin="00:35:16.800" end="00:35:20.000" style="s2">there&#39;s always been a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.240" end="00:35:21.839" style="s2">gender war play</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.000" end="00:35:24.160" style="s2">it&#39;s just the way it is it&#39;s part of the</p>

<p begin="00:36:09.119" end="00:36:13.200" style="s2">symbols and memes in order to thrive or</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.000" end="00:36:16.079" style="s2">do they</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.200" end="00:36:17.359" style="s2">simply exist as a way to spread an idea</p>

<p begin="00:36:21.280" end="00:36:26.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question um and it&#39;s tough</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.160" end="00:36:28.880" style="s2">to say there are certainly ideas</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.000" end="00:36:30.079" style="s2">that don&#39;t have memes but i think it</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.880" end="00:36:32.640" style="s2">kind of speaks to</p>

<p begin="00:36:32.640" end="00:36:36.400" style="s2">which is that the vast majority of</p>

<p begin="00:36:44.560" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">so there are ideas that don&#39;t have memes</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.200" end="00:36:51.760" style="s2">but they&#39;re weak</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:53.359" style="s2">and they don&#39;t survive the test of time</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.760" end="00:36:55.040" style="s2">no matter how good of an idea it is you</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.359" end="00:36:58.240" style="s2">know even if it&#39;s an important idea</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.040" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">if it&#39;s not an effective virulent idea</p>

<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:06.839" style="s2">that&#39;s catchy this won&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.720" end="00:37:10.160" style="s2">so memes</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.839" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">are symbols that signify the presence of</p>

<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:15.839" style="s2">and it kind of gets to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.920" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">one would imagine there is only a set</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.839" end="00:37:20.720" style="s2">amount of ideas in the world</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">and that all of the archetypes represent</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:25.280" style="s2">those ideas or that all ideas</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:26.960" style="s2">are related to those archetypal</p>

<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:35.119" style="s2">not close to that intense energy</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;ll be forgotten if it&#39;s memetic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.119" end="00:37:38.160" style="s2">close to the source</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.880" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">cool do you have a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:54.160" style="s2">so you feel that</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.800" end="00:37:57.599" style="s2">ideas have to be old in</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.160" end="00:37:59.839" style="s2">order for them to be taken</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.599" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">by people in order to become a medic</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.839" end="00:38:05.200" style="s2">they have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">closer to something that is based</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.200" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">exactly and that is why</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.960" style="s2">you have the meme of you know you react</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:14.880" style="s2">some people they respond to an idea and</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.960" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">they say based</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.880" end="00:38:19.839" style="s2">because it is literally a base idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:26.480" style="s2">cool thank you uh evan you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.560" end="00:38:33.920" style="s2">you can and yeah sorry sorry i had to</p>

<p begin="00:38:33.920" end="00:38:39.440" style="s2">so my question is um i kept having the</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.280" end="00:38:41.599" style="s2">notion of the concept of memetic hazards</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.440" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">um and the i guess bowstrum or what have</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.599" end="00:38:45.440" style="s2">you since um</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:47.440" style="s2">specifically the idea of cogito hazards</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.440" end="00:38:49.680" style="s2">come up for me during your initial</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.440" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">um sort of presentation especially when</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.680" end="00:38:54.640" style="s2">you were talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:55.200" style="s2">um the sense of the book that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.640" end="00:38:58.480" style="s2">want to leave</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.200" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">open um etc and so i was i was wondering</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.480" end="00:39:02.960" style="s2">if you could maybe just riff on</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:05.119" style="s2">uh talk about the idea of um the</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.960" end="00:39:07.200" style="s2">relationship between your conception of</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.119" end="00:39:08.560" style="s2">memes and their virality here uh and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.200" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">whether they&#39;re memetically or</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.560" end="00:39:10.960" style="s2">cognitively hazardous to us potentially</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:12.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.960" end="00:39:15.599" style="s2">i&#39;m really interested to get your take</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.160" end="00:39:18.000" style="s2">on that</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.599" end="00:39:18.800" style="s2">yes that&#39;s a very important idea to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.000" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.800" end="00:39:23.280" style="s2">because i think if you think about it if</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:25.200" style="s2">you think about memes correctly you</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.280" end="00:39:26.839" style="s2">would be afraid and you would recognize</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.200" end="00:39:30.079" style="s2">them as hazardous</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.839" end="00:39:32.800" style="s2">um you know one of lovecraft&#39;s quotes</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.079" end="00:39:34.720" style="s2">is is so brilliant and it so brilliantly</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.800" end="00:39:37.760" style="s2">speaks to the tr the trouble</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.720" end="00:39:38.880" style="s2">in believing in anything which is you</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.760" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">know the most</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.880" end="00:39:45.280" style="s2">the most um shoot uh i&#39;m gonna have to</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">paraphrase it but the most um</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.280" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">fortunate trait in mankind is that we</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">cannot</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">um correspond all the parts of our mind</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:57.440" style="s2">if we were able to actually make sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:59.280" style="s2">of what we believe we would go mad</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.440" end="00:40:01.839" style="s2">and this is an idea that crowley talks</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.280" end="00:40:05.040" style="s2">about heavily in book four</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.839" end="00:40:07.119" style="s2">um and it&#39;s said like you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.040" end="00:40:08.480" style="s2">if you don&#39;t know every devil the one</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.119" end="00:40:09.920" style="s2">that you&#39;ve forgotten is going to come</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.480" end="00:40:11.119" style="s2">up from behind you and strangle you to</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.920" end="00:40:15.359" style="s2">death</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.119" end="00:40:18.800" style="s2">so he says you know if most christians</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.359" end="00:40:21.359" style="s2">could actually reason out</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.800" end="00:40:22.800" style="s2">what they believe which is to say if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.359" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">really think that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.800" end="00:40:26.960" style="s2">if you don&#39;t save somebody that they are</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:29.520" style="s2">going to go to hell</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.960" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">how do you sleep at night knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.520" end="00:40:33.200" style="s2">the majority of humans are going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:36.319" style="s2">tortured for eternity</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.200" end="00:40:40.319" style="s2">you simply can&#39;t really believe it</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.319" end="00:40:41.119" style="s2">without that um distance without that</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.319" end="00:40:44.000" style="s2">cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.119" end="00:40:45.200" style="s2">dissonance from the belief if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.000" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">actually believe the thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.200" end="00:40:49.920" style="s2">wholeheartedly you would go mad</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.440" end="00:40:51.280" style="s2">but the dangerous part of the cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.920" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">hazard is that when you do</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.280" end="00:40:56.480" style="s2">start to treat it as it is when you</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:58.640" style="s2">if you have a really bad idea or a</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.480" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">really bad idea gets you</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.640" end="00:41:02.000" style="s2">and you live according to it then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.359" style="s2">you&#39;re lost</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.000" end="00:41:07.520" style="s2">like there&#39;s a lot of in-cell propaganda</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.359" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">and it is impossible to get through to</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.520" end="00:41:11.680" style="s2">these people like</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">they are wholeheartedly believers in</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.680" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">this idea because it was such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">a hazardous effective idea it just traps</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:23.440" style="s2">for good and it contorts your body you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:24.560" style="s2">you act insecure it makes you insecure</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.440" end="00:41:26.960" style="s2">it makes you</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.560" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">despise your body there&#39;s a lot of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.960" end="00:41:30.319" style="s2">like this</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:30.960" style="s2">so i definitely think that mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.319" end="00:41:33.760" style="s2">hazards</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.960" end="00:41:34.880" style="s2">cognitive hazards are not just a product</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:38.400" style="s2">of fiction</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.880" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">they are real and they are a major part</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.400" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">of modern life</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.599" end="00:41:47.040" style="s2">i&#39;m curious um what&#39;s your thoughts on q</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.240" end="00:41:49.520" style="s2">anon</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.040" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">uh because i&#39;ve been studying the um</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.520" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">culture war</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">when i go on to the chance man it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">my body just shrivels down i can&#39;t stay</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">on there too long</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:41:58.079" style="s2">but just i have a feel of the contours</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.319" end="00:41:58.560" style="s2">of the different mimetic mean plexus out</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.079" end="00:42:00.160" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.560" end="00:42:02.240" style="s2">and it&#39;s a very distinct one from kind</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.160" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">of the trollish reactionary sphere</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.240" end="00:42:05.599" style="s2">but they&#39;re kind of in the same sandbox</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">and chance uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.599" end="00:42:09.200" style="s2">how do you read that movement and with</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:10.960" style="s2">the kind of the lens of the archetypes</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.200" end="00:42:14.079" style="s2">and the memes</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.960" end="00:42:16.160" style="s2">so i&#39;m of two minds i&#39;m of the i&#39;m of</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.079" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">the magical mind and i am of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.160" end="00:42:19.760" style="s2">human all-too-human mind and that</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:21.680" style="s2">humanoid it&#39;s a human part man</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.760" end="00:42:23.119" style="s2">i really feel bad for them i really pity</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.680" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">them but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.119" end="00:42:26.640" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad way to look at it you look</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:30.319" style="s2">at it like a magician you say yes</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.640" end="00:42:33.359" style="s2">we&#39;re so close now if i made the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.319" end="00:42:33.839" style="s2">stupid little post i could gain as much</p>

<p begin="00:42:33.839" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">as q that was so darn</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.280" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">easy to create a new cult a new religion</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:45.119" style="s2">and i mean it is it is a serious cult</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:48.240" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.119" end="00:42:51.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of sad very very very very</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.240" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">sad groups of q people talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.760" end="00:42:55.280" style="s2">they&#39;ve lost their families you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.440" end="00:42:57.359" style="s2">they&#39;ve alienated themselves</p>

<p begin="00:42:57.359" end="00:43:02.240" style="s2">think that is such</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.560" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">a miserable idea you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.240" end="00:43:05.599" style="s2">the really important idea that nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.760" style="s2">and max sterner talk about and these are</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.599" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">like serious serious individualists</p>

<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">think sometimes we need</p>

<p begin="00:45:28.640" end="00:45:33.760" style="s2">yeah hi um i guess uh i&#39;ve always kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:35.280" style="s2">of struggled to understand how to</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.760" end="00:45:37.040" style="s2">communicate symbolically</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.280" end="00:45:38.960" style="s2">when people are inevitably going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.040" end="00:45:41.040" style="s2">receive it in a million different ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.960" end="00:45:44.640" style="s2">however they take it whatever their</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.040" end="00:45:46.000" style="s2">preconditioning is um but i also</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.640" end="00:45:48.160" style="s2">kind of feel that way when i try to</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.000" end="00:45:51.280" style="s2">communicate with reason</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.160" end="00:45:54.319" style="s2">people tend to just take it however</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.280" end="00:45:55.119" style="s2">we&#39;re not always on the same um we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.319" end="00:45:56.800" style="s2">not always on the</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.119" end="00:45:58.720" style="s2">starting from the same position so i</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.800" end="00:46:00.560" style="s2">wonder whether you think</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.720" end="00:46:02.800" style="s2">it has anything to do with either of</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.560" end="00:46:04.640" style="s2">those methods of communication or</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.800" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">whether that&#39;s just generally</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.640" end="00:46:10.400" style="s2">unavoidable and um</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:15.200" style="s2">also if you have any thoughts on how to</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.400" end="00:46:18.240" style="s2">effectively communicate with symbolism</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.200" end="00:46:21.200" style="s2">so um</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.240" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">you know half the battle is is</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.200" end="00:46:25.839" style="s2">confidence</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:28.000" style="s2">half the battle is um honestly believing</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.839" end="00:46:29.280" style="s2">in what you do and that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.000" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">trick of being a magician</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.280" end="00:46:32.560" style="s2">in in speaking in symbols is that part</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:35.280" style="s2">of you is like</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.560" end="00:46:36.400" style="s2">this is [ __ ] what am i doing but</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.280" end="00:46:39.119" style="s2">when you see</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.400" end="00:46:39.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s effective [ __ ] then you</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.119" end="00:46:41.119" style="s2">realize</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.680" end="00:46:42.800" style="s2">well i&#39;m actually doing something</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.119" end="00:46:44.160" style="s2">important i&#39;m actually doing something</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.800" end="00:46:46.000" style="s2">that works</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.160" end="00:46:47.200" style="s2">so i think it&#39;s a matter of how</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.000" end="00:46:49.200" style="s2">confident are you</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.200" end="00:46:50.880" style="s2">in those ideas that you&#39;re sharing you</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.200" end="00:46:51.920" style="s2">know are you really speaking what you</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.880" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">feel what you think</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.920" end="00:46:57.119" style="s2">or is it just trying to do it</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:59.040" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t try to do it you</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.119" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">simply have to</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.040" end="00:47:02.400" style="s2">give it and then they&#39;ll understand i</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:05.359" style="s2">think if you can meet them</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.400" end="00:47:06.560" style="s2">animal to animal that is the way to</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.359" end="00:47:09.359" style="s2">effectively</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.560" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">symbolically communicate like if a if a</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.359" end="00:47:13.760" style="s2">bird were singing with a weak voice</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:15.440" style="s2">or didn&#39;t mean their song i&#39;m sure they</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.760" end="00:47:18.560" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be understood either</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.440" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of animal magnetism in</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.560" end="00:47:25.839" style="s2">the effective magicians communications</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.800" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">all right um david you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.760" end="00:47:39.440" style="s2">yeah thanks peter um yeah i&#39;m looking</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:43.040" style="s2">for some</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.440" end="00:47:45.200" style="s2">clarification um how much control</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.040" end="00:47:46.800" style="s2">do you think people have in the genesis</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.200" end="00:47:49.200" style="s2">of these powerful memes</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.800" end="00:47:51.040" style="s2">like is there any authorship or design</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.200" end="00:47:51.599" style="s2">involved or do you think these memes</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.040" end="00:47:53.599" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.599" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">evolve independently of any human</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.599" end="00:47:56.000" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.079" end="00:47:59.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s a great question and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.680" end="00:48:01.599" style="s2">one of the most important</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.119" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">magical questions but i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.599" end="00:48:07.280" style="s2">concept of synchronicity</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:10.079" style="s2">and of necklands hyperstation</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.280" end="00:48:11.200" style="s2">is the answer which is that these are</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.079" end="00:48:15.200" style="s2">ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.200" end="00:48:16.800" style="s2">lay dormant until the creator</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.200" end="00:48:18.559" style="s2">the author happened upon it</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.800" end="00:48:22.079" style="s2">unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.559" end="00:48:22.960" style="s2">so sometimes the you you might think an</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.079" end="00:48:26.160" style="s2">author</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.960" end="00:48:26.880" style="s2">made that idea up but really it had been</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.160" end="00:48:29.920" style="s2">waiting</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.880" end="00:48:32.960" style="s2">in wait to come out of them</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.920" end="00:48:33.680" style="s2">um i mean personally i would say there</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.960" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">is never</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.680" end="00:48:40.240" style="s2">an author it&#39;s just an author gets</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:43.359" style="s2">divine inspiration they get possessed of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.240" end="00:48:45.680" style="s2">that power and they do it they make it</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.359" end="00:48:47.680" style="s2">um even if it&#39;s perceived as as their</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.680" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">own creativity i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.680" end="00:48:50.559" style="s2">really possible</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.800" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">like i was talking about if the idea is</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.559" end="00:48:56.960" style="s2">effective it&#39;s close to something old</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">so um maybe there&#39;s a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.960" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">personal influence but the majority of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">the influence is coming from</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:05.200" style="s2">something impersonal</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.680" end="00:49:10.319" style="s2">right that that seems like a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.680" end="00:49:13.440" style="s2">post-modern interpretation like the text</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:14.000" style="s2">is generated independently of the author</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.440" end="00:49:15.440" style="s2">like you</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.000" end="00:49:17.200" style="s2">you don&#39;t have to take into account the</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.440" end="00:49:18.400" style="s2">author at all when interpreting the text</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:22.079" style="s2">and same for memes</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.400" end="00:49:25.280" style="s2">in this case well i suppose it depends</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.079" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">on the context of the author um and i</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.280" end="00:49:27.920" style="s2">because i would disagree i would say it</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:30.640" style="s2">is a modernist</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.920" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">view which is that i am sharing in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.640" end="00:49:34.240" style="s2">ideas of frasier</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:35.920" style="s2">and jung who are both distinctly</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.240" end="00:49:36.800" style="s2">modernist i mean they&#39;re predicting post</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.920" end="00:49:38.559" style="s2">modernism</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.800" end="00:49:40.319" style="s2">but they are asserting and i am</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.559" end="00:49:43.520" style="s2">asserting a real</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.319" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">energy a real archetype behind it</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.520" end="00:49:47.520" style="s2">and that the author is really possessed</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:49.680" style="s2">that it is not a symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.520" end="00:49:50.559" style="s2">i&#39;m not speaking in a metaphor i do mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.680" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">literally</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.559" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">that that idea was laying dormant to</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.880" style="s2">arise that it is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:49:58.240" style="s2">um it is not as if the author and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.880" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">piece are separate</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.240" end="00:50:01.520" style="s2">it is just that the relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:04.559" style="s2">them is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.520" end="00:50:06.319" style="s2">a a divine one which is even you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">traditional that&#39;s the traditional</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.319" end="00:50:08.800" style="s2">viewpoint</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.960" end="00:50:12.480" style="s2">so if it has something in common with</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.480" end="00:50:14.079" style="s2">post-modernism it is because</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.480" end="00:50:16.480" style="s2">that is something that post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.079" end="00:50:19.040" style="s2">was correct about</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.480" end="00:50:21.520" style="s2">all right thanks so many more questions</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.040" end="00:50:24.559" style="s2">but i&#39;ll give someone else a turn now</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.520" end="00:50:25.839" style="s2">thank you and do you have to leave at</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.559" end="00:50:28.480" style="s2">the hour chris</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.839" end="00:50:29.280" style="s2">no i can go on as as long as you want</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.480" end="00:50:31.520" style="s2">cool so</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.280" end="00:50:33.119" style="s2">maybe uh 10-15 minutes after the hour we</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.520" end="00:50:37.040" style="s2">have a bunch of questions in the chat</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.119" end="00:50:40.640" style="s2">um the medic caper you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.040" end="00:50:44.400" style="s2">yeah hello um do you think</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.640" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">symbols or memes uh have to contain</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.400" end="00:50:49.680" style="s2">energy themselves or can they rather be</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">a mechanism by which potential energy is</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.680" end="00:50:56.559" style="s2">unlocked within the viewer a good that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:51:00.160" style="s2">a good question as well</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.559" end="00:51:03.440" style="s2">um and i think the answer is in yoga</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.160" end="00:51:05.839" style="s2">actually which is that the</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.440" end="00:51:06.559" style="s2">the symbol the meme is a vessel for</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.839" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.559" end="00:51:10.400" style="s2">it is not the energy itself it exists to</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:13.920" style="s2">contain it</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.400" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">um when we do yoga the idea is that our</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.920" end="00:51:18.079" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">takes on an archetypal form like this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.079" end="00:51:24.480" style="s2">a form that is built into our bodies</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:25.920" style="s2">and doing so is what um puts that energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.480" end="00:51:28.000" style="s2">it allows that energy to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.920" end="00:51:30.240" style="s2">to kind of emanate from you it puts you</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.000" end="00:51:32.640" style="s2">in contact with that energy</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.240" end="00:51:34.160" style="s2">so there&#39;s a bit of both the meme has to</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.640" end="00:51:38.079" style="s2">be a good vessel</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.160" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">but your body also has to connect</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.079" end="00:51:43.520" style="s2">with that image to get that energy so</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:45.760" style="s2">it&#39;s a little bit of both</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.520" end="00:51:48.079" style="s2">okay yeah i mean i i think of it usually</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.760" end="00:51:51.119" style="s2">as a stimulus response</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.079" end="00:51:52.960" style="s2">that&#39;s which is a less uh</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.119" end="00:51:54.640" style="s2">i don&#39;t know a less magical view of it</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.960" end="00:51:56.319" style="s2">maybe but but there are there definitely</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.640" end="00:51:59.119" style="s2">are like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.319" end="00:52:00.480" style="s2">things about the body that are stable</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.119" end="00:52:02.480" style="s2">representations over</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.480" end="00:52:04.000" style="s2">time and just a function of human</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.480" end="00:52:06.640" style="s2">genetics even right</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.000" end="00:52:07.680" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m allowed to make a</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.640" end="00:52:10.800" style="s2">comment here</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.680" end="00:52:13.680" style="s2">but i kind of want to um</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.800" end="00:52:16.160" style="s2">so that whole thing about the book being</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.680" end="00:52:18.960" style="s2">left open being dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.160" end="00:52:20.480" style="s2">um because the symbol is so contagious</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.960" end="00:52:22.960" style="s2">within it</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.480" end="00:52:24.720" style="s2">but that sort of thing i&#39;m always highly</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.960" end="00:52:28.079" style="s2">skeptical of it um</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.720" end="00:52:30.960" style="s2">i think that sort of claim is made</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.079" end="00:52:32.079" style="s2">to make the symbol powerful to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.960" end="00:52:33.520" style="s2">person who&#39;s reading the book</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.079" end="00:52:35.599" style="s2">like it&#39;s not it&#39;s not actually the</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.520" end="00:52:39.839" style="s2">symbol has this inherent power</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.599" end="00:52:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s that sort of magical claim</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.839" end="00:52:46.559" style="s2">um it charges it with power by uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.200" end="00:52:48.800" style="s2">manipulating the belief of the reader</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.559" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my opinion about that sort</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.800" end="00:52:53.520" style="s2">of thing</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:55.760" style="s2">and this is the answer with all real um</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.520" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">all real questions of magic is if it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.760" end="00:53:00.720" style="s2">works then it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.680" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the test if it if a magical idea</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.720" end="00:53:03.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work then it should be gotten</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:05.520" style="s2">rid of</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.760" end="00:53:07.200" style="s2">but i do think that it is true and i</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.520" end="00:53:09.839" style="s2">think that memes are living evidence of</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.200" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">it that&#39;s what i would say</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.839" end="00:53:14.880" style="s2">so i mean it gives us we have sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:18.079" style="s2">ontological disagreement then because</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.880" end="00:53:18.720" style="s2">um if it works it&#39;s true i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.079" end="00:53:22.079" style="s2">works that</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.720" end="00:53:22.960" style="s2">that to me that just makes magic applied</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.079" end="00:53:24.800" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.960" end="00:53:27.119" style="s2">which i think it definitely is like</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.800" end="00:53:29.440" style="s2">stage magic is applied psychology</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.119" end="00:53:31.920" style="s2">i think all the occult stuff that&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.440" end="00:53:35.839" style="s2">i view it as applied psychology</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.920" end="00:53:38.800" style="s2">um yeah whereas</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.839" end="00:53:40.240" style="s2">we&#39;re saying that uh there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.800" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">of supernatural force</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.240" end="00:53:45.920" style="s2">or energy within the symbol is uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">that&#39;s a different thing right that is</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.920" end="00:53:50.319" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">that is jungian and reiki</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:54.839" style="s2">i view it the same way but i just think</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">psychology is far stranger than most</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.839" end="00:53:57.839" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.720" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">all right um michael</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:04.480" style="s2">you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.960" end="00:54:08.400" style="s2">yeah yeah uh i was thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.040" end="00:54:09.119" style="s2">performance i don&#39;t know if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.400" end="00:54:11.040" style="s2">familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.119" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">jonathan hates work around sacredness</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.040" end="00:54:14.800" style="s2">and the human ability to hold things</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:17.839" style="s2">sacred you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.800" end="00:54:20.400" style="s2">when when you connect the meme deeply</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.839" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">emotionally you get upset and like the</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.400" end="00:54:25.040" style="s2">human ability to get very upset when you</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:26.000" style="s2">attack something that is sacred or the</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.040" end="00:54:28.160" style="s2">opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.000" end="00:54:29.520" style="s2">the human connection of actually uniting</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.160" end="00:54:31.440" style="s2">people when there are</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.520" end="00:54:33.280" style="s2">whole things sacred together like</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.440" end="00:54:34.640" style="s2">symbols and religion has</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.280" end="00:54:36.720" style="s2">certainly hijacked this ability</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.640" end="00:54:38.240" style="s2">throughout the ages but how is meme</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.720" end="00:54:39.280" style="s2">related to this ability the whole</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.240" end="00:54:41.440" style="s2">thing&#39;s sacred</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.280" end="00:54:43.359" style="s2">do we do we actually hold meme sacred</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.440" end="00:54:44.880" style="s2">and what aren&#39;t there a lot of memes</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.359" end="00:54:45.839" style="s2">that we don&#39;t hold sacred that they are</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.880" end="00:54:48.880" style="s2">silly or</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.839" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">or convenient and stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.880" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">well that&#39;s again the question of</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">proximity of locality</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:56.079" style="s2">the cross as i was saying in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:59.520" style="s2">beginning is a meme</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.079" end="00:55:03.040" style="s2">the cross is a iconic</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.520" end="00:55:03.359" style="s2">symbolic image that spreads christianity</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.040" end="00:55:06.480" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.359" end="00:55:08.799" style="s2">does the fish the simple uh fish</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.480" end="00:55:09.839" style="s2">that was drawn by the early christians</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.799" end="00:55:13.119" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.839" end="00:55:14.319" style="s2">the christian meme and i what i argue</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:16.640" style="s2">christianity spread</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.319" end="00:55:17.520" style="s2">through memes romans might have seen it</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.640" end="00:55:19.359" style="s2">as ha</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.520" end="00:55:20.799" style="s2">look at this cross you know in fact one</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.359" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">of the earliest pieces of</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.799" end="00:55:25.280" style="s2">in fact the first ever depiction of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:27.599" style="s2">christ is a piece of roman graffiti</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.280" end="00:55:29.040" style="s2">and it depicts a a man with the head of</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.599" end="00:55:31.760" style="s2">a donkey</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.040" end="00:55:33.359" style="s2">and it says this is the god alex</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">worships</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.359" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">it&#39;s the palatine cross so it was an</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:40.160" style="s2">object of ridicule so when we look at a</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:41.920" style="s2">ridiculous internet meme</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.160" end="00:55:49.040" style="s2">that very well might be a religion</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.920" end="00:55:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s going to come out</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.040" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">yeah but i think like of course</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.480" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">the cross if i attacked you across a</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:59.040" style="s2">brand new cross you feel very</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:00.880" style="s2">attacked and humiliated and and this was</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.040" end="00:56:04.720" style="s2">connected to your sacredness but</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.880" end="00:56:06.240" style="s2">as i myself has done this been</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.720" end="00:56:07.920" style="s2">very upset when someone attacked my</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.240" end="00:56:09.839" style="s2">hobby or something like that and</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.920" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">felt disconnected didn&#39;t realize that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.839" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">hold my hobby sacred</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:14.960" style="s2">but now that i realize this i don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:16.559" style="s2">emotionally uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.960" end="00:56:18.400" style="s2">attacked when someone attacked my hobby</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.559" end="00:56:20.079" style="s2">anymore but so</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.400" end="00:56:22.319" style="s2">can you cultivate this awareness that</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.079" end="00:56:24.799" style="s2">the they&#39;re not actually attacking me</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.319" end="00:56:27.440" style="s2">or my sacredness they just don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.799" end="00:56:29.200" style="s2">why and how i hold this sacred</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.440" end="00:56:30.960" style="s2">yes but that&#39;s it that&#39;s extremely</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.200" end="00:56:31.680" style="s2">difficult but that is certainly the goal</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.960" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.680" end="00:56:36.079" style="s2">my idea of recognizing that memes matter</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.280" end="00:56:44.559" style="s2">yeah thanks right</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.480" end="00:56:46.079" style="s2">megan you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.559" end="00:56:48.319" style="s2">uh hey thanks chris this has been really</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.079" end="00:56:50.160" style="s2">interesting um actually you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.319" end="00:56:51.680" style="s2">just talking about the exact content i</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.160" end="00:56:53.359" style="s2">was going to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.680" end="00:56:54.880" style="s2">um that i was just writing about</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.359" end="00:56:57.520" style="s2">interesting um</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.880" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">i wanted to um ask what your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.520" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">are about um</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:02.079" style="s2">uh when a symbol gets corrupted and its</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:03.680" style="s2">meaning changes</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.079" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">and i think that the best example of</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.680" end="00:57:08.640" style="s2">that is the cross because</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:10.079" style="s2">um christians now see the cross very</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.640" end="00:57:12.079" style="s2">very differently to how someone would</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.079" end="00:57:14.079" style="s2">have seen it in 32 a.d</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.079" end="00:57:15.760" style="s2">i mean i think in 32ad it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.079" end="00:57:18.240" style="s2">symbol represents a threat</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.760" end="00:57:19.599" style="s2">um you will obey or this is what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.240" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">to happen to you</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.599" end="00:57:26.720" style="s2">um and i have a feeling that it still</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:28.240" style="s2">retains that meaning um and perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.720" end="00:57:29.920" style="s2">there is something in the symbol itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.240" end="00:57:31.760" style="s2">like the way it&#39;s asymmetric um</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.920" end="00:57:33.200" style="s2">if you i mean if you compare it with a</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.760" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.200" end="00:57:38.319" style="s2">um four-pointed star or an eight-pointed</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:40.319" style="s2">star which i think are both old symbols</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.319" end="00:57:42.160" style="s2">um and they&#39;re symmetrical and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.319" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">that&#39;s a sort of as above so below thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.160" end="00:57:45.839" style="s2">and then we&#39;ve got this asymmetric cross</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:48.240" style="s2">and it had that specific cultural</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.839" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">meaning of being a threat</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.240" end="00:57:52.240" style="s2">um and then now we have it as a</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:53.839" style="s2">christian symbol and it&#39;s about you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.240" end="00:57:55.599" style="s2">maybe sacrifice or compassion or</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.839" end="00:57:56.640" style="s2">something completely different but when</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.599" end="00:57:59.119" style="s2">is that um</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.640" end="00:58:00.160" style="s2">where does that old symbolism still fit</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.119" end="00:58:02.400" style="s2">in with that</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.160" end="00:58:04.319" style="s2">what would be your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.400" end="00:58:06.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what young brings that up</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.319" end="00:58:08.240" style="s2">uh in a very big way that and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.960" end="00:58:10.079" style="s2">like almost you know one of his</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.240" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">burns on christianity is like you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.079" end="00:58:13.359" style="s2">perhaps their cross</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">should have been more balanced perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.359" end="00:58:17.040" style="s2">it should have been symmetrical</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:19.280" style="s2">um it shows an imbalance in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.040" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">character in the denial of evil</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.280" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">the denial of evil as a part of god</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:26.559" style="s2">and his work in answer to job is</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.359" style="s2">basically to introduce evil back into</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.559" end="00:58:30.240" style="s2">god</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.359" end="00:58:31.520" style="s2">so the cross is most certainly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.240" end="00:58:33.599" style="s2">unbalanced</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.520" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">but beyond that it is it&#39;s a symbol of</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.599" end="00:58:38.240" style="s2">torture it&#39;s a symbol of destruction</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">to the christian but it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.240" end="00:58:43.520" style="s2">desire the you know martin</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:45.119" style="s2">martyrdom was a memetic phenomena they</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.520" end="00:58:46.000" style="s2">found out about christ like oh i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.119" end="00:58:47.470" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.000" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">and then did it so</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.470" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:52.799" style="s2">what part of christianity remains is</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:54.640" style="s2">really hard to say i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.799" end="00:58:56.079" style="s2">i think it&#39;s almost gone and i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.640" end="00:58:59.599" style="s2">definitely the reformation was</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.079" end="00:59:01.040" style="s2">was pretty much the the loss of that of</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.599" end="00:59:02.640" style="s2">what was left in an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.040" end="00:59:05.760" style="s2">rediscover it</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.640" end="00:59:08.720" style="s2">but the church and its countless splits</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.760" end="00:59:12.240" style="s2">and its its wealth of dogma</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.720" end="00:59:14.079" style="s2">it blinds the christian to the cross</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.240" end="00:59:15.599" style="s2">nietzsche&#39;s big point is that there was</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:17.200" style="s2">only one christian</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.599" end="00:59:19.040" style="s2">and he died on the cross and everything</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.200" end="00:59:22.160" style="s2">after that has been</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.040" end="00:59:23.359" style="s2">a misinterpretation of the life of</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.160" end="00:59:25.839" style="s2">christ</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.359" end="00:59:27.119" style="s2">so the cross in a way has come to</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.839" end="00:59:30.240" style="s2">symbolize</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.119" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">the church more than it did christ and</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.240" end="00:59:32.960" style="s2">it is that</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:34.720" style="s2">i think that and it&#39;s so if you read</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.960" end="00:59:37.119" style="s2">nietzsche it&#39;s a very early point</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.720" end="00:59:38.160" style="s2">when the symbolism of the cross becomes</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.119" end="00:59:40.319" style="s2">perverted</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.160" end="00:59:42.559" style="s2">uh another really good example is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.319" end="00:59:44.880" style="s2">the pentagram and the pentacle</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.559" end="00:59:46.240" style="s2">the upright five-pointed star is</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.880" end="00:59:48.960" style="s2">considered good</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.240" end="00:59:50.799" style="s2">and the reverse is evil in the devil and</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.960" end="00:59:52.720" style="s2">this is something that levi talks about</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.799" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">that that is how magicians</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.720" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">play you take a symbol and you turn it</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">upside down or you</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.400" end="01:00:00.000" style="s2">turn it a certain way and you&#39;ve gained</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:01.920" style="s2">power you&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.000" end="01:00:03.280" style="s2">something to it and affected the way</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.920" end="01:00:06.559" style="s2">it&#39;s viewed</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.280" end="01:00:09.920" style="s2">but the idea for for the</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.559" end="01:00:10.640" style="s2">the pentagram is that upright the fifth</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.920" end="01:00:13.920" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.640" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">is your head that the four points of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.920" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">star are your limbs</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:20.000" style="s2">and then reversed it&#39;s the penis or the</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.839" end="01:00:20.960" style="s2">genitals which is why it&#39;s the devil it</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.000" end="01:00:24.319" style="s2">is the genital</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.960" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">sexual um base devil</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.319" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s very interesting to see how</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">these symbols are able to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:33.839" style="s2">perverted and diverted into new forms</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.200" end="01:00:38.480" style="s2">when we were interested about a few of</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:40.880" style="s2">us in the comments there is about</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.480" end="01:00:42.079" style="s2">christian fish as well</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.880" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">do you have anything you&#39;d like to add</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.079" end="01:00:44.799" style="s2">about that it&#39;s it seems really</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:47.040" style="s2">interesting about the christian fish in</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.799" end="01:00:48.720" style="s2">the age of pisces and um</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.040" end="01:00:50.319" style="s2">i noticed a few years ago that john</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.720" end="01:00:51.200" style="s2">podesta thinks the fish is quite</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.319" end="01:00:52.720" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.200" end="01:00:54.480" style="s2">and when john podesta thinks something</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.720" end="01:00:56.000" style="s2">is important i&#39;m inclined to agree with</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.480" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">him and want to know what he&#39;s up to</p>

<p begin="01:00:59.920" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">so jung has a whole book about the fish</p>

<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:11.359" style="s2">ion and so the two fish</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.599" end="01:01:31.359" style="s2">and this is one of my thoughts there&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">side especially post</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.200" end="01:03:47.440" style="s2">2016. um so</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:48.079" style="s2">yeah absolutely i don&#39;t i i highly doubt</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.440" end="01:03:51.280" style="s2">there are</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.079" end="01:03:54.319" style="s2">any high up enough pr people</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.280" end="01:03:56.000" style="s2">or anybody who designs logos or makes</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.319" end="01:03:59.200" style="s2">films that is not aware</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.000" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">of jungian symbolism a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.200" end="01:04:02.240" style="s2">a lot of authors are just very outright</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:04.799" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.240" end="01:04:06.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s good because if we could if we</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.799" end="01:04:09.039" style="s2">could make these ideas</p>
<p begin="01:04:06.319" end="01:04:11.440" style="s2">conscious in the population if there was</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.039" end="01:04:13.200" style="s2">a psycho-educated population</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.440" end="01:04:14.880" style="s2">much of the symbolism would fail and it</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.200" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">would be much more difficult for people</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.880" end="01:04:17.839" style="s2">to manipulate it</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:19.599" style="s2">because like we&#39;re pretty much playing a</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.839" end="01:04:20.400" style="s2">game that&#39;s been played for hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.599" end="01:04:22.240" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.400" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">if we could get everybody to read the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.240" end="01:04:25.440" style="s2">rule book you&#39;d have to play a new one</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">and things would be much more</p>
<p begin="01:04:25.440" end="01:04:27.839" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.960" end="01:04:36.000" style="s2">all right um so let&#39;s see we have one</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.720" end="01:04:40.240" style="s2">more question</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.000" end="01:04:42.160" style="s2">dan you had a question um on susan</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.240" end="01:04:42.799" style="s2">blackmore who was on the stoa last week</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.160" end="01:04:44.480" style="s2">as well</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.799" end="01:04:47.039" style="s2">um so you&#39;re gonna mute yourself dan and</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.480" end="01:04:47.039" style="s2">ask your question</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:53.280" style="s2">yeah hey so what&#39;s your</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.119" end="01:04:54.400" style="s2">main distinctions between your own</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.280" end="01:04:58.000" style="s2">theory of mimetics</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.400" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">and suzanne blackmore&#39;s like the meme</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.000" end="01:05:01.039" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">or dawkins definition or i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.039" end="01:05:04.400" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of daniel dennis</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.640" end="01:05:08.559" style="s2">i haven&#39;t read any of i haven&#39;t read any</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.640" end="01:05:12.000" style="s2">of them um</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.559" end="01:05:15.680" style="s2">but my my theory of mimetics is based</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.000" end="01:05:19.599" style="s2">in jungian archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.680" end="01:05:21.920" style="s2">and burrows uh viruses</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.599" end="01:05:23.039" style="s2">so i&#39;m approaching it from a more</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.920" end="01:05:26.160" style="s2">distinctly</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.039" end="01:05:28.160" style="s2">archaic religious and occult</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.160" end="01:05:29.440" style="s2">sensibility so if it happens to</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.160" end="01:05:32.799" style="s2">correspond</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.440" end="01:05:36.079" style="s2">with a more scientific um</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.799" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">or analytic rational viewpoint then</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.079" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">it shows that you know both are on to</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:41.280" style="s2">the same phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.559" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">isaias you had a question i was</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.559" end="01:05:48.799" style="s2">wondering if you</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:51.119" style="s2">if chris you could give your</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.799" end="01:05:53.920" style="s2">interpretation of the law of dilemma</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.119" end="01:05:57.039" style="s2">for modern digital times and especially</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.920" end="01:05:59.440" style="s2">now during the pandemic</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.039" end="01:06:00.400" style="s2">that&#39;s a great question um and i was</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.440" end="01:06:02.079" style="s2">thinking about this because i was</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.400" end="01:06:06.319" style="s2">thinking about a christian</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.079" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">symbol today there is the idea of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.319" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">the straight and narrow path to heaven</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:15.200" style="s2">and the highway to hell</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:18.799" style="s2">and a lot of people desperately want</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.200" end="01:06:20.559" style="s2">do what thou wilt to mean um</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.799" end="01:06:22.880" style="s2">just you know speed on the highway to</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.559" end="01:06:25.359" style="s2">hell and it&#39;s not that at all</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.880" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">um it is in fact the very opposite it is</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.359" end="01:06:29.520" style="s2">the most</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:31.920" style="s2">narrow the most difficult path</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.520" end="01:06:32.559" style="s2">is to do what that will to do your own</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.920" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">will</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.559" end="01:06:38.640" style="s2">is the most difficult imaginable thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.240" end="01:06:39.920" style="s2">um and carly talks about this in magic</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.640" end="01:06:42.960" style="s2">without tears like</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.920" end="01:06:44.079" style="s2">every single decision has to be weighed</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.960" end="01:06:47.359" style="s2">according to your own</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.079" end="01:06:49.440" style="s2">personal moral viewpoint uh there is no</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.359" end="01:06:50.480" style="s2">preset morality there is no ten</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.440" end="01:06:53.039" style="s2">commandments</p>

<p begin="01:06:53.039" end="01:06:56.559" style="s2">this my will like is this</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.720" end="01:06:58.000" style="s2">the right thing i should be doing how</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.559" end="01:07:00.559" style="s2">many people can do that</p>
<p begin="01:06:58.000" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">and on the internet my god um where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.559" end="01:07:04.000" style="s2">all manufactured to consent</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:06.559" style="s2">every viewpoint every choice is</p>

<p begin="01:07:09.280" end="01:07:13.520" style="s2">fun with the internet</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.319" end="01:07:16.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve made my my philosophical</p>

<p begin="01:07:16.480" end="01:07:19.599" style="s2">almost always just like this is pretty</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.480" end="01:07:21.839" style="s2">dangerous</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.599" end="01:07:24.000" style="s2">um but when you see me in the future</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.839" end="01:07:27.200" style="s2">it&#39;s probably going to be me having fun</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">using these ideas to do exciting</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.200" end="01:07:34.319" style="s2">magical operations um so</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:35.839" style="s2">yeah to do the law to do what thou wilt</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.319" end="01:07:37.359" style="s2">uh it certainly is not</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.839" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look like being addicted to</p>

<p begin="01:08:04.799" end="01:08:07.920" style="s2">and neuter them of their hijacking</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.480" end="01:08:10.799" style="s2">potential and</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.920" end="01:08:11.760" style="s2">just to speak on sort of how i kind of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.799" end="01:08:14.400" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.760" end="01:08:15.680" style="s2">uh so i&#39;m a practicing stoic um and one</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.400" end="01:08:16.400" style="s2">thing that&#39;s great about stoicism is</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.680" end="01:08:18.319" style="s2">they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.400" end="01:08:20.000" style="s2">reframe game is pretty tight if you</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.319" end="01:08:22.839" style="s2">follow the stoic algorithm</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.000" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">um and couple that with kind of somatic</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.839" end="01:08:27.040" style="s2">practices um</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:28.880" style="s2">like when i review memetic tribes i</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.040" end="01:08:30.640" style="s2">allow them to kind of infect my body in</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.880" end="01:08:32.480" style="s2">a way and feel what they feel</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.640" end="01:08:33.679" style="s2">and so kind of map the content to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.480" end="01:08:35.199" style="s2">emotional reality</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.679" end="01:08:36.480" style="s2">but if i&#39;m also afforded the meta</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.199" end="01:08:38.000" style="s2">distance when i do that if you keep</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.480" end="01:08:39.679" style="s2">doing the reframe thing</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.000" end="01:08:41.839" style="s2">so i&#39;m curious if you think there&#39;s any</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.679" end="01:08:44.159" style="s2">kind of uh philosophies</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.839" end="01:08:44.880" style="s2">or practices that are good for that or</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.159" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">superior</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.880" end="01:08:49.040" style="s2">uh or more superior than others yeah in</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:51.120" style="s2">my personal context</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.040" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">you know i use the tarot i use tarot</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.120" end="01:08:56.239" style="s2">cards a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:58.480" style="s2">and i&#39;m a big fan of stories narratives</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.239" end="01:08:59.920" style="s2">if you can look at a meme and you can</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.480" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.920" end="01:09:04.960" style="s2">what it arose from what it speaks to in</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:06.799" style="s2">other people</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.960" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">because if you&#39;re really good at tara</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.799" end="01:09:10.960" style="s2">you you can see</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:12.159" style="s2">the presence of an archetype in</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.960" end="01:09:13.600" style="s2">something external</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.159" end="01:09:16.000" style="s2">because that&#39;s what the whole point of</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.600" end="01:09:17.520" style="s2">reading is is like you take these images</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.000" end="01:09:19.520" style="s2">these very old images and you say well</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.520" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">this relates to this in my own life</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.520" end="01:09:23.359" style="s2">or this relates to this other thing and</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:23.679" style="s2">if you just get really good at that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.359" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.679" end="01:09:30.000" style="s2">really good at a simple um</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:32.719" style="s2">symbolic language</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.000" end="01:09:34.000" style="s2">you will be very good at things i think</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.719" end="01:09:35.040" style="s2">it&#39;s unfortunate because you see a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.000" end="01:09:37.120" style="s2">of people they get really</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.040" end="01:09:39.040" style="s2">into fiction they get really into star</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.120" end="01:09:41.120" style="s2">wars or really into harry potter</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.040" end="01:09:42.319" style="s2">or marvel and they understand the</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.120" end="01:09:44.319" style="s2">narrative there</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.319" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">they might even do deep analysis of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.319" end="01:09:46.880" style="s2">but they can&#39;t apply it to their own</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.880" end="01:09:49.839" style="s2">because like i was saying about the</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:51.759" style="s2">internet they don&#39;t use it as a tool</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.839" end="01:09:54.880" style="s2">they use it as a pastime</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.759" end="01:09:57.040" style="s2">they don&#39;t actually believe in it</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.880" end="01:09:58.000" style="s2">when you have a narrative that you</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.040" end="01:10:00.640" style="s2">believe in</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.000" end="01:10:01.679" style="s2">which is what religion used to be you</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.640" end="01:10:04.159" style="s2">can then use that</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.679" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">symbolic framework to take apart</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.159" end="01:10:07.679" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:09.520" style="s2">uh and to not be easily swayed because</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.679" end="01:10:11.520" style="s2">you think well this is just like this</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.520" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">so when you see those memes mocking and</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.520" end="01:10:13.520" style="s2">it does it makes me cringe but when</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:15.120" style="s2">people like</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.520" end="01:10:17.280" style="s2">oh this political figure is just like</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.120" end="01:10:19.199" style="s2">voldemort or this person was like</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.280" end="01:10:20.640" style="s2">you know this was dumbledore or this</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.199" end="01:10:23.040" style="s2">person&#39;s like darth vader</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.640" end="01:10:24.480" style="s2">like it&#39;s a very very simple symbolic</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.040" end="01:10:26.000" style="s2">calculus</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.480" end="01:10:28.000" style="s2">but they&#39;re they&#39;re heading in the right</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.000" end="01:10:28.640" style="s2">direction if they can really commit to</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.000" end="01:10:31.520" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.640" end="01:10:32.800" style="s2">and think this world is structured like</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.520" end="01:10:33.920" style="s2">star wars</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.800" end="01:10:35.760" style="s2">they&#39;re going to be they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.920" end="01:10:38.000" style="s2">a pretty fair jungian because star wars</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.760" end="01:10:39.920" style="s2">is is a directly jungian tale</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.000" end="01:10:42.400" style="s2">if you could really commit to that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.920" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">could really understand that story well</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.400" end="01:10:46.719" style="s2">you would you would do pretty well so</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.960" style="s2">commit to a narrative</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.719" end="01:10:50.960" style="s2">even if it&#39;s one that you you choose to</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.960" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">create or you choose to believe in</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.960" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">you can commit to that narrative and</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:55.360" style="s2">then you can apply it everything and</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:57.679" style="s2">everything else</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.360" end="01:10:59.520" style="s2">that would be perfect that is the way</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.679" end="01:11:02.320" style="s2">out understanding</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.520" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">symbolism in one context and applying it</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.320" end="01:11:04.719" style="s2">elsewhere</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.640" end="01:11:09.920" style="s2">what&#39;s your thought on do you know that</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.080" end="01:11:10.640" style="s2">the satanic group i think it&#39;s the order</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">of the nine</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.640" end="01:11:15.760" style="s2">angles i think and then they have um</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:17.199" style="s2">in order for their initiation they have</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.760" end="01:11:18.880" style="s2">something called insight roles where</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.199" end="01:11:19.280" style="s2">they go into these extremist groups like</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.880" end="01:11:21.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.280" end="01:11:23.280" style="s2">islamic terrorist groups or neo-nazi</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.120" end="01:11:25.040" style="s2">groups they just really embody them</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.280" end="01:11:26.640" style="s2">in order to dismantle sort of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.040" end="01:11:29.040" style="s2">intersubjective prison that</p>
<p begin="01:11:26.640" end="01:11:30.400" style="s2">you know civilization provides to kind</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.040" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">of free their minds but then they leave</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.400" end="01:11:32.480" style="s2">the group</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:34.640" style="s2">do you think something like that is</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.480" end="01:11:37.360" style="s2">useful with um going to these weird</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.640" end="01:11:38.880" style="s2">uh eclectic places on the internet</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.360" end="01:11:42.000" style="s2">that&#39;s a great point that&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.880" end="01:11:42.880" style="s2">important element in chaos magic you</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.000" end="01:11:45.600" style="s2">roll the dice</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.880" end="01:11:46.400" style="s2">you give um each face of the dice a</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:49.760" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.400" end="01:11:51.679" style="s2">or a cult and you roll it and every um</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.760" end="01:11:52.960" style="s2">every week you pick a new one or every</p>
<p begin="01:11:51.679" end="01:11:54.000" style="s2">day you pick a new one and you</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.960" end="01:11:57.199" style="s2">wholeheartedly</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.000" end="01:11:58.719" style="s2">commit and you act as if it is true</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.199" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">so and it is something that wilson</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.719" end="01:12:01.840" style="s2">wilson talks about as well uh robert</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:04.159" style="s2">anton wilson</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.840" end="01:12:06.000" style="s2">so that is a very important part of</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.159" end="01:12:07.440" style="s2">liberating your mind from methods of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.000" end="01:12:10.239" style="s2">control</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.440" end="01:12:10.960" style="s2">when i say to commit to an idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.239" end="01:12:14.159" style="s2">definitely</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.960" end="01:12:14.159" style="s2">not a way of</p>
