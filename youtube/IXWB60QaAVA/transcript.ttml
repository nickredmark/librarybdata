<p begin="00:02:59.250" end="00:03:03.160" style="s2">contemplation is about looking deeply at</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.330" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">work and you need the two together</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.160" end="00:03:08.050" style="s2">think about our metaphor of standing</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:08.860" style="s2">back and looking at the glasses in</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.050" end="00:03:10.930" style="s2">meditation</p>

<p begin="00:03:10.930" end="00:03:16.450" style="s2">standing back looking at right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.450" end="00:03:17.980" style="s2">good looking at the mind rather than</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.450" end="00:03:20.050" style="s2">automatically through it I hope you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.980" end="00:03:23.470" style="s2">getting to see I&#39;m useful and important</p>

<p begin="00:03:24.990" end="00:03:30.940" style="s2">how do you know if you know no longer</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.930" end="00:03:33.400" style="s2">your glasses are no longer distorting</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.940" end="00:03:35.020" style="s2">your vision we have to put them on you</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.400" end="00:03:38.500" style="s2">have to put them on and look out and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.020" end="00:03:42.400" style="s2">if you can now see they&#39;re friendly you</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.500" end="00:03:44.550" style="s2">see um you complement meditation with</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.400" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">contemplation you&#39;re not actually</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.550" end="00:03:50.170" style="s2">engaging in a process of transformation</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:52.900" style="s2">you need to be doing the two together</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.170" end="00:03:56.320" style="s2">this is of course one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.900" end="00:03:58.570" style="s2">my work on insight is you need right</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.320" end="00:04:00.880" style="s2">when I didn&#39;t say you you have to step</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.570" end="00:04:04.590" style="s2">back from the inappropriate framing</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.880" end="00:04:08.050" style="s2">you&#39;re in but you often look through</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.590" end="00:04:11.080" style="s2">right to a new and more encompassing</p>

<p begin="00:04:11.080" end="00:04:15.580" style="s2">for this that has been sort of actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.450" end="00:04:18.160" style="s2">reduced it meaning to just meaning an</p>

<p begin="00:04:18.160" end="00:04:23.740" style="s2">have to break the old frame but you have</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.859" end="00:04:26.150" style="s2">to move through to the new frame so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.740" end="00:04:28.910" style="s2">meditation and contemplation are not</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.150" end="00:04:30.710" style="s2">ethical they compliment and correct and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.910" end="00:04:33.410" style="s2">need each other</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.710" end="00:04:36.430" style="s2">and I was privileged as a as I said to</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.410" end="00:04:38.539" style="s2">be taught of these three together</p>

<p begin="00:04:46.130" end="00:04:53.210" style="s2">about much later in the course</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.419" end="00:04:55.070" style="s2">Praja wisdom okay so meta okay so now we</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.210" end="00:04:57.080" style="s2">face another issue because meta is</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.070" end="00:05:02.960" style="s2">become quite popular in North America</p>

<p begin="00:05:20.510" end="00:05:25.400" style="s2">sits well with our best cognitive</p>

<p begin="00:05:41.240" end="00:05:44.840" style="s2">emotional interpretation is that meta is</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.130" end="00:05:51.500" style="s2">largely about generating positive</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.840" end="00:05:54.860" style="s2">feelings towards all beers and this is</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.500" end="00:05:57.139" style="s2">problematic yet in a lot of ways first</p>

<p begin="00:05:57.139" end="00:06:02.240" style="s2">and that it confuses emotions with what</p>

<p begin="00:07:03.109" end="00:07:07.969" style="s2">Old English is what&#39;s called the why by</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.729" end="00:07:11.029" style="s2">the way I had to do with initially</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.969" end="00:07:13.849" style="s2">causing an increase and then later with</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.029" end="00:07:16.399" style="s2">noble deeds you see it was it was the</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.849" end="00:07:18.529" style="s2">act of sort of opening things up in a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.399" end="00:07:20.839" style="s2">virtuous manner now think of the word</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.529" end="00:07:23.419" style="s2">virtue the word virtue like virtual</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.839" end="00:07:26.029" style="s2">virtue is having a power having a</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.419" end="00:07:28.519" style="s2">capacity so what if I have the virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.029" end="00:07:32.509" style="s2">courage I have the capacity to see</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.519" end="00:07:36.379" style="s2">through the illusions of fear into what</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.509" end="00:07:38.029" style="s2">needs to be done if I have the combined</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.379" end="00:07:41.449" style="s2">the virtue of temperance I have the</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.449" end="00:07:48.009" style="s2">greed and do what needs to be done so</p>

<p begin="00:07:48.009" end="00:07:54.589" style="s2">which is a positive existential attitude</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.139" end="00:07:56.479" style="s2">for sure and it affords a virtue it</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.589" end="00:07:58.509" style="s2">gives me the power to see through a kind</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.479" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">of a lesion into what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.509" end="00:08:02.869" style="s2">see the word loving-kindness is this</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:06.439" style="s2">hybrid word because it&#39;s specifically</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.869" end="00:08:08.269" style="s2">not an emotional term it&#39;s an inter</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.439" end="00:08:10.459" style="s2">categorical term it&#39;s trying to put</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.269" end="00:08:12.529" style="s2">together things that that for which we</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.459" end="00:08:13.309" style="s2">don&#39;t have a singular English term it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.529" end="00:08:16.219" style="s2">putting together</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.309" end="00:08:19.899" style="s2">there&#39;s existential stance of love love</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.219" end="00:08:21.049" style="s2">and active and kindness which is virtue</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.899" end="00:08:25.069" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.049" end="00:08:26.989" style="s2">so let&#39;s say that like what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.069" end="00:08:29.419" style="s2">are there positive emotions being</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.989" end="00:08:31.309" style="s2">invoked in Metta yes I&#39;ll explain those</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.419" end="00:08:33.559" style="s2">to you but what I want you to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.309" end="00:08:36.379" style="s2">is that the positive emotions are not</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.559" end="00:08:38.089" style="s2">the goal that&#39;s the that&#39;s I think the</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.379" end="00:08:39.889" style="s2">primary mistake of the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.089" end="00:08:43.480" style="s2">interpretation of Metta the positive</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.889" end="00:08:47.509" style="s2">emotions are a method by which we get an</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.480" end="00:08:49.309" style="s2">existential stance that allows us to see</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.509" end="00:08:52.830" style="s2">through an important kind of a lesion</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.309" end="00:08:54.750" style="s2">and into what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.830" end="00:08:57.660" style="s2">so what is an existential mode then if</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.750" end="00:08:59.880" style="s2">the emotional interpretation of meta is</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.660" end="00:09:00.690" style="s2">inadequate it&#39;s too simplistic it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.880" end="00:09:04.070" style="s2">truncate it</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.690" end="00:09:06.390" style="s2">what is this deeper meaning well</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.070" end="00:09:07.860" style="s2">thankfully we have two really important</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.390" end="00:09:09.630" style="s2">sources both of them who were deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.860" end="00:09:11.730" style="s2">familiar with the Buddhist tradition we</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.630" end="00:09:14.400" style="s2">have erich fromm and he was also deeply</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.730" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">familiar with historic tradition because</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.400" end="00:09:17.610" style="s2">this what I&#39;m going to talk about was</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.660" end="00:09:19.410" style="s2">also discovered basically I think in</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.610" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">this dark tradition and we have Stephen</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.410" end="00:09:23.010" style="s2">Baxter in his book on Buddhism an</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:26.100" style="s2">existential interpretation of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.010" end="00:09:27.900" style="s2">called alone with others okay let&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.100" end="00:09:31.050" style="s2">is an existential mode so what I want</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.900" end="00:09:33.810" style="s2">you to think about is a process that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.050" end="00:09:36.470" style="s2">all happening all the time but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.810" end="00:09:39.150" style="s2">normally happening automatically</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.470" end="00:09:41.570" style="s2">unconsciously and reactively what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.150" end="00:09:44.760" style="s2">process it&#39;s a process that I call pel</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.570" end="00:09:46.470" style="s2">identification what does that mean it</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.760" end="00:09:49.020" style="s2">means that whenever I go into any</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.470" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">situation I&#39;m automatically assuming a</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.020" end="00:09:54.210" style="s2">particular identity right now I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:57.840" style="s2">teacher and I&#39;m automatically assigning</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.210" end="00:10:01.370" style="s2">identities you&#39;re my students this wall</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.840" end="00:10:04.200" style="s2">isn&#39;t just the wall it&#39;s it&#39;s my support</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.370" end="00:10:06.630" style="s2">right because I&#39;m assuming the identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.200" end="00:10:08.400" style="s2">of a meditator when I&#39;m not assuming the</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.630" end="00:10:10.650" style="s2">identity of a meditator this isn&#39;t to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.400" end="00:10:14.600" style="s2">support it&#39;s just a wall it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.650" end="00:10:17.340" style="s2">barrier so I&#39;m always assuming an</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.600" end="00:10:18.870" style="s2">identity and an assigning an identity</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.340" end="00:10:20.790" style="s2">and we&#39;re doing this both with other</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.870" end="00:10:24.750" style="s2">people and as I just indicated with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.790" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">wall with objects so the existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.750" end="00:10:31.310" style="s2">mode is how that process of Co</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:34.770" style="s2">identification is is occurring in you</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.310" end="00:10:36.960" style="s2">now the thing about this and this is was</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.770" end="00:10:38.790" style="s2">Erich Fromm&#39;s deep insight but Steven</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.960" end="00:10:40.200" style="s2">Batchelor came to it independently many</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.790" end="00:10:42.510" style="s2">people have actually converged on this</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.200" end="00:10:45.660" style="s2">across different wisdom traditions both</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.510" end="00:10:47.910" style="s2">Western and Eastern is that there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.660" end="00:10:49.380" style="s2">really important existential modes we</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.910" end="00:10:51.360" style="s2">have to talk about they&#39;re oriented</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.380" end="00:10:54.660" style="s2">around some of our fundamental needs</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.360" end="00:10:57.570" style="s2">let&#39;s talk about one that from calls the</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.660" end="00:10:59.370" style="s2">having mode the having mode is your</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.570" end="00:11:01.670" style="s2">existential mode the kind of identities</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.370" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">you assume and assign and those are Co</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.670" end="00:11:06.450" style="s2">determining when you&#39;re trying to meet</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:06.720" style="s2">your having needs these are needs that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.450" end="00:11:08.970" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.720" end="00:11:11.160" style="s2">by having something I need to have water</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.970" end="00:11:13.550" style="s2">I need to have food there is nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.160" end="00:11:16.560" style="s2">immoral or wrong about this by the way I</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.550" end="00:11:18.660" style="s2">don&#39;t have water and I don&#39;t have food</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.560" end="00:11:21.060" style="s2">if I prefer if I pursue that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.660" end="00:11:24.410" style="s2">self-denial which was rejected</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.060" end="00:11:28.500" style="s2">ultimately by the Buddha then I will die</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.410" end="00:11:30.959" style="s2">so notice what I have to do that control</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.500" end="00:11:33.120" style="s2">of things I have to bring them under my</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.959" end="00:11:37.019" style="s2">control I have to be able to consume</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.120" end="00:11:38.699" style="s2">them oxygen water air shelter we consume</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.019" end="00:11:40.980" style="s2">shelter away and we&#39;re aware of all of</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.699" end="00:11:43.589" style="s2">this very acutely right now all right</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.980" end="00:11:45.779" style="s2">this is very important and notice</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.589" end="00:11:48.269" style="s2">something about these needs right</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.779" end="00:11:50.910" style="s2">they require me to solve problems very</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.269" end="00:11:53.759" style="s2">readily and in order to do that the kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.910" end="00:11:56.610" style="s2">of identities I assigned to things are</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.759" end="00:11:58.430" style="s2">categorical identities this is the</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.430" end="00:12:04.230" style="s2">category because when it belongs to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.500" end="00:12:06.810" style="s2">category I can predict its behavior I</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.230" end="00:12:08.459" style="s2">can familiarize myself with it I can</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.810" end="00:12:11.730" style="s2">control and manipulate it to solve my</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.459" end="00:12:14.100" style="s2">problems this is a pen I readily and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.730" end="00:12:16.379" style="s2">quickly recognize it as a pen it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.100" end="00:12:17.220" style="s2">it reminds me of many other pans I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:12:17.220" end="00:12:22.970" style="s2">if I lose this pen I readily know what</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.970" end="00:12:29.759" style="s2">that&#39;s good because I need to be able to</p>

<p begin="00:12:29.759" end="00:12:33.689" style="s2">this is the follow Martin Buber this is</p>
