<p begin="00:00:03.840" end="00:00:08.340" style="s2">we&#39;ve reached 250 patrons on the patreon</p>

<p begin="00:00:08.340" end="00:00:12.750" style="s2">the landscape of ideas to be covered is</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.800" end="00:00:14.490" style="s2">complicated but I think I found a way to</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.750" end="00:00:16.109" style="s2">do this so that it will be intuitive for</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.490" end="00:00:18.000" style="s2">those with little prior exposure to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.109" end="00:00:20.310" style="s2">kind of thinking you&#39;ll start seeing</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.000" end="00:00:21.689" style="s2">that soon number of people have</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.310" end="00:00:24.390" style="s2">expressed an interest in continuing</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.689" end="00:00:25.920" style="s2">developments in the evergreen story in</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.390" end="00:00:27.869" style="s2">an effort not to pollute the science</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.920" end="00:00:29.460" style="s2">with a necessary controversy I will</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.869" end="00:00:31.800" style="s2">provide those updates in a separate</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.460" end="00:00:34.200" style="s2">playlist on the YouTube channel but be</p>

<p begin="00:00:34.200" end="00:00:38.850" style="s2">as it approaches humans is in no way</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.750" end="00:00:40.850" style="s2">politically correct this is not a safe</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.850" end="00:00:43.260" style="s2">space and there will be no taboos that</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.850" end="00:00:45.239" style="s2">said some of what I am interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.260" end="00:00:47.250" style="s2">doing is understanding the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.239" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">basis for unconscionable human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.250" end="00:00:52.410" style="s2">so that we might eliminate them in the</p>

<p begin="00:00:52.410" end="00:00:56.190" style="s2">going to take this opportunity to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.090" end="00:00:59.070" style="s2">about a little piece of related material</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.190" end="00:01:00.899" style="s2">the evolutionary basis of gratitude what</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.070" end="00:01:03.000" style="s2">I present here is formally speaking a</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.899" end="00:01:04.799" style="s2">hypothesis it is in fact the very first</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.000" end="00:01:06.570" style="s2">lesson that I taught to my first</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.799" end="00:01:08.990" style="s2">students at Evergreen and everything</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.570" end="00:01:11.549" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen since is consistent with it</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.990" end="00:01:15.650" style="s2">let&#39;s take on four related concepts</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.549" end="00:01:17.850" style="s2">gratitude guilt indignation and apology</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.650" end="00:01:20.610" style="s2">gratitude is the expression of an</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.850" end="00:01:22.710" style="s2">honorable debt I thank you right now for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.610" end="00:01:24.210" style="s2">coming along with me on this journey you</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.710" end="00:01:25.979" style="s2">have agreed to support this channel and</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.210" end="00:01:28.140" style="s2">are making it possible for me to bring</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.979" end="00:01:29.729" style="s2">this evolutionary material to a larger</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.140" end="00:01:33.110" style="s2">audience which I have long wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.729" end="00:01:35.460" style="s2">I am indebted to you for your support</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.110" end="00:01:38.390" style="s2">guilt is the imposition of a debt on</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.460" end="00:01:41.280" style="s2">oneself which is experienced as shame</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.390" end="00:01:43.579" style="s2">indignation is like an invoice here is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.280" end="00:01:46.350" style="s2">debt that you have yet to recognize</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.579" end="00:01:47.909" style="s2">apology is slightly more complex it</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.350" end="00:01:50.040" style="s2">contains an expression of indebtedness</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.909" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">that can be cashed in and is also a</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.040" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">communication of awareness of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">specific nature of the harm done by</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:58.290" style="s2">conveying that I know what I did wrong</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">the apologizer also increases the cost</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.290" end="00:02:02.700" style="s2">of themselves if they engage in the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:04.170" style="s2">thing in the future an apology is thus a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.700" end="00:02:07.350" style="s2">kind of insurance against the same</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.170" end="00:02:09.119" style="s2">behavior repeating itself once you start</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.350" end="00:02:10.770" style="s2">thinking about apologies this way it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.119" end="00:02:12.810" style="s2">interesting to watch the tiny debts that</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.770" end="00:02:13.770" style="s2">cause most apologies and the release</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.810" end="00:02:16.050" style="s2">from debt the general</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.770" end="00:02:18.270" style="s2">follows you bump into somebody you say</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.050" end="00:02:21.450" style="s2">I&#39;m very sorry and they say there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.270" end="00:02:23.100" style="s2">problem or it was my fault it is also</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.450" end="00:02:25.260" style="s2">interesting to recognize the effects of</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.100" end="00:02:28.230" style="s2">in sincere apologies an insincere</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.260" end="00:02:30.090" style="s2">apology exacerbates the harm done if</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.230" end="00:02:32.130" style="s2">somebody says for example I&#39;m very sorry</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.090" end="00:02:33.540" style="s2">that you felt hurt by what I said they</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.130" end="00:02:36.480" style="s2">are not acknowledging that they said</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.540" end="00:02:38.300" style="s2">something hurtful a sincere apology on</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.480" end="00:02:40.890" style="s2">the other hand mitigates harm</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.300" end="00:02:43.440" style="s2">so in summary gratitude guilt</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.890" end="00:02:46.260" style="s2">indignation and apology gratitude is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.440" end="00:02:47.880" style="s2">expression of honorable debt guilt is</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.260" end="00:02:49.890" style="s2">the imposition of a debt on oneself</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.880" end="00:02:52.740" style="s2">which is experienced a shame and likely</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.890" end="00:02:54.570" style="s2">leads to an apology indignation is an</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.740" end="00:02:56.970" style="s2">invoice here is a debt that you have yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.570" end="00:02:58.800" style="s2">to recognize apology is both an</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.970" end="00:03:00.750" style="s2">expression of indebtedness and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.800" end="00:03:02.690" style="s2">protection to those harmed against</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.750" end="00:03:05.310" style="s2">suffering similar harm in the future I</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.690" end="00:03:06.990" style="s2">am grateful to you all for joining this</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.310" end="00:03:11.600" style="s2">effort and for being early adopters</p>
