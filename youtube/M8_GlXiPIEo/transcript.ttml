<p begin="00:00:11.639" end="00:00:16.859" style="s2">cooperative which means it has to be run</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.380" end="00:00:18.810" style="s2">as a democracy one-person one-vote there</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.859" end="00:00:21.000" style="s2">can be some caveats to that as in</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.810" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">workers might get two votes one is a</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.000" end="00:00:25.769" style="s2">member and one is an employee but it&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="00:00:40.860" end="00:00:45.980" style="s2">as somebody else even if there&#39;s ways to</p>

<p begin="00:00:45.980" end="00:00:50.430" style="s2">folds of magnitude that currently exists</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.660" end="00:00:51.930" style="s2">in our democracies or if you have money</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.430" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">and you have power you get to decide who</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.930" end="00:00:57.239" style="s2">is up on the ticket and therefore that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">a lot more power than getting to give</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.239" end="00:01:03.120" style="s2">your one vote so how do we make sure if</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:06.510" style="s2">we are a democracy a democratic</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:08.670" style="s2">corporation a cooperative that we aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.510" end="00:01:11.820" style="s2">run like what how we see our country is</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.670" end="00:01:15.240" style="s2">being run with very few people in power</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.820" end="00:01:18.950" style="s2">and they retain the power because we</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.240" end="00:01:21.689" style="s2">don&#39;t have the media&#39;s owned by them the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.950" end="00:01:24.900" style="s2">they kind of get to run the the message</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.689" end="00:01:27.049" style="s2">of what it takes to be in office and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.900" end="00:01:29.220" style="s2">we&#39;re not electing scientists right</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.049" end="00:01:32.460" style="s2">because we need economists and business</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.220" end="00:01:35.909" style="s2">people political science majors to be to</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.460" end="00:01:39.060" style="s2">be in office they are currently able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.909" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">very easily run on a platform get</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.060" end="00:01:42.930" style="s2">elected and go back on a platform with</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:44.720" style="s2">no repercussions besides maybe not</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.930" end="00:01:47.040" style="s2">getting elected again in four years and</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.720" end="00:01:49.500" style="s2">with a four-year term</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.040" end="00:01:51.390" style="s2">they know our we have very little memory</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.500" end="00:01:52.439" style="s2">they know they can go back and promises</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.390" end="00:01:54.500" style="s2">and still probably get elected</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.439" end="00:01:56.850" style="s2">especially they go back at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.500" end="00:01:59.009" style="s2">they know that well there&#39;s nothing they</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.850" end="00:02:00.600" style="s2">can do for four years and that also</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.009" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">doesn&#39;t help us move our countries</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.600" end="00:02:03.780" style="s2">forward because someone put something</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">into place for four years the next</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.780" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">person has to roll it back and put their</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:09.000" style="s2">thing into place for four years it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:10.670" style="s2">both too long to be a real democracy and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.000" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">too short to be effective</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.670" end="00:02:16.400" style="s2">we are going to create a system that the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:20.120" style="s2">people who&#39;ve put those people in power</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.400" end="00:02:23.120" style="s2">the voters retain their power what that</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.120" end="00:02:25.220" style="s2">looks like is you delegate your vote to</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.120" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">somebody once a year there&#39;s an election</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.220" end="00:02:30.020" style="s2">and that just means the top people with</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:32.180" style="s2">delegated votes at midnight on this day</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.020" end="00:02:37.459" style="s2">get to be on the board of directors the</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.180" end="00:02:40.730" style="s2">top 10 people let&#39;s say now those 10</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.459" end="00:02:43.370" style="s2">people don&#39;t have equal power at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.730" end="00:02:45.830" style="s2">table we get equal voice we get to talk</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.370" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">and say how they feel they got to help</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.830" end="00:02:50.390" style="s2">in the making of the decision but when</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:52.489" style="s2">it comes time to vote their power is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.390" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">reflective of how many members have</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.489" end="00:02:57.170" style="s2">delegated their vote to them so if you</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:03:00.470" style="s2">put a Board of Directors around that</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.170" end="00:03:02.480" style="s2">table and they start acting in in their</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.470" end="00:03:05.060" style="s2">self-interest in their friends</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.480" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">self-interest to make a profit instead</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.060" end="00:03:11.720" style="s2">of to make purpose for us we transfer</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:13.880" style="s2">our boat to somebody else and as we the</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.720" end="00:03:15.500" style="s2">people who have put them in power don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.880" end="00:03:17.630" style="s2">understand what&#39;s going on and it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.500" end="00:03:19.730" style="s2">complex we need to make the tools in</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.630" end="00:03:22.280" style="s2">place to make it less complex to give us</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.730" end="00:03:25.220" style="s2">access to that information once the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.280" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">technology has caught up once we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.220" end="00:03:29.950" style="s2">the technology people will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:32.120" style="s2">vote directly on the issues themselves</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.950" end="00:03:33.380" style="s2">but many of us will still want to</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.120" end="00:03:34.549" style="s2">delegate are about to somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.380" end="00:03:37.220" style="s2">because we don&#39;t want to attend every</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.549" end="00:03:40.130" style="s2">meeting 10 million people attending a</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.220" end="00:03:43.130" style="s2">weekly board meeting or whatever we</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.130" end="00:03:47.989" style="s2">decide is the is the time in between</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.130" end="00:03:50.000" style="s2">meetings is not that&#39;s millions of hours</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.989" end="00:03:51.230" style="s2">spent watching meeting instead of if</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.000" end="00:03:52.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not what you want to do and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.230" end="00:03:56.600" style="s2">rather delegate your vote to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.760" end="00:03:56.959" style="s2">who has expertise in that area yes let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.600" end="00:03:59.150" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.959" end="00:04:01.100" style="s2">we don&#39;t need to have a million people</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.150" end="00:04:03.200" style="s2">making a decision but we do need a</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.100" end="00:04:05.269" style="s2">million power people to empower a small</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.200" end="00:04:08.540" style="s2">group of people without that small group</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.269" end="00:04:11.250" style="s2">of people having supreme power having</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.540" end="00:04:13.800" style="s2">power that we can&#39;t take back</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.250" end="00:04:16.470" style="s2">even if it&#39;s only for a year or four</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.800" end="00:04:18.150" style="s2">years so liquid democracy is just that</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.470" end="00:04:20.549" style="s2">it&#39;s fluid democracy it&#39;s been able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.150" end="00:04:23.640" style="s2">transfer your vote from one person to</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.549" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">another in between elections so the same</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.640" end="00:04:28.590" style="s2">ten people in this example will be on</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.100" end="00:04:30.630" style="s2">the board but your power around that</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.590" end="00:04:33.420" style="s2">board could be from zero to a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:36.030" style="s2">percent if you have a hundred percent of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.420" end="00:04:37.890" style="s2">the vote that&#39;s very unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.030" end="00:04:39.480" style="s2">especially with a lot of members but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.890" end="00:04:41.010" style="s2">if you have 51 percent of the vote which</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.480" end="00:04:43.140" style="s2">isn&#39;t necessarily gonna be that unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.010" end="00:04:45.450" style="s2">what you say your vision is what gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.140" end="00:04:47.400" style="s2">moved forward people like yes that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.450" end="00:04:49.260" style="s2">what we want to do and they give you</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.400" end="00:04:51.060" style="s2">your vote you have you&#39;ve been empowered</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.260" end="00:04:51.780" style="s2">by it as soon as it gets to your head</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.060" end="00:04:54.750" style="s2">and you&#39;re working in your own</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.780" end="00:04:56.190" style="s2">self-interest and not theirs if your</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.750" end="00:04:56.790" style="s2">self-interest is their self-interest</p>

<p begin="00:04:56.790" end="00:05:00.330" style="s2">but if your self-interest is not in the</p>

<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:17.669" style="s2">while doing shitty shitty things also</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.590" end="00:05:20.250" style="s2">probably shouldn&#39;t say this but when we</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.669" end="00:05:22.560" style="s2">create a company that runs with liquid</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.250" end="00:05:23.910" style="s2">democracy and we can see that millions</p>
