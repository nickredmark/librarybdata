<p begin="00:00:19.500" end="00:00:24.600" style="s2">with Zack sixth I know I just had an</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.160" end="00:00:26.789" style="s2">extraordinary interview with and I know</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.600" end="00:00:29.550" style="s2">you work with horses and I know you do</p>

<p begin="00:00:33.030" end="00:00:39.239" style="s2">these extraordinary texts on medium and</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.420" end="00:00:41.989" style="s2">have a sort of ability to combine very</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.239" end="00:00:45.899" style="s2">high abstraction with very down-to-earth</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.989" end="00:00:47.940" style="s2">sorts of sorts of issues so so did you</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.899" end="00:00:49.950" style="s2">want to just sort of introduce yourself</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.940" end="00:00:52.559" style="s2">or say something about what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.950" end="00:00:54.480" style="s2">trying to do what your what&#39;s your yeah</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.559" end="00:00:58.500" style="s2">what&#39;s your angle what&#39;s your unique</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.480" end="00:01:00.329" style="s2">thing um yeah you know I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.500" end="00:01:03.059" style="s2">thinking about that in the last year or</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.329" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">so because people always ask me that and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.059" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">I think my answer has gotten to be more</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:14.040" style="s2">refined at first they stumbled over it a</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:17.939" style="s2">little a lot more so my current version</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.040" end="00:01:19.380" style="s2">of where I am in this space is and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.939" end="00:01:21.090" style="s2">like that way you put it in that email</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.380" end="00:01:25.610" style="s2">what&#39;s your parallax you know what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.090" end="00:01:28.470" style="s2">your author and all or side view is I</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.610" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">mean we can get into why this matters</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.470" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">but you know I&#39;m a person that has been</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:41.210" style="s2">looking for new architectures of thought</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:45.869" style="s2">for a long time and partially because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.210" end="00:01:48.210" style="s2">think that I&#39;ve been thinking sin</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.869" end="00:01:51.060" style="s2">different ways but also that as I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.210" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">studied philosophy and read people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.060" end="00:01:55.619" style="s2">writings over many many years I started</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:57.270" style="s2">to see wow this you know there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.619" end="00:02:00.240" style="s2">of philosophy within a certain Canon</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.270" end="00:02:02.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of writing in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.240" end="00:02:04.200" style="s2">scientific paradigm but there are</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.430" end="00:02:08.009" style="s2">actually you could start to see like</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.200" end="00:02:10.920" style="s2">this genesis of different ways that</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.009" end="00:02:14.100" style="s2">people are constructing thoughts and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.920" end="00:02:17.370" style="s2">started getting very interested in</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.100" end="00:02:20.790" style="s2">so what I&#39;m attracted to I guess now</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.370" end="00:02:25.230" style="s2">after maybe 20 years of this is I really</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.790" end="00:02:28.530" style="s2">see a lot of hope in combining a process</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.230" end="00:02:32.510" style="s2">philosophical approach you know ala</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.530" end="00:02:35.310" style="s2">Whitehead and then there&#39;s there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.510" end="00:02:39.690" style="s2">many versions of that but we could</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.310" end="00:02:42.680" style="s2">anchor that in Whitehead with like</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.690" end="00:02:45.600" style="s2">embodied in active approaches of</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.680" end="00:02:48.900" style="s2">Thompson and Varela let&#39;s say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.600" end="00:02:51.800" style="s2">also in that process field and then kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.900" end="00:02:55.410" style="s2">of integrate that with what I call</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.800" end="00:02:57.450" style="s2">holistic complexity science which is not</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.410" end="00:03:02.160" style="s2">cybernetics it&#39;s not second or third</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.450" end="00:03:04.800" style="s2">order cybernetics it&#39;s it&#39;s really kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:06.630" style="s2">of a new science I would say that Dave</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.800" end="00:03:10.140" style="s2">Snowden and Nora Bateson are in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.630" end="00:03:12.120" style="s2">field and so somehow I think that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.140" end="00:03:18.360" style="s2">there&#39;s a new architecture or a new</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.120" end="00:03:23.340" style="s2">paradigm of mind that&#39;s going to draw on</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.360" end="00:03:25.980" style="s2">some a lot of those resources I might my</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.340" end="00:03:28.580" style="s2">current turn for what that theory looks</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.980" end="00:03:32.100" style="s2">like what that combination looks like is</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.580" end="00:03:35.820" style="s2">complex potential State theory which is</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.100" end="00:03:39.210" style="s2">a move away from complex adaptive States</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.820" end="00:03:42.050" style="s2">you know Darwinian kind of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.210" end="00:03:45.840" style="s2">of complexity to a more emergent novel</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.050" end="00:03:48.180" style="s2">so complex potential States and that of</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.840" end="00:03:53.090" style="s2">course draws from processed philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.180" end="00:03:56.690" style="s2">so even in it might I&#39;m writing a big</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.090" end="00:03:59.880" style="s2">paper or a small book for perspectiva</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.690" end="00:04:03.780" style="s2">and transform transformational</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.880" end="00:04:06.330" style="s2">approaches to education drawing on this</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.780" end="00:04:09.330" style="s2">notion of complex potential States can I</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.330" end="00:04:11.550" style="s2">can I bring forth the potential what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.330" end="00:04:15.690" style="s2">the potential from here you know what</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.550" end="00:04:19.770" style="s2">are these pre egoic evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.690" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">potentials of the human right so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.770" end="00:04:24.060" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of where all my work even in</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:25.920" style="s2">organizations I talk about complex</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.060" end="00:04:29.790" style="s2">potential states and</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.920" end="00:04:34.230" style="s2">education yes I would say that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.790" end="00:04:39.660" style="s2">the sphere around which my intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.230" end="00:04:42.420" style="s2">life and I did this I did this interview</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.660" end="00:04:44.750" style="s2">with Zack Stein that I&#39;m still thinking</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.420" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">about a lot and and there was a quote</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.750" end="00:04:52.290" style="s2">that Zack used and that quote was and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.440" end="00:04:55.590" style="s2">and you suggested that we start talking</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.290" end="00:04:58.760" style="s2">about this the quote was that schools</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.590" end="00:05:03.570" style="s2">make you stupid money makes you poor and</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.760" end="00:05:05.660" style="s2">medicine makes you sick so so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:09.570" style="s2">talking about the dysfunction of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.660" end="00:05:11.550" style="s2">organizations right and III believe you</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.570" end="00:05:15.510" style="s2">work very hard to try to heal these</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.550" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">dysfunctions and also to try to you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.510" end="00:05:22.440" style="s2">bring forth human potential mm-hmm do I</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:25.920" style="s2">have that right yeah so you know that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.440" end="00:05:27.960" style="s2">loved that when he said that and I kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.920" end="00:05:28.680" style="s2">of I kind of sent it around the</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.960" end="00:05:33.360" style="s2">Twittersphere</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.680" end="00:05:35.460" style="s2">and you know so why does I would like to</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.360" end="00:05:37.020" style="s2">talk about why does that ring true I</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.460" end="00:05:39.060" style="s2">mean right I thought about that because</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.020" end="00:05:41.460" style="s2">I mean on the one hand it seems kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.060" end="00:05:43.290" style="s2">like a funny thing to say but it does</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.460" end="00:05:45.960" style="s2">ring true and it points to these</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.290" end="00:05:47.190" style="s2">sense-making crisis the you know war on</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.960" end="00:05:51.290" style="s2">sense-making in the meaning-making</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.190" end="00:05:54.680" style="s2">crisis so I want to step back and say</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.290" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">why I think this is rings true and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.680" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">there&#39;s something like there&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:02.210" style="s2">like we invented schools to make us</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.090" end="00:06:04.620" style="s2">stupid you know there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.210" end="00:06:05.940" style="s2">conspiratorial kind of feel to them</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.620" end="00:06:09.120" style="s2">because they&#39;re all happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.940" end="00:06:12.600" style="s2">same time and this is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.120" end="00:06:16.440" style="s2">paranoia in the social media space right</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.600" end="00:06:19.560" style="s2">now is because people feel like all</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.440" end="00:06:23.100" style="s2">these things have a common reason and</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.560" end="00:06:26.040" style="s2">they project that as a cabal of a few</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.100" end="00:06:28.950" style="s2">people but they do have a common reason</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.040" end="00:06:35.100" style="s2">but the common reason is not a cabal a</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.950" end="00:06:37.500" style="s2">few people it has to do with what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.100" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">seeing is the reversal of intention and</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.500" end="00:06:42.810" style="s2">outcome right so</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:45.090" style="s2">goals the intention is to educate the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.810" end="00:06:48.479" style="s2">outcome is makes us stupid so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.090" end="00:06:53.130" style="s2">good intentions which but that&#39;s leading</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.479" end="00:06:54.990" style="s2">to this often terrible outcome yes in</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.130" end="00:06:58.020" style="s2">our everyday life I have a good</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.990" end="00:07:01.770" style="s2">intention to protect my family</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.020" end="00:07:05.310" style="s2">and my my country and it leads to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.770" end="00:07:09.300" style="s2">nuclear war if a good intention to you</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.310" end="00:07:12.240" style="s2">know to play the game by the rules and</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.300" end="00:07:15.030" style="s2">it turns into fraud I have a good</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.240" end="00:07:17.040" style="s2">intention to make a home and a good life</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.030" end="00:07:20.510" style="s2">in career for my family and it destroys</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.040" end="00:07:23.729" style="s2">the environment so what we see is this</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.510" end="00:07:28.260" style="s2">reversal or decoupling of intention and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.729" end="00:07:30.240" style="s2">outcome and what that makes me think of</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.260" end="00:07:33.000" style="s2">is that it&#39;s the result of a mono</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.240" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">perspective of some kind yeah okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.000" end="00:07:42.600" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s it&#39;s a result of the long</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:45.210" style="s2">process of decreasing returns in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.600" end="00:07:47.490" style="s2">cycles of civilization and then you get</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.210" end="00:07:48.930" style="s2">a reversal and the returns decrease to</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.490" end="00:07:52.950" style="s2">you know the benefits of the return</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.930" end="00:07:55.470" style="s2">starts at tip okay and so what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.950" end="00:07:57.750" style="s2">looking at mean we live is Zack says and</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.470" end="00:08:00.840" style="s2">a time between worlds we&#39;re living at</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.750" end="00:08:04.680" style="s2">the end of a very large paradigm a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.840" end="00:08:07.380" style="s2">large cycle of civilization and this has</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.680" end="00:08:10.860" style="s2">happened before we&#39;re lucky to be able</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.380" end="00:08:13.200" style="s2">to conceive it as the end of a cycle of</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.860" end="00:08:16.050" style="s2">civilization he calls it that he says</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.200" end="00:08:17.970" style="s2">we&#39;re living in the post tragic age</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.050" end="00:08:20.130" style="s2">which is an interesting I thought an</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.970" end="00:08:23.479" style="s2">interesting concept yeah but this</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.130" end="00:08:25.979" style="s2">in-between world place is sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.479" end="00:08:28.349" style="s2">you know it&#39;s the tragedy of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.979" end="00:08:30.060" style="s2">which I guess has to do with you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.349" end="00:08:32.610" style="s2">all of these institutions kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.060" end="00:08:34.740" style="s2">falling apart and no that&#39;s right and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.610" end="00:08:40.830" style="s2">the tragedy of post modernity is more</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.740" end="00:08:42.270" style="s2">like we don&#39;t know what to do so so</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.830" end="00:08:45.959" style="s2">there&#39;s like the problem with the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.270" end="00:08:48.300" style="s2">paradigm we&#39;re in is that the modernity</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.959" end="00:08:52.140" style="s2">and its critique are in the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.300" end="00:08:53.700" style="s2">paradigm yeah oh this is mmm this is why</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.140" end="00:08:55.650" style="s2">it&#39;s so tough</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.700" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">this is why this is like the mother of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.650" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">all paradigms right and so if you think</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:05.940" style="s2">about it in the past paradigms there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:08.760" style="s2">not a conceptual critique of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.940" end="00:09:13.890" style="s2">paradigm itself it just it just evolved</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.760" end="00:09:17.940" style="s2">and you know wrong just destroyed itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.890" end="00:09:20.610" style="s2">by just action but in modern times we</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.940" end="00:09:23.310" style="s2">start to see we get post bond and</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.610" end="00:09:26.880" style="s2">critique and so what you have with</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.310" end="00:09:29.010" style="s2">paradigms they&#39;re either inconsistent or</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.880" end="00:09:30.990" style="s2">they&#39;re incomplete now inconsistent</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.010" end="00:09:33.450" style="s2">paradigms don&#39;t live very long they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.990" end="00:09:37.730" style="s2">not very robust because so you start to</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.450" end="00:09:41.700" style="s2">have a lot of relativistic you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.730" end="00:09:44.280" style="s2">movement between paradigms but in our</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.700" end="00:09:46.770" style="s2">modern society we get the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.280" end="00:09:49.470" style="s2">critique the postmodern critiques start</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.770" end="00:09:52.650" style="s2">shoring up all the inconsistencies of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.470" end="00:09:55.670" style="s2">the modern paradigm and that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.650" end="00:09:59.040" style="s2">much more complex you get this complex</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.670" end="00:10:02.070" style="s2">systemic hyper systemic understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.040" end="00:10:06.390" style="s2">them of modernity from postmodern but it</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.070" end="00:10:09.390" style="s2">started to close up all the loopholes so</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.390" end="00:10:14.580" style="s2">it actually made it more robust and more</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.390" end="00:10:17.100" style="s2">recursive and so the game is is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.580" end="00:10:19.970" style="s2">closed on itself and the reversal is</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.100" end="00:10:22.410" style="s2">happening because not only of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.970" end="00:10:25.620" style="s2">inconsistencies of the modern paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.410" end="00:10:27.960" style="s2">but we&#39;ve shorted up with the critiques</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.620" end="00:10:31.320" style="s2">right all the regulation in business and</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.960" end="00:10:33.720" style="s2">all the height or surveillance of AI and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.320" end="00:10:35.640" style="s2">all the systems keeps shoring up those</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.720" end="00:10:38.670" style="s2">inconsistencies so now we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.640" end="00:10:41.010" style="s2">robust paradigm very closed on itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.670" end="00:10:42.300" style="s2">but it&#39;s incomplete and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.010" end="00:10:45.480" style="s2">challenge not to look for</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.300" end="00:10:48.030" style="s2">inconsistencies but we have to see what</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.480" end="00:10:51.030" style="s2">we can&#39;t see we have and this is exactly</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.030" end="00:10:53.790" style="s2">what you said we&#39;re closed in a paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.030" end="00:10:57.180" style="s2">and the job is we have to see outside of</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.790" end="00:10:58.500" style="s2">it yeah so when you say we have to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.180" end="00:11:03.060" style="s2">what we can&#39;t see or you&#39;re thinking</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.500" end="00:11:04.960" style="s2">about about the future and but also I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.060" end="00:11:07.630" style="s2">was wondering if we have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.960" end="00:11:09.970" style="s2">a thread to the past in other words we</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.630" end="00:11:12.250" style="s2">have to kind of rediscover some of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.970" end="00:11:14.800" style="s2">you know the narratives of the past or</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.250" end="00:11:17.020" style="s2">the grand narrows asked to move us into</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.800" end="00:11:18.550" style="s2">the future so it&#39;s so we&#39;re not just</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.020" end="00:11:23.050" style="s2">starting from nowhere because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.550" end="00:11:24.790" style="s2">okay exactly yes and there&#39;s people that</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.050" end="00:11:26.260" style="s2">are working like that going back to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.790" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">archetypes and this and that but this</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.260" end="00:11:30.880" style="s2">was me what makes me different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:33.070" style="s2">that&#39;s not radical enough so the</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.880" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">instinct that we have to go backwards to</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.070" end="00:11:41.350" style="s2">go forwards yes because you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:44.490" style="s2">start here and then emerge from nothing</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.350" end="00:11:47.520" style="s2">but we have because the paradigm is</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.490" end="00:11:50.860" style="s2">linguistic and symbolic we have to go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.520" end="00:11:53.560" style="s2">pre-linguistic and pre-symbolic modes</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.860" end="00:11:55.960" style="s2">again and then build from there</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.560" end="00:11:58.510" style="s2">Wow so the archetypes are not the place</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.960" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">to start so further back then you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.510" end="00:12:04.240" style="s2">further back so like I don&#39;t know I my</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">my friend Alexander bard</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.240" end="00:12:10.030" style="s2">talks about no madala G and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:12.190" style="s2">look at the the the dynamics of early</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.030" end="00:12:14.740" style="s2">tribes and how they work in the Dunbar</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.190" end="00:12:15.310" style="s2">number and all that how people work</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.740" end="00:12:16.990" style="s2">together</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.310" end="00:12:19.720" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s still working within an</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.990" end="00:12:21.940" style="s2">archetypal model exactly it&#39;s not deep</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.720" end="00:12:26.410" style="s2">enough so now but you see quite a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.940" end="00:12:28.290" style="s2">people that are saying and we need to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.410" end="00:12:32.290" style="s2">back to the sensory more motor</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.290" end="00:12:34.090" style="s2">perception action mode of being we</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.290" end="00:12:36.460" style="s2">actually have to reclaim a lot of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.090" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">because you know I do work with horses</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.460" end="00:12:41.620" style="s2">and literally people get so lost and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:43.990" style="s2">thought they cannot see what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.620" end="00:12:47.170" style="s2">to them in their sensory motor spatial</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.990" end="00:12:49.420" style="s2">relationships they either get completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.170" end="00:12:52.000" style="s2">overwhelmed with emotion or completely</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.420" end="00:12:56.650" style="s2">overwhelmed with theory in their daily</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.000" end="00:12:58.630" style="s2">lives and so you start to see and this</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.650" end="00:13:02.800" style="s2">is why our culture has like extreme</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.630" end="00:13:05.770" style="s2">sports there&#39;s this intuitive need of in</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.800" end="00:13:08.380" style="s2">Thompson&#39;s work Adam Roberts work at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.770" end="00:13:11.290" style="s2">side view it&#39;s all something in us</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.380" end="00:13:13.060" style="s2">Jordan also says yeah you have to be in</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.290" end="00:13:15.580" style="s2">right relationship you have to be sober</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.060" end="00:13:18.100" style="s2">and you have two choices and app we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.580" end="00:13:18.769" style="s2">going all the way back down to these</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.100" end="00:13:23.379" style="s2">deep</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.769" end="00:13:27.920" style="s2">or protocol of embodied choice</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.379" end="00:13:30.800" style="s2">experiment in action so there see you</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.920" end="00:13:32.660" style="s2">know we&#39;re split right we&#39;re very split</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.800" end="00:13:34.910" style="s2">let&#39;s say between the brain and the body</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.660" end="00:13:37.369" style="s2">like the whole culture is extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.910" end="00:13:40.910" style="s2">split between embodied experience and</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.369" end="00:13:45.769" style="s2">abstraction yeah I mean so you know the</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.910" end="00:13:47.929" style="s2">question is what comes on top of duck I</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.769" end="00:13:51.619" style="s2">call that the core self the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.929" end="00:13:54.739" style="s2">sensory motor perception action so does</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.619" end="00:13:57.319" style="s2">is there another linguistic symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.739" end="00:13:59.869" style="s2">system that gets built on that probably</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.319" end="00:14:04.819" style="s2">it just won&#39;t be the paradigm that we</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.869" end="00:14:07.519" style="s2">have now and so there will be you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.819" end="00:14:10.249" style="s2">that&#39;s the possibility for emergent type</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.519" end="00:14:14.029" style="s2">of Minds right because the architecture</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.249" end="00:14:16.309" style="s2">of mind has changed through time with</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.029" end="00:14:20.329" style="s2">these with these transformations of</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.309" end="00:14:22.220" style="s2">civilization hmm so maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.329" end="00:14:24.049" style="s2">unpack a little bit you know this I</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.220" end="00:14:27.709" style="s2">guess Francis Forellis idea of Auto</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.049" end="00:14:30.369" style="s2">poiesis and and emergent theory and and</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.709" end="00:14:33.549" style="s2">all of that I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sure if I</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.369" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">understand it in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.549" end="00:14:37.069" style="s2">self-organization if there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.839" end="00:14:40.399" style="s2">self-organization and</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.069" end="00:14:42.199" style="s2">how do we work with that does that mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.399" end="00:14:45.439" style="s2">this was my set is my question clear</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.199" end="00:14:48.949" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna riff on it instead of</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.439" end="00:14:54.459" style="s2">going deep into the theory okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.949" end="00:14:58.160" style="s2">so I do the I do the presentation and</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.459" end="00:14:59.779" style="s2">that&#39;s called how self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.160" end="00:15:01.759" style="s2">happens and why does it matter on why</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.779" end="00:15:04.730" style="s2">you can trust it or something and one of</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.759" end="00:15:07.069" style="s2">the slides I put up or you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.730" end="00:15:13.339" style="s2">find it on the internet and it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.069" end="00:15:20.209" style="s2">this animation of DNA being unraveled</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.339" end="00:15:23.629" style="s2">and copied in a ribosome Factory and I</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.209" end="00:15:26.119" style="s2">and it&#39;s all molecular self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.629" end="00:15:28.549" style="s2">so I say well how does that happen how</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.119" end="00:15:30.589" style="s2">does that not only that but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.549" end="00:15:32.170" style="s2">autopoietic cycles so it perpetuates</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.589" end="00:15:34.510" style="s2">itself am I</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.170" end="00:15:39.610" style="s2">the ribosomes are just molecules they</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.510" end="00:15:42.760" style="s2">don&#39;t have DNA right but all of life is</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.610" end="00:15:46.080" style="s2">predicated upon the fact that they self</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.760" end="00:15:49.150" style="s2">organize in these extremely complex</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.080" end="00:15:49.720" style="s2">factories right nobody knows how to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.150" end="00:15:54.750" style="s2">what they do</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.720" end="00:16:03.280" style="s2">so self-organization is not trivial it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.750" end="00:16:05.470" style="s2">deeply intelligent and it&#39;s deeply well</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.280" end="00:16:08.230" style="s2">I guess nature nature is intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.470" end="00:16:11.080" style="s2">right you know you know I mean nature is</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.230" end="00:16:14.230" style="s2">complex and intelligent and and we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.080" end="00:16:17.470" style="s2">part of nature but we also make these we</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.230" end="00:16:19.380" style="s2">construct things like machines and we</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.470" end="00:16:22.270" style="s2">kind of believe that those are complex</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.380" end="00:16:24.010" style="s2">no there&#39;s complained it paired to a</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.270" end="00:16:28.090" style="s2">blade of grass or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.010" end="00:16:31.240" style="s2">our machines are very very dumb or very</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.090" end="00:16:33.520" style="s2">simple yes so machines don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.240" end="00:16:35.410" style="s2">self-organized right I mean and then you</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.520" end="00:16:38.230" style="s2">could say well machines can build other</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.410" end="00:16:40.720" style="s2">machines but then now we have to think</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.230" end="00:16:45.190" style="s2">about the notion of self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.720" end="00:16:47.850" style="s2">and you know machines build build each</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.190" end="00:16:50.260" style="s2">other up from parts and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.850" end="00:16:56.350" style="s2">self-organization are patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.260" end="00:17:00.120" style="s2">relationship that make you know that</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.350" end="00:17:03.240" style="s2">create more complex types of potentials</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.120" end="00:17:05.740" style="s2">ok so I like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.240" end="00:17:07.810" style="s2">self-organization and every in every</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.740" end="00:17:11.680" style="s2">relationship in a self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.810" end="00:17:15.390" style="s2">relationship there&#39;s a promise that is</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.680" end="00:17:19.959" style="s2">made for a higher possibility right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.390" end="00:17:22.839" style="s2">if I and this girls cuts across living</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.959" end="00:17:27.089" style="s2">and nonliving things right so if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.839" end="00:17:29.710" style="s2">working with a horse as a farmer and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.089" end="00:17:32.500" style="s2">plowing the land but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.710" end="00:17:35.140" style="s2">promissory note between me and ores for</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.500" end="00:17:39.900" style="s2">a larger possibility the horse and I</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.140" end="00:17:43.480" style="s2">right and so you start to see that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.900" end="00:17:44.820" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of just you know an N</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.480" end="00:17:45.880" style="s2">storied way to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.820" end="00:17:47.650" style="s2">self-organization</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.880" end="00:17:49.620" style="s2">yeah when I can go the other way too</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.650" end="00:17:52.510" style="s2">right if you don&#39;t if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.620" end="00:17:55.060" style="s2">cultivate that relationship and in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.510" end="00:17:57.340" style="s2">good in a positive or in a correct</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.060" end="00:17:59.760" style="s2">manner then the relationship can degrade</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.340" end="00:18:06.010" style="s2">right self-organization can go backwards</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.760" end="00:18:08.610" style="s2">exactly so if you know so some people</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.010" end="00:18:11.740" style="s2">can talk about it as an energy kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.610" end="00:18:14.050" style="s2">equation so at the higher level it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.740" end="00:18:17.590" style="s2">to be a lower energy state or lower</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.050" end="00:18:20.500" style="s2">energy cost so that&#39;s the possibility so</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.590" end="00:18:22.930" style="s2">you you know molecules work like that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.500" end="00:18:25.840" style="s2">get together there&#39;s a lower energy cost</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.930" end="00:18:28.150" style="s2">for something that we&#39;re doing so that</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.840" end="00:18:29.770" style="s2">we&#39;re going to promise to interact in</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.150" end="00:18:32.770" style="s2">this certain way I like to say you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.770" end="00:18:35.410" style="s2">if my cells didn&#39;t promise to get up -</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.770" end="00:18:36.970" style="s2">if my cells didn&#39;t promise to keep doing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.410" end="00:18:41.050" style="s2">what they were doing I couldn&#39;t get up</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.970" end="00:18:43.090" style="s2">and walk across the room but you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.050" end="00:18:44.590" style="s2">start to see this like from an inactive</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.090" end="00:18:47.950" style="s2">approach and I think this is where</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.590" end="00:18:50.440" style="s2">Varela was really inspired is you could</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.950" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">start to see yourself inside the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.440" end="00:18:55.870" style="s2">universe of self-organization and this</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:19:00.130" style="s2">notion of promise and possibility so</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.870" end="00:19:02.740" style="s2">like if this if the way a stone is right</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.130" end="00:19:05.230" style="s2">as the laws of nature are like deep</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.740" end="00:19:08.050" style="s2">promises so if there&#39;s stone and its</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.230" end="00:19:09.970" style="s2">promise to lay upon the ground I</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.050" end="00:19:12.090" style="s2">couldn&#39;t pick her up and throw it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.970" end="00:19:15.340" style="s2">you start to get this completely</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.090" end="00:19:18.240" style="s2">animated participatory process view of</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.340" end="00:19:20.530" style="s2">reality is all upon us and participation</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.240" end="00:19:22.570" style="s2">promise is the same thing as as</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.530" end="00:19:25.390" style="s2">potential or I&#39;m trying to understand</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.570" end="00:19:28.720" style="s2">what you mean by promise yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.390" end="00:19:32.530" style="s2">every relation like in process its</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.720" end="00:19:35.770" style="s2">relation every relation is both a</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.530" end="00:19:40.120" style="s2">promise so that there can be enacted a</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.770" end="00:19:42.760" style="s2">higher potential okay right so MA so the</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.120" end="00:19:45.070" style="s2">laws of nature are like promises they</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.760" end="00:19:48.340" style="s2">meet your promises to behave a certain</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.070" end="00:19:50.770" style="s2">way in order for other potentials to</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.340" end="00:19:52.810" style="s2">come across so they&#39;re not archetypes or</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.770" end="00:19:54.160" style="s2">ideals in the Platonic sense or</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.810" end="00:19:56.020" style="s2">something like that there</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.160" end="00:19:57.730" style="s2">they&#39;re their promises that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.020" end="00:20:01.030" style="s2">interesting I like well it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.730" end="00:20:05.890" style="s2">way to talk about what is self a self</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.030" end="00:20:08.170" style="s2">organization from a process view you</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.890" end="00:20:12.640" style="s2">know their their their relational</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.170" end="00:20:15.340" style="s2">dynamics yeah in from easy way to</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.640" end="00:20:18.910" style="s2">understand it to bring out this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.340" end="00:20:21.790" style="s2">beauty of a world that is seen through</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.910" end="00:20:25.390" style="s2">this way you can think of it as promise</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.790" end="00:20:28.900" style="s2">impossibility at different levels you</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.390" end="00:20:33.610" style="s2">know so there&#39;s there&#39;s this and that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.900" end="00:20:36.070" style="s2">that really brings up the way Whitehead</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.610" end="00:20:40.060" style="s2">thought of his philosophy he talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.070" end="00:20:45.880" style="s2">about you know prehension is feeling it</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.060" end="00:20:47.170" style="s2">was the long it&#39;s very it&#39;s a very you</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.880" end="00:20:49.120" style="s2">know this notion of promising</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.170" end="00:20:51.370" style="s2">possibility is a lot of feeling a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.120" end="00:20:53.620" style="s2">effort to it and this is the world that</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.370" end="00:20:57.910" style="s2">he wanted to bring forth this notion of</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.620" end="00:21:01.320" style="s2">not just making connections like wiring</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.910" end="00:21:04.810" style="s2">things together but that there were</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.320" end="00:21:07.990" style="s2">tomes those affect on both sides of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.810" end="00:21:11.470" style="s2">equation and so I turned that into this</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.990" end="00:21:15.490" style="s2">phrase about promises and possibility</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.470" end="00:21:19.750" style="s2">and this is actually what a society is</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.490" end="00:21:22.090" style="s2">you know you you promise to obey certain</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.750" end="00:21:24.280" style="s2">rules and certain patterns because</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.090" end="00:21:27.220" style="s2">everybody it&#39;s going to enact a higher</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.280" end="00:21:30.490" style="s2">possibility for everyone it&#39;s what a</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.220" end="00:21:33.640" style="s2">company is its what self-organization is</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.490" end="00:21:38.830" style="s2">it&#39;s a set of promises to realize a</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.640" end="00:21:41.860" style="s2">greater possibility and when the</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.830" end="00:21:45.120" style="s2">promises are when the promises are being</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.860" end="00:21:47.590" style="s2">upheld and the possibilities are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.120" end="00:21:50.740" style="s2">then you start to have some breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.590" end="00:21:53.410" style="s2">and so that then we can maybe that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.740" end="00:21:55.780" style="s2">segue into talking about education again</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.410" end="00:21:57.400" style="s2">going back into education and this sort</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.780" end="00:22:02.610" style="s2">of breakdown you&#39;re talking about and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.400" end="00:22:06.340" style="s2">what to do to create genuine</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.610" end="00:22:07.800" style="s2">self-organizing let&#39;s say education yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.340" end="00:22:10.230" style="s2">Zack distinct</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.800" end="00:22:13.260" style="s2">is between education and school mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.230" end="00:22:16.380" style="s2">like he has just you know ivan el</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.260" end="00:22:20.040" style="s2">acuerdo called the schooling society so</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.380" end="00:22:22.650" style="s2">i guess my question is yeah so is it</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.040" end="00:22:26.610" style="s2">yeah you know about organizations and</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.650" end="00:22:28.860" style="s2">and how they work and what is it what</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.610" end="00:22:31.350" style="s2">does education going to be like and what</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.860" end="00:22:37.920" style="s2">is it now and and you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.350" end="00:22:41.040" style="s2">internet age and how do we educate</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.920" end="00:22:43.700" style="s2">ourselves today it&#39;s I&#39;m asking this</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.040" end="00:22:46.590" style="s2">question because I&#39;m thinking about like</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.700" end="00:22:50.190" style="s2">this conversation we&#39;re having and then</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.590" end="00:22:52.650" style="s2">also my and my interactions on internet</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.190" end="00:22:56.730" style="s2">and then my job and all these things in</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.650" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">different compartments and how does the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.730" end="00:23:01.230" style="s2">whole thing work how do we how do we do</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:06.660" style="s2">that how do we how do we fulfill the</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.230" end="00:23:13.680" style="s2">promise of Education if you like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.660" end="00:23:17.310" style="s2">interesting so again when you ask me a</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.680" end="00:23:22.290" style="s2">question like that I have to start by</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.310" end="00:23:26.850" style="s2">saying okay the whole discourse around</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.290" end="00:23:28.770" style="s2">education is in this paradigm so I make</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.850" end="00:23:32.040" style="s2">the distinction between education reform</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.770" end="00:23:34.410" style="s2">which has not exited the paradigm so all</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.040" end="00:23:37.140" style="s2">those moves will give you decreasing</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.410" end="00:23:40.200" style="s2">returns increase in complexity won&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.140" end="00:23:43.550" style="s2">you out of the pickle so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.200" end="00:23:45.570" style="s2">education reform so what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.550" end="00:23:47.670" style="s2">transformational philosophy a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.570" end="00:23:52.350" style="s2">transformational philosophy of education</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.670" end="00:23:54.690" style="s2">what Zak Stein would call a theory a new</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.350" end="00:23:56.670" style="s2">theory of the human a new theory of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.690" end="00:24:03.270" style="s2">human yeah so you have to step way back</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.670" end="00:24:07.950" style="s2">and so a new new philosophy of Education</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.270" end="00:24:09.810" style="s2">requires a new theory of learning how do</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.950" end="00:24:12.120" style="s2">people learn I want to just go back a</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.810" end="00:24:15.390" style="s2">little bit about the human what would</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.120" end="00:24:18.210" style="s2">this new idea of the human be yeah as a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.390" end="00:24:19.680" style="s2">learner I guess or as a learner exactly</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.210" end="00:24:23.190" style="s2">so the new idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.680" end="00:24:28.830" style="s2">of how people learn how do humans learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.190" end="00:24:33.300" style="s2">and so we have to examine assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.830" end="00:24:36.630" style="s2">for example in our current paradigm we</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.300" end="00:24:39.110" style="s2">have what I call a developmental bias we</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.630" end="00:24:42.180" style="s2">think the past is primitive and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.110" end="00:24:45.540" style="s2">future is more complex and that</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.180" end="00:24:48.180" style="s2">development is linear so this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.540" end="00:24:53.640" style="s2">think people linear and additive this is</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.180" end="00:24:58.940" style="s2">how we think people learn and so it</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.640" end="00:25:03.660" style="s2">turns out this is not true the the being</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.940" end="00:25:08.360" style="s2">the amount of information that your body</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.660" end="00:25:12.660" style="s2">processes just to get to being like a</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.360" end="00:25:16.140" style="s2">perceiving walking sensing feeling</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.660" end="00:25:19.020" style="s2">organism is like 11 billion bits a</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.140" end="00:25:21.210" style="s2">second and in the cognitive narrow</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.020" end="00:25:25.770" style="s2">cognitive linguistic mind can only</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.210" end="00:25:29.430" style="s2">handle like 14 to 64 bits per second</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.770" end="00:25:34.230" style="s2">most of the intelligence in us is in</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.430" end="00:25:36.240" style="s2">disembodied organs in our body and also</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.230" end="00:25:42.050" style="s2">in our deep history I guess or inner</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.240" end="00:25:45.510" style="s2">yeah so there in genetic and epigenetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.050" end="00:25:48.660" style="s2">evolutionary potentials right so first</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.510" end="00:25:51.810" style="s2">of all this is we need to think of</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.660" end="00:25:54.030" style="s2">Education not so this is what we think</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.810" end="00:25:56.340" style="s2">about education so the child goes to</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.030" end="00:26:00.180" style="s2">first grade or kindergarten and we said</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.340" end="00:26:01.860" style="s2">oh the embody child is is that phase is</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.180" end="00:26:03.810" style="s2">over now we&#39;re going to do this phase</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.860" end="00:26:05.640" style="s2">and then we&#39;re going to do this space</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.810" end="00:26:07.530" style="s2">now they have to learn abstractions I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.640" end="00:26:10.470" style="s2">not going to do this we have this</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.530" end="00:26:12.630" style="s2">feeling that we have to add all these</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.470" end="00:26:14.970" style="s2">things on top now we learn science now</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.630" end="00:26:17.550" style="s2">we learn science in a more complex way</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.970" end="00:26:20.970" style="s2">or whatever but what we really need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.550" end="00:26:23.090" style="s2">do is say the embodied core self</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.970" end="00:26:26.000" style="s2">we&#39;re actually educating for ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.090" end="00:26:30.120" style="s2">the this comes this is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.000" end="00:26:33.799" style="s2">maturation of the theory of donald&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.120" end="00:26:35.850" style="s2">Oliver who is one of the first</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.799" end="00:26:38.010" style="s2">philosophers of education that took a</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.850" end="00:26:42.660" style="s2">process approach or giveness is in my</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.010" end="00:26:44.690" style="s2">mind my whole sphere but we have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.660" end="00:26:48.510" style="s2">educate the core self so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.690" end="00:26:53.460" style="s2">sensorimotor perception action self has</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.510" end="00:26:56.250" style="s2">to be educated and this requires a lot</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.460" end="00:26:59.280" style="s2">about the family environment and the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.250" end="00:27:02.040" style="s2">nutrition early childhood nutrition so</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.280" end="00:27:06.330" style="s2">without this without focus on that on</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.040" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">this then the societies lost anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.330" end="00:27:11.760" style="s2">so we have the core self and then we</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:14.880" style="s2">have the communal self the communal self</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.760" end="00:27:17.549" style="s2">is a self that can create relationships</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.880" end="00:27:21.780" style="s2">the civic engagement the self that can</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.549" end="00:27:24.570" style="s2">speak that can participate in group</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.780" end="00:27:27.210" style="s2">process that creates larger and larger</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.570" end="00:27:29.130" style="s2">spheres of inclusion this is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.210" end="00:27:31.260" style="s2">communal so now the communal self</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.130" end="00:27:33.419" style="s2">doesn&#39;t come after the education of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.260" end="00:27:37.799" style="s2">core self the communal self is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.419" end="00:27:40.140" style="s2">course of expanded into communal</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.799" end="00:27:44.100" style="s2">possibilities so we still now we have to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.140" end="00:27:47.370" style="s2">educate both there&#39;s a transformation</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.100" end="00:27:50.610" style="s2">that happens in this potential of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.370" end="00:27:54.950" style="s2">human it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.610" end="00:27:57.990" style="s2">learning is something like this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.950" end="00:28:03.030" style="s2">transcended include idea as that course</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.990" end="00:28:13.890" style="s2">is it there&#39;s not not quite yet because</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.030" end="00:28:17.010" style="s2">transcend means stage does it&#39;s not see</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.890" end="00:28:20.700" style="s2">it&#39;s a developmental theory not a comp</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.010" end="00:28:22.260" style="s2">it&#39;s not from complexity science so and</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.700" end="00:28:25.700" style="s2">this is why it&#39;s got a lot of holes</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.260" end="00:28:28.530" style="s2">these are big problems but develop so</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.700" end="00:28:30.870" style="s2">one of the problems with our paradigm</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.530" end="00:28:33.570" style="s2">today is it has a developmental wires</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.870" end="00:28:36.450" style="s2">and all our bad developmental stage</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.570" end="00:28:39.210" style="s2">theory has a developmental bias so what</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.450" end="00:28:41.940" style="s2">we&#39;re looking at is there&#39;s a core so</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.210" end="00:28:44.370" style="s2">and that it complex defies to the core</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.940" end="00:28:47.010" style="s2">self or the communal self the core self</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.370" end="00:28:49.200" style="s2">has certain psychological schemas the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.010" end="00:28:51.810" style="s2">canoodle self has other structures the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.200" end="00:28:54.840" style="s2">identity changes the organism changes</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.810" end="00:28:57.480" style="s2">the potential changes what is possible</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.840" end="00:29:00.060" style="s2">from here now and then you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.480" end="00:29:02.430" style="s2">educate into the cosmopolitan itself</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.060" end="00:29:05.400" style="s2">which right now the cosmopolitan South</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.430" end="00:29:09.260" style="s2">is all on what education teaches just</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.400" end="00:29:12.450" style="s2">stuff back down to what is the core</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.260" end="00:29:14.760" style="s2">psycho-spiritual self that I&#39;m educating</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.450" end="00:29:18.240" style="s2">at this point in the lifespan which</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.760" end="00:29:20.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t concern itself with that so so</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.240" end="00:29:23.520" style="s2">we&#39;re forgetting the earlier stages so</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.850" end="00:29:25.950" style="s2">to speak like we&#39;re we should continue</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.520" end="00:29:28.470" style="s2">to nourish those earlier stages as were</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.950" end="00:29:32.460" style="s2">because they&#39;re not just earlier they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.470" end="00:29:49.040" style="s2">more fundamental earlier so it&#39;s not at</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.460" end="00:29:51.630" style="s2">linear time foundation has to grow</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.040" end="00:29:56.330" style="s2">holistically that&#39;s a holistically</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.630" end="00:30:02.490" style="s2">complex yeah participation of complex</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.330" end="00:30:05.640" style="s2">you know psyches really and so so but we</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.490" end="00:30:08.340" style="s2">actually exclude some so in our society</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.640" end="00:30:10.830" style="s2">we exclude the kind of psycho spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.340" end="00:30:14.400" style="s2">growth that should be happening in in</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.830" end="00:30:16.890" style="s2">the family and for and onwards but what</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.400" end="00:30:19.590" style="s2">we have is a very short window of time</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.890" end="00:30:21.660" style="s2">if you happen to have a healthy nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.590" end="00:30:24.270" style="s2">family for psycho spiritual growth to</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.660" end="00:30:27.020" style="s2">happen then you give it to schools no</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.270" end="00:30:31.290" style="s2">psychology no spiritual growth allowed</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.020" end="00:30:33.840" style="s2">you just get information psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.290" end="00:30:36.870" style="s2">spiritual growth you mean you mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.840" end="00:30:39.060" style="s2">working on on your effective self you</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.870" end="00:30:41.820" style="s2">know doing practices like meditation and</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.060" end="00:30:44.940" style="s2">martial arts and orienting yourself with</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.820" end="00:30:46.890" style="s2">nature and exactly like that these</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.940" end="00:30:49.500" style="s2">things need to grow throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.890" end="00:30:51.090" style="s2">lifespan so what we have today I teach a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.500" end="00:30:54.780" style="s2">master&#39;s course in consciousness studies</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.090" end="00:30:57.180" style="s2">and transformational psychology I get</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.780" end="00:30:59.190" style="s2">you know by the time people are 40 or 50</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.180" end="00:31:00.500" style="s2">years old they say oh I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.190" end="00:31:03.020" style="s2">exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.500" end="00:31:05.840" style="s2">work on my mindfulness in my car my</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.020" end="00:31:09.140" style="s2">trauma and all this stuff but the whole</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.840" end="00:31:11.570" style="s2">point is is we educate and condition all</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.140" end="00:31:14.780" style="s2">these things until people are 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.570" end="00:31:17.300" style="s2">old yeah and then when they&#39;re 50 we</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.780" end="00:31:19.790" style="s2">have to decondition ourselves to go</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.300" end="00:31:22.280" style="s2">forward but by then it&#39;s too hard you</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.790" end="00:31:24.130" style="s2">have to be in a fourth or fifth level of</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.280" end="00:31:26.870" style="s2">consciousness to metacognitively</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.130" end="00:31:30.410" style="s2">deconstruct what the society has</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.870" end="00:31:33.920" style="s2">constructed for the last 50 years so for</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.410" end="00:31:37.100" style="s2">example we know children are intuitively</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.920" end="00:31:40.010" style="s2">collaborative and empathic mm-hm</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.100" end="00:31:42.140" style="s2">but then we say Oh Keegan&#39;s fourth or</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.010" end="00:31:45.350" style="s2">fifth order consciousness people become</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.140" end="00:31:48.260" style="s2">collaborative and empathic why does it</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.350" end="00:31:51.380" style="s2">take a fifth-order consciousness for</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.260" end="00:31:54.880" style="s2">people to be that because the way we</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.380" end="00:32:00.020" style="s2">educate or school today is we school</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.880" end="00:32:03.050" style="s2">competitiveness and and non empathy so</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.020" end="00:32:06.110" style="s2">by the time you&#39;re 50 you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.050" end="00:32:09.230" style="s2">very strong metacognitive mind to</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.110" end="00:32:13.240" style="s2">deconstruct your early conditioning so</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.230" end="00:32:17.450" style="s2">the whole the whole project is</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.240" end="00:32:22.310" style="s2">inadequate so what were what we need</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.450" end="00:32:24.590" style="s2">what we need and you know I wrote down</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.310" end="00:32:26.060" style="s2">one of my questions I was listening to</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.590" end="00:32:29.120" style="s2">one of your talks you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.060" end="00:32:31.280" style="s2">competition versus consensus and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.120" end="00:32:34.040" style="s2">like on some level we have hyper</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.280" end="00:32:37.250" style="s2">competition and in another level we have</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.040" end="00:32:39.470" style="s2">hyper conformity or consensus you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.250" end="00:32:45.170" style="s2">in our relationships and how we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.470" end="00:32:47.590" style="s2">supposed to be with each other and so so</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.170" end="00:32:52.780" style="s2">and then the middle ground would be</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.590" end="00:32:52.780" style="s2">creativity right in relationships or</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.820" end="00:33:11.929" style="s2">self-organized like organizations but it</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.470" end="00:33:17.350" style="s2">it&#39;s based upon a model of collective</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.929" end="00:33:20.499" style="s2">collective action that shows that</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.350" end="00:33:25.360" style="s2">there&#39;s kind of like complex feed loops</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.499" end="00:33:28.999" style="s2">in holistic complexity science what you</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.360" end="00:33:30.950" style="s2">are encounter is things that are very</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.999" end="00:33:33.429" style="s2">similar to the brain like the brain</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.950" end="00:33:39.769" style="s2">doesn&#39;t just have feed-forward loops</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.429" end="00:33:42.889" style="s2">some some some brain areas of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.769" end="00:33:44.539" style="s2">when they get excited inhibit others but</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.889" end="00:33:46.610" style="s2">then when they&#39;re inhibited they</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.539" end="00:33:48.889" style="s2">uninhibit other things that get excited</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.610" end="00:33:50.840" style="s2">but then might inhibit you know very</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.889" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">complex feed loops so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.840" end="00:33:56.990" style="s2">working with holistic complexity you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.840" end="00:34:03.429" style="s2">always working with very complex feed</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.990" end="00:34:03.429" style="s2">loops that create threshold events so</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.059" end="00:34:13.129" style="s2">what&#39;s an example of a threshold event</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.879" end="00:34:15.770" style="s2">so that&#39;s happening in my brain I may or</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.129" end="00:34:17.540" style="s2">could use for Vicky&#39;s language I make</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.770" end="00:34:19.730" style="s2">something may or not become salient</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.540" end="00:34:21.440" style="s2">because things are inhibiting you</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.730" end="00:34:26.030" style="s2">disinhibited each other all their</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.440" end="00:34:28.250" style="s2">savings until something switches and</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.030" end="00:34:30.819" style="s2">there&#39;s more inhibition or more</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.250" end="00:34:30.819" style="s2">excitatory</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.309" end="00:34:41.829" style="s2">inside that system are not just this</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.020" end="00:34:51.710" style="s2">Vicki calls an opponent processing or</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.730" end="00:34:54.349" style="s2">something that there&#39;s a back and forth</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.710" end="00:34:57.260" style="s2">between exactly this different modes of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.349" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">being and and then you come to some kind</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.260" end="00:35:01.940" style="s2">of consensus or some kind of as you say</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:04.760" style="s2">threshold Bray or some kind of insight</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.940" end="00:35:08.329" style="s2">or exactly processing that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.760" end="00:35:15.260" style="s2">have complex feed loops so it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.329" end="00:35:18.020" style="s2">for example this so this this neuron</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.260" end="00:35:20.359" style="s2">tickles that neuron and amplifies that</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.020" end="00:35:22.520" style="s2">neuron and then it crosses a threshold</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.359" end="00:35:24.859" style="s2">event that would just be a linear</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.520" end="00:35:25.560" style="s2">feedback loop just dissolve four feet</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.859" end="00:35:29.589" style="s2">forward</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.560" end="00:35:31.329" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s back-and-forth</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.589" end="00:35:35.170" style="s2">of pushing exactly there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.329" end="00:35:38.349" style="s2">back-and-forth right and then it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.170" end="00:35:40.030" style="s2">much more complex space of possibility</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.349" end="00:35:46.829" style="s2">until there&#39;s a threshold event so this</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.030" end="00:35:46.829" style="s2">happens in organizations also and and</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.640" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">this kind of answers some of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.260" end="00:35:55.030" style="s2">questions in this social media space</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:58.630" style="s2">about hierarchy and privilege and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.030" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">so an organization also sorry what were</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.630" end="00:36:02.950" style="s2">you referring to questions of hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:05.800" style="s2">in the social media space I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.950" end="00:36:08.230" style="s2">you know like the whole you talk about</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.800" end="00:36:10.960" style="s2">the difference between consensus and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.230" end="00:36:15.190" style="s2">competitive competition hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.960" end="00:36:18.640" style="s2">egalitarian is okay so so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.190" end="00:36:24.010" style="s2">look at societies and organizations they</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.640" end="00:36:28.839" style="s2">also are a dynamic that has complex feed</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.010" end="00:36:35.589" style="s2">loops so for example what I call it the</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.839" end="00:36:39.069" style="s2">the the feed loops fork right so you</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.589" end="00:36:43.300" style="s2">can&#39;t just you can&#39;t just for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.069" end="00:36:45.280" style="s2">teach social justice concerns over and</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.300" end="00:36:47.500" style="s2">over and over at school because then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.280" end="00:36:50.020" style="s2">feed loop will form you&#39;ll get the</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.500" end="00:36:54.010" style="s2">reverse outcome from your intention</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.020" end="00:36:56.619" style="s2">because you get a bunch of fascists when</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.010" end="00:37:00.970" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to create a bunch of very</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.619" end="00:37:03.550" style="s2">helpful kind people or yes because the</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.970" end="00:37:06.550" style="s2">human collective intelligence has</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.550" end="00:37:08.589" style="s2">complex feed loops you can just feed</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.550" end="00:37:11.560" style="s2">forward or feed backwards</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.589" end="00:37:15.460" style="s2">that&#39;s not how complex holistic systems</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.560" end="00:37:18.730" style="s2">work so in organization I&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.460" end="00:37:23.410" style="s2">very easy example of how we use it in</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.730" end="00:37:26.650" style="s2">organizations yeah as trust in let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.410" end="00:37:30.490" style="s2">you&#39;re working with a team as Trust goes</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.650" end="00:37:34.720" style="s2">up right yeah you know you&#39;re getting to</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.490" end="00:37:37.089" style="s2">know each other as Trust goes up what we</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.720" end="00:37:39.520" style="s2">call action thresholds the thresholds</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.089" end="00:37:41.860" style="s2">for action go down so you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.520" end="00:37:44.470" style="s2">I have to get everybody to agree no</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.860" end="00:37:46.720" style="s2">longer require consensus because you</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.470" end="00:37:48.970" style="s2">have high level of trust same we do with</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.720" end="00:37:52.270" style="s2">our kids we trust them we give them the</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.970" end="00:37:54.640" style="s2">keys we buy them a car okay so is trust</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.270" end="00:37:58.450" style="s2">those are the actions the thresholds for</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.640" end="00:38:00.520" style="s2">action go down yeah as the thracian the</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.450" end="00:38:03.010" style="s2">need for hierarchy I guess becomes less</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.520" end="00:38:05.440" style="s2">no aha</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.010" end="00:38:07.990" style="s2">no or natural hierarchies kind of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.440" end="00:38:10.920" style="s2">developed or exactly yes action</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.990" end="00:38:14.440" style="s2">thresholds go down small just</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.920" end="00:38:16.540" style="s2">differences in skill yeah become larger</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.440" end="00:38:19.750" style="s2">and you&#39;ll get a natural hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.540" end="00:38:23.950" style="s2">when that happens trust those gowns do</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.750" end="00:38:26.680" style="s2">you have this new cycle kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.950" end="00:38:30.850" style="s2">and so in the dominant discourse all we</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.680" end="00:38:32.800" style="s2">have is polarized discourse you know</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.850" end="00:38:35.380" style="s2">those are against hierarchies and those</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.800" end="00:38:39.270" style="s2">that were things but what if we come at</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.380" end="00:38:43.560" style="s2">this from a new paradigm complex</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.270" end="00:38:48.100" style="s2">holistic systems we see our work were</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.560" end="00:38:51.790" style="s2">dealing with their complex feed loop and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.100" end="00:38:55.750" style="s2">this is part this is part of all living</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.790" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">systems there&#39;s and so the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.750" end="00:39:03.310" style="s2">thing is all societies have actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:05.650" style="s2">adjusted themselves unconsciously for</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.310" end="00:39:07.500" style="s2">these feed for these feed loops we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.650" end="00:39:11.740" style="s2">help ourselves we&#39;re self-organized</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.500" end="00:39:15.550" style="s2">Ecology&#39;s things it seems like whatever</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.740" end="00:39:16.600" style="s2">we try to do we make it worse or you</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.550" end="00:39:18.760" style="s2">know when you&#39;re talking about that I</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.600" end="00:39:22.810" style="s2">was thinking yes there&#39;s this complexity</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.760" end="00:39:25.510" style="s2">of behavior and then there&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.810" end="00:39:28.000" style="s2">attempts to try to manipulate that</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.510" end="00:39:30.700" style="s2">behavior and how often that has a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.000" end="00:39:32.020" style="s2">negative you know outcome again we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.700" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">back to the same thing you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.020" end="00:39:36.550" style="s2">about at the beginning of good</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:39.580" style="s2">intentions because we do technological</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.550" end="00:39:42.670" style="s2">innovations uh-huh from a mindset that</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.580" end="00:39:45.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have holistic complexity hmm we</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.670" end="00:39:47.350" style="s2">do technological interventions from</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.100" end="00:39:50.980" style="s2">either developmental linear</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.350" end="00:39:53.740" style="s2">developmental mindset or</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.980" end="00:39:56.589" style="s2">so how would you rate technology in the</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.740" end="00:39:59.710" style="s2">manner that you&#39;re suggesting how would</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.589" end="00:40:04.300" style="s2">I create not you personally but how</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.710" end="00:40:07.420" style="s2">would one like like how would you create</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.300" end="00:40:09.520" style="s2">technology where let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.420" end="00:40:13.359" style="s2">technology is not dominating the human</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.520" end="00:40:15.609" style="s2">being the feeling on social media that</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.359" end="00:40:18.490" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s such it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.609" end="00:40:21.640" style="s2">such a destructive ecosystem like 99% of</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.490" end="00:40:24.040" style="s2">Facebook yeah and there&#39;s like 1% that</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.640" end="00:40:27.790" style="s2">might be might be might be positive you</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.040" end="00:40:29.230" style="s2">know okay so you know we can go directly</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.790" end="00:40:31.980" style="s2">from here to there</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.230" end="00:40:35.109" style="s2">what are the feed bag feed loops in</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.980" end="00:40:35.740" style="s2">social media they&#39;re only in one</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.109" end="00:40:38.890" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.740" end="00:40:41.920" style="s2">the mob complex feed loops they do not</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.890" end="00:40:45.070" style="s2">min an image they do no it is not a</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.920" end="00:40:48.030" style="s2">platform that supports the complex feed</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.070" end="00:40:55.349" style="s2">loops in actual discourse they only</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.030" end="00:41:01.839" style="s2">amplify in one direction so amplified</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.349" end="00:41:05.560" style="s2">salience or you know the clicking one or</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.839" end="00:41:11.200" style="s2">two hijacking them Magdala I think it</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.560" end="00:41:15.520" style="s2">was what Frank so so it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.200" end="00:41:20.109" style="s2">disrupt normal discourse because it</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.520" end="00:41:23.230" style="s2">impedes the feed loops to be as rich as</p>

<p begin="00:43:14.840" end="00:43:22.460" style="s2">that paradigm and move out its to</p>

<p begin="00:43:25.820" end="00:43:31.190" style="s2">I was thinking about I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.150" end="00:43:33.530" style="s2">about how there&#39;s that going on and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.190" end="00:43:36.410" style="s2">there&#39;s this conversation going on you</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.530" end="00:43:38.510" style="s2">know so it seems like the two things are</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.410" end="00:43:40.220" style="s2">happens happening science simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.510" end="00:43:44.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s all of this interesting</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.220" end="00:43:47.660" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s out there which you can you</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.000" end="00:43:51.080" style="s2">can kind of you can learn from long-form</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.660" end="00:43:54.370" style="s2">discussions which are which are deep and</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.080" end="00:43:56.720" style="s2">interesting and then and then and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.370" end="00:43:58.940" style="s2">it&#39;s like an extreme there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.720" end="00:44:03.680" style="s2">happening and then the other extreme is</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.940" end="00:44:06.620" style="s2">this sort of sound bite you know you</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.680" end="00:44:10.310" style="s2">know very negative almost almost</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.620" end="00:44:12.410" style="s2">you know regressive mode of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.310" end="00:44:13.550" style="s2">communication happening at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.410" end="00:44:15.500" style="s2">like I see those things kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.550" end="00:44:18.109" style="s2">happening simultaneously does that does</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.500" end="00:44:20.799" style="s2">that make any sense yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.109" end="00:44:24.140" style="s2">I think that you know there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.799" end="00:44:27.890" style="s2">we were actually a group was actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.140" end="00:44:33.430" style="s2">asking this question and it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.890" end="00:44:39.140" style="s2">how much the behavior on social media is</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.430" end="00:44:42.950" style="s2">driven by the algorithms I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.140" end="00:44:46.400" style="s2">lot more than you think I think that the</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.950" end="00:44:49.999" style="s2">behavior on social media the discourse</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.400" end="00:44:52.039" style="s2">on social media is driven by that&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.999" end="00:44:55.160" style="s2">crack cocaine that&#39;s like yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.039" end="00:44:56.930" style="s2">somebody gave everybody acid yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.160" end="00:45:01.160" style="s2">heard somebody was saying that right it</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.930" end="00:45:02.809" style="s2">can&#39;t be underestimated you know yeah</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.160" end="00:45:05.239" style="s2">although I don&#39;t want to be like you</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.809" end="00:45:07.930" style="s2">know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.239" end="00:45:12.680" style="s2">dramatic or melodramatic about it but</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.930" end="00:45:15.380" style="s2">for example I have almost was 3,000</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.680" end="00:45:17.599" style="s2">or 5,000 forgot what the limit is I have</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.380" end="00:45:19.880" style="s2">thousand friends yeah yeah I like almost</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.599" end="00:45:23.839" style="s2">5,000 friends on my Facebook page</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.880" end="00:45:26.869" style="s2">mm-hmm and you know I&#39;m in this group</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.839" end="00:45:29.539" style="s2">that&#39;s grown to a thousand and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.869" end="00:45:32.720" style="s2">starting to be as they grow to that</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.539" end="00:45:34.430" style="s2">limit to be completely chaotic and</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.720" end="00:45:38.239" style="s2">dysfunctional it breaks down at a</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.430" end="00:45:39.950" style="s2">surprise but so I say the algorithms in</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.239" end="00:45:42.109" style="s2">a group are different than the Admiral</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.950" end="00:45:46.249" style="s2">algorithms on my Facebook page I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.109" end="00:45:48.499" style="s2">have I have five times more people there</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.249" end="00:45:53.150" style="s2">but I don&#39;t have that dysfunction it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.499" end="00:45:57.160" style="s2">quite quiet and respectful and so the</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.150" end="00:46:00.759" style="s2">way the way that algorithms work are</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.160" end="00:46:00.759" style="s2">different in groups</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.600" end="00:46:05.800" style="s2">and I think that&#39;s why you get the kind</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.550" end="00:46:07.690" style="s2">of dynamic so it&#39;s an algorithm that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.800" end="00:46:09.790" style="s2">almost trying to turn people against</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.690" end="00:46:13.120" style="s2">each other of course</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.790" end="00:46:17.530" style="s2">cuz the more that people the more that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.120" end="00:46:20.530" style="s2">it can prioritize like these sparks of</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.530" end="00:46:24.040" style="s2">activity which are emotional then the</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.530" end="00:46:26.040" style="s2">more it keeps your attention and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.040" end="00:46:28.900" style="s2">what it wants it wants you to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.040" end="00:46:31.690" style="s2">attention and it wants your interaction</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.900" end="00:46:33.850" style="s2">with the with the hardware to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.690" end="00:46:37.000" style="s2">emotional because that creates a</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.850" end="00:46:39.910" style="s2">coupling an addiction coupling so every</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.000" end="00:46:41.590" style="s2">time your emotional so first the hog</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.910" end="00:46:44.470" style="s2">where it creates the emotional and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.590" end="00:46:46.990" style="s2">every time your emotional you go and</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.470" end="00:46:50.320" style="s2">pick up the hardware right so it creates</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.990" end="00:46:54.540" style="s2">this one directional again not complex</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.320" end="00:46:58.210" style="s2">not rich feedback loop but a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.540" end="00:47:02.470" style="s2">exponentially amplifying feedback yeah</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.210" end="00:47:04.840" style="s2">yeah when I was talking to Zack again I</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.470" end="00:47:07.270" style="s2">have exact at my conversation with Zacks</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.840" end="00:47:09.280" style="s2">time very much in my in my mind and you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.270" end="00:47:14.230" style="s2">know he was he doesn&#39;t use social media</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.280" end="00:47:16.750" style="s2">and he was telling me and that he almost</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.230" end="00:47:20.520" style="s2">would say think it&#39;s it&#39;s unethical to</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.750" end="00:47:23.830" style="s2">use it just because of how much you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.520" end="00:47:26.260" style="s2">sort of money that these companies are</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.830" end="00:47:28.930" style="s2">making from from people&#39;s you know most</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.260" end="00:47:33.580" style="s2">intimate you know feelings and emotions</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.930" end="00:47:35.290" style="s2">and and all that so I what what why why</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.580" end="00:47:37.630" style="s2">are we still using it I mean why are</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.290" end="00:47:39.130" style="s2">intelligent people still using it and</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.630" end="00:47:41.520" style="s2">you think we should be using it or you</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.130" end="00:47:43.690" style="s2">think something else is coming next or</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.520" end="00:47:49.720" style="s2">that we can jump on to that will be</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.690" end="00:47:59.560" style="s2">better or I think question component to</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.720" end="00:48:02.770" style="s2">it I think that I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.560" end="00:48:06.310" style="s2">things about social media as is true for</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.770" end="00:48:09.160" style="s2">a lot of Technology we engage in it</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.310" end="00:48:12.340" style="s2">the effort the ethical component is very</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.160" end="00:48:15.160" style="s2">demanding and so you have to constantly</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.340" end="00:48:18.910" style="s2">ask yourself am i a choice here am I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.160" end="00:48:24.610" style="s2">choice here and ice here so there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.910" end="00:48:27.760" style="s2">due diligence that is part of it and</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.610" end="00:48:31.930" style="s2">then at a certain point and you know and</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.760" end="00:48:34.810" style="s2">I think this is more true for me than</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.930" end="00:48:37.480" style="s2">Zach and so I really respect that is</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.810" end="00:48:39.880" style="s2">like a certain point are you at choice</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.480" end="00:48:44.140" style="s2">for all the energy you&#39;re putting into</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.880" end="00:48:50.850" style="s2">the system to be a choice right so I</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.140" end="00:48:58.810" style="s2">think that there that social media is an</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.850" end="00:49:03.760" style="s2">experiment I think that if you can keep</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.810" end="00:49:05.740" style="s2">that more like an experiment yeah for</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.760" end="00:49:08.260" style="s2">example I remember you saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.740" end="00:49:10.540" style="s2">you would share positions from different</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.260" end="00:49:12.730" style="s2">political parties or from different</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.540" end="00:49:16.540" style="s2">perspectives or rather than remain</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.730" end="00:49:19.000" style="s2">trying to remain in this kind of you</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.540" end="00:49:21.580" style="s2">know bubble feedback loop where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.000" end="00:49:24.370" style="s2">just getting your own confirmation bias</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.580" end="00:49:26.730" style="s2">confirmed over over again yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.370" end="00:49:29.100" style="s2">confirmation porn somebody said that</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.730" end="00:49:33.690" style="s2">somewhere which I thought was a good</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.100" end="00:49:37.060" style="s2">exactly so so I think it&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.690" end="00:49:39.310" style="s2">to have it open up many many</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.060" end="00:49:42.970" style="s2">perspectives but again you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.310" end="00:49:46.300" style="s2">due diligence am i right am i is it just</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.970" end="00:49:49.120" style="s2">clickbait or is this some real person on</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.300" end="00:49:54.190" style="s2">the other side of opinion that is also</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.120" end="00:49:57.190" style="s2">doing due diligence and I you know I</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.190" end="00:50:01.210" style="s2">think it&#39;s I think there&#39;s there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.190" end="00:50:05.260" style="s2">comes a point where social media is not</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.210" end="00:50:11.890" style="s2">helpful and I often wonder at what point</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.260" end="00:50:14.260" style="s2">it is for me and especially now you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.890" end="00:50:16.930" style="s2">many of us are deep enough in cyberspace</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.260" end="00:50:19.000" style="s2">with that there are ways like we can</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.930" end="00:50:20.740" style="s2">find that that&#39;s great I mean it would</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.000" end="00:50:24.340" style="s2">be horrible if you couldn&#39;t find people</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.740" end="00:50:28.190" style="s2">like that you know and so the question</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.340" end="00:50:33.290" style="s2">is once you establish enough</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.190" end="00:50:36.890" style="s2">networks and how do you you know how</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.290" end="00:50:39.619" style="s2">then you can jump off and yeah yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.890" end="00:50:41.450" style="s2">how you pull the plug I think yeah oh</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.619" end="00:50:42.950" style="s2">that&#39;s that that kind of brings me up</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.450" end="00:50:47.810" style="s2">because um you know you mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.950" end="00:50:51.829" style="s2">word parallax that I&#39;m working with a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.810" end="00:50:54.140" style="s2">guy named Tom I&#39;m mark I think you did a</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.829" end="00:50:56.599" style="s2">podcast with him and his magazine is</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.140" end="00:51:00.589" style="s2">called parallax magazine and and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.599" end="00:51:03.859" style="s2">working with Alexander as well and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.589" end="00:51:07.640" style="s2">wanted to make this magazine into a kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.859" end="00:51:09.319" style="s2">of alert learning platform as it was</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.640" end="00:51:11.390" style="s2">kind of its kind of our ambition at the</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.319" end="00:51:12.980" style="s2">moment and we&#39;ve been talking about this</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.390" end="00:51:17.000" style="s2">for a while and and and now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.980" end="00:51:20.000" style="s2">talking about it openly so so I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.000" end="00:51:21.650" style="s2">to get maybe your advice and how we</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.000" end="00:51:25.339" style="s2">could do that like how something like</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.650" end="00:51:26.869" style="s2">that could be done you know III we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.339" end="00:51:29.660" style="s2">making a video and we&#39;re gonna put it</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.869" end="00:51:30.980" style="s2">out on YouTube and podcasts and and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.660" end="00:51:33.079" style="s2">kind of thing that&#39;s how it gets to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.980" end="00:51:34.670" style="s2">people but again we haven&#39;t pulled the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.079" end="00:51:36.829" style="s2">plug we haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t found that</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.670" end="00:51:39.349" style="s2">there hasn&#39;t we haven&#39;t found a space</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.829" end="00:51:46.089" style="s2">for let&#39;s say intelligent people that</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.349" end="00:51:50.140" style="s2">want to be thinking in a parallax world</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.089" end="00:51:52.910" style="s2">yeah I think it&#39;s you know these are not</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.140" end="00:51:54.079" style="s2">these are questions and experiments that</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.910" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">are not yet answered</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.079" end="00:52:02.119" style="s2">I think we&#39;re experimenting our way to</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:05.390" style="s2">them you know and the what&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.119" end="00:52:07.579" style="s2">is the shelf life of these innovations</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.390" end="00:52:09.470" style="s2">or these initiatives is starting to get</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.579" end="00:52:12.829" style="s2">really short so for example the</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.470" end="00:52:18.079" style="s2">intellectual dark web became it went you</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.829" end="00:52:20.630" style="s2">know it came it wound it and even like</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.079" end="00:52:22.520" style="s2">some I mean I was very happy to be on</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.630" end="00:52:24.290" style="s2">this podcast with you because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.520" end="00:52:28.550" style="s2">much more like a conversation and not</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.290" end="00:52:36.050" style="s2">like trying to capture a certain segment</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.550" end="00:52:38.420" style="s2">or sector and you know so there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.050" end="00:52:40.339" style="s2">in I love his accent he&#39;s like you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.420" end="00:52:42.020" style="s2">to some point podcast like we have a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.339" end="00:52:48.890" style="s2">podcast with Zack</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.020" end="00:52:50.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not entertain yeah so well yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.890" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">would be a conversation it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.480" end="00:52:54.230" style="s2">marketing like marketing&#39;s over like</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:56.030" style="s2">there&#39;s no need to be Martin all</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.230" end="00:52:58.610" style="s2">marketing about it does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.030" end="00:53:03.050" style="s2">we don&#39;t have we don&#39;t have to put on</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.610" end="00:53:05.210" style="s2">some kind of a persona and you know have</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.050" end="00:53:07.070" style="s2">a deep voice and all this music and</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.210" end="00:53:12.230" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s you know almost like the</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.070" end="00:53:17.180" style="s2">raw thing yeah more but then the</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.230" end="00:53:18.620" style="s2">question becomes you know and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.180" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">saying you know these are these are</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.620" end="00:53:24.080" style="s2">things and I think you&#39;re probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.720" end="00:53:26.960" style="s2">trying to answer and that is like then</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.080" end="00:53:32.660" style="s2">what is the public or performance nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.960" end="00:53:37.850" style="s2">of it and you know some of the work that</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.660" end="00:53:39.740" style="s2">Hannah rented comes to mind because she</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.850" end="00:53:41.780" style="s2">talks about you know there&#39;s a private</p>
<p begin="00:53:39.740" end="00:53:44.720" style="s2">sphere and there&#39;s a public sphere and</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.780" end="00:53:51.020" style="s2">the Polish the great polish is when you</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.720" end="00:53:53.780" style="s2">came into the public sphere and and what</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.020" end="00:53:56.660" style="s2">did you share right and the question</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.780" end="00:54:00.230" style="s2">here is with the rise of the internet is</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.660" end="00:54:03.350" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s almost like everything is</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.230" end="00:54:05.930" style="s2">public everything is the paulus so what</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.350" end="00:54:11.980" style="s2">are the new rules what are the new rules</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.930" end="00:54:14.450" style="s2">for engagement and and you&#39;ve become</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.980" end="00:54:16.100" style="s2">virtual versions of yourself so</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.450" end="00:54:17.990" style="s2">something you see on a video can get</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.100" end="00:54:18.860" style="s2">clipped and put over here and now you</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.990" end="00:54:22.070" style="s2">exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.860" end="00:54:24.590" style="s2">if you have any kind of social capital</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.070" end="00:54:27.470" style="s2">that&#39;s influenced if you&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.590" end="00:54:30.340" style="s2">influencer now you exist influencing the</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.470" end="00:54:38.660" style="s2">opposite of maybe what you wanted to say</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.340" end="00:54:41.470" style="s2">and these are big questions yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.660" end="00:54:45.320" style="s2">well I think I think you know in a way</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.470" end="00:54:49.910" style="s2">in a way we do have to go back into</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.320" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">smaller communities don&#39;t we smaller</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.910" end="00:54:55.869" style="s2">hubs and smaller smaller worlds because</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:55:00.940" style="s2">when something is too big it&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.869" end="00:55:07.319" style="s2">it&#39;s corrupt does that make any sense or</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.940" end="00:55:10.569" style="s2">is that yeah so I talked about it we all</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.319" end="00:55:13.089" style="s2">our worlds are becoming Isis like</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.569" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">they&#39;re just identities like us versus</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.089" end="00:55:20.170" style="s2">them it&#39;s like a thin category and what</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:24.779" style="s2">we don&#39;t have anymore our ways and we</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.170" end="00:55:28.809" style="s2">are units of agency so if you&#39;re on a</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.779" end="00:55:33.339" style="s2">team like a baseball team you say we did</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.809" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">it it&#39;s clear but when what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.339" end="00:55:38.380" style="s2">and so maybe it&#39;s a Dunbar number but</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:40.029" style="s2">for me it&#39;s not the number but it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.380" end="00:55:43.900" style="s2">point at which you feel that the</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.029" end="00:55:46.240" style="s2">collective is the unit of agency an</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.900" end="00:55:48.579" style="s2">intimacy like there&#39;s others there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.240" end="00:55:49.480" style="s2">real relationship between each person</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.579" end="00:55:51.279" style="s2">exactly</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.480" end="00:55:53.349" style="s2">not like a hyper relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.279" end="00:55:55.539" style="s2">them not like the person is you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.349" end="00:55:58.499" style="s2">this is on a stage and you&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.539" end="00:56:01.989" style="s2">audience or or the person is you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.499" end="00:56:03.730" style="s2">just a persona or where there&#39;s a real I</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.989" end="00:56:05.650" style="s2">guess that&#39;s what a church is is or a</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.730" end="00:56:07.539" style="s2">temple or they they&#39;re they&#39;re always</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.650" end="00:56:12.369" style="s2">there&#39;s always you always know everybody</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.539" end="00:56:14.829" style="s2">at the church yeah but sometimes not</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.369" end="00:56:16.920" style="s2">sometimes a religion versus a church or</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.829" end="00:56:20.619" style="s2">a parish I would say becomes an us</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.920" end="00:56:22.920" style="s2">because you know actually a unit of</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.619" end="00:56:25.630" style="s2">agency you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.920" end="00:56:27.999" style="s2">participating in the enactment of some</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.630" end="00:56:31.210" style="s2">kind of world oh you&#39;re a cult rather</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.999" end="00:56:35.349" style="s2">than a are you just on the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.210" end="00:56:37.329" style="s2">well I&#39;m not enacting the things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.349" end="00:56:40.210" style="s2">Catholic Church does let&#39;s say I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.329" end="00:56:43.299" style="s2">enacting the things that my religion</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.210" end="00:56:50.710" style="s2">does and I don&#39;t even agree with maybe</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.299" end="00:56:52.239" style="s2">it so you know what is what is yeah how</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.710" end="00:56:54.009" style="s2">to keep it living I think what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.239" end="00:56:55.869" style="s2">hearing from you is how to keep the</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.009" end="00:56:59.319" style="s2">whole the community are living like a</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.869" end="00:57:02.680" style="s2">living community yeah you know so if I</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.319" end="00:57:07.230" style="s2">associate with something like I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.680" end="00:57:07.230" style="s2">know any kind of any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.590" end="00:57:15.630" style="s2">ideology or any kind of category like</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.690" end="00:57:16.950" style="s2">like I&#39;m a female okay yeah well my we</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.630" end="00:57:20.040" style="s2">is not female</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.950" end="00:57:22.680" style="s2">I don&#39;t experience all women together</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.040" end="00:57:25.590" style="s2">doing something together like a we on a</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.680" end="00:57:28.530" style="s2">team it&#39;s not a unit of agency it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.590" end="00:57:31.890" style="s2">a categorical identity and what you see</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.530" end="00:57:34.530" style="s2">is more and more people identified with</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.890" end="00:57:37.980" style="s2">categorical identities and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.530" end="00:57:42.300" style="s2">actually enact things as groups they</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.980" end="00:57:45.120" style="s2">know actually you know have Wiis that</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.300" end="00:57:47.940" style="s2">have goals and aims that they come back</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.120" end="00:57:51.030" style="s2">to and focus on as a group one of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.940" end="00:57:53.340" style="s2">one of the early things I found out when</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.030" end="00:57:59.190" style="s2">I started doing group process dialogic</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.340" end="00:58:00.870" style="s2">process is that after it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.190" end="00:58:04.260" style="s2">just learning how to talk to each other</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.870" end="00:58:06.420" style="s2">mm-hmm so and in these in these group</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.260" end="00:58:07.920" style="s2">processes you always have the tension</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.420" end="00:58:09.420" style="s2">between the individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.920" end="00:58:14.700" style="s2">collective the autonomy and the</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.420" end="00:58:18.690" style="s2">relationality yeah that that is like two</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.700" end="00:58:23.460" style="s2">legs of a three-legged stool in history</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.690" end="00:58:26.580" style="s2">all collectives are also solidified by</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.460" end="00:58:28.650" style="s2">action there that&#39;s where the family is</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.580" end="00:58:31.470" style="s2">powerful you&#39;re not just an individual</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.650" end="00:58:34.740" style="s2">and the collective you have things to do</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.470" end="00:58:38.160" style="s2">home to build food to create there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.740" end="00:58:39.720" style="s2">unit of locus of production inside the</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.160" end="00:58:42.150" style="s2">collective that&#39;s different than being</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.720" end="00:58:45.150" style="s2">like you know a French citizen or</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.150" end="00:58:48.060" style="s2">something or exactly so when you have</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.150" end="00:58:50.850" style="s2">these we space groups that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.060" end="00:58:53.430" style="s2">the third don&#39;t have the third leg of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.850" end="00:58:57.810" style="s2">the three-legged stool they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.430" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">actual work abstracts or a project they</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.810" end="00:59:02.510" style="s2">actually don&#39;t let the world in and</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.520" end="00:59:06.300" style="s2">they&#39;re saying oh humans can be you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.510" end="00:59:09.060" style="s2">transformative just by individual and</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.300" end="00:59:13.080" style="s2">collective intersubjective is in</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.060" end="00:59:15.630" style="s2">individual sovereign actions is not true</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.080" end="00:59:19.020" style="s2">we&#39;ve cut ourselves off from the other</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.630" end="00:59:20.630" style="s2">aspect of what being a human collective</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.020" end="00:59:22.400" style="s2">is and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.630" end="00:59:25.760" style="s2">with the world you have to let the world</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.400" end="00:59:28.970" style="s2">in the world solidifies so for example</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.760" end="00:59:31.160" style="s2">it works both ways because I you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.970" end="00:59:34.330" style="s2">you could have a dysfunctional community</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.160" end="00:59:38.200" style="s2">and then a hurt Herick and hits and</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.330" end="00:59:42.110" style="s2">everybody&#39;s together because the action</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.200" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">solidifies grounds its discourse so all</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.110" end="00:59:50.780" style="s2">these practices are sure to fail yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:53.450" style="s2">discourse this is also why some of these</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.780" end="00:59:55.820" style="s2">you have to remember mind this in your</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.450" end="00:59:59.120" style="s2">podcast so how do you move how do you</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.820" end="01:00:02.030" style="s2">build so you and Tom and Alexander will</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.120" end="01:00:05.000" style="s2">be really doing something in the world</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.030" end="01:00:08.240" style="s2">but how do you express that call to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.000" end="01:00:12.500" style="s2">action to your audience to make a week</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.240" end="01:00:14.990" style="s2">and this is this is again this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.500" end="01:00:17.120" style="s2">the blind spots in a lot of these</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.990" end="01:00:19.700" style="s2">practices and it&#39;s something on Facebook</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.120" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">there is no world there so like in game</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.700" end="01:00:24.080" style="s2">D Facebook there&#39;s no there&#39;s no world</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:26.900" style="s2">there is that what you said yeah world</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.080" end="01:00:31.340" style="s2">no work there&#39;s no work there it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.900" end="01:00:33.530" style="s2">you know right so we constantly say this</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.340" end="01:00:36.530" style="s2">Facebook group is not going be find</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.530" end="01:00:41.600" style="s2">people&#39;s make a choice do an experiment</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.530" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">in the world so so it can&#39;t be just a</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.600" end="01:00:45.080" style="s2">media platform it has to be sort of</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:47.210" style="s2">events as well it has to be people</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.080" end="01:00:50.840" style="s2">getting together to do pro actual</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.210" end="01:00:53.840" style="s2">projects if you hear in collectives the</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.840" end="01:00:56.630" style="s2">world has to be the third leg of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.840" end="01:01:00.700" style="s2">three-legged stool the actual work in</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.630" end="01:01:03.380" style="s2">the world your body the work that you do</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.700" end="01:01:06.980" style="s2">or else you&#39;re not gonna get coherence</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.380" end="01:01:09.680" style="s2">okay so all those forms that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.980" end="01:01:16.880" style="s2">realize that are destined to just be</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.680" end="01:01:18.170" style="s2">incoherent mm-hmm you mentioned if</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.880" end="01:01:19.730" style="s2">there&#39;s a hurricane or something like</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.170" end="01:01:22.220" style="s2">that we would all get together and we</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.730" end="01:01:25.760" style="s2">suddenly become human right suddenly</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.220" end="01:01:27.320" style="s2">become how relationships with each other</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.760" end="01:01:32.030" style="s2">instead of just walking around like</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.320" end="01:01:34.040" style="s2">zombies no no but then the question is</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.030" end="01:01:34.490" style="s2">like how do you do that in just ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.040" end="01:01:36.410" style="s2">life when</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.490" end="01:01:39.490" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a you know when the world</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.410" end="01:01:44.810" style="s2">isn&#39;t falling apart all around you or or</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.490" end="01:01:48.200" style="s2">well the way we used to do it we would</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.810" end="01:01:50.800" style="s2">create art or sing talk together or</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.200" end="01:01:55.130" style="s2">dance there would always be things to do</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.800" end="01:01:58.850" style="s2">and so when you take this into the into</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.130" end="01:02:01.090" style="s2">the workplace so so one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.850" end="01:02:03.800" style="s2">where a lot of people doing collective</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.090" end="01:02:05.690" style="s2">discourse practice have started to work</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.800" end="01:02:09.380" style="s2">with organizations is because they do</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.690" end="01:02:12.260" style="s2">have a goal or a name but in many</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.380" end="01:02:15.500" style="s2">organizations there isn&#39;t what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.260" end="01:02:18.410" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually asked to do is</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.500" end="01:02:21.140" style="s2">decoupled from the goal or the aim of</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.410" end="01:02:24.710" style="s2">the whole itself so you have what graver</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.140" end="01:02:30.260" style="s2">calls jobs right jobs</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.710" end="01:02:33.130" style="s2">yeah so you start to have you start to</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.260" end="01:02:38.660" style="s2">see people going into the workplace and</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.130" end="01:02:41.540" style="s2">having you know more loyalty to a small</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.660" end="01:02:42.500" style="s2">silo because they can have a picnic or</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.540" end="01:02:44.869" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna do something they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.500" end="01:02:47.480" style="s2">actually doing something together but in</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.869" end="01:02:48.830" style="s2">the context of their career they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.480" end="01:02:51.290" style="s2">they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.830" end="01:02:54.350" style="s2">something with the organization because</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.290" end="01:02:56.869" style="s2">it&#39;s a job so this is another</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.350" end="01:02:59.210" style="s2">way of saying you need the sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.869" end="01:03:01.070" style="s2">the iconic autonomy of the individual</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.210" end="01:03:03.530" style="s2">you need the relationality of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.070" end="01:03:05.840" style="s2">collective and you need agency you need</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.530" end="01:03:08.240" style="s2">action in the world and then the system</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.840" end="01:03:10.160" style="s2">coherence yeah I mean I guess the only</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.240" end="01:03:18.050" style="s2">reason we do job is to make</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.160" end="01:03:20.230" style="s2">money right to survive you never had one</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.050" end="01:03:23.780" style="s2">well yeah you must be very fortunate</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.230" end="01:03:26.270" style="s2">yeah very also work very hard to be in</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.780" end="01:03:29.480" style="s2">that position I didn&#39;t mean to no no I</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.270" end="01:03:32.780" style="s2">did I did in high school I worked in a</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.480" end="01:03:34.160" style="s2">factory to save money go to college that</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.780" end="01:03:37.880" style="s2">was the kind of a job</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.160" end="01:03:40.310" style="s2">but then after that well I guess I</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.880" end="01:03:41.810" style="s2">washed dishes you know and things like</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.310" end="01:03:43.070" style="s2">that I worked in restaurants and on</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.810" end="01:03:45.350" style="s2">fishing boats and those aren&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.070" end="01:03:47.050" style="s2"> jobs like working-class jobs</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.350" end="01:03:49.640" style="s2">are not jobs because</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.050" end="01:03:52.040" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s the kind of job where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.640" end="01:03:55.700" style="s2">putting numbers into Excel files you</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.040" end="01:04:01.060" style="s2">know that seemed to me to be sort of so</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.700" end="01:04:01.060" style="s2">dehumanizing yeah I mean I worked in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.500" end="01:04:10.369" style="s2">like what is it called not a deli but</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.000" end="01:04:14.210" style="s2">where like a catering industry arm of a</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.369" end="01:04:17.450" style="s2">big big store in California and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.210" end="01:04:22.520" style="s2">learned so much about cooking and spices</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.450" end="01:04:27.020" style="s2">and food farm-to-table you know so the</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.520" end="01:04:29.510" style="s2">the benefits of that job it wasn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.020" end="01:04:31.670" style="s2">wasn&#39;t highly paid but it wasn&#39;t gonna</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.510" end="01:04:33.800" style="s2">feel like a job no and then</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.670" end="01:04:35.829" style="s2">after that I just I worked I ran my own</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.800" end="01:04:45.410" style="s2">companies and landscape design</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.829" end="01:04:47.510" style="s2">architecture contracting so yeah so so I</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.410" end="01:04:49.550" style="s2">think this that the things you do I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.510" end="01:04:52.310" style="s2">always been very practically again as</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.550" end="01:04:54.530" style="s2">what I was struck struck by by your</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.310" end="01:04:56.089" style="s2">writing and and and the fact that you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.530" end="01:04:57.319" style="s2">very practical things and then but</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.089" end="01:05:00.380" style="s2">you&#39;re also working with this high</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.319" end="01:05:02.660" style="s2">abstract concepts and try not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.380" end="01:05:04.790" style="s2">bring it bring the two together and well</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.660" end="01:05:06.710" style="s2">I just a lot of the sort of stuff that</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.790" end="01:05:11.089" style="s2">people do around getting together and</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.710" end="01:05:14.030" style="s2">and like talking and doing dialogue and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.089" end="01:05:18.710" style="s2">and all that sort of stuff often feels</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.030" end="01:05:21.079" style="s2">quite flaky and narcissistic to me</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.710" end="01:05:22.819" style="s2">because because because yeah for that</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.079" end="01:05:24.890" style="s2">exact precise reason that you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.819" end="01:05:27.020" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay we had this good feeling</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.890" end="01:05:29.599" style="s2">together we had this good communal</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.020" end="01:05:30.950" style="s2">feeling together it&#39;s like so what</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.599" end="01:05:38.839" style="s2">that&#39;s it that you know I always want to</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.950" end="01:05:40.970" style="s2">say it&#39;s good feeling is an important</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.839" end="01:05:47.410" style="s2">experience but then when it becomes the</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.970" end="01:05:52.940" style="s2">hole or catharsis or it&#39;s just endless</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.410" end="01:05:56.990" style="s2">it is so grounded in something and doing</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.940" end="01:05:58.589" style="s2">something something real or it seems</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.990" end="01:06:04.170" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.589" end="01:06:06.210" style="s2">a kind of upper-class pastime or I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.170" end="01:06:08.999" style="s2">know maybe I&#39;m being too insulting here</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.210" end="01:06:11.759" style="s2">with no no I just was talking about this</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.999" end="01:06:16.829" style="s2">with the future thinkers people and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.759" end="01:06:19.799" style="s2">thing is is you know Western popular</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.829" end="01:06:23.609" style="s2">Western psychology you know over</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.799" end="01:06:25.680" style="s2">psychologize is everything this is and</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.609" end="01:06:29.670" style="s2">there&#39;s a little bit of an entertainment</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.680" end="01:06:33.329" style="s2">factor in it when people don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.670" end="01:06:35.489" style="s2">else to do they can start deconstructing</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.329" end="01:06:37.890" style="s2">this psyche now part of that is helpful</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.489" end="01:06:40.950" style="s2">but what happens is when you&#39;re in these</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.890" end="01:06:43.349" style="s2">extended groups the psyche one of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.950" end="01:06:47.039" style="s2">the nature of the psyche is to create</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.349" end="01:06:48.719" style="s2">structures so you and so you have for</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.039" end="01:06:50.969" style="s2">example people that will work with</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.719" end="01:06:53.969" style="s2">internal family systems and they have</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.969" end="01:06:55.890" style="s2">like you know the inner child and the</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.969" end="01:06:59.190" style="s2">father and the mother and the policeman</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.890" end="01:07:01.619" style="s2">and then I then I I know people who then</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.190" end="01:07:06.059" style="s2">think the inners inner systems</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.619" end="01:07:09.509" style="s2">themselves have inner systems and so the</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.059" end="01:07:11.700" style="s2">psyche can can you have to be careful</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.509" end="01:07:14.460" style="s2">because as you&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.700" end="01:07:16.349" style="s2">psychological structures you&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.460" end="01:07:18.989" style="s2">creating more psychological structures</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.349" end="01:07:20.930" style="s2">that you have to work with so it is</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.989" end="01:07:24.420" style="s2">infinite it&#39;s a it&#39;s a self</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.930" end="01:07:26.460" style="s2">proliferating process and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.420" end="01:07:29.400" style="s2">know about this you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.460" end="01:07:32.219" style="s2">actually finding more and more</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.400" end="01:07:35.789" style="s2">complexity you&#39;re getting to something</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.219" end="01:07:39.239" style="s2">but you&#39;re building it up as you do so</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.789" end="01:07:41.849" style="s2">and we got to iatrogenic</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.239" end="01:07:44.819" style="s2">this this in medically created diseases</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.849" end="01:07:47.219" style="s2">in a way it seems to me that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.819" end="01:07:50.219" style="s2">happens to is is that the more you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.219" end="01:07:55.559" style="s2">complex solutions we come up to things</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.219" end="01:07:57.739" style="s2">and we&#39;re actually creating harm yeah or</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.559" end="01:08:01.680" style="s2">at least if it&#39;s not harm its</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.739" end="01:08:05.160" style="s2">complexified things you know Carl I</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.680" end="01:08:08.160" style="s2">think it&#39;s Karl Weick he has this great</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.160" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">little metaphor he says you know the</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.160" end="01:08:12.330" style="s2">human body is very complex and we could</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:19.290" style="s2">think of it the psyche us</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.330" end="01:08:21.870" style="s2">and if I&#39;m sick like then I go to our</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.290" end="01:08:23.790" style="s2">doctor now the system&#39;s even more</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.870" end="01:08:26.720" style="s2">complex because not only do I have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.790" end="01:08:30.950" style="s2">complexity human body but I have the</p>
<p begin="01:08:26.720" end="01:08:34.380" style="s2">complexity of the medical doctors</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.950" end="01:08:36.750" style="s2">paradigm and the medical doctors</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.380" end="01:08:38.310" style="s2">complexity and his interpretation of me</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.750" end="01:08:40.859" style="s2">and there might be some political or</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.310" end="01:08:45.780" style="s2">social class kind of thing yeah so that</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.859" end="01:08:48.750" style="s2">move is hyper complexified the illness</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.780" end="01:08:51.330" style="s2">just just that one move and the medical</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.750" end="01:08:53.370" style="s2">doctors inside the institution and the</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.330" end="01:08:57.690" style="s2">insurance company in this and that so</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.370" end="01:09:00.030" style="s2">how is a society do we improve how can</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.690" end="01:09:07.650" style="s2">we intervene at the lowest level of</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.030" end="01:09:11.550" style="s2">complexity that&#39;s possible great so he</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.650" end="01:09:14.700" style="s2">says you know we have the but because of</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.550" end="01:09:17.400" style="s2">our society we&#39;ve given people the</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.700" end="01:09:22.080" style="s2">impression that self-care is inadequate</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.400" end="01:09:27.600" style="s2">self learning is deficient yeah self</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.080" end="01:09:30.089" style="s2">work yes less valuable so it makes us</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.600" end="01:09:32.390" style="s2">because that the shadow economy like all</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.089" end="01:09:34.830" style="s2">people thing all the things people do</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.390" end="01:09:37.670" style="s2">which are devalued but which are</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.830" end="01:09:40.730" style="s2">actually often the most valuable thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.670" end="01:09:43.470" style="s2">like being a mother for example or</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.730" end="01:09:47.520" style="s2">exactly in every move toward the next</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.470" end="01:09:50.700" style="s2">level of complexity hyper complexify is</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.520" end="01:09:52.560" style="s2">it right so if I can if I know something</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.700" end="01:09:55.860" style="s2">about my own body you can work with them</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.560" end="01:09:57.600" style="s2">but if that&#39;s less complex then going to</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.860" end="01:09:58.590" style="s2">a doctor now I have to make that move</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.600" end="01:10:03.870" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.590" end="01:10:05.850" style="s2">but the it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I I tell my</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.870" end="01:10:08.010" style="s2">students you know solve your problems at</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.850" end="01:10:13.260" style="s2">the lowest level of complexity that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.010" end="01:10:17.250" style="s2">can the same problems so deal with them</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.260" end="01:10:18.600" style="s2">there don&#39;t go to a doctor to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.250" end="01:10:22.190" style="s2">how to solve your problem with your</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.600" end="01:10:23.980" style="s2">mother go talk to your mother</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.190" end="01:10:29.080" style="s2">great</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.980" end="01:10:30.490" style="s2">yeah yeah that&#39;s hard it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.080" end="01:10:32.440" style="s2">hard to talk to your mother&#39;s much more</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.490" end="01:10:35.440" style="s2">easier much easier to go talk to a</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.440" end="01:10:39.160" style="s2">therapist ten years ago my mother my</p>
<p begin="01:10:35.440" end="01:10:42.010" style="s2">relationship yeah I was thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.160" end="01:10:43.930" style="s2">yeah well you had some interest in your</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.010" end="01:10:45.340" style="s2">discussion with David fuller a rebel</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.930" end="01:10:50.680" style="s2">wisdom I thought you had some</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.340" end="01:10:54.310" style="s2">interesting insights about about men and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.680" end="01:10:59.440" style="s2">women and and and you know and and that</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.310" end="01:11:03.750" style="s2">whole thing yeah and that I thought was</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.440" end="01:11:07.750" style="s2">very very useful so yeah so I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.750" end="01:11:09.670" style="s2">kind of expand that a little because I</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.750" end="01:11:17.050" style="s2">don&#39;t want it to generate it it can</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.670" end="01:11:19.450" style="s2">generate into a man and woman so this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.050" end="01:11:22.540" style="s2">kind of what I call a heuristic or a</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.450" end="01:11:25.990" style="s2">little taxonomy of the types of</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.540" end="01:11:31.030" style="s2">behaviors people tend to show up within</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.990" end="01:11:33.130" style="s2">in group process and I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.030" end="01:11:35.890" style="s2">rebel wisdom I talked about the rancor</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.130" end="01:11:38.950" style="s2">and the were longer yeah these are two</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.890" end="01:11:42.010" style="s2">out of the eight but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.950" end="01:11:45.130" style="s2">there&#39;s some deeper psychological schema</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.010" end="01:11:48.720" style="s2">underneath how you show up so for</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.130" end="01:11:52.159" style="s2">example and there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.720" end="01:11:56.360" style="s2">three structures in this</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.159" end="01:11:59.239" style="s2">typology so there&#39;s what&#39;s called the</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.360" end="01:12:04.330" style="s2">primary psychological schema this is</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.239" end="01:12:07.550" style="s2">from good joke Jeff&#39;s work that is yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.330" end="01:12:08.170" style="s2">good job brave is just like sorry to</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.550" end="01:12:10.550" style="s2">interrupt</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.170" end="01:12:12.530" style="s2">you mentioned Gert chefs craving and</p>
<p begin="01:12:10.550" end="01:12:16.400" style="s2">dirt chef is like I live in a von France</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.530" end="01:12:18.679" style="s2">where he had his his big monastery in</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.400" end="01:12:23.389" style="s2">his graves about a block away from my</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.679" end="01:12:27.920" style="s2">house sorry excuse me for interrupting</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.389" end="01:12:29.929" style="s2">your yeah so the primary psychological</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.920" end="01:12:33.469" style="s2">structure or the strategy of the child</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.929" end="01:12:38.080" style="s2">is either to take power or seek approval</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.469" end="01:12:41.060" style="s2">sometimes that&#39;s highly gendered</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.080" end="01:12:47.060" style="s2">sometimes not but this is this is like</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.060" end="01:12:49.550" style="s2">the primary so the rancor see takes</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.060" end="01:12:52.820" style="s2">power has has learned as a child to take</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.550" end="01:12:55.580" style="s2">power the belong er to seek approval so</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.820" end="01:12:59.690" style="s2">that&#39;s one aspect the second aspect is</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.580" end="01:13:02.960" style="s2">what I call social processing typology</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.690" end="01:13:06.500" style="s2">so when were to come into group space we</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.960" end="01:13:09.110" style="s2">have social anxiety it&#39;s it&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.500" end="01:13:15.500" style="s2">being a mammal really you get to get</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.110" end="01:13:17.810" style="s2">your energy comes up and so when so</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.500" end="01:13:19.909" style="s2">there&#39;s another type apology some people</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.810" end="01:13:26.739" style="s2">turn that energy into talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.909" end="01:13:30.380" style="s2">emotions and using story and some use</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.739" end="01:13:33.620" style="s2">mental models and abstractions right</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.380" end="01:13:37.639" style="s2">right so so then there&#39;s either</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.620" end="01:13:42.370" style="s2">narrative or absence concepts easily and</p>
<p begin="01:13:37.639" end="01:13:47.030" style="s2">then the third piece is how we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.370" end="01:13:49.400" style="s2">trained to think about collectives and</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.030" end="01:13:52.670" style="s2">this is comes from our social or</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.400" end="01:13:56.570" style="s2">political kind of background and so one</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.670" end="01:13:59.750" style="s2">one typology is the focus on individuals</p>
<p begin="01:13:56.570" end="01:14:02.960" style="s2">rights and responsibilities and the</p>
<p begin="01:13:59.750" end="01:14:05.280" style="s2">others are collective so you have Jordan</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.960" end="01:14:07.050" style="s2">Peterson on one side and then you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.280" end="01:14:10.830" style="s2">social justice warriors on the other</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.050" end="01:14:14.100" style="s2">something like that right so a rancor is</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.830" end="01:14:18.119" style="s2">my archetype for a person who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.100" end="01:14:20.340" style="s2">psychological schema is power processing</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.119" end="01:14:25.460" style="s2">temperaments concepts in individual</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.340" end="01:14:31.350" style="s2">rights and you&#39;ll see in ABBA longer is</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.460" end="01:14:34.980" style="s2">approval narrative and collective and if</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.350" end="01:14:37.679" style="s2">you take these three things it creates a</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.980" end="01:14:40.830" style="s2">matrix of eight social types and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.679" end="01:14:42.659" style="s2">done this in workshops we just yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.830" end="01:14:45.150" style="s2">you have precisely eight different types</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.659" end="01:14:46.860" style="s2">of yeah because the combination of these</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.150" end="01:14:50.820" style="s2">three and different combinations give</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.860" end="01:14:55.230" style="s2">you eight types so the rancor is power</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.820" end="01:14:57.270" style="s2">concepts and individual but you could</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.230" end="01:14:59.310" style="s2">have power concepts and collective</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.270" end="01:15:04.679" style="s2">that&#39;s a different one a different</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.310" end="01:15:06.210" style="s2">archetype and I&#39;ve done in some of my</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.679" end="01:15:07.889" style="s2">early work I mean it&#39;s kind of a fun</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.210" end="01:15:09.780" style="s2">typology it&#39;s not that intellectually</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.889" end="01:15:11.639" style="s2">rigorous but people will take the test</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.780" end="01:15:14.250" style="s2">they&#39;ll answer the three questions when</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.639" end="01:15:17.540" style="s2">you are a child relative to other kids</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.250" end="01:15:21.090" style="s2">did you take our secret probe all and</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.540" end="01:15:23.909" style="s2">they will recognize their archetype</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.090" end="01:15:26.520" style="s2">based upon these structures that are</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.909" end="01:15:31.920" style="s2">operating on them and so my point in the</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.520" end="01:15:35.030" style="s2">rebel wisdom was that people you know</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.920" end="01:15:40.050" style="s2">people have biases they think that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:35.030" end="01:15:42.270" style="s2">one of these archetypes is better in</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.050" end="01:15:44.400" style="s2">cluttered space than the others and I</p>
<p begin="01:15:42.270" end="01:15:46.860" style="s2">say no they&#39;re just different archetypes</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.400" end="01:15:49.080" style="s2">of the social self and what the first</p>
<p begin="01:15:46.860" end="01:15:52.320" style="s2">stage is in collective process is the</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.080" end="01:15:57.500" style="s2">Ruby on the social self into more</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.320" end="01:16:01.650" style="s2">authentic selves so it&#39;s just is</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.500" end="01:16:04.860" style="s2">typology and yeah well often that the</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.650" end="01:16:07.889" style="s2">belonging stuff you know has its form of</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.860" end="01:16:09.810" style="s2">manipulation right just as exactly this</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.889" end="01:16:12.360" style="s2">is the ranking stuff that has this form</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.810" end="01:16:14.219" style="s2">of you know manipulation so in ranking</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.360" end="01:16:18.210" style="s2">stuff is the more obvious kind of male I</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.219" end="01:16:19.010" style="s2">would yeah one person trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.210" end="01:16:20.420" style="s2">tougher than</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.010" end="01:16:24.110" style="s2">the other and then and then the</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.420" end="01:16:26.990" style="s2">belonging is more more female or is that</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.110" end="01:16:29.000" style="s2">too reductive it&#39;s reductive the point</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.990" end="01:16:31.250" style="s2">is they&#39;re both they&#39;re both social</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.000" end="01:16:33.850" style="s2">selves they&#39;re social strategies to</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.250" end="01:16:36.620" style="s2">reduce anxiety and they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.850" end="01:16:39.230" style="s2">distortions of the authentic self so</p>
<p begin="01:16:36.620" end="01:16:41.960" style="s2">neither of none of them you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.230" end="01:16:48.350" style="s2">you don&#39;t want them in you know as you</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.960" end="01:16:51.950" style="s2">move along and I was just saying some of</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.350" end="01:16:54.740" style="s2">the confusion in social space social</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.950" end="01:16:59.030" style="s2">collective practice was a lot of the</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.740" end="01:17:01.910" style="s2">initial circles were convened by people</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.030" end="01:17:05.360" style="s2">who thought the belonging needs person</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.910" end="01:17:09.200" style="s2">was in the right direction I&#39;ve noticed</p>
<p begin="01:17:05.360" end="01:17:11.240" style="s2">that because and neither of them are in</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.200" end="01:17:15.080" style="s2">the right direction they they are</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.240" end="01:17:19.640" style="s2">actually the same structure that needs</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.080" end="01:17:22.810" style="s2">to be resolved yeah often it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.640" end="01:17:25.820" style="s2">the I would see this as people who are</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.810" end="01:17:31.580" style="s2">really into emotionality and feeling and</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.820" end="01:17:35.240" style="s2">expression and drama queen type of</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.580" end="01:17:38.600" style="s2">people run the show and then the geeky</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.240" end="01:17:41.810" style="s2">little or lost in abstraction or</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.600" end="01:17:56.960" style="s2">completely lost we could see how the</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.810" end="01:18:01.550" style="s2">other yeah you know and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.960" end="01:18:04.040" style="s2">gifts the rancor becomes very perceptive</p>
<p begin="01:18:01.550" end="01:18:09.950" style="s2">and tends to be a very builder these</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.040" end="01:18:13.040" style="s2">these high build theories to see them as</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.950" end="01:18:14.780" style="s2">you get more capacity in these groups if</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.040" end="01:18:17.900" style="s2">you stick together that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.780" end="01:18:21.100" style="s2">a mature contribution the rancor has so</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.900" end="01:18:24.020" style="s2">the belong or is the person that is</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.100" end="01:18:26.510" style="s2">experiencing well I I feel like no no I</p>
<p begin="01:18:24.020" end="01:18:31.330" style="s2">feel like we should stay on this and</p>
<p begin="01:18:26.510" end="01:18:32.690" style="s2">their way of processing becomes an asset</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.330" end="01:18:34.670" style="s2">but then</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.690" end="01:18:36.410" style="s2">clutching like when they first start you</p>
<p begin="01:18:34.670" end="01:18:39.199" style="s2">have all these belonging needs if</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.410" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">they&#39;re released of those those</p>
<p begin="01:18:39.199" end="01:18:44.090" style="s2">contractions</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:46.699" style="s2">hmm so that there&#39;s an erotic form of</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.090" end="01:18:47.120" style="s2">that and an enlightened firm of that so</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.699" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">to speak</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.120" end="01:18:55.940" style="s2">exactly right there&#39;s a gift inside the</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.199" end="01:18:58.430" style="s2">just started typology yeah yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.940" end="01:19:03.830" style="s2">that&#39;s what another thing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:18:58.430" end="01:19:10.250" style="s2">thinking about is is I&#39;ve mentioned Zach</p>
<p begin="01:19:03.830" end="01:19:13.940" style="s2">about 20 times in this interview of so I</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.250" end="01:19:17.800" style="s2">can&#39;t stop he&#39;s been saying and we talk</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.940" end="01:19:17.800" style="s2">he talked about his high level dyslexia</p>
<p begin="01:19:18.489" end="01:19:23.390" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s a personality who you</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.410" end="01:19:25.850" style="s2">can you read the paragraph before you</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.390" end="01:19:28.370" style="s2">read read the sentence or you read the</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.850" end="01:19:31.760" style="s2">word so you go from top down instead of</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.370" end="01:19:33.710" style="s2">bottom up yeah that kind of and I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.760" end="01:19:36.680" style="s2">I&#39;m exactly I mean I&#39;m not exactly the</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.710" end="01:19:39.050" style="s2">same that this Zach because I&#39;m I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.680" end="01:19:41.180" style="s2">high I&#39;m not so gifted and a dyslexic</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.050" end="01:19:44.120" style="s2">but I know that I function in that way</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.180" end="01:19:48.050" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s made it very difficult for</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.120" end="01:19:52.010" style="s2">me in some areas especially school where</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.050" end="01:19:54.680" style="s2">as I kind of excel in other areas and so</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.010" end="01:19:57.739" style="s2">in terms of our discussion about about</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.680" end="01:19:59.630" style="s2">education and how to fit in these people</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.739" end="01:20:01.910" style="s2">that maybe don&#39;t fit in the the ordinary</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.630" end="01:20:05.780" style="s2">technologies or for a bit sort of yeah</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.910" end="01:20:07.100" style="s2">they&#39;re lost in in in in the functioning</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.780" end="01:20:09.530" style="s2">kind of kind of world and I&#39;ve known a</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.100" end="01:20:12.680" style="s2">lot of people like that in my life I</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.530" end="01:20:16.489" style="s2">tend to enjoy people who are a bit odd</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.680" end="01:20:19.040" style="s2">or stranger or you know yeah wacky minds</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.489" end="01:20:22.010" style="s2">are just different kinds of minds yes so</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.040" end="01:20:24.020" style="s2">in my educational philosophy I talked</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.010" end="01:20:28.699" style="s2">about the switch from complex adaptive</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.020" end="01:20:31.460" style="s2">systems you know so like the Darwinian</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.699" end="01:20:35.030" style="s2">model of Education is dyslexics have to</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.460" end="01:20:38.030" style="s2">adapt to the reading program right</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.030" end="01:20:40.510" style="s2">versus complex potential systems all of</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.030" end="01:20:42.949" style="s2">a sudden well what&#39;s what&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.510" end="01:20:44.989" style="s2">potential from here this this is a</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.949" end="01:20:45.910" style="s2">different inner mind perhaps a whole new</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.989" end="01:20:48.520" style="s2">mind what</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.910" end="01:20:52.760" style="s2">is the potential of this but I&#39;m facing</p>
<p begin="01:20:48.520" end="01:20:55.489" style="s2">to educate is to bring forth</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.760" end="01:20:58.250" style="s2">they have the potentials that to notice</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.489" end="01:21:01.010" style="s2">identify detected amplify potentials</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.250" end="01:21:04.760" style="s2">that are in front of me not to force</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.010" end="01:21:08.180" style="s2">that emergent potential into a</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.760" end="01:21:12.170" style="s2">pre-designed or preordained adaptation</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.180" end="01:21:14.989" style="s2">plan yeah that&#39;s called you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.170" end="01:21:18.520" style="s2">curriculum or the devil and and in our</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.989" end="01:21:21.739" style="s2">standardized testing and all right</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.520" end="01:21:24.550" style="s2">thinking you know a third grader is</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.739" end="01:21:28.610" style="s2">going to move from here to here because</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.550" end="01:21:31.250" style="s2">what we&#39;re noticing in like early</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.610" end="01:21:33.920" style="s2">childhood research psychological</p>

<p begin="01:21:33.920" end="01:21:41.390" style="s2">is that there are metacognitive</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.140" end="01:21:43.730" style="s2">abilities that come online early in</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.390" end="01:21:45.410" style="s2">childhood and so if we assume these</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.730" end="01:21:48.230" style="s2">things are only going to come online</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.410" end="01:21:51.310" style="s2">when someone&#39;s 18 19 or 20 then we miss</p>

<p begin="01:22:40.670" end="01:22:46.360" style="s2">know you&#39;re looking at impulse and</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.830" end="01:22:49.820" style="s2">instinct and desire these are the</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.360" end="01:22:51.680" style="s2">fundamental protocols for civilization</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.820" end="01:22:55.100" style="s2">right there in your faces yeah we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.680" end="01:22:57.080" style="s2">gonna drug them yeah yeah and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.100" end="01:23:00.290" style="s2">all there aren&#39;t they all of these as</p>
<p begin="01:22:57.080" end="01:23:02.540" style="s2">you say protocols for civilization the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.290" end="01:23:05.330" style="s2">whole all the typology all the different</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.540" end="01:23:06.530" style="s2">types are just sitting there you know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.330" end="01:23:09.639" style="s2">need to be used and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.530" end="01:23:12.980" style="s2">corralling them into this very narrow</p>
<p begin="01:23:09.639" end="01:23:15.920" style="s2">perspective his white head said you know</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.980" end="01:23:18.770" style="s2">we have to move from this notion of</p>
<p begin="01:23:15.920" end="01:23:23.119" style="s2">constraint in control to see the world</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.770" end="01:23:30.619" style="s2">is screaming with affordances I mean</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.119" end="01:23:33.679" style="s2">literally screaming the I think mindset</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.619" end="01:23:36.199" style="s2">that gets us beyond the sense making a</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.679" end="01:23:40.849" style="s2">meeting making crisis and into being</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.199" end="01:23:42.650" style="s2">able to literally see the potentials are</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.849" end="01:23:47.230" style="s2">staring us in the face but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.650" end="01:23:49.280" style="s2">categorized as problems or deviants</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.230" end="01:23:50.420" style="s2">that&#39;s just funny because when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.280" end="01:23:53.480" style="s2">talking to you compared to my</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.420" end="01:23:55.940" style="s2">conversation with Zack Zack Zack very</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.480" end="01:23:58.820" style="s2">weren&#39;t very deep into you know this</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.940" end="01:24:01.400" style="s2">apocalyptic sort of feel to what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.820" end="01:24:04.610" style="s2">on right now and and you you have a very</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.400" end="01:24:06.440" style="s2">you know you have a way of making one</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.610" end="01:24:08.840" style="s2">feel very hopeful about the world in a</p>
<p begin="01:24:06.440" end="01:24:11.559" style="s2">sense right if we can if we could sort</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.840" end="01:24:13.940" style="s2">of see all of this you know chaos as</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.559" end="01:24:18.349" style="s2">potential as abundance rather than</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.940" end="01:24:20.090" style="s2">scarcity and and work with that of</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.349" end="01:24:23.329" style="s2">course we&#39;re in trouble in a lot of ways</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.090" end="01:24:28.130" style="s2">as well we can&#39;t deny that / well you</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.329" end="01:24:31.429" style="s2">know actually one of the things that and</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.130" end="01:24:34.909" style="s2">I both are warning of I haven&#39;t said it</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.429" end="01:24:38.949" style="s2">so dire but if you don&#39;t take the</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.909" end="01:24:43.250" style="s2">problems with society seriously then</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.949" end="01:24:45.559" style="s2">you&#39;re just being snookered right you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.250" end="01:24:48.770" style="s2">say oh here&#39;s a new potential but it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.559" end="01:24:51.920" style="s2">be the same structure just in more</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.770" end="01:24:55.340" style="s2">disguise you know to be the same problem</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.920" end="01:24:58.070" style="s2">under cover right so we have to come to</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.340" end="01:25:00.559" style="s2">terms with the fact and so the way I</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.070" end="01:25:03.440" style="s2">describe that is by saying no you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.559" end="01:25:06.320" style="s2">to exit this paradigm you have to get</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.440" end="01:25:10.250" style="s2">outside of me if you try to think of</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.320" end="01:25:12.710" style="s2">complex systems outside of adaptation we</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.250" end="01:25:16.670" style="s2">have to adapt try to tell all your</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.710" end="01:25:17.869" style="s2">stories without using that subtle mental</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.670" end="01:25:18.940" style="s2">model that you have to adapt to</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.869" end="01:25:22.450" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.940" end="01:25:25.990" style="s2">mm-hmm it&#39;s almost impossible mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.450" end="01:25:28.060" style="s2">yeah you can&#39;t adapt to it because</p>
<p begin="01:25:25.990" end="01:25:30.550" style="s2">you&#39;re saying I don&#39;t want to use that</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.060" end="01:25:32.320" style="s2">paradigm that Darwinian paradigm so then</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.550" end="01:25:38.920" style="s2">what do I use to talk about conflict</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.320" end="01:25:41.020" style="s2">systems and yeah and also it may have</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.920" end="01:25:43.510" style="s2">been that that paradigm had its value in</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.020" end="01:25:48.850" style="s2">its time but it&#39;s but it just keeps</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.510" end="01:25:54.820" style="s2">going and becoming more of a monolithic</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.850" end="01:25:58.960" style="s2">kind of dead structure right all</p>
<p begin="01:25:54.820" end="01:26:11.440" style="s2">civilizations become you know their</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.960" end="01:26:12.510" style="s2">paradigms become deficient I didn&#39;t find</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.440" end="01:26:14.530" style="s2">sucks</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.510" end="01:26:18.760" style="s2">I&#39;m sorry we&#39;re talking about you is</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.530" end="01:26:23.110" style="s2">that I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t find that</p>
<p begin="01:26:18.760" end="01:26:31.060" style="s2">interview disheartening oh no I found it</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.110" end="01:26:32.620" style="s2">very clarifying you know yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.060" end="01:26:37.840" style="s2">agree with you I know I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.620" end="01:26:40.180" style="s2">there well I I would say that he says</p>
<p begin="01:26:37.840" end="01:26:45.000" style="s2">that we have to look through the thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.180" end="01:26:48.010" style="s2">right which which isn&#39;t which is not</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.000" end="01:26:51.040" style="s2">saying that we&#39;re stuck or were blocked</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.010" end="01:26:52.600" style="s2">or we can look through the thing but</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.040" end="01:26:54.940" style="s2">he&#39;s saying that he buddy buddy but he</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.600" end="01:26:57.700" style="s2">he is he is also saying the world is</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.940" end="01:27:00.550" style="s2">burning so you know if you&#39;re here or</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.700" end="01:27:03.730" style="s2">you&#39;re in the middle of the fire so I</p>
<p begin="01:27:00.550" end="01:27:07.120" style="s2">think if you&#39;re the kind of person that</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.730" end="01:27:09.550" style="s2">wants to has it has a hunger for for</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.120" end="01:27:11.440" style="s2">truth and that that that kind of message</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.550" end="01:27:13.480" style="s2">just wakes you up and makes you feel</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.440" end="01:27:15.910" style="s2">more alive if you&#39;re a person who wants</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.480" end="01:27:20.500" style="s2">to retreat back into safety and comfort</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.910" end="01:27:22.360" style="s2">and habit then maybe that would see</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.500" end="01:27:25.120" style="s2">depressing or something like that you</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.360" end="01:27:27.690" style="s2">know to some people exactly I mean I</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.120" end="01:27:27.690" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.900" end="01:27:36.610" style="s2">what I will kind of say in terms of my</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.239" end="01:27:40.869" style="s2">own despair is you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.610" end="01:27:46.539" style="s2">see people changing I don&#39;t see masses</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.869" end="01:27:50.829" style="s2">of people changing I see hope potential</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.539" end="01:27:52.690" style="s2">and small initiatives and so when when</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.829" end="01:27:55.769" style="s2">when Zack talks about his hub and spoke</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.690" end="01:28:00.190" style="s2">network of education I think these are</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.769" end="01:28:07.179" style="s2">smart designs for the possible</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.190" end="01:28:09.900" style="s2">transition I don&#39;t see I think the whole</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.179" end="01:28:12.820" style="s2">even the whole strategy to change</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.900" end="01:28:14.559" style="s2">massive well that&#39;s a what I would say</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.820" end="01:28:16.989" style="s2">why would you want to change everybody I</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.559" end="01:28:19.840" style="s2">mean that seems there&#39;s something wrong</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.989" end="01:28:21.630" style="s2">in it I was listening to one of your</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.840" end="01:28:25.090" style="s2">talks where you talking about how I</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.630" end="01:28:26.979" style="s2">think so it has to be a very a local</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.090" end="01:28:28.449" style="s2">everything has to be very local and</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.979" end="01:28:28.989" style="s2">that&#39;s really that&#39;s where you have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.449" end="01:28:32.429" style="s2">work with</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.989" end="01:28:32.429" style="s2">otherwise you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.519" end="01:28:41.530" style="s2">pretending you if you felt that you were</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.630" end="01:28:46.179" style="s2">participating adequately or learning</p>
<p begin="01:28:41.530" end="01:28:48.610" style="s2">then that would be okay maybe yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.179" end="01:28:53.349" style="s2">mean I think it at least you have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.610" end="01:28:55.979" style="s2">have Theory practice consistency so if</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.349" end="01:28:59.380" style="s2">you so and this I think where is that</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.979" end="01:29:00.880" style="s2">really shines because he&#39;s like social</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.380" end="01:29:04.659" style="s2">media we all know it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.880" end="01:29:06.820" style="s2">problematic oh yeah so he gets out we go</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.659" end="01:29:09.150" style="s2">ahead social media saying how its</p>
<p begin="01:29:06.820" end="01:29:13.659" style="s2">problematic so there&#39;s a very practice</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.150" end="01:29:14.289" style="s2">inconsistency there now that tension can</p>
<p begin="01:29:13.659" end="01:29:15.940" style="s2">go either way</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.289" end="01:29:19.300" style="s2">maybe we say well it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.940" end="01:29:23.679" style="s2">problematic as I thought or yes it is</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.300" end="01:29:25.599" style="s2">but at a certain point the you know you</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.679" end="01:29:29.139" style="s2">have to have to strive for more</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.599" end="01:29:31.510" style="s2">coherence between the theory what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.139" end="01:29:32.739" style="s2">espousing and the choices that you make</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.510" end="01:29:36.039" style="s2">and everything has to start with a</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.739" end="01:29:38.709" style="s2">choice mm-hmm and I think that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.039" end="01:29:40.150" style="s2">linchpin I think I think it&#39;d be easy to</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.709" end="01:29:44.260" style="s2">get people</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.150" end="01:29:47.530" style="s2">to conceptualize change even if it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:29:44.260" end="01:29:50.320" style="s2">very high metacognitive terms that seems</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.530" end="01:29:54.040" style="s2">easier to me than for them to take a</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.320" end="01:29:55.780" style="s2">first real step and and the first real</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.040" end="01:29:57.090" style="s2">step you would describe as coherence</p>
<p begin="01:29:55.780" end="01:30:01.090" style="s2">what do you mean by that</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.090" end="01:30:07.210" style="s2">no I think the first real step is for</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.090" end="01:30:09.699" style="s2">example well that&#39;s maybe the goal</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.210" end="01:30:11.800" style="s2">coherence excuse me maybe maybe yes the</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.699" end="01:30:14.110" style="s2">goal more of a goal and the first step</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.800" end="01:30:16.860" style="s2">would be directing yourself towards that</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.110" end="01:30:19.929" style="s2">or or or taking concrete actions and</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.860" end="01:30:26.739" style="s2">going in that direction yeah it&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.929" end="01:30:28.210" style="s2">of like a really hard time with that</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.739" end="01:30:31.630" style="s2">word I get maybe it&#39;s just the way it</p>
<p begin="01:30:28.210" end="01:30:34.179" style="s2">looks I are geneticists yeah so if you</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.630" end="01:30:38.050" style="s2">truly believe that if you truly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.179" end="01:30:40.350" style="s2">think the medical institution is helpful</p>
<p begin="01:30:38.050" end="01:30:43.659" style="s2">that the medicine is making you sick</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.350" end="01:30:46.150" style="s2">then don&#39;t watch it don&#39;t participate in</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.659" end="01:30:48.400" style="s2">the medical system you know I have a</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.150" end="01:30:49.900" style="s2">long background and Qigong in self care</p>

<p begin="01:32:09.260" end="01:32:13.030" style="s2">of discourse today is that you can&#39;t</p>
