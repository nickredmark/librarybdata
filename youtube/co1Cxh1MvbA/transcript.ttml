<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:11.580" style="s2">is kind of in twined with how I came to</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.340" end="00:02:14.349" style="s2">be here you know we were founded by some</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.580" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">graduate students in 1979 so we turned</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.349" end="00:02:19.030" style="s2">40 last year and they you know the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:21.069" style="s2">waning years the Carter Administration</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.030" end="00:02:22.150" style="s2">they thought that the conservative</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.069" end="00:02:24.580" style="s2">movement knew it it was against</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.150" end="00:02:25.780" style="s2">communism abroad maybe unlimited</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.580" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">government at home but didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.780" end="00:02:31.569" style="s2">know how it ought to think about its own</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:34.390" style="s2">history its own principles and and what</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.569" end="00:02:36.430" style="s2">it should be for so that was the project</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.390" end="00:02:38.019" style="s2">they were all students of this great</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.430" end="00:02:40.629" style="s2">Lincoln scholar and scholar of America</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.019" end="00:02:44.230" style="s2">named Harry Jaffa who passed away just</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.629" end="00:02:45.850" style="s2">four or five years ago and I came out</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.230" end="00:02:47.530" style="s2">for graduate school I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.850" end="00:02:49.450" style="s2">gone to Hillsdale College for undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.530" end="00:02:50.710" style="s2">and the president of Hillsdale was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.450" end="00:02:53.590" style="s2">former president the Claremont Institute</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.710" end="00:02:55.630" style="s2">Larry Arne so that I sort of knew about</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.590" end="00:02:57.580" style="s2">the place did one of our summer</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.630" end="00:03:00.070" style="s2">fellowships the Claremont Institute&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.580" end="00:03:01.660" style="s2">that is and then I took a year off after</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.070" end="00:03:03.580" style="s2">college and then came out for graduate</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.660" end="00:03:06.100" style="s2">school started working part-time and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.580" end="00:03:08.650" style="s2">then before I knew it you know graduate</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.100" end="00:03:10.240" style="s2">coursework was up and I was working full</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.650" end="00:03:12.670" style="s2">time eventually running and most of our</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.240" end="00:03:14.350" style="s2">programs spent four years as chief</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.670" end="00:03:17.890" style="s2">operating officer and then took over in</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.350" end="00:03:21.010" style="s2">September of seventeen so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.890" end="00:03:22.780" style="s2">sort of my my history and it it speaks</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.010" end="00:03:24.700" style="s2">really to the Claremont Institute&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.780" end="00:03:26.680" style="s2">history which is we&#39;ve always had a foot</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.700" end="00:03:28.960" style="s2">in academia or the academic world and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.680" end="00:03:30.970" style="s2">foot in the political world we always</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.960" end="00:03:32.620" style="s2">thought that you know the battle of</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.970" end="00:03:34.690" style="s2">policy day-to-day is important but</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.620" end="00:03:36.580" style="s2">really the battle of ideas upstream from</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.690" end="00:03:39.070" style="s2">that battle so we wanted to play in that</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.580" end="00:03:41.410" style="s2">space so really what we do more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.070" end="00:03:44.170" style="s2">anything else is we do a lot of teaching</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.410" end="00:03:46.150" style="s2">especially in the summer for people from</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.170" end="00:03:48.370" style="s2">beginning of career and policy in and</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.150" end="00:03:51.970" style="s2">national intellectual life or political</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.370" end="00:03:53.980" style="s2">life all the way up to mid-career and</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.970" end="00:03:56.380" style="s2">then we have a fellowship for lawyers we</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.980" end="00:03:58.570" style="s2">have one a new one for speech writers we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.380" end="00:04:00.910" style="s2">publish a quarterly review of books and</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.570" end="00:04:02.770" style="s2">then you mentioned at the outset one of</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.910" end="00:04:05.710" style="s2">our newer products is an online</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.770" end="00:04:07.990" style="s2">publication called the American mind and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.710" end="00:04:10.420" style="s2">we do podcasts and conferences and all</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.990" end="00:04:12.850" style="s2">the rest sort of think-tank stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.420" end="00:04:14.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve never really we&#39;ve never really</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.850" end="00:04:16.630" style="s2">done this sort of normal white paper</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.500" end="00:04:18.220" style="s2">policy work although we comment on</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.630" end="00:04:20.560" style="s2">politics and policies we&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.220" end="00:04:23.080" style="s2">interested in the battle of ideas part</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.560" end="00:04:25.780" style="s2">of you know conservatism broadly</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.080" end="00:04:27.370" style="s2">speaking and and then going forward who</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.780" end="00:04:29.560" style="s2">knows what I think conservatism is</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.370" end="00:04:31.510" style="s2">probably a diminishing diminishing asset</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.560" end="00:04:34.930" style="s2">rhetorically so we&#39;re all trying to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.510" end="00:04:36.820" style="s2">figure out what comes next so would you</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:38.980" style="s2">say yes to think-tank or know you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.820" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">a think-tank or something sort of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.980" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">yeah I mean at certain point labels are</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:44.890" style="s2">pretty descriptive because everyone</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:46.960" style="s2">knows what they are so we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.890" end="00:04:48.940" style="s2">think-tank we just do a little less of</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.960" end="00:04:50.440" style="s2">direct policy work then then your</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.940" end="00:04:53.380" style="s2">standard you know Washington think tank</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.440" end="00:04:55.780" style="s2">and we&#39;re way out here in California so</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.380" end="00:04:58.710" style="s2">it&#39;s always kept us I think to our</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.780" end="00:05:02.300" style="s2">benefit out outside the DC</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.710" end="00:05:04.830" style="s2">chamber right right and in reference to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.300" end="00:05:06.840" style="s2">Clermont and the folks that have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.830" end="00:05:08.669" style="s2">part of the Clermont Network I often</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.840" end="00:05:10.590" style="s2">hear this phrase drowsy and applied to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.669" end="00:05:13.919" style="s2">them can you explain what that means</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.590" end="00:05:18.300" style="s2">sure broadly speaking it&#39;s it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.919" end="00:05:19.979" style="s2">looking at political philosophy or the</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.300" end="00:05:22.259" style="s2">history of ideas and how they influence</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.979" end="00:05:25.050" style="s2">politics Straus really more than anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.259" end="00:05:27.150" style="s2">else at the in the 20th century revived</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.050" end="00:05:29.759" style="s2">the serious study of old books whether</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.150" end="00:05:32.070" style="s2">it&#39;s Aristotle or Plato or Hegel or</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:33.690" style="s2">Nietzsche you know he&#39;d like to he would</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.070" end="00:05:35.520" style="s2">say and his students would say they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.690" end="00:05:36.900" style="s2">really like in their political</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.520" end="00:05:39.210" style="s2">philosophy laughable realm they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.900" end="00:05:40.650" style="s2">probably twenty great thinkers we should</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.210" end="00:05:42.479" style="s2">study them and we should study them in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.650" end="00:05:43.740" style="s2">way that we think they still have</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.479" end="00:05:45.900" style="s2">something to teach us rather than</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.740" end="00:05:48.030" style="s2">looking at them as sort of historical</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.900" end="00:05:48.810" style="s2">curiosities so taking them seriously on</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.030" end="00:05:51.660" style="s2">their own terms</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.810" end="00:05:54.330" style="s2">that was sort of out of out of fashion</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.660" end="00:05:58.440" style="s2">in the 20th century when Strauss took up</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.330" end="00:06:01.710" style="s2">that project and historians and</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.440" end="00:06:04.050" style="s2">political philosophy students and those</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.710" end="00:06:05.460" style="s2">types political thinkers thought yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.050" end="00:06:07.289" style="s2">you know Aristotle is interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.460" end="00:06:09.750" style="s2">because he had this influence in his</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.289" end="00:06:12.419" style="s2">time and he&#39;s time bound but to take him</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.750" end="00:06:14.120" style="s2">seriously as offering any wins wisdom or</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.419" end="00:06:16.470" style="s2">insight into politics now would be crazy</p>

<p begin="00:06:16.470" end="00:06:19.530" style="s2">presumption you should first try to</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.240" end="00:06:21.510" style="s2">understand them as they understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.530" end="00:06:23.760" style="s2">themselves before you think that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.510" end="00:06:25.320" style="s2">better than them you may come to that</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.760" end="00:06:26.699" style="s2">judgment eventually but first you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.320" end="00:06:28.169" style="s2">take them on their own terms is there a</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.699" end="00:06:30.860" style="s2">difference between a westcoast Strauss</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.169" end="00:06:34.349" style="s2">enn in East Coast Strauss iam yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.860" end="00:06:37.530" style="s2">the categories are too facile of course</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.349" end="00:06:41.580" style="s2">or to you pay with a broad brush but</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.530" end="00:06:43.800" style="s2">roughly speaking the East Coast I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.580" end="00:06:45.539" style="s2">say is a little less political thinks</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.800" end="00:06:47.909" style="s2">thinks that the American political</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.539" end="00:06:50.550" style="s2">project is as fine as far as it goes but</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.909" end="00:06:53.070" style="s2">you know kind of a materialistic thing</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.550" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">not that high not that noble that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.070" end="00:06:58.650" style="s2">it lets them do what they want to do in</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:01.259" style="s2">terms of you know seeking the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.650" end="00:07:02.729" style="s2">philosophizing and and again I should</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.259" end="00:07:04.349" style="s2">have a disclaimer they don&#39;t all think</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.729" end="00:07:06.240" style="s2">this way it&#39;s just a sort of broad broad</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.349" end="00:07:08.340" style="s2">brushstroke and then the West Coast is</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.240" end="00:07:10.139" style="s2">really I mentioned Harry Jaffa at the</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.340" end="00:07:12.060" style="s2">beginning it&#39;s really he and his</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.139" end="00:07:14.760" style="s2">students are West Coast drowsiness</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.060" end="00:07:16.020" style="s2">followers and fellow travelers which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.760" end="00:07:18.780" style="s2">to say a little more comfortable with</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.020" end="00:07:20.040" style="s2">the scrum of American politics had a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.780" end="00:07:22.860" style="s2">little higher opinion of the American</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.040" end="00:07:25.320" style="s2">political project I&#39;m selling it short a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.860" end="00:07:27.630" style="s2">little bit a much higher opinion you</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.320" end="00:07:29.790" style="s2">know it was sure we were we were liberal</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.630" end="00:07:32.610" style="s2">small-l liberal in the political</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.790" end="00:07:34.050" style="s2">philosophical sense but there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.610" end="00:07:37.170" style="s2">sort of moral architecture of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.050" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">founding the the concern with happiness</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.170" end="00:07:41.850" style="s2">and virtue and nobility is there as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:43.620" style="s2">it&#39;s just the rhetoric and the</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.850" end="00:07:45.750" style="s2">principles in their application is</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.620" end="00:07:48.360" style="s2">updated for a world very different than</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.750" end="00:07:50.250" style="s2">the ancient world yes it&#39;s a interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.360" end="00:07:53.300" style="s2">to me to think that studying ancient</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.250" end="00:07:55.500" style="s2">philosophers would be out of vogue I</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.300" end="00:07:57.210" style="s2">guess I didn&#39;t really realize that</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.500" end="00:07:59.610" style="s2">because as far as I&#39;ve been paying</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.210" end="00:08:01.680" style="s2">attention to politics and philosophy you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.610" end="00:08:03.270" style="s2">can&#39;t you can&#39;t walk to tweets without</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.680" end="00:08:05.550" style="s2">hearing somebody reference Nietzsche or</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.270" end="00:08:07.320" style="s2">Aristotle at this point in time yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.550" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">I think to a large extent that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.320" end="00:08:12.750" style="s2">Stratis legacy not just him but but he</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">was probably the biggest player in in</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.750" end="00:08:16.920" style="s2">the serious revival of that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:18.990" style="s2">study well would you say the general</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.920" end="00:08:21.180" style="s2">goal of the Claremont Institute is or</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.990" end="00:08:24.840" style="s2">let&#39;s how about two parts what was the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.180" end="00:08:27.420" style="s2">goal and has it changed over time our</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.840" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">mission you know has been to to quote</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.420" end="00:08:32.160" style="s2">verbatim just forgive me listeners to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:33.690" style="s2">restore the principles of the American</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.160" end="00:08:35.750" style="s2">Founding to their rightful and</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.690" end="00:08:40.080" style="s2">preeminent place in our national life</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.750" end="00:08:42.180" style="s2">that&#39;s still our project but restoring</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.080" end="00:08:45.300" style="s2">principles is a very different thing</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.180" end="00:08:47.900" style="s2">from you know offering an unchanging</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.300" end="00:08:50.250" style="s2">suite of policy prescriptions or being</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.900" end="00:08:52.260" style="s2">unsensible to the changing needs of</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.250" end="00:08:53.900" style="s2">politics and American cultural and</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.260" end="00:08:57.090" style="s2">political life so I would say our</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.900" end="00:08:59.070" style="s2">adaptation is how do you revive those</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.090" end="00:09:01.380" style="s2">principles or how do you apply them you</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.070" end="00:09:03.030" style="s2">never go back in politics of course in</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.380" end="00:09:05.730" style="s2">any real sense we&#39;re not going to return</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.030" end="00:09:08.010" style="s2">to the 18th century or to that cultural</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.730" end="00:09:10.530" style="s2">and political landscape but I think we</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.010" end="00:09:13.560" style="s2">think the principles are true and so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.530" end="00:09:15.660" style="s2">have to figure out a way to reapply them</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.560" end="00:09:16.920" style="s2">because if we don&#39;t this experiment</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.660" end="00:09:20.040" style="s2">self-government is going to turn into</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.920" end="00:09:22.500" style="s2">something else and if it if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.040" end="00:09:24.310" style="s2">already well down that road yeah do you</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.500" end="00:09:26.240" style="s2">guys do</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.310" end="00:09:28.850" style="s2">you come out and support a specific</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.240" end="00:09:30.290" style="s2">candidates no I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.850" end="00:09:33.440" style="s2">non-profit so we don&#39;t endorse</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.290" end="00:09:35.750" style="s2">candidates or or legislation we</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.440" end="00:09:38.420" style="s2">certainly comment on on policies and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.750" end="00:09:40.700" style="s2">candidates but we&#39;re not in this you</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.420" end="00:09:42.650" style="s2">know PAC or C for business at all so we</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.700" end="00:09:45.710" style="s2">we don&#39;t get directly involved in</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.650" end="00:09:47.090" style="s2">campaigns or policy work well to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.710" end="00:09:49.520" style="s2">extent that you can talk about it before</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.090" end="00:09:51.200" style="s2">the in the early days of the 2016</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.520" end="00:09:55.130" style="s2">Republican primary did you guys have a</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.200" end="00:09:57.800" style="s2">general favorite by early days yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.130" end="00:10:00.980" style="s2">think the earliest indication of our</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.800" end="00:10:03.530" style="s2">general disposition was I think in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.980" end="00:10:07.880" style="s2">spring of 16 my colleague Bill Buckley</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.530" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">wrote a piece for the magazine I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.880" end="00:10:12.080" style="s2">for the online online portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:15.170" style="s2">Clemmie review books this was before the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.080" end="00:10:18.110" style="s2">American line was up where he said I why</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.170" end="00:10:21.020" style="s2">I&#39;m anti anti Trump and he was kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.110" end="00:10:22.730" style="s2">riffing off an old I think he had in</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.020" end="00:10:26.060" style="s2">mind you know Buckley way back in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.730" end="00:10:28.280" style="s2">day wrote wrote a kind of defensive Joe</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.060" end="00:10:30.290" style="s2">McCarthy and and I think back then I</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.280" end="00:10:32.900" style="s2">think Buckley was kind of anti anti</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.290" end="00:10:34.610" style="s2">McCarthy I think bill took that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.900" end="00:10:37.190" style="s2">inspiration a bit but he sort of laid</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.610" end="00:10:38.690" style="s2">out the case for look I mean we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.190" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">quite sure what to make of Donald Trump</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.690" end="00:10:43.520" style="s2">but the hysteria on the what was then</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:46.400" style="s2">the early never Trump right and the left</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.520" end="00:10:48.800" style="s2">about this guy is totally misplaced and</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.400" end="00:10:51.110" style="s2">sort of out of control we ought to take</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.800" end="00:10:53.210" style="s2">a more sober view of of him in the run</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.110" end="00:10:55.070" style="s2">of American political history and we</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.210" end="00:10:57.350" style="s2">should you know we should have a little</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.070" end="00:10:59.930" style="s2">sobriety about the whole thing and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.350" end="00:11:03.170" style="s2">the a lot of that I guess culminated in</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.930" end="00:11:04.400" style="s2">the piece you you want to talk about I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.170" end="00:11:06.440" style="s2">know which everyone wants to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.400" end="00:11:09.730" style="s2">which was Mike Anton&#39;s piece in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.440" end="00:11:12.050" style="s2">September called the flight 93 election</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.730" end="00:11:14.120" style="s2">yeah so talk about that a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.050" end="00:11:15.710" style="s2">would you because that that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.120" end="00:11:18.530" style="s2">an important piece and people are still</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.710" end="00:11:20.840" style="s2">referencing it today yeah well Mike had</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.530" end="00:11:22.580" style="s2">read vogue Li&#39;s piece I&#39;m good friends</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.840" end="00:11:26.660" style="s2">with Mike known him for over a decade</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.580" end="00:11:28.460" style="s2">now and you know Microsoft reassessing</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.660" end="00:11:32.200" style="s2">the field he was a little more open to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.460" end="00:11:35.210" style="s2">Trump there was this sort of um this</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.200" end="00:11:37.220" style="s2">group of us who had been in and around</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.210" end="00:11:39.319" style="s2">the Claremont Institute for four</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.220" end="00:11:40.970" style="s2">the better part of its history who are</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.319" end="00:11:42.319" style="s2">sort of trading emails privately about</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.970" end="00:11:45.170" style="s2">how we ought to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.319" end="00:11:46.970" style="s2">Republican primary field and how we</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.170" end="00:11:48.980" style="s2">ought to think about Trump and the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.970" end="00:11:52.939" style="s2">possibilities of a kind of populist</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.980" end="00:11:54.769" style="s2">outsider and so that that kind of all</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.939" end="00:11:57.050" style="s2">came to a head Mike Mike stole this</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.769" end="00:11:59.420" style="s2">public&#39;s this story publicly so I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.050" end="00:12:02.240" style="s2">speaking out of turn but he originally</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.420" end="00:12:04.100" style="s2">sent us a piece called I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.240" end="00:12:07.009" style="s2">called towards a more responsible and</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.100" end="00:12:08.329" style="s2">coherent trumpism then ultimately my</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.009" end="00:12:10.220" style="s2">colleague Charles Kesler some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.329" end="00:12:12.769" style="s2">other editors decide it wasn&#39;t quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.220" end="00:12:15.889" style="s2">ready or didn&#39;t quite fit with with our</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.769" end="00:12:18.019" style="s2">editorial project and that was probably</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.889" end="00:12:20.329" style="s2">three three four months before flight 93</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.019" end="00:12:22.759" style="s2">and then Mike wrote five ninety three</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.329" end="00:12:24.649" style="s2">and we decided you know either we&#39;d come</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.759" end="00:12:25.879" style="s2">closer to him or we&#39;d met somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.649" end="00:12:28.310" style="s2">the middle but we decided it was</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.879" end="00:12:30.019" style="s2">definitely worth publishing and the rest</p>

<p begin="00:14:09.350" end="00:14:13.519" style="s2">polemical piece so he was being a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.819" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">hyperbolic but yeah his you know his</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.519" end="00:14:17.060" style="s2">histrionics proved to be pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:19.939" style="s2">prescient actually with the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.060" end="00:14:22.339" style="s2">insane reaction to Trump from the left</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.939" end="00:14:25.040" style="s2">and you know I like to joke with some</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.339" end="00:14:26.629" style="s2">friends that and colleagues that one of</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.040" end="00:14:29.420" style="s2">trumps great virtues is he&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:14:29.420" end="00:14:33.589" style="s2">masks down on the modern left or at</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.370" end="00:14:36.500" style="s2">least the leading edge of of modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.589" end="00:14:38.750" style="s2">leftism and shows that you know Anton&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:14:38.750" end="00:14:44.089" style="s2">consistent rule by this group we could</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.329" end="00:14:46.399" style="s2">put up with I think that was he was</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.089" end="00:14:49.550" style="s2">right and not not hysterical or</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.399" end="00:14:51.470" style="s2">overblown no and I think not to cut you</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.550" end="00:14:53.149" style="s2">off there but I think that the way that</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.470" end="00:14:55.850" style="s2">the Democratic primary is going right</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.149" end="00:14:58.310" style="s2">now only shows that he was even more</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.850" end="00:15:00.560" style="s2">accurate today than even before like</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.310" end="00:15:02.899" style="s2">very predictive of the future and for me</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.560" end="00:15:05.660" style="s2">in my book and Democrats are deplorable</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.899" end="00:15:07.790" style="s2">I really analyzed a lot of these same a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.660" end="00:15:10.310" style="s2">lot of these same trends and I came to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.790" end="00:15:12.860" style="s2">the conclusion that there was a stopping</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.310" end="00:15:15.350" style="s2">the Democrats a stopping Hillary was was</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.860" end="00:15:18.259" style="s2">like primary function number one what</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.350" end="00:15:20.269" style="s2">and and Trump represented an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.259" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">bomb to toss into the whole system and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.269" end="00:15:25.220" style="s2">at least if anything disrupt the flow</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:29.420" style="s2">and the nonstop March that would have</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.220" end="00:15:31.370" style="s2">only been more brazen had had Hillary we</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:32.930" style="s2">had Hillary won and I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.370" end="00:15:35.360" style="s2">interesting to see now how the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.930" end="00:15:37.069" style="s2">Democratic primary is revealing the fact</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.360" end="00:15:39.380" style="s2">that they&#39;ve all continued to just you</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.069" end="00:15:41.029" style="s2">know skew left as hard as they can every</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.380" end="00:15:42.829" style="s2">single one of them on stage talking</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.029" end="00:15:45.589" style="s2">about free health care for illegal</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.829" end="00:15:47.809" style="s2">immigrants and Bernie Sanders going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.589" end="00:15:50.059" style="s2">about how America&#39;s racist country from</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.809" end="00:15:52.370" style="s2">top to bottom and you know Elizabeth</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.059" end="00:15:53.779" style="s2">Warren saying racism is horrible in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.370" end="00:15:56.750" style="s2">United States and getting worse every</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.779" end="00:15:59.000" style="s2">single day and all of these things fit</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.750" end="00:16:01.730" style="s2">under this umbrella term that I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.000" end="00:16:04.639" style="s2">you guys use in your new pieces</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.730" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">called multiculturalism and you wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.639" end="00:16:11.089" style="s2">very eloquent piece so did your chair as</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:13.339" style="s2">well and I wanted to sort of dig into</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.089" end="00:16:15.949" style="s2">that a little bit um could you just</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.339" end="00:16:20.060" style="s2">explain what you guys mean by</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.949" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">multiculturalism now and how is that</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.060" end="00:16:24.769" style="s2">piece that you wrote is it reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:26.990" style="s2">sort of your central central goals and</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.769" end="00:16:28.459" style="s2">motivation and sort of umbrella for the</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.990" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">work that you&#39;re doing moving forward</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.459" end="00:16:34.910" style="s2">like how pertinent is it to the mission</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:36.860" style="s2">for you yeah I think it&#39;s um you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.910" end="00:16:39.170" style="s2">like I said where we&#39;re trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.860" end="00:16:41.180" style="s2">out how we apply the principles of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.170" end="00:16:43.670" style="s2">founding these days and we think the</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.180" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">central threat in a way is this new but</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.670" end="00:16:47.480" style="s2">new evolution of the left probably</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:49.399" style="s2">starts in the 60s although it has roots</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.480" end="00:16:51.410" style="s2">going back farther and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.399" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">multiculturalism as an ideology and how</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.410" end="00:16:55.370" style="s2">most people are a lot of people that the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:56.899" style="s2">terms not perfect we like it because</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.370" end="00:16:59.690" style="s2">it&#39;s comprehensive and suggests an</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.899" end="00:17:01.010" style="s2">ideology but it&#39;s confusing to some I</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.690" end="00:17:03.769" style="s2">mean when a lot of people think</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.010" end="00:17:05.959" style="s2">multicultural they think what are you</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.769" end="00:17:08.209" style="s2">against you know immigrants a good food</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.959" end="00:17:10.790" style="s2">and and cultural diversity that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.209" end="00:17:12.890" style="s2">crazy you guys are you&#39;re nuts but when</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.790" end="00:17:15.439" style="s2">we mean it as an ideology we really mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.890" end="00:17:17.860" style="s2">it wrapped up with this new identity</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.439" end="00:17:21.230" style="s2">politics and political correctness</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.860" end="00:17:23.750" style="s2">sort of suite of approaches to politics</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.230" end="00:17:25.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s the latest evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.750" end="00:17:27.589" style="s2">modern progressivism which we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.640" end="00:17:28.880" style="s2">arguing against for well it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.589" end="00:17:30.679" style="s2">around for a century but we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.880" end="00:17:33.830" style="s2">arguing against it since at least the</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.679" end="00:17:36.890" style="s2">early 90s and it&#39;s sort of the newest</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.830" end="00:17:39.320" style="s2">and most virulent form of that so it</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.890" end="00:17:41.360" style="s2">takes all of the all the apparatus of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.320" end="00:17:43.880" style="s2">progressivism the modern administrative</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.360" end="00:17:45.679" style="s2">state that tends to rule by expert in</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.880" end="00:17:48.140" style="s2">judges beyond the reach of politics and</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.679" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">it marries it to this insane obsession</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.140" end="00:17:53.360" style="s2">with identity based on race gender</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:55.660" style="s2">sexual orientation and really seeks to</p>

<p begin="00:17:55.660" end="00:18:00.650" style="s2">rather than providing any sort of common</p>

<p begin="00:18:05.830" end="00:18:11.120" style="s2">really is a threat to the success and</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.630" end="00:19:31.220" style="s2">really to say the broader point is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.790" end="00:19:33.650" style="s2">this is a question about the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.220" end="00:19:36.800" style="s2">things we think about our politics the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.650" end="00:19:39.080" style="s2">human nature what it means for what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.800" end="00:19:41.390" style="s2">do in politics what it means for how</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.080" end="00:19:43.130" style="s2">political coalition&#39;s should work how</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.390" end="00:19:46.100" style="s2">they should look what it means for</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.130" end="00:19:48.440" style="s2">citizenship and voting so it&#39;s it&#39;s sort</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.100" end="00:19:50.720" style="s2">of a in the old political science sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.440" end="00:19:53.990" style="s2">a regime question you know we disagree</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.720" end="00:19:56.630" style="s2">we&#39;ve written a bit about us being now</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.990" end="00:20:00.140" style="s2">in a cold civil war and I think what we</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.630" end="00:20:02.900" style="s2">mean by that is not all I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.140" end="00:20:06.860" style="s2">the broad swath of middle America or</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.900" end="00:20:08.810" style="s2">just normal Americans sort don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.860" end="00:20:10.250" style="s2">about politics thank God every day in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.810" end="00:20:11.960" style="s2">day out they&#39;re not doing this for a</p>

<p begin="00:20:11.960" end="00:20:17.210" style="s2">ways so now I don&#39;t mean to paint a too</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.470" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">broader brush with to normal citizenry</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.210" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">you kind of have a notion of this kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:22.820" style="s2">of thing but I&#39;m not quite sure how to</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:24.920" style="s2">think about it but really the elites</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.820" end="00:20:27.380" style="s2">driving our political conflict there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.920" end="00:20:28.400" style="s2">just this huge divide that goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.380" end="00:20:31.370" style="s2">core of human</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.400" end="00:20:33.200" style="s2">and justice and that&#39;s what we meet so</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.370" end="00:20:34.010" style="s2">that Lincoln talked about a house</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.200" end="00:20:36.200" style="s2">divided</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.010" end="00:20:38.660" style="s2">during the slavery crisis and he talked</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.200" end="00:20:40.430" style="s2">about look one sized side thinks slavery</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.660" end="00:20:42.140" style="s2">is right and should be extended the</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.430" end="00:20:45.640" style="s2">other side thinks it&#39;s wrong and should</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.140" end="00:20:48.590" style="s2">be you know at the time he said not</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.640" end="00:20:50.960" style="s2">squelched permanently but really pared</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.590" end="00:20:53.090" style="s2">back slowed down and put on the course</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.960" end="00:20:55.790" style="s2">of ultimate extinction so that&#39;s what he</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.090" end="00:20:57.260" style="s2">meant by this sort of regime crisis and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.790" end="00:20:59.750" style="s2">I think where a house divided on</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.260" end="00:21:02.000" style="s2">questions of justice just as we were in</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.750" end="00:21:03.500" style="s2">the 1850s although it&#39;s different of</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.000" end="00:21:06.290" style="s2">course we&#39;re not fighting over enslaving</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.500" end="00:21:09.140" style="s2">a good portion of our citizenry no</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.290" end="00:21:11.150" style="s2">you&#39;re not but at the same time you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.140" end="00:21:13.070" style="s2">if you read your Kurt Vonnegut you can</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.150" end="00:21:15.080" style="s2">see how this stuff carries out into the</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.070" end="00:21:18.410" style="s2">future and I wrote a book that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.080" end="00:21:20.690" style="s2">the redistribution of oppression and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.410" end="00:21:23.210" style="s2">you know basically this new regime this</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.690" end="00:21:26.300" style="s2">new ideology is devouring liberty and</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.210" end="00:21:28.940" style="s2">redistributing oppression and you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.300" end="00:21:30.800" style="s2">in your essay you lay out an argument</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.940" end="00:21:32.480" style="s2">that I would like to learn more about</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.800" end="00:21:34.280" style="s2">and I would like more people to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.480" end="00:21:36.440" style="s2">on it is that really what we&#39;re facing</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.280" end="00:21:39.080" style="s2">are two competing versions of justice</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.440" end="00:21:40.520" style="s2">and that is not something that can be</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.080" end="00:21:42.410" style="s2">maintained for a long time could you</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.520" end="00:21:45.820" style="s2">explain can you explain that a little</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.410" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">bit please yeah yeah I mean the old</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.820" end="00:21:50.660" style="s2">imperfect and implementation of course</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:53.120" style="s2">as the post slavery controversy shows</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.660" end="00:21:55.730" style="s2">maybe more than anything else but the</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.120" end="00:21:59.240" style="s2">old the old way of American justice was</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.730" end="00:22:01.580" style="s2">to view it at in its ideal as the equal</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.240" end="00:22:03.530" style="s2">protection of equal rights so or we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.580" end="00:22:05.450" style="s2">all not gods and we&#39;re all not beasts we</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.530" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">at least know that about humanity and</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.450" end="00:22:09.800" style="s2">that means that we shouldn&#39;t rule each</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.340" end="00:22:11.690" style="s2">other without our consent and that means</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.800" end="00:22:13.730" style="s2">we should protect and governments should</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.690" end="00:22:17.090" style="s2">protect the equal rights that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.730" end="00:22:18.890" style="s2">under the law that&#39;s that&#39;s the ideal of</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.090" end="00:22:21.830" style="s2">American justice at a certain baseline</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.890" end="00:22:23.270" style="s2">and I think underlying that as a view of</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.830" end="00:22:24.470" style="s2">human nature you know we can know what</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.270" end="00:22:27.260" style="s2">humans are we can know the difference</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.470" end="00:22:30.560" style="s2">between beasts or gods however you</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.260" end="00:22:33.080" style="s2">conceive of gods and we can sort of know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.560" end="00:22:35.480" style="s2">that we have this equality at that basic</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.080" end="00:22:37.430" style="s2">level as Lincoln said not equal and</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.480" end="00:22:40.220" style="s2">talents not equal in virtue not equal in</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.430" end="00:22:41.330" style="s2">intelligence but equal and being equally</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.220" end="00:22:42.710" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.330" end="00:22:44.270" style="s2">that means certain things for government</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.710" end="00:22:45.530" style="s2">it means among other things a limited</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.270" end="00:22:48.470" style="s2">government because unlimited government</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.530" end="00:22:49.670" style="s2">ultimately it will abused rights doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.470" end="00:22:52.520" style="s2">mean small government I should say</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.670" end="00:22:54.530" style="s2">especially these days but and then the</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.520" end="00:22:56.030" style="s2">other view is the view of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.530" end="00:23:00.770" style="s2">multiculturalists or the identity</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.030" end="00:23:02.660" style="s2">politics left is that no really we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.770" end="00:23:05.030" style="s2">not really the most fundamental thing</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.660" end="00:23:07.610" style="s2">about us is not our individual equality</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.030" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">of rights in fact it&#39;s differences</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.610" end="00:23:11.930" style="s2">amongst groups its histories of</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:14.420" style="s2">oppression as you said and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.930" end="00:23:17.000" style="s2">taking the former oppressor group and</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.420" end="00:23:20.180" style="s2">taking it down a couple notches rhe</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.000" end="00:23:22.250" style="s2">distributing goods services honors and</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.180" end="00:23:25.460" style="s2">prestige to the formerly oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.250" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">groups and as we see from the attack of</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.460" end="00:23:29.950" style="s2">modern liberalism even in the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:34.580" style="s2">years that that intersexual</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.950" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">intersectional basket is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.580" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">changing you know that the my colleague</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:41.090" style="s2">bill vocally I don&#39;t know if he did this</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:43.340" style="s2">in print or not but he talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.090" end="00:23:45.080" style="s2">the oppression Olympics you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.340" end="00:23:46.820" style="s2">kind of yeah it&#39;s hard to know who&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.080" end="00:23:48.230" style="s2">top and who&#39;s on the bottom and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.820" end="00:23:50.510" style="s2">hard to know who ought to decide those</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.230" end="00:23:52.400" style="s2">things but that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of this</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.510" end="00:23:54.110" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s devouring the left-right</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.400" end="00:23:56.570" style="s2">our the thing they&#39;re trying to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.110" end="00:23:59.030" style="s2">in the primary and elsewhere is how do</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.570" end="00:24:01.420" style="s2">we decide on what basis do we decide</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.030" end="00:24:04.490" style="s2">who&#39;s the most oppressed and is the most</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.420" end="00:24:05.690" style="s2">are the biggest oppressor I think the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.490" end="00:24:08.510" style="s2">left kind of agrees that the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.690" end="00:24:12.320" style="s2">oppressor are so grisly male yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.510" end="00:24:14.630" style="s2">and I so that that&#39;s the only thing they</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.320" end="00:24:15.320" style="s2">can agree on I think the rest of it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.630" end="00:24:17.750" style="s2">up for grabs</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.320" end="00:24:19.790" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s interesting what&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.750" end="00:24:23.540" style="s2">fascinating about your experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.790" end="00:24:25.010" style="s2">mine as I see it is that I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.540" end="00:24:26.570" style="s2">background in political science or even</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.010" end="00:24:28.730" style="s2">in philosophy I was a philosophy major</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.570" end="00:24:30.440" style="s2">for like a half a year at a university</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.730" end="00:24:31.880" style="s2">and then I read Marx and I was like</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.440" end="00:24:33.050" style="s2">economic sounds important let me learn</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.880" end="00:24:35.420" style="s2">about that so I got a degree in</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.050" end="00:24:37.340" style="s2">economics but I didn&#39;t I got into all</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.420" end="00:24:39.350" style="s2">this stuff you know ten years ago after</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.340" end="00:24:41.240" style="s2">my divorce starting to learn about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.350" end="00:24:45.350" style="s2">dating markets and the mating markets</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.240" end="00:24:49.179" style="s2">and and marriage and then feminism and</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.350" end="00:24:51.070" style="s2">then intersectionality so like I started</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.179" end="00:24:53.109" style="s2">in the trenches just trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.070" end="00:24:55.869" style="s2">out how to rebuild my life after my my</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.109" end="00:24:58.330" style="s2">divorce and as I kept pulling on the</p>

<p begin="00:25:27.399" end="00:25:32.379" style="s2">path all the way to sort of the same</p>

<p begin="00:25:40.869" end="00:25:46.059" style="s2">the same conclusion which is that this</p>

<p begin="00:25:55.599" end="00:26:01.479" style="s2">and for the longest time for me it felt</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.450" end="00:26:03.700" style="s2">like I was a crazy person talking about</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.479" end="00:26:05.559" style="s2">talking about war on men and more on</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.700" end="00:26:07.539" style="s2">masculinity because at the heart of all</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.559" end="00:26:09.549" style="s2">of this stuff is an attack on</p>

<p begin="00:26:19.389" end="00:26:21.999" style="s2">like the root of it and we need to</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.679" end="00:26:24.729" style="s2">attack it and that&#39;s what&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.999" end="00:26:26.529" style="s2">happening and I guess I was I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.729" end="00:26:28.719" style="s2">thinking I was a crazy person until the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.529" end="00:26:31.589" style="s2">APA came out last year with their</p>

<p begin="00:26:37.299" end="00:26:41.609" style="s2">basically and then hearing the language</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.369" end="00:26:43.989" style="s2">of radical feminism rang out in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.609" end="00:26:46.509" style="s2">judiciary hearings the confirmation</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.989" end="00:26:49.059" style="s2">hearings for Kavanagh so that&#39;s when I</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.509" end="00:26:50.769" style="s2">was like okay this is all not just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.059" end="00:26:52.779" style="s2">fevered dream that I&#39;m having and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:26:52.779" end="00:26:55.979" style="s2">everywhere and it&#39;s infiltrated our</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.629" end="00:27:03.020" style="s2">etc so I&#39;m fascinated by the work that</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.229" end="00:27:06.200" style="s2">you guys are doing</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.020" end="00:27:08.330" style="s2">because it&#39;s like just this collision</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.200" end="00:27:10.070" style="s2">and Confirmation I think that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.330" end="00:27:13.150" style="s2">sort of on the same path and we see</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.070" end="00:27:16.510" style="s2">things the same way now I doubt that</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.150" end="00:27:20.390" style="s2">everybody around you and your think-tank</p>

<p begin="00:27:34.670" end="00:27:38.540" style="s2">existential threat and something that</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.650" end="00:27:43.090" style="s2">needs to be a highlight and a focus for</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.540" end="00:27:46.370" style="s2">us yeah well the one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.090" end="00:27:48.500" style="s2">that piece that you mentioned defeat</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.370" end="00:27:51.860" style="s2">multi cultures and defend America or the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.500" end="00:27:53.060" style="s2">other way around I forget you know you</p>

<p begin="00:27:53.060" end="00:28:00.920" style="s2">when you wait I got that but I think the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.250" end="00:28:02.870" style="s2">most a couple of interesting responses</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.920" end="00:28:07.820" style="s2">one from Peter Meyers a friend and</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.870" end="00:28:11.300" style="s2">academic was you know he he said he he</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.820" end="00:28:12.520" style="s2">didn&#39;t want he basically said this is</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.300" end="00:28:15.890" style="s2">different than the civil rights struggle</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.520" end="00:28:17.210" style="s2">that&#39;s that was a noble thing so we</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.890" end="00:28:18.950" style="s2">ought to be careful about how we talk</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.210" end="00:28:20.390" style="s2">about this but the more the more</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.950" end="00:28:22.370" style="s2">pointing critique was from Peter</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.390" end="00:28:25.820" style="s2">Berkowitz who is involved with Hoover</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.370" end="00:28:27.230" style="s2">and actually is now I think still at the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.820" end="00:28:29.270" style="s2">State Department head of policy planning</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.230" end="00:28:31.160" style="s2">he replaced Chiron Skinner another</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.270" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">Hoover colleague of his but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.160" end="00:28:34.730" style="s2">neither here nor there but he&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:37.250" style="s2">interesting guy and an academic by</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.730" end="00:28:39.050" style="s2">training but he wanted to say look it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.250" end="00:28:40.610" style="s2">not a regime multiculturalism is not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.050" end="00:28:43.430" style="s2">regime it&#39;s not a way of life it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.610" end="00:28:45.890" style="s2">as comprehensive as you say if we&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.430" end="00:28:49.220" style="s2">we&#39;re not clear in our categories then</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.890" end="00:28:51.590" style="s2">we&#39;re miss diagnosing the problem but I</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.220" end="00:28:54.020" style="s2">would say in the rank-and-file of our</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.590" end="00:28:57.050" style="s2">donors and our friends and our political</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.020" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">actors especially amongst the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.050" end="00:29:02.060" style="s2">more Trumpy crowd or pro-trump folks it</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:04.160" style="s2">all makes perfect sense to them they may</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.060" end="00:29:05.720" style="s2">especially when you say what I mean by</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.160" end="00:29:09.500" style="s2">multiculturalism is identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.720" end="00:29:13.490" style="s2">they they all agree that this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.500" end="00:29:16.060" style="s2">a weaponized form of divide and conquer</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.490" end="00:29:17.740" style="s2">that really can&#39;t end well any</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.060" end="00:29:19.960" style="s2">if you see polling on identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.740" end="00:29:23.080" style="s2">nationwide nobody really likes it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.960" end="00:29:25.420" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of 6040 against to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.080" end="00:29:27.040" style="s2">that people know what it is so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.420" end="00:29:29.470" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of you know political and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.040" end="00:29:31.840" style="s2">rhetorical hey to be made by raising</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.470" end="00:29:35.980" style="s2">this question in that way that&#39;s partly</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.840" end="00:29:38.620" style="s2">why we raised it but you know more</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.980" end="00:29:41.710" style="s2">importantly I think it&#39;s it was for us</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.620" end="00:29:44.050" style="s2">the the latest evolution of this central</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.710" end="00:29:46.150" style="s2">project of progressivism to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.050" end="00:29:49.150" style="s2">undermine Americanism and</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.150" end="00:29:51.940" style="s2">constitutionalism at its root so we</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.150" end="00:29:54.160" style="s2">understand it in that sort of that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.940" end="00:29:55.870" style="s2">evolved century of liberalism has the</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.160" end="00:29:59.920" style="s2">latest instantiation of it and in many</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.870" end="00:30:02.350" style="s2">ways the most troubling version of it I</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.920" end="00:30:05.560" style="s2">mean it&#39;s you max you mentioned Marx it</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.350" end="00:30:08.410" style="s2">is a kind of it&#39;s a little too clean but</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.560" end="00:30:10.140" style="s2">it is a kind of cultural Marxism so we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.410" end="00:30:12.370" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be surprised that the EM the</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.140" end="00:30:14.940" style="s2">economic justice left you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.370" end="00:30:18.130" style="s2">the burning of old has now become the</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.940" end="00:30:19.780" style="s2">identity politics warrior of Bernie 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.130" end="00:30:22.810" style="s2">you know he&#39;s easily transitioned from</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.780" end="00:30:25.030" style="s2">from the old Marxism to the new cultural</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.810" end="00:30:26.410" style="s2">Marxism yeah and that you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.030" end="00:30:28.870" style="s2">gonna be very interesting to see how</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.410" end="00:30:32.590" style="s2">that plays out in 2020 if he is indeed</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.870" end="00:30:34.600" style="s2">the nominee I think that in 2016 there</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.590" end="00:30:37.150" style="s2">were a number of Bernie supporters who</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.600" end="00:30:40.050" style="s2">in fact I wanna called a number of them</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.150" end="00:30:42.940" style="s2">indefinitely in my book who were burned</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.050" end="00:30:45.370" style="s2">through the primary process including</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.940" end="00:30:47.530" style="s2">one woman who was a Bernie delegate in</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.370" end="00:30:49.240" style="s2">Nevada went through the caucuses there</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.530" end="00:30:52.000" style="s2">saw how Hillary basically stole that</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.240" end="00:30:54.700" style="s2">from him then went to Philadelphia so I</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.000" end="00:30:56.860" style="s2">saw how they treated them there and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.700" end="00:30:59.680" style="s2">just quit the Democratic Party voted for</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.860" end="00:31:02.830" style="s2">Trump but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.680" end="00:31:05.080" style="s2">back to Bernie in 2020 if he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.830" end="00:31:06.490" style="s2">nominee partly because she&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.080" end="00:31:09.220" style="s2">gone through the fire and seen a light</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.490" end="00:31:10.990" style="s2">secondly because you know he&#39;s just he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.220" end="00:31:13.150" style="s2">so vastly different now with this you</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.990" end="00:31:15.130" style="s2">know rate a racist nation from top to</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.150" end="00:31:16.870" style="s2">bottom I just was floored when I heard</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.130" end="00:31:19.150" style="s2">him say that in the last or a couple</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.870" end="00:31:20.800" style="s2">debates ago I hope that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.150" end="00:31:22.870" style="s2">people never let him forget because if</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.980" end="00:31:48.230" style="s2">you really explain to them how it is</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.850" end="00:31:52.100" style="s2">permeating every element of our society</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.390" end="00:35:14.080" style="s2">the founding meant that these were</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.560" end="00:35:15.490" style="s2">rights that we ought we all had a duty</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.490" end="00:35:19.300" style="s2">and the government had to right to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.470" end="00:35:21.100" style="s2">protect for us they were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.300" end="00:35:24.760" style="s2">negative rights but when rights become</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.100" end="00:35:28.600" style="s2">these things that I&#39;m owed materially</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.760" end="00:35:32.350" style="s2">and as a matter of dignity it becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.600" end="00:35:33.940" style="s2">sort of a war of all against all of all</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.350" end="00:35:36.580" style="s2">identity groups against all identity</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.940" end="00:35:37.330" style="s2">groups and if you end up end up on top</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.580" end="00:35:39.280" style="s2">that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.330" end="00:35:41.290" style="s2">if you&#39;re on the bottom it&#39;s not as good</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.280" end="00:35:45.190" style="s2">yeah you know that&#39;s an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.290" end="00:35:48.250" style="s2">perspective because thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.190" end="00:35:50.970" style="s2">now if if the whole thing is basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.250" end="00:35:52.890" style="s2">about taking from one to give to another</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.970" end="00:35:54.540" style="s2">rather than provide like providing an</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.890" end="00:35:57.000" style="s2">environment that everybody has the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.540" end="00:35:59.940" style="s2">chances if it becomes taking from one</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.000" end="00:36:01.590" style="s2">and giving to another deep inside people</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.940" end="00:36:04.860" style="s2">have to understand that they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.590" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">like making a taking on people right and</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.860" end="00:36:09.450" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to be taking something</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:12.270" style="s2">from someone and or you know parallel</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.450" end="00:36:14.460" style="s2">this was like a war conflict it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.270" end="00:36:16.650" style="s2">you have to stop thinking of them as a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.460" end="00:36:18.360" style="s2">human right because if you thought of</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.650" end="00:36:20.400" style="s2">somebody as a human being with rights</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.360" end="00:36:22.350" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re just entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.400" end="00:36:23.880" style="s2">their liberty and all that you know you</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.350" end="00:36:25.350" style="s2">would be less inclined to just want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.880" end="00:36:27.600" style="s2">take something from them snaps thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.350" end="00:36:30.840" style="s2">from so there has to be some element of</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.600" end="00:36:33.000" style="s2">dehumanization and and sort of turning</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.840" end="00:36:36.210" style="s2">them into monsters which is I think part</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.000" end="00:36:38.790" style="s2">of why the straight white hetero guy is</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.210" end="00:36:41.730" style="s2">being so demeaned and degraded today</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.790" end="00:36:43.650" style="s2">because how how else can you justify to</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.730" end="00:36:45.930" style="s2">yourself taking something from someone</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.650" end="00:36:49.950" style="s2">if not if you don&#39;t think that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.930" end="00:36:51.840" style="s2">somehow undeserving or subhuman or you</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.950" end="00:36:54.420" style="s2">know some sort of you know manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.840" end="00:36:56.340" style="s2">of evil or something like that and you</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.420" end="00:36:57.810" style="s2">can see that in this just in the media</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.340" end="00:37:00.300" style="s2">and in the discourse and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.810" end="00:37:02.550" style="s2">language and then the anger and vitriol</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.300" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">and of course they deflect it by saying</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.550" end="00:37:07.830" style="s2">oh no no this is a structural thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.600" style="s2">not like individuals do it but come on I</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.830" end="00:37:11.210" style="s2">mean the whole structure is built up of</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.600" end="00:37:16.800" style="s2">individuals what are you talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.210" end="00:37:18.870" style="s2">no one who gets back to you know Madison</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.800" end="00:37:21.560" style="s2">and the Federalists says that the the</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.870" end="00:37:25.020" style="s2">first object of government is to protect</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.560" end="00:37:27.330" style="s2">the unequal faculties of folks because</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.020" end="00:37:30.600" style="s2">it will lead to unequal results</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.330" end="00:37:31.890" style="s2">I think the modern left and look we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.600" end="00:37:34.350" style="s2">we can bracket all this and say of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.890" end="00:37:37.080" style="s2">course at the time a huge portion of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.350" end="00:37:38.670" style="s2">population was enslaved so and at a</p>

<p begin="00:39:17.620" end="00:39:22.480" style="s2">about the Gulag as we know from James</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.980" end="00:39:31.660" style="s2">and gulags and death camps but you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.770" end="00:39:34.630" style="s2">the logic of this way of doing politics</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.660" end="00:39:38.140" style="s2">and and this denial of human difference</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.630" end="00:39:40.960" style="s2">and messiness is really frightening and</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.140" end="00:39:43.630" style="s2">and we&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been down this road</p>

<p begin="00:39:46.360" end="00:39:51.340" style="s2">yeah I think that that&#39;s interesting</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.640" end="00:39:53.320" style="s2">there&#39;s a parallel conversation going on</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.340" end="00:39:56.260" style="s2">in biology and psychology right now</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.320" end="00:39:59.260" style="s2">about did biological differences between</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.260" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">men and women and and large populations</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.260" end="00:40:04.210" style="s2">and such and and how the the data and</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:08.590" style="s2">the science seems to keep marching</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.210" end="00:40:10.570" style="s2">steadily towards you know empirical hard</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.590" end="00:40:12.130" style="s2">evidence that there&#39;s differences</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.570" end="00:40:14.080" style="s2">between men and women in large</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.130" end="00:40:15.920" style="s2">populations and whatever and maybe maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.080" end="00:40:18.710" style="s2">they&#39;re generally the same but there are</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.920" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">certainly group differences and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.710" end="00:40:23.330" style="s2">a huge push back against acknowledging</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">that right and this is this is where you</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.330" end="00:40:28.370" style="s2">know the denial of science and reason</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:30.410" style="s2">gets alarming for me and that&#39;s why some</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.370" end="00:40:32.360" style="s2">of these issues of radical feminism and</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.410" end="00:40:35.420" style="s2">the transgender issue and so it&#39;s become</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.360" end="00:40:38.990" style="s2">such flashpoints because they really</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.420" end="00:40:42.020" style="s2">emphasize and highlight how modern left</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.990" end="00:40:45.650" style="s2">is just just tossing science into the</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.020" end="00:40:47.210" style="s2">trashcan in order to keep advancing the</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.650" end="00:40:48.980" style="s2">goals that they have which is to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.210" end="00:40:51.650" style="s2">know basically make it slit everybody</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.980" end="00:40:53.420" style="s2">everywhere is the same in all ways at</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.650" end="00:40:56.360" style="s2">all times with the same outcomes and the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.420" end="00:40:58.700" style="s2">same successes and so this battle the</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.360" end="00:41:00.680" style="s2">struggle is actually happening on a</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.700" end="00:41:03.260" style="s2">number of different levels across the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.680" end="00:41:05.570" style="s2">country various layers whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.260" end="00:41:08.990" style="s2">academia or in politics or whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.570" end="00:41:11.810" style="s2">in science and it does seem to me that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.990" end="00:41:14.690" style="s2">there is a growing resistance to this to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.810" end="00:41:17.480" style="s2">these ideas and I do see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.690" end="00:41:19.490" style="s2">like a new coalescing I mean we see that</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.480" end="00:41:20.690" style="s2">there&#39;s a new parties sort of emerging</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.490" end="00:41:23.630" style="s2">both Republican Party and the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.690" end="00:41:26.180" style="s2">Party very different and one of the ways</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.630" end="00:41:28.790" style="s2">that I&#39;ve seen that people one of the</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.180" end="00:41:31.100" style="s2">common traits to divide these two groups</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.790" end="00:41:33.950" style="s2">now would be sort of the blank slate</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.100" end="00:41:36.890" style="s2">errs versus people that believe in some</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.950" end="00:41:39.320" style="s2">elements of biological determinism now</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.890" end="00:41:41.060" style="s2">if you are believe in determinism it</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.320" end="00:41:43.400" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean you believe in superiority</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.060" end="00:41:44.780" style="s2">you just believe in admitting and</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.400" end="00:41:46.280" style="s2">acknowledging that there are differences</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.780" end="00:41:49.190" style="s2">in difference and preferences and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.280" end="00:41:51.470" style="s2">desires and risk tolerances and such and</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.190" end="00:41:52.940" style="s2">if you&#39;re a blank slate asti&#39;s more than</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.470" end="00:41:56.450" style="s2">the same and it&#39;s just society does it</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.940" end="00:41:58.700" style="s2">to you oh and so I&#39;m seeing a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.450" end="00:42:00.560" style="s2">joining I guess that&#39;s why the evopsych</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.700" end="00:42:03.230" style="s2">guys are popular with the red pill</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.560" end="00:42:05.210" style="s2">community and it&#39;s more reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.230" end="00:42:06.830" style="s2">politics and such and and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.210" end="00:42:09.860" style="s2">make for someone savory bedfellows at</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.830" end="00:42:12.440" style="s2">times but are you seeing are you seeing</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.860" end="00:42:15.430" style="s2">sort of a a growing push back do you see</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.440" end="00:42:17.240" style="s2">the group that that I can identify</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.430" end="00:42:18.830" style="s2">multiculturalism identity politics</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.240" end="00:42:22.670" style="s2">intersectionality as a problem is</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.830" end="00:42:24.650" style="s2">growing or are we still on the fringes</p>

<p begin="00:42:24.650" end="00:42:28.640" style="s2">on that what&#39;s happening and where are</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.420" end="00:42:32.069" style="s2">we going and who&#39;s on the team</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.640" end="00:42:35.309" style="s2">well I think no I think it is growing</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.069" end="00:42:38.299" style="s2">you know helped helped immeasurably by</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.309" end="00:42:40.710" style="s2">the what seems to be the galloping</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.299" end="00:42:41.940" style="s2">radicalization of the left you know</p>

<p begin="00:42:45.000" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">got to be honest at basically all of the</p>

<p begin="00:43:01.530" end="00:43:05.369" style="s2">right you know this this new way of</p>

<p begin="00:44:26.819" end="00:44:31.559" style="s2">doing better than ever materially why</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.859" end="00:44:34.170" style="s2">are you all so freaked out whereas I</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.559" end="00:44:35.520" style="s2">think you and I and many others</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.170" end="00:44:37.589" style="s2">increasing numbers both at the</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.520" end="00:44:39.660" style="s2">grassroots level and at the elite level</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.589" end="00:44:40.030" style="s2">on the right are pretty alarmed at the</p>

<p begin="00:44:42.370" end="00:44:47.080" style="s2">modern left yeah I think I think it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.580" end="00:44:49.510" style="s2">true that it is growing and it&#39;s growing</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.080" end="00:44:51.190" style="s2">in various different sectors like I said</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.510" end="00:44:55.060" style="s2">before so it might be interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.190" end="00:44:57.070" style="s2">about how how we can unite you know just</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.060" end="00:44:59.410" style="s2">identify the various sort of industries</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.070" end="00:45:02.080" style="s2">and and and intellectual genres that are</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.410" end="00:45:04.900" style="s2">and encountering the issues presented by</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.080" end="00:45:08.710" style="s2">these these theories and then try to if</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.900" end="00:45:10.930" style="s2">we use like a common denominator of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.710" end="00:45:13.450" style="s2">discourse we can attract people from the</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.930" end="00:45:16.180" style="s2">various silos we want onto the same</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.450" end="00:45:18.310" style="s2">theme and it&#39;s it&#39;s something that just</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.180" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">came to mind while I was talking to you</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.310" end="00:45:23.020" style="s2">because really we need the evopsych and</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.150" style="s2">biologists guys to really get on get</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.020" end="00:45:27.610" style="s2">louder and get more voice in the matter</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.150" end="00:45:29.920" style="s2">because we need people to understand it</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.610" end="00:45:32.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a just a physical</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.920" end="00:45:33.790" style="s2">impossibility for everyone to end up</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.200" end="00:45:37.210" style="s2">with the same outcomes and so making</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.790" end="00:45:38.710" style="s2">that as a goal is a disaster and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.210" end="00:45:40.650" style="s2">know what I find I&#39;ve watched these guys</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.710" end="00:45:44.650" style="s2">like Eric and Brett Weinstein they</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.650" end="00:45:46.270" style="s2">having these public journeys they&#39;re red</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.650" end="00:45:47.800" style="s2">pilling like right in front of your very</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.270" end="00:45:49.240" style="s2">eyes but then they&#39;re just afraid to</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.800" end="00:45:51.730" style="s2">take the plunge at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.240" end="00:45:53.290" style="s2">because they still have some level of</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.730" end="00:45:56.260" style="s2">trumpet arrangement syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.290" end="00:45:58.840" style="s2">and I&#39;m just hoping that that guys like</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.260" end="00:46:00.790" style="s2">them and others will will continue to</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.840" end="00:46:02.860" style="s2">work do the intellectual work and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.790" end="00:46:04.660" style="s2">maybe work through the emotional baggage</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.860" end="00:46:07.240" style="s2">that comes along with this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.660" end="00:46:09.850" style="s2">supporting Trump the madman it was not</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.240" end="00:46:12.460" style="s2">really and be able to come out publicly</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.850" end="00:46:13.810" style="s2">on the other end it&#39;ll be interesting to</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.460" end="00:46:16.450" style="s2">see what they recommend for their</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.810" end="00:46:19.120" style="s2">audiences and stuff to do in the 2020</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.450" end="00:46:20.770" style="s2">election I&#39;m getting the sense of some</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.120" end="00:46:22.300" style="s2">people who are willing to sit it out and</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.770" end="00:46:24.730" style="s2">I said well you&#39;re free riding on me</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.300" end="00:46:26.200" style="s2">then cuz I&#39;m out here yeah you would my</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.730" end="00:46:28.870" style="s2">name and getting arrows in my back but</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.200" end="00:46:32.170" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna just sit it out and and and</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.870" end="00:46:34.810" style="s2">go with Trump anyway but it just brings</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.170" end="00:46:36.550" style="s2">me again to like a further idea here I</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.810" end="00:46:39.670" style="s2">wanted to talk to you about how you</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.550" end="00:46:41.320" style="s2">could harness the power of the Claremont</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.670" end="00:46:43.390" style="s2">Institute network in the American mind</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.320" end="00:46:46.030" style="s2">Network how are you doing that how are</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.390" end="00:46:47.710" style="s2">you expanding that and then after that</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.030" end="00:46:50.490" style="s2">I&#39;m going to follow up on with you on</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.710" end="00:46:54.280" style="s2">that on Bronze Age pervert okay</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.490" end="00:46:56.560" style="s2">sure yeah I think I just as a quick</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.280" end="00:47:00.250" style="s2">aside and I know you agree with this</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.560" end="00:47:01.930" style="s2">I think rhetorically you know while we</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.250" end="00:47:04.000" style="s2">talk about the emerging science of</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.930" end="00:47:05.760" style="s2">genetics and group differences and all</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.000" end="00:47:10.270" style="s2">this stuff we need to keep repeating</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.760" end="00:47:12.040" style="s2">that no matter the source of group</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.270" end="00:47:13.750" style="s2">differences and outcomes it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.040" end="00:47:16.240" style="s2">anything for the equal rights of equal</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.750" end="00:47:19.510" style="s2">citizens and the only way we can sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.240" end="00:47:21.760" style="s2">accept this new an increasing realm of</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.510" end="00:47:24.510" style="s2">science and what it tells us about human</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.760" end="00:47:27.280" style="s2">achievement and you know populations</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.510" end="00:47:28.810" style="s2">evolutionary history and all that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.280" end="00:47:31.240" style="s2">only way we can approach that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.810" end="00:47:33.520" style="s2">responsibly as Republican small our</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.240" end="00:47:37.320" style="s2">citizens is to also maintain at the same</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.520" end="00:47:40.450" style="s2">time look that your identity position</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.320" end="00:47:43.060" style="s2">has nothing to do with the equal</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.450" end="00:47:45.400" style="s2">protection of your rights so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.060" end="00:47:48.010" style="s2">modern left is rightfully even quite</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.400" end="00:47:49.600" style="s2">scared of that way of looking at group</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.010" end="00:47:52.390" style="s2">differences because if they can see at</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.600" end="00:47:54.640" style="s2">that point at all and if they marry the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.390" end="00:47:57.610" style="s2">the truth of that kind of stuff with</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.640" end="00:47:59.980" style="s2">their project they have to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.610" end="00:48:03.190" style="s2">that most of the their policy</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.980" end="00:48:05.260" style="s2">recommendations and their philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.190" end="00:48:07.870" style="s2">and scientific attempts to conquest</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.260" end="00:48:10.210" style="s2">conquer human nature are really futile</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.870" end="00:48:12.010" style="s2">and are going to wind up hurting more</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.210" end="00:48:13.630" style="s2">people than they help so that it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.010" end="00:48:15.580" style="s2">that&#39;s the psychology of it I think and</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.630" end="00:48:17.650" style="s2">you see it you&#39;ve seen it of course with</p>

<p begin="00:51:03.809" end="00:51:08.790" style="s2">down the country and we think that sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.420" end="00:51:10.500" style="s2">of urgency is sometimes lacking and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.790" end="00:51:12.119" style="s2">Washington DC today especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.500" end="00:51:14.910" style="s2">the think-tank world so we&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.119" end="00:51:16.930" style="s2">address that or fill that gap and work</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.910" end="00:51:18.160" style="s2">with you know there&#39;s tons of good Paul</p>

<p begin="00:51:20.410" end="00:51:24.730" style="s2">centered distribution center and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.119" end="00:51:27.520" style="s2">really sort of you know lab laboratory</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.730" end="00:51:29.859" style="s2">for figuring out how we ought to think</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.520" end="00:51:31.390" style="s2">together with lawmakers and political</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.859" end="00:51:33.809" style="s2">opinion leaders about how we get</p>

<p begin="00:51:33.809" end="00:51:38.260" style="s2">we&#39;re working on we&#39;re having fun I</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.550" end="00:51:40.839" style="s2">think that&#39;s a great idea and I would</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.260" end="00:51:43.540" style="s2">urge you to try to capture the network</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.839" end="00:51:45.609" style="s2">power of your Ohana and your fellows and</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.540" end="00:51:47.770" style="s2">and your contributors and try to engage</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.609" end="00:51:50.050" style="s2">them as most as best as possible as</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.770" end="00:51:51.550" style="s2">frequently as possible in a private</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.050" end="00:51:54.280" style="s2">community somehow get them all together</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.550" end="00:51:56.980" style="s2">email list chats forums like anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.280" end="00:51:58.599" style="s2">that you can do to to build that network</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.980" end="00:52:01.180" style="s2">and get people connected to each other</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.599" end="00:52:02.380" style="s2">and understand that as a network grows</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.180" end="00:52:04.809" style="s2">that the power doesn&#39;t just grow</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.380" end="00:52:07.059" style="s2">linearly it grows even better than that</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.809" end="00:52:08.920" style="s2">and it&#39;s important to continue working</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.059" end="00:52:10.420" style="s2">on those on the networks which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.920" end="00:52:12.130" style="s2">something that I&#39;m trying to do myself</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.420" end="00:52:15.220" style="s2">more on like a grass grassroots level</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.130" end="00:52:16.980" style="s2">like trying to recruit gentlemen for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.220" end="00:52:19.690" style="s2">limo order that have the same worldview</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.980" end="00:52:21.760" style="s2">but rather than trying to figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.690" end="00:52:23.589" style="s2">we&#39;re going to affect policy or Lobby or</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.760" end="00:52:25.660" style="s2">even take a firm political position</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.589" end="00:52:28.180" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to figure out how how does</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.660" end="00:52:30.640" style="s2">a citizen how does a male citizen in</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.180" end="00:52:32.410" style="s2">America you know fight back against</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.640" end="00:52:34.270" style="s2">these issues and what&#39;s the best course</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.410" end="00:52:35.530" style="s2">of action for us as individuals that</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.270" end="00:52:37.720" style="s2">would ultimately lead to positive</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.530" end="00:52:39.910" style="s2">outcomes for the nation yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.720" end="00:52:44.170" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s our effort on the on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.910" end="00:52:46.299" style="s2">ground and if if the last six months is</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.170" end="00:52:47.920" style="s2">anything of a predictive of the future</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.299" end="00:52:50.049" style="s2">the limo order is going to just continue</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.920" end="00:52:52.059" style="s2">to grow because the demand for it is</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.049" end="00:52:53.859" style="s2">just ridiculous and everything anybody</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.059" end="00:52:55.660" style="s2">learns about it they&#39;re very fascinated</p>

<p begin="00:53:03.640" end="00:53:07.990" style="s2">want to get involved because I think</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.220" end="00:53:10.210" style="s2">they feel as though that it&#39;s addressing</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.990" end="00:53:12.099" style="s2">an urgent urgently missing element in</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.210" end="00:53:13.900" style="s2">their life and they&#39;re all so tired of</p>

<p begin="01:04:27.640" end="01:04:31.029" style="s2">made a compelling case for why he wanted</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.319" end="01:04:33.430" style="s2">to learn what we taught and came</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.029" end="01:04:37.719" style="s2">recommended you know Jack was not does</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.430" end="01:04:40.299" style="s2">not have a non-controversial history of</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.719" end="01:04:42.249" style="s2">reporting and sort of media stuff he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.299" end="01:04:45.519" style="s2">part of this online community that that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.249" end="01:04:47.170" style="s2">you&#39;ve described and you know as you as</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.519" end="01:04:49.989" style="s2">you discussed with Jack made it made it</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.170" end="01:04:52.390" style="s2">transition from Game of Thrones persona</p>

<p begin="01:04:52.390" end="01:04:57.849" style="s2">to now a media career so we thought all</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.450" end="01:04:58.989" style="s2">that was very interesting we we knew</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.849" end="01:05:02.079" style="s2">that he was going to be a controversial</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.989" end="01:05:03.940" style="s2">pick but decided if we hadn&#39;t had the</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.079" end="01:05:05.859" style="s2">solid recommendation from a few friends</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.940" end="01:05:07.660" style="s2">we trusted we might have taken a pass</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.859" end="01:05:11.380" style="s2">just given given the controversy</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.660" end="01:05:14.739" style="s2">surrounding Jack&#39;s rise to fame and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.380" end="01:05:16.029" style="s2">infamy and media influence but of course</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.739" end="01:05:18.190" style="s2">what seems that the fellowship was as</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.029" end="01:05:20.109" style="s2">you know as you knew before I did he was</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.190" end="01:05:23.289" style="s2">nothing but a gentleman and respectful</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.109" end="01:05:25.269" style="s2">and and they engaged discussant in our</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.289" end="01:05:29.559" style="s2">seminar and and a family man and</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.269" end="01:05:30.849" style="s2">everything else people people have can</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.559" end="01:05:33.759" style="s2">get a pretty warped view of folks by</p>

<p begin="01:05:33.759" end="01:05:39.549" style="s2">to the very online equip from our friend</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.509" end="01:05:41.559" style="s2">yeah we got pushed back but mostly from</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.549" end="01:05:43.329" style="s2">the nevertrump crowd which was this is</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.559" end="01:05:47.729" style="s2">just the latest example of our unserious</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.329" end="01:05:51.489" style="s2">are selling out to the Trump Magadan and</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.729" end="01:05:54.369" style="s2">you know the the new media etc etcetera</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.489" end="01:05:56.019" style="s2">so in that sense we know what we were</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.369" end="01:05:58.390" style="s2">about we still were teaching the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.019" end="01:06:00.219" style="s2">old things we always taught trying to</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.390" end="01:06:01.839" style="s2">figure out how to how to navigate</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.219" end="01:06:04.359" style="s2">American politics in a principled way</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.839" end="01:06:06.339" style="s2">and teach that to people but taking I</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.359" end="01:06:08.440" style="s2">mean acknowledging the fact of the</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.339" end="01:06:11.199" style="s2">matter that this new media landscape has</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.440" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">to be engaged with the the people who</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.199" end="01:06:15.400" style="s2">are influential within it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:19.959" style="s2">need to be all of our fellows now but to</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.400" end="01:06:22.539" style="s2">to neglect this this growing cohort of</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.959" end="01:06:25.449" style="s2">people with huge influence many of them</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.539" end="01:06:28.150" style="s2">more influence than brian Stelter move</p>

<p begin="01:06:35.949" end="01:06:39.009" style="s2">them and to the extent that they come to</p>

<p begin="01:11:43.960" end="01:11:48.410" style="s2">and and I know we only have a few more</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.730" end="01:11:49.990" style="s2">minutes here and I wanted to wrap up</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.410" end="01:11:52.190" style="s2">with one last thing which would be</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.990" end="01:11:54.350" style="s2">lately it seems like you guys have been</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.190" end="01:11:56.030" style="s2">writing a lot about trumpism after Trump</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.350" end="01:11:58.520" style="s2">that&#39;s like subject that people are</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.030" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">discussing to what extent do you think</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.520" end="01:12:05.540" style="s2">that the ideas that he has written into</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:09.680" style="s2">the presidency and hopefully into a</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.540" end="01:12:11.360" style="s2">second presidency and some of the policy</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.680" end="01:12:13.220" style="s2">proposals or at least just even the</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.360" end="01:12:15.380" style="s2">concepts or the framework or just that</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.220" end="01:12:19.520" style="s2">even the mindset how much of that is</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.380" end="01:12:22.310" style="s2">going to persist after Trump&#39;s eventual</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.520" end="01:12:23.960" style="s2">end of his presidency whether it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.310" end="01:12:27.050" style="s2">year in four years yeah</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.960" end="01:12:29.930" style="s2">well the the most intangible part of him</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.050" end="01:12:32.720" style="s2">is his sense of the media landscape and</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.930" end="01:12:34.550" style="s2">his sort of showmanship that&#39;s a hard</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.720" end="01:12:35.960" style="s2">thing you can&#39;t really train that sort</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.550" end="01:12:36.440" style="s2">of thing you just kind of have it or you</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.960" end="01:12:38.630" style="s2">don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.440" end="01:12:42.710" style="s2">where you&#39;ve cultivated it from some</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.630" end="01:12:44.870" style="s2">some good base material so who knows</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.710" end="01:12:46.850" style="s2">that side of the national politician</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.870" end="01:12:49.190" style="s2">that is Trump or the national political</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.850" end="01:12:51.800" style="s2">phenomenon that is Trump pretty hard to</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.190" end="01:12:54.290" style="s2">replicate but I think the more important</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.800" end="01:12:59.570" style="s2">thing is you know look he&#39;s the first</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.290" end="01:13:01.850" style="s2">president since since HW Bush and really</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.570" end="01:13:04.850" style="s2">Reagan to win any of those Upper Midwest</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.850" end="01:13:08.300" style="s2">states I think there&#39;s a good chance he</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.850" end="01:13:11.330" style="s2">wins one more this year than me than he</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.300" end="01:13:13.730" style="s2">did in 16 you know he&#39;s kind of revived</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.330" end="01:13:16.190" style="s2">the prospects of a blue-collar</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.730" end="01:13:17.690" style="s2">conservatism and that&#39;s a little bit of</p>

<p begin="01:13:22.360" end="01:13:26.949" style="s2">a few times a few decades and how did he</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.940" end="01:13:31.810" style="s2">do that well he showed that a certain</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.949" end="01:13:34.030" style="s2">dexterity with a back you know suite of</p>

<p begin="01:13:39.640" end="01:13:42.910" style="s2">anything wrong with Reagan per se but</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.080" end="01:13:46.630" style="s2">his world was a lot different than ours</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.910" end="01:13:48.040" style="s2">it was now a long time ago we have</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.630" end="01:13:49.750" style="s2">different challenges today and I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.040" end="01:13:51.730" style="s2">you know and this ties us back to the</p>
