<p begin="00:05:49.430" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">is it&#39;s exhausting because you could</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.430" end="00:05:58.279" style="s2">cheek one person let&#39;s say peterson cuz</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:06:01.490" style="s2">you know it goes back to somebody like</p>

<p begin="00:06:05.659" end="00:06:11.539" style="s2">like the entire kind of leftist</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.569" end="00:06:15.710" style="s2">enterprise to debunk this man you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.539" end="00:06:19.569" style="s2">just kind of empowers him so you know as</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.710" end="00:06:21.949" style="s2">i kriti that and also people close to me</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.569" end="00:06:24.830" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s like whack-a-mole</p>

<p begin="00:06:26.479" end="00:06:32.110" style="s2">look like the bad guy and i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.750" end="00:06:34.669" style="s2">i&#39;m doing kind of intellectual triage</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.110" end="00:06:37.159" style="s2">you know i have to run around and like</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.669" end="00:06:40.969" style="s2">figure out who&#39;s the most hurt i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.159" end="00:06:42.770" style="s2">damaged and and try to try to fix it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.969" end="00:06:45.949" style="s2">I feel like the medic mediators are kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.770" end="00:06:47.779" style="s2">of coming to the scene like okay we know</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.949" end="00:06:49.190" style="s2">that everybody&#39;s hurt we&#39;re kind of kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.779" end="00:06:51.890" style="s2">of listen to</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.190" end="00:06:54.890" style="s2">everybody&#39;s pain all at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.890" end="00:06:57.890" style="s2">and you know try to try to work it out</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.890" end="00:07:05.350" style="s2">that way so there there&#39;s a basic</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.890" end="00:07:07.610" style="s2">tension there so let me let me just</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.350" end="00:07:10.490" style="s2">restart with what the title is who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.490" end="00:07:14.870" style="s2">simple answer is nobody I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.950" end="00:07:17.780" style="s2">anybody kind of being remotely</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.870" end="00:07:20.390" style="s2">self-critical enough or engaging and in</p>

<p begin="00:10:41.500" end="00:10:45.750" style="s2">simple questions on the face of it but</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.030" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">they&#39;re actually really complex</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:54.670" style="s2">throughout my critiques they&#39;re in</p>

<p begin="00:10:57.070" end="00:11:03.130" style="s2">of lecture mm-hmm and so above all that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.640" end="00:11:05.110" style="s2">though it&#39;s like why and how given all</p>

<p begin="00:13:47.920" end="00:13:55.360" style="s2">and large the the catalyst of Peterson&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.370" end="00:13:57.730" style="s2">fame is a lie and many things that keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.360" end="00:14:00.370" style="s2">him going are blatant lies or</p>

<p begin="00:14:00.370" end="00:14:03.699" style="s2">call them lies but what do you call it</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.990" end="00:14:07.179" style="s2">what do you call it when someone is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.699" end="00:14:10.389" style="s2">is wrong or being hyperbolic or just</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.179" end="00:14:12.939" style="s2">sorting the truth you know III think I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.389" end="00:14:15.759" style="s2">think it treads into lie territory and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.939" end="00:14:20.259" style="s2">you know what launch Peterson was his</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.759" end="00:14:20.949" style="s2">critique of Bill c16 you know from what</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.259" end="00:14:22.629" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.949" end="00:14:24.609" style="s2">Peterson&#39;s whole approach has been</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.629" end="00:14:26.199" style="s2">debunked you know he&#39;s not a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.609" end="00:14:30.429" style="s2">the trans community that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.199" end="00:14:33.309" style="s2">he&#39;s transphobic but it means like with</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.429" end="00:14:36.369" style="s2">these issues of racism that he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.309" end="00:14:42.220" style="s2">know how to advocate for the the justice</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.369" end="00:14:43.959" style="s2">for those communities and so so the meta</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.220" end="00:14:46.720" style="s2">point here is like well if I&#39;m correct</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.959" end="00:14:48.369" style="s2">about that and I think I happen and many</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.720" end="00:14:51.639" style="s2">other things Peterson&#39;s been wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.369" end="00:14:58.899" style="s2">like saying white privilege is a Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.639" end="00:15:02.919" style="s2">lie that is a reactionary lie hmm but</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.899" end="00:15:05.499" style="s2">that aside if I&#39;m right well why you</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.919" end="00:15:07.449" style="s2">know why is he still so popular not only</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.499" end="00:15:09.039" style="s2">with the average person but with all</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.449" end="00:15:11.019" style="s2">these so-called intellectuals why do</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.039" end="00:15:12.639" style="s2">they gravitate towards him why do they</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.019" end="00:15:14.769" style="s2">focus on the positive stuff and ignore</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.639" end="00:15:17.499" style="s2">the negative stuff and there&#39;s deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.769" end="00:15:20.739" style="s2">complicated uncomfortable answers to</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.499" end="00:15:23.439" style="s2">these questions and so this is why I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.739" end="00:15:25.329" style="s2">never gonna stop criticizing somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.439" end="00:15:28.359" style="s2">like Peterson because you know if he</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.329" end="00:15:32.470" style="s2">really believes in in logos and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.359" end="00:15:35.350" style="s2">uh you know man-to-man combat or</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.470" end="00:15:37.359" style="s2">whatever then then he you know he has to</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.350" end="00:15:41.019" style="s2">face his critics and you know going into</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.359" end="00:15:43.720" style="s2">a spectacle like facing jjak where he</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.019" end="00:15:45.639" style="s2">got like just embarrassed is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.720" end="00:15:49.259" style="s2">sufficient we feel like we still don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.639" end="00:15:50.559" style="s2">have kind of closure on all of that</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.259" end="00:15:55.600" style="s2">mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.559" end="00:15:57.669" style="s2">anyways moving on um you know in a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.600" end="00:15:58.989" style="s2">of these spaces I think you know going</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.669" end="00:16:00.759" style="s2">back to the intelligence thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.989" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of weaponized intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.759" end="00:16:06.789" style="s2">right like so I criticize some people</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:09.639" style="s2">for being you know not so bright or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.789" end="00:16:11.949" style="s2">so good faith but that&#39;s not completely</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.639" end="00:16:15.329" style="s2">fair because there&#39;s just a major</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.949" end="00:16:15.329" style="s2">distinction that&#39;s missing here</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.690" end="00:16:20.310" style="s2">I&#39;ll just read I&#39;m gonna read from this</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.060" end="00:16:23.970" style="s2">book anti-intellectualism in American</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.310" end="00:16:25.620" style="s2">Life it&#39;s from 1964 and there&#39;s tons of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.970" end="00:16:27.270" style="s2">gems in here but I want to just focus on</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.620" end="00:16:30.840" style="s2">that distinction between intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.270" end="00:16:32.880" style="s2">and intellect intelligence works within</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.840" end="00:16:35.670" style="s2">the framework of limited but clearly</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.670" end="00:16:42.030" style="s2">away questions of thought that do not</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.980" end="00:16:53.610" style="s2">simple or complex Minds right so this is</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.290" end="00:16:56.010" style="s2">why we&#39;re all wowed by them intellect on</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.610" end="00:16:58.730" style="s2">the other hand is the critical creative</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.010" end="00:17:00.900" style="s2">and contemplative side of mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.730" end="00:17:03.360" style="s2">whereas intelligence seeks to grasp</p>

<p begin="00:17:03.360" end="00:17:09.240" style="s2">examines Ponder&#39;s wonders see arises</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.990" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">criticizes imagines intelligence will</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.240" end="00:17:14.670" style="s2">see the immediate meaning in a situation</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:17.460" style="s2">and evaluate it intellect evaluates</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.670" end="00:17:20.850" style="s2">evaluations and looks for the meanings</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.460" end="00:17:22.980" style="s2">of situations as a whole intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.850" end="00:17:25.770" style="s2">can be praised as a quality in animals</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.980" end="00:17:28.530" style="s2">intellect being a unique manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.770" end="00:17:33.810" style="s2">of human dignity is both praised and</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.530" end="00:17:35.130" style="s2">assailed as a quality in men when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.810" end="00:17:36.780" style="s2">difference is so defined it becomes</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.130" end="00:17:39.660" style="s2">easier to understand why we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.780" end="00:17:42.690" style="s2">say that the mind of admittedly</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.660" end="00:17:45.060" style="s2">penetrating intelligence is relatively</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.690" end="00:17:47.670" style="s2">unintellectual and why by the same token</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.060" end="00:17:50.430" style="s2">we see among Mayans that are</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.670" end="00:17:58.590" style="s2">unmistakably intellectual a considerable</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.430" end="00:18:02.040" style="s2">range of intelligence and like this this</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.590" end="00:18:06.930" style="s2">book is super important but I just want</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.040" end="00:18:09.330" style="s2">to you know kind of make the point that</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.930" end="00:18:10.680" style="s2">the intellectual dark web right I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.330" end="00:18:13.170" style="s2">making the claim that it&#39;s anti</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.680" end="00:18:15.420" style="s2">intellectual but that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.170" end="00:18:17.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not engaged with intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.420" end="00:18:18.810" style="s2">things right that&#39;s the kind of paradox</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.160" end="00:18:21.840" style="s2">at work here so there&#39;s a quote here</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.810" end="00:18:24.660" style="s2">from earlier in the page so the leading</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.840" end="00:18:26.670" style="s2">anti intellectuals are usually men</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.660" end="00:18:28.480" style="s2">deeply engaged with ideas often</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.670" end="00:18:31.150" style="s2">obsessively engaged</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.480" end="00:18:33.580" style="s2">with this or that a worn or rejected</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.150" end="00:18:35.710" style="s2">idea and that&#39;s the key because so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.580" end="00:18:37.960" style="s2">of these ideas that that they take up</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.710" end="00:18:40.390" style="s2">like Sam Harris with the bell curve and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.960" end="00:18:43.870" style="s2">charles murray it&#39;s been debunked</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.390" end="00:18:46.780" style="s2">already in the past but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.870" end="00:18:49.780" style="s2">public and the mass media you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.780" end="00:18:52.390" style="s2">not quick to realize that right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.780" end="00:18:55.060" style="s2">there&#39;s a kind of pattern of history and</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.390" end="00:18:57.730" style="s2">it goes back to socrates at least right</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.060" end="00:19:00.550" style="s2">this is the kind of kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.730" end="00:19:06.100" style="s2">tradition right is the kind of disparage</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.550" end="00:19:11.080" style="s2">and exile and you know execute critical</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.100" end="00:19:13.840" style="s2">thinkers that threaten the status quo so</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.080" end="00:19:15.520" style="s2">we&#39;re often not hearing from the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.840" end="00:19:17.440" style="s2">that we should be right the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.520" end="00:19:20.980" style="s2">dark web blows up and it&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.440" end="00:19:24.070" style="s2">it&#39;s mostly mostly white men uh mostly</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.980" end="00:19:27.040" style="s2">obsessed with old ideas right classical</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.070" end="00:19:30.340" style="s2">liberalism and its various extents race</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.040" end="00:19:34.240" style="s2">realism like with Colet and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.340" end="00:19:36.610" style="s2">endorsed colette you know and you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.240" end="00:19:39.220" style="s2">these these things become contentious</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.610" end="00:19:41.710" style="s2">because of the culture war not because</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.220" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">there&#39;s some inherent truth in what</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.710" end="00:19:48.720" style="s2">they&#39;re saying hmm so and there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.670" end="00:19:56.320" style="s2">well I wanted to say something quickly</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.870" end="00:19:59.890" style="s2">about about Socrates I&#39;ll come back to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.320" end="00:20:01.870" style="s2">that just this idea of Western</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.890" end="00:20:04.750" style="s2">civilization you know Michael Brooks&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.870" end="00:20:08.790" style="s2">has talked about this like it&#39;s largely</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.750" end="00:20:11.110" style="s2">a myth right and it&#39;s it&#39;s perpetuated</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.790" end="00:20:15.280" style="s2">mostly by the right but also the center</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.110" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">as as as a truth it&#39;s rarified right we</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.280" end="00:20:22.000" style="s2">believe in it because you know it is</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:23.740" style="s2">written but that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.000" end="00:20:27.100" style="s2">deeper reality so I have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.740" end="00:20:28.930" style="s2">degree of faith at least in the people</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.100" end="00:20:30.940" style="s2">present in my allies that they can see</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.930" end="00:20:32.800" style="s2">beyond that kind of facade of Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.940" end="00:20:35.920" style="s2">civilization that keeps us trapped in</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.800" end="00:20:38.020" style="s2">this culture war right because those</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.920" end="00:20:41.720" style="s2">people the intellectual dark web that</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.020" end="00:20:45.330" style="s2">are fighting at the hardest for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.720" end="00:20:47.160" style="s2">interests it&#39;s really built on this kind</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.330" end="00:20:49.950" style="s2">of myth right and if you&#39;re to undercut</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.160" end="00:20:52.590" style="s2">that myth you know and Peterson&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.950" end="00:20:56.780" style="s2">vehement defender of myths you know it</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.590" end="00:20:59.460" style="s2">all kind of collapses and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.780" end="00:21:02.670" style="s2">you know the aspect of the attentional</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.460" end="00:21:05.670" style="s2">economy right the kind of in equal</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.670" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">access people have two platforms right</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.670" end="00:21:12.390" style="s2">and and free speech and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:14.160" style="s2">irony of the the IDW whining about free</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.390" end="00:21:15.990" style="s2">speech while they&#39;re platformed in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.160" end="00:21:17.400" style="s2">new york times and not only that if they</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.990" end="00:21:20.070" style="s2">were real intellectuals if they were</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.400" end="00:21:23.670" style="s2">critical they would be critical of the</p>

<p begin="00:21:23.670" end="00:21:28.920" style="s2">promoted them and of her politics right</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.730" end="00:21:31.230" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of like tacit</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.920" end="00:21:33.930" style="s2">collusion between a lot of these people</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.230" end="00:21:36.870" style="s2">with no politics or bad or bad politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.930" end="00:21:39.750" style="s2">and the under the undercurrent here is</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.870" end="00:21:42.120" style="s2">like you know cuz I fight I fight with a</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.750" end="00:21:45.990" style="s2">lot of apolitical people too in the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.120" end="00:21:48.450" style="s2">emerge space like the truth is you</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.990" end="00:21:51.480" style="s2">actually can&#39;t escape politics</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.450" end="00:21:54.300" style="s2">everything is political at least its</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.480" end="00:21:57.390" style="s2">political for somebody right all social</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.300" end="00:22:07.640" style="s2">issues are political in politics is one</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.390" end="00:22:12.810" style="s2">major lever to intervene on that so</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.640" end="00:22:15.150" style="s2">about about Socrates like ancient</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.810" end="00:22:17.520" style="s2">philosophy philosophy can be instructive</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.150" end="00:22:19.920" style="s2">right but as a saying Western</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.520" end="00:22:22.170" style="s2">civilization is a myth like ancient</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.920" end="00:22:24.150" style="s2">Greece was not a modernist it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.170" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">cosmopolitan and it had shared or stolen</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.150" end="00:22:29.010" style="s2">culture from Africa in the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:30.450" style="s2">it also had slaves so we shouldn&#39;t like</p>

<p begin="00:31:06.169" end="00:31:11.779" style="s2">so Jared Jaynes Jason Snyder and myself</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.529" end="00:31:15.830" style="s2">were as you know were fans of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.779" end="00:31:17.330" style="s2">mimetic mediator term and the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.830" end="00:31:18.799" style="s2">question I have for you is I guess what</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.330" end="00:31:20.359" style="s2">is your sense on what that is that</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.799" end="00:31:22.549" style="s2">potential project is because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.359" end="00:31:24.200" style="s2">still a new project and it has not works</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.549" end="00:31:26.960" style="s2">not really been defined you ever come to</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.200" end="00:31:29.149" style="s2">the mediation campfires and what do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.960" end="00:31:32.450" style="s2">think it&#39;s negative and positive</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.149" end="00:31:35.629" style="s2">potential is yeah a good question</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.450" end="00:31:38.239" style="s2">mm-hmm I&#39;ve been to a few camp fires and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.629" end="00:31:40.179" style="s2">I&#39;ve had you know private conversations</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.239" end="00:31:42.739" style="s2">with with both of you about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.179" end="00:31:45.739" style="s2">my criticism has been more what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.739" end="00:31:47.570" style="s2">missing right because I&#39;m starting from</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.739" end="00:31:49.970" style="s2">my own meaning what mimetic mediation</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.570" end="00:31:51.650" style="s2">should be but let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.970" end="00:31:55.280" style="s2">some credit right because you guys have</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.650" end="00:31:57.260" style="s2">like um skills right that you that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.280" end="00:31:58.580" style="s2">worked on and that take practice and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.260" end="00:32:01.940" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.580" end="00:32:06.680" style="s2">developing so it&#39;s you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.940" end="00:32:11.570" style="s2">diplomacy mediation itself conflict</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.680" end="00:32:13.250" style="s2">resolution I have a lot of ideas of how</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.570" end="00:32:16.430" style="s2">I&#39;d like to take that further like how</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.250" end="00:32:19.130" style="s2">do we experimentally build consensus you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.430" end="00:32:21.320" style="s2">know I I can&#39;t do that on my own but</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.130" end="00:32:23.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve got the research and the idea is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.320" end="00:32:25.490" style="s2">do it my critique of the mimetic</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.420" end="00:32:27.500" style="s2">mediation is that like as Jason</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.490" end="00:32:28.520" style="s2">suggested in a tweet today like</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.500" end="00:32:30.470" style="s2">sometimes he can&#39;t tell the difference</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.520" end="00:32:34.490" style="s2">between all these competing viewpoints</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.470" end="00:32:38.290" style="s2">he just absorbs them all and not to</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.490" end="00:32:41.330" style="s2">place myself like higher in a hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.290" end="00:32:43.670" style="s2">but as a student I went through phases</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.330" end="00:32:45.620" style="s2">like that right it&#39;s critical to go</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.670" end="00:32:48.020" style="s2">through those and put yourself in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.620" end="00:32:48.590" style="s2">shoes of a white supremacist or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.020" end="00:32:53.900" style="s2">it may be</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.590" end="00:32:58.010" style="s2">mm-hmm um but I think I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.900" end="00:33:01.220" style="s2">like you know we have to get we have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.010" end="00:33:03.560" style="s2">get through it to something like there</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.220" end="00:33:10.130" style="s2">are good memes and bad memes to</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.560" end="00:33:13.550" style="s2">oversimplify and you know I saw a game B</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.130" end="00:33:16.010" style="s2">and mimetic mediation as not being</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.550" end="00:33:17.990" style="s2">sufficiently critical of the IDW that</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.010" end="00:33:20.330" style="s2">came before it right so it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.990" end="00:33:23.660" style="s2">baking in some of the same practices</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.330" end="00:33:26.180" style="s2">some of the same like knowledge gaps and</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.660" end="00:33:28.550" style="s2">ignorance about theory about race about</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.180" end="00:33:31.250" style="s2">social justice about post-modernism</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.550" end="00:33:33.500" style="s2">right because there&#39;s nobody in those</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.250" end="00:33:37.370" style="s2">spaces who is like an authority right</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.500" end="00:33:39.230" style="s2">and so you know I would be one one</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.370" end="00:33:42.260" style="s2">person who has some authority on those</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.230" end="00:33:45.350" style="s2">topics but we need a lot more right and</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.260" end="00:33:48.050" style="s2">what I was seeing in game B especially</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.350" end="00:33:51.620" style="s2">was the opposite of mediation it was</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.050" end="00:33:55.610" style="s2">like like literally cancelling and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.620" end="00:33:57.110" style="s2">kicking out anybody who was like sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.610" end="00:34:00.350" style="s2">rocking the boat even constructively</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.110" end="00:34:02.900" style="s2">like you know full disclosure like like</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.350" end="00:34:03.890" style="s2">I can beat up on people but I was kicked</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.900" end="00:34:08.590" style="s2">out essentially</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.890" end="00:34:11.630" style="s2">for calling racists racist so you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.590" end="00:34:13.909" style="s2">the the deeper problem here is people</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.630" end="00:34:16.550" style="s2">are getting offended because they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.909" end="00:34:19.280" style="s2">understand like you know nobody wants to</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.550" end="00:34:21.770" style="s2">be racist perfect call graces there are</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.280" end="00:34:24.280" style="s2">explicit racists out there but the</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.770" end="00:34:26.480" style="s2">systemic problem is that like you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.280" end="00:34:28.850" style="s2">there&#39;s not been a sufficient public</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.480" end="00:34:31.899" style="s2">discourse about this stuff systemic</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.850" end="00:34:34.669" style="s2">racism is ongoing with the way the media</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.899" end="00:34:39.140" style="s2">handles things with the way think tanks</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.669" end="00:34:43.520" style="s2">operate and you know the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.140" end="00:34:47.149" style="s2">feedback loop that that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.520" end="00:34:49.790" style="s2">people you know give back to these</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.149" end="00:34:57.020" style="s2">leaders to to to pump them up so it</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.790" end="00:34:59.560" style="s2">becomes a trap cool thank you maybe gray</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.020" end="00:34:59.560" style="s2">you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.450" end="00:35:07.190" style="s2">hi Brian thanks for being here um I</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.730" end="00:35:10.280" style="s2">heard from you really early on in your</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.190" end="00:35:13.400" style="s2">introduction today um that you felt that</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.280" end="00:35:16.460" style="s2">there&#39;s some really like he self</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.400" end="00:35:18.890" style="s2">learning and self critique topics that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.460" end="00:35:20.390" style="s2">sense makers seem to have blind spots</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.890" end="00:35:25.220" style="s2">around and I&#39;d love to hear you riff</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.390" end="00:35:28.040" style="s2">more on that sure well they talk a lot</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.220" end="00:35:30.290" style="s2">about shadow work right that&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.040" end="00:35:32.480" style="s2">personal development hack to to deal</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.290" end="00:35:35.290" style="s2">with your own trauma but that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.480" end="00:35:38.540" style="s2">nothing to do with social issues and the</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.290" end="00:35:40.100" style="s2">epistemology of that so my critique is</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.540" end="00:35:43.340" style="s2">like that there&#39;s not enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.100" end="00:35:45.890" style="s2">self-criticism of the of the ignorance</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.340" end="00:35:48.560" style="s2">like a lot of these problems are over</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.890" end="00:35:51.980" style="s2">determined by various social factors and</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.560" end="00:35:54.230" style="s2">then and then in these spaces our</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.980" end="00:35:55.460" style="s2">confidence becomes kind of over</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.230" end="00:35:57.170" style="s2">determined to like people are</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.460" end="00:35:59.890" style="s2">overconfident for various reasons like</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.170" end="00:36:02.390" style="s2">rebel wisdom has had a lot of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.890" end="00:36:06.500" style="s2">success in terms of traffic and</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.390" end="00:36:08.210" style="s2">audiences and and and so has game B and</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.500" end="00:36:09.830" style="s2">you know the people involved with these</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.210" end="00:36:12.980" style="s2">things so there&#39;s a kind of momentum</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.830" end="00:36:16.520" style="s2">there&#39;s a there&#39;s a great degree of</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.980" end="00:36:17.690" style="s2">hesitancy to not just engage in self</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.520" end="00:36:19.910" style="s2">critique but like</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.690" end="00:36:23.510" style="s2">to ask the tough deeper questions like</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.910" end="00:36:26.270" style="s2">what if I&#39;m wrong about everything you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.510" end="00:36:28.130" style="s2">know fundamentally and you know I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.270" end="00:36:31.460" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to pick on certain people</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.130" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">um especially without like you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.460" end="00:36:35.359" style="s2">saying something nice right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:38.990" style="s2">what&#39;s gonna that&#39;s gonna let me be</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.359" end="00:36:41.390" style="s2">heard but like the the moderators</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.990" end="00:36:44.500" style="s2">in the game B group and you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.390" end="00:36:48.319" style="s2">under gym rats guidance and an influence</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.500" end="00:36:52.460" style="s2">wanted to you know completely control</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.319" end="00:36:54.980" style="s2">the discourse right and this isn&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.460" end="00:36:58.130" style="s2">you know I hope to talk to Jim soon and</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.980" end="00:37:00.140" style="s2">like hope that the good faith and</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.130" end="00:37:06.410" style="s2">openness there means we can work through</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.140" end="00:37:08.680" style="s2">these things but like you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.410" end="00:37:12.380" style="s2">the issue of him wanting to ban like</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.680" end="00:37:14.150" style="s2">race theories it&#39;s one thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.380" end="00:37:18.049" style="s2">gonna be pretty hostile to sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.150" end="00:37:21.530" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening but then like</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.049" end="00:37:24.710" style="s2">just on a much more basic level I would</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.530" end="00:37:26.270" style="s2">use the word problematic like this this</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.710" end="00:37:28.190" style="s2">is problematic or that person is</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.270" end="00:37:32.500" style="s2">problematic and I you know I try to use</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.190" end="00:37:34.789" style="s2">it in the way the word is meant like</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.500" end="00:37:36.920" style="s2">that there&#39;s a set of problems that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.789" end="00:37:39.890" style="s2">arise in the in the process of</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.920" end="00:37:41.630" style="s2">engagement right and he just wanted he</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.890" end="00:37:43.369" style="s2">just didn&#39;t like that word he wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.630" end="00:37:45.619" style="s2">ban the word like let&#39;s not say</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.369" end="00:37:48.079" style="s2">problematic and you know in prep for</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.619" end="00:37:50.660" style="s2">this I came across you know some better</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.079" end="00:37:53.589" style="s2">definitions like problematization you</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.660" end="00:37:57.289" style="s2">know it&#39;s a way we kind of D mythos eyes</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.589" end="00:37:59.809" style="s2">problems and you know deconstruct common</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.289" end="00:38:01.640" style="s2">knowledge that is taken for granted so</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.809" end="00:38:03.650" style="s2">we can make a meta move you know and</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.640" end="00:38:05.390" style="s2">reform our thinking about it but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.650" end="00:38:07.130" style="s2">also something called and I think Jim</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.390" end="00:38:08.900" style="s2">and others would be interested in this</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.130" end="00:38:11.930" style="s2">it&#39;s called problematic integration</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.900" end="00:38:13.640" style="s2">theory and it really puts a button on</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.930" end="00:38:15.079" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to say here right and</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.640" end="00:38:17.450" style="s2">I&#39;ll just read is this the definition</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.079" end="00:38:19.130" style="s2">from Wikipedia problematic integration</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.450" end="00:38:21.260" style="s2">theory is a theory of communication that</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.130" end="00:38:24.319" style="s2">addresses the processes and dynamics of</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.650" end="00:38:32.990" style="s2">theory are base</p>

<p begin="00:38:39.340" end="00:38:46.670" style="s2">construction right so I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.530" end="00:38:50.090" style="s2">this is a sociological thing that just</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.670" end="00:38:53.330" style="s2">for being sociological it&#39;s in Jim&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.090" end="00:38:56.450" style="s2">blind spot but we all have the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.330" end="00:38:57.860" style="s2">know Jim&#39;s very intelligent right going</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.450" end="00:39:00.440" style="s2">back to that we all have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.860" end="00:39:03.620" style="s2">learn these things so we could actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.440" end="00:39:05.660" style="s2">use this theory to work through some of</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.620" end="00:39:07.220" style="s2">these things and unpack them but it</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.660" end="00:39:09.410" style="s2">takes a process it takes it takes</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.220" end="00:39:14.210" style="s2">collaboration it takes overcoming the</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.410" end="00:39:16.400" style="s2">fear of being wrong or called out um but</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.210" end="00:39:18.670" style="s2">you know this is how we get over</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.400" end="00:39:21.680" style="s2">disagreements that are that are</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.670" end="00:39:25.340" style="s2">generated from from misinterpretation or</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.680" end="00:39:27.980" style="s2">bad premises you know and hence why I</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.340" end="00:39:29.690" style="s2">say problematic because all of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.980" end="00:39:32.630" style="s2">of disagreements that would crop up like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.690" end="00:39:35.540" style="s2">about politics and social justice they</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.630" end="00:39:37.850" style="s2">weren&#39;t like there was no coherence</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.540" end="00:39:40.640" style="s2">there you know it didn&#39;t resonate with</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.850" end="00:39:42.290" style="s2">anything I&#39;d studied uh or anything I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.640" end="00:39:44.780" style="s2">currently working on related to these</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.290" end="00:39:49.700" style="s2">subjects it&#39;s just kind of the standard</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.780" end="00:39:54.410" style="s2">reactionary dismissal of of lapped isms</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.700" end="00:40:03.430" style="s2">socialism and politics in general so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.410" end="00:40:08.030" style="s2">hope that is a sufficient answer okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.430" end="00:40:09.200" style="s2">thank you maybe so we have a private</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.030" end="00:40:13.420" style="s2">someone some a private question I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.200" end="00:40:13.420" style="s2">read on their behalf just let me find it</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.070" end="00:40:21.020" style="s2">okay so who in your view is doing</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.160" end="00:40:24.080" style="s2">sense-making well or that you consider</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.020" end="00:40:27.020" style="s2">to be a high signal noise good faith</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.080" end="00:40:28.340" style="s2">sources and what is in the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.020" end="00:40:29.720" style="s2">their approach that transcends the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.340" end="00:40:32.440" style="s2">critique that you have outlined here</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.720" end="00:40:32.440" style="s2">today at the Stoa</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.690" end="00:40:47.499" style="s2">so you know Michael Brooks comes to mind</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.720" end="00:40:49.479" style="s2">because he&#39;s been on the stoah and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.499" end="00:40:52.960" style="s2">know one of the things I&#39;ve said to you</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.479" end="00:40:55.329" style="s2">Peter is that we can&#39;t just have</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.960" end="00:40:58.299" style="s2">conversations and then move on with our</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.329" end="00:41:01.539" style="s2">lives right like I participate in</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.299" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">Michael Brooks&#39;s community I take in all</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.539" end="00:41:07.630" style="s2">his content and hmm and and then some</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:10.059" style="s2">right because there&#39;s there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.630" end="00:41:12.279" style="s2">there&#39;s many many great thinkers on the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.059" end="00:41:14.140" style="s2">left that that few people know about and</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.279" end="00:41:18.849" style="s2">so through a show like his you have</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.140" end="00:41:20.380" style="s2">access to that you know kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.849" end="00:41:22.059" style="s2">other alternative sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.380" end="00:41:26.979" style="s2">really like there&#39;s a lot of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.059" end="00:41:29.999" style="s2">lot of people in terms of like really</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.979" end="00:41:33.670" style="s2">cutting-edge intellectuals like I</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.999" end="00:41:35.829" style="s2">reference Benjamin Bratton a lot Zac</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.670" end="00:41:39.700" style="s2">who&#39;s in the chat here also likes</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.829" end="00:41:41.890" style="s2">Bratton you know that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.700" end="00:41:43.869" style="s2">discourse just kind of flies overhead</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.890" end="00:41:47.829" style="s2">all of this kind of stuff like it&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.869" end="00:41:50.890" style="s2">another plane um and and again it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.829" end="00:41:54.190" style="s2">like you have to dive into it we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.890" end="00:41:56.170" style="s2">just like great graze on his body of</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.190" end="00:41:57.969" style="s2">work you know you can&#39;t just interview</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.170" end="00:42:00.339" style="s2">him and think you&#39;re gonna grok or</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.969" end="00:42:05.109" style="s2">download what what is consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.339" end="00:42:07.930" style="s2">right like you know so hopefully we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.109" end="00:42:11.049" style="s2">all in the process and the people here</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.930" end="00:42:13.690" style="s2">can help lead in constructive ways the</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.049" end="00:42:16.180" style="s2">move away from these intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.690" end="00:42:18.359" style="s2">web thinkers and they can decide for</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.180" end="00:42:20.710" style="s2">themselves whether to come along or not</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.359" end="00:42:22.269" style="s2">but what seems to be happening is that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.710" end="00:42:24.609" style="s2">they just they further alienate</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.269" end="00:42:28.630" style="s2">themselves into the center or the right</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.609" end="00:42:30.130" style="s2">and um you know that that&#39;s that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.630" end="00:42:32.680" style="s2">paradox at play here with all these</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.130" end="00:42:35.789" style="s2">communities like integral and rubble</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.680" end="00:42:39.479" style="s2">wisdom that are invested in those</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.789" end="00:42:43.859" style="s2">so-called intellectuals and sense makers</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.479" end="00:42:46.809" style="s2">a lot of also who I draw on is just like</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.859" end="00:42:50.410" style="s2">obscure scholars like papers and books</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.809" end="00:42:52.990" style="s2">you know I&#39;m often collecting stuff more</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.410" end="00:42:56.050" style="s2">than ever more than I&#39;m reading it</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.990" end="00:42:57.970" style="s2">so that keeps me humble because whenever</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.050" end="00:43:02.020" style="s2">you come across a popular article like</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.970" end="00:43:04.210" style="s2">it&#39;s full of holes relative to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.020" end="00:43:06.280" style="s2">out there right and and one point I</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.210" end="00:43:08.650" style="s2">wanted to make that I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.280" end="00:43:10.660" style="s2">coming into this talk is like you know a</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.650" end="00:43:13.330" style="s2">lot of us are thinkers where we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.660" end="00:43:15.280" style="s2">research we&#39;re innovating one thing</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.330" end="00:43:17.290" style="s2">researchers have to realize is that like</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.280" end="00:43:19.960" style="s2">most of the groundwork has already been</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.290" end="00:43:21.940" style="s2">laid it&#39;s a matter of like realizing</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.960" end="00:43:23.920" style="s2">what was good from the past right and</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.940" end="00:43:26.080" style="s2">and and so like I said in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.920" end="00:43:27.490" style="s2">book like sometimes these anti</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.080" end="00:43:30.360" style="s2">intellectuals are obsessed with old</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.490" end="00:43:32.950" style="s2">outdated antiquated debunked ideas</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.360" end="00:43:34.930" style="s2">there&#39;s so many good ideas in the past</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.950" end="00:43:37.360" style="s2">so many things have been realized early</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.930" end="00:43:39.310" style="s2">on like this book is very predictive and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.360" end="00:43:42.190" style="s2">descriptive of the intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.310" end="00:43:45.760" style="s2">and it&#39;s from 1964 right so we see</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.190" end="00:43:48.910" style="s2">history repeating itself and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.760" end="00:43:52.780" style="s2">just about you know who&#39;s you know hot</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.910" end="00:43:54.730" style="s2">today um but you know what are the gold</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.780" end="00:43:59.560" style="s2">standards what can we really trust when</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.730" end="00:44:01.960" style="s2">we go back to but yeah you know aside</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.560" end="00:44:04.630" style="s2">for Michael Brooks like you know I want</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.960" end="00:44:06.700" style="s2">to give credit to you know like like</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.630" end="00:44:09.400" style="s2">Jacobin and current affairs like these</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.700" end="00:44:11.410" style="s2">are just kind of socialist outlets that</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.400" end="00:44:16.570" style="s2">that produce content on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.410" end="00:44:19.510" style="s2">and you know they&#39;re they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.570" end="00:44:21.160" style="s2">something intellectual right and this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.510" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">they&#39;re also doing something very</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.160" end="00:44:26.680" style="s2">pragmatic like what they are advocating</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:28.570" style="s2">for in some sense should line up with</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.680" end="00:44:31.890" style="s2">Jambi stuff right if game B wants to</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.570" end="00:44:34.930" style="s2">talk about the Commons or you know like</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.890" end="00:44:38.740" style="s2">like decentralization or distribution</p>

<p begin="00:47:28.420" end="00:47:33.100" style="s2">answered its from Jason Snyder our boy</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.720" end="00:47:36.390" style="s2">Jason Snyder Jason would you like to</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.100" end="00:47:40.660" style="s2">unmute yourself and ask your question</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.390" end="00:47:42.910" style="s2">yeah Brett just a really a quick</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.660" end="00:47:45.610" style="s2">question or a small question no no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.910" end="00:47:47.290" style="s2">quick who are some thinkers that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.610" end="00:47:49.750" style="s2">on a socialist and/or critical theory</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.290" end="00:47:53.710" style="s2">left that you learned from I asked this</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.750" end="00:47:55.270" style="s2">question because as you know somebody</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.710" end="00:47:56.560" style="s2">coming in I think I know where you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.270" end="00:48:01.000" style="s2">coming from but somebody coming in might</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.560" end="00:48:04.570" style="s2">think that the arbiter of truth and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.000" end="00:48:07.890" style="s2">know the real intellect intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.570" end="00:48:11.380" style="s2">conversations going on is on the left</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.890" end="00:48:13.600" style="s2">and so I want to know who&#39;s not talking</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.380" end="00:48:15.850" style="s2">about socialism or critical theory that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.600" end="00:48:19.780" style="s2">you find really worthwhile to engage</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.850" end="00:48:22.690" style="s2">with yeah it&#39;s a good question I can</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.780" end="00:48:24.760" style="s2">probably come up with a more detailed</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.690" end="00:48:27.910" style="s2">answer later but the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.760" end="00:48:30.610" style="s2">comes to mind is comedians love lots of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.910" end="00:48:32.320" style="s2">comedians and I saw you tweeted Dave</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.610" end="00:48:34.630" style="s2">Chappelle clip I think and I I did as</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.320" end="00:48:36.490" style="s2">well like I love that shit and you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.630" end="00:48:39.220" style="s2">he&#39;s speaking he&#39;s speaking truth I mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.490" end="00:48:42.700" style="s2">in the clip he was criticizing Candace</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.220" end="00:48:45.670" style="s2">Owens Hey and Candace Owens you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.700" end="00:48:47.140" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of you know adjacent to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.670" end="00:48:50.530" style="s2">intellectual dark web and like you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.140" end="00:48:53.350" style="s2">was big part of the dave rubin craze has</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.530" end="00:48:54.940" style="s2">enormous influence for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.350" end="00:48:57.870" style="s2">she&#39;s you know she&#39;s incredibly popular</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.940" end="00:49:00.550" style="s2">is it because she&#39;s smart</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.870" end="00:49:04.780" style="s2">it&#39;s because she&#39;s like attractive</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.550" end="00:49:07.720" style="s2">probably a little but you know or is it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.780" end="00:49:11.110" style="s2">because the United States has a systemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.720" end="00:49:12.940" style="s2">racism problem and she&#39;s paid papering</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.110" end="00:49:14.410" style="s2">over that and making people feel okay</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.940" end="00:49:16.570" style="s2">about it I think it&#39;s the latter and</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.410" end="00:49:18.580" style="s2">that&#39;s what Dave Chappelle was pointing</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.570" end="00:49:20.500" style="s2">out right and so Dave Chappelle is not</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.580" end="00:49:24.870" style="s2">theorizing about socialism and in fact I</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.500" end="00:49:29.230" style="s2">think he supported Andrew yang mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.870" end="00:49:32.010" style="s2">you know so I do go outside the left and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.230" end="00:49:33.609" style="s2">I do also seek out conservative thinkers</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.010" end="00:49:36.309" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.609" end="00:49:39.009" style="s2">moment in this day and age it is so hard</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.309" end="00:49:41.289" style="s2">to parse that and it might in fact be</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.009" end="00:49:45.009" style="s2">impossible or counterproductive right so</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.289" end="00:49:48.849" style="s2">I&#39;m not you know for whatever I can do</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.009" end="00:49:51.549" style="s2">in it I try to encourage people who want</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.849" end="00:49:55.299" style="s2">to identify as conservative to build out</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.549" end="00:49:58.180" style="s2">this like much better brand I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.299" end="00:50:00.670" style="s2">talk with Justin Carmy on this weekend</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.180" end="00:50:02.710" style="s2">who&#39;s like a meta modder and colleague</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.670" end="00:50:05.440" style="s2">if you will but he identifies as</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.710" end="00:50:08.739" style="s2">conservative and we we have a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.440" end="00:50:11.890" style="s2">good relationship across that and so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.739" end="00:50:14.200" style="s2">know he he has a lot of knowledge right</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.890" end="00:50:16.930" style="s2">so I respect what he knows and I respect</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.200" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">his thinking process you know as long as</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.930" end="00:50:22.239" style="s2">he&#39;s not trying to import any ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">dogma I have no problem with engaging</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.239" end="00:50:30.160" style="s2">him over that and encouraging you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:36.609" style="s2">that kind of bipartisanship but uh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.160" end="00:50:39.279" style="s2">that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say on that cool</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.609" end="00:50:42.099" style="s2">so looks like Naomi and Ron are both</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.279" end="00:50:45.069" style="s2">tapping out two questions for each other</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.099" end="00:50:48.339" style="s2">so maybe no me if you want to yourself I</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.069" end="00:50:53.940" style="s2">read yours looks like Ron also suggested</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.339" end="00:50:58.420" style="s2">years ago hey sure okay so let&#39;s see um</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.940" end="00:51:00.759" style="s2">I want to what a forward a premise</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.420" end="00:51:02.289" style="s2">that&#39;s that I sort of go with from time</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.759" end="00:51:04.509" style="s2">to time especially when I&#39;m frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.289" end="00:51:07.140" style="s2">with not being able to figure out why</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.509" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">people in a particular sense making</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.140" end="00:51:14.019" style="s2">arena are able to entertain you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.680" end="00:51:17.710" style="s2">much more entertain critiques of</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.019" end="00:51:20.589" style="s2">themselves which is that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.710" end="00:51:24.130" style="s2">there&#39;s an integral Aswany this in which</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.589" end="00:51:27.819" style="s2">I DW and this in SJW and everything else</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.130" end="00:51:30.579" style="s2">everything in between are essentially</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.819" end="00:51:31.839" style="s2">like avatars of communities that need to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.579" end="00:51:35.410" style="s2">sort things out in their own particular</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.839" end="00:51:37.359" style="s2">way so I&#39;m wondering if you see this if</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.410" end="00:51:39.190" style="s2">there&#39;s a way to see this as a version</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.359" end="00:51:43.779" style="s2">of collective sense making in and of</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.190" end="00:51:46.569" style="s2">itself and so instead of attempting to</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.779" end="00:51:47.410" style="s2">you know kind of go in with a scalpel</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.569" end="00:51:49.119" style="s2">and try to fix</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.410" end="00:51:51.760" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong with any particular group</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.119" end="00:51:54.250" style="s2">but rather to have them hash that cash</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.760" end="00:51:56.859" style="s2">things out in their own way and if that</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.250" end="00:52:00.220" style="s2">is the case what would be the mechanisms</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.859" end="00:52:03.789" style="s2">by which these these collective sense</p>

<p begin="00:52:44.289" end="00:52:47.980" style="s2">like let that be it because a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.750" end="00:52:50.170" style="s2">people are okay with that or is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.980" end="00:52:53.980" style="s2">actually a dangerous cult and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.170" end="00:52:56.920" style="s2">you know um mmm like like like money</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.980" end="00:53:00.490" style="s2">scheme like what is it right and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.920" end="00:53:03.490" style="s2">its relationship to to justice but I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.490" end="00:53:05.140" style="s2">think you know comes back to the</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.490" end="00:53:07.660" style="s2">intellectual dark web calling themselves</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.140" end="00:53:09.520" style="s2">intellectual and that they should</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.660" end="00:53:12.609" style="s2">actually be interested in these topics</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.520" end="00:53:15.940" style="s2">that would make them more self-critical</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.609" end="00:53:18.579" style="s2">and reflective mm-hmm and given their</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.940" end="00:53:19.809" style="s2">role as kind of public speakers you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.579" end="00:53:22.859" style="s2">with followings</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.809" end="00:53:25.240" style="s2">I think whatever they do you know they</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.859" end="00:53:26.740" style="s2">they they can lead people in a new</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.240" end="00:53:28.809" style="s2">direction right that&#39;s always the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.740" end="00:53:30.130" style="s2">opportunity here what instead tends to</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.809" end="00:53:32.380" style="s2">happen is like what&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.130" end="00:53:34.809" style="s2">Dave Rubin like he just goes further and</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.380" end="00:53:38.710" style="s2">further to the right making more money</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.809" end="00:53:41.380" style="s2">and and completely selling out his sense</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.710" end="00:53:43.359" style="s2">making and not only is that happening</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.380" end="00:53:44.770" style="s2">all his so-called friends have just</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.359" end="00:53:47.529" style="s2">abandoned him and throwing him under the</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.770" end="00:53:49.779" style="s2">bus right and so one thing I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.529" end="00:53:53.140" style="s2">lobbying for behind the scenes is that</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.779" end="00:53:55.390" style="s2">we should actually like do way better to</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.140" end="00:53:59.799" style="s2">take care of each other like to to call</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.390" end="00:54:01.130" style="s2">in to reach out you know and and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.799" end="00:54:02.809" style="s2">hard right because people</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.130" end="00:54:04.519" style="s2">we&#39;ll say like yeah well I tried you</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.809" end="00:54:06.529" style="s2">know I tried to criticize so-and-so and</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.519" end="00:54:10.490" style="s2">they just they wouldn&#39;t have it and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.529" end="00:54:12.170" style="s2">I&#39;m like exactly this is the problem we</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.490" end="00:54:15.650" style="s2">can&#39;t criticize each other we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.170" end="00:54:18.529" style="s2">learn or stuck you know going in circles</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.650" end="00:54:25.039" style="s2">on some of these just really really bad</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.529" end="00:54:26.660" style="s2">ideas and you know so I don&#39;t know we</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.039" end="00:54:29.750" style="s2">can only be in control of ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.660" end="00:54:32.240" style="s2">right that&#39;s the kind of stoic and stoic</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.750" end="00:54:35.299" style="s2">value proposition you have to just</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.240" end="00:54:36.710" style="s2">accept it and so as time goes on that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.299" end="00:54:39.890" style="s2">what that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do more</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.710" end="00:54:43.490" style="s2">to like you know I make I made the</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.890" end="00:54:45.799" style="s2">videos and do long critiques cuz like</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.490" end="00:54:48.680" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s my purpose as an</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.799" end="00:54:50.329" style="s2">intellectual I just have to say fuck it</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.680" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">mmm and I want to read an anecdote</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.329" end="00:54:55.759" style="s2">quickly along these lines like so my my</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:54:58.460" style="s2">classics professor he fashioned himself</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.759" end="00:55:00.319" style="s2">was kind of a Tyler Durden type of guy</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.460" end="00:55:03.680" style="s2">and he would he would always bring up</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.319" end="00:55:06.140" style="s2">this this parallel from antiquity who</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.680" end="00:55:08.180" style="s2">was called HIPPA Clyde ease and HIPAA</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.140" end="00:55:12.410" style="s2">Clyde ease was was a guy who was like</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.180" end="00:55:14.180" style="s2">competing for some first for a wife and</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.410" end="00:55:16.549" style="s2">in any made it to the end and then the</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.180" end="00:55:18.529" style="s2">final contests like the night before he</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.549" end="00:55:21.559" style="s2">decided to get drunk and just dance away</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.529" end="00:55:23.720" style="s2">his concern so you know and then and</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.559" end="00:55:26.000" style="s2">then one of the other guys is like he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.720" end="00:55:29.809" style="s2">like you just you just like you just</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.000" end="00:55:32.630" style="s2">like lost the competition like on your</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.809" end="00:55:36.440" style="s2">own and then he says typical IDs doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.630" end="00:55:38.119" style="s2">care and that phrase actually was like</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.440" end="00:55:39.619" style="s2">became a common expression in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.119" end="00:55:41.690" style="s2">ancient world right in the the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.619" end="00:55:44.150" style="s2">contemporary equivalent would be like no</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.690" end="00:55:46.430" style="s2">fucks given right so so typical IDs is</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.150" end="00:55:49.579" style="s2">like like I don&#39;t care I place my own</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.430" end="00:55:53.329" style="s2">kind of values and priorities above the</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.579" end="00:55:56.480" style="s2">expectations of society and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.329" end="00:56:00.559" style="s2">kind of what I&#39;m trying to do but at the</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.480" end="00:56:04.970" style="s2">same time like I do care a lot so you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.559" end="00:56:07.190" style="s2">know there&#39;s a lot of like this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.970" end="00:56:10.130" style="s2">critical knowledge out there and I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.190" end="00:56:13.029" style="s2">like that&#39;s what needs to become the</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.130" end="00:56:14.809" style="s2">next addictive craze but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.029" end="00:56:17.539" style="s2">something that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.809" end="00:56:20.839" style="s2">really amenable to like going going</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.539" end="00:56:22.489" style="s2">viral because it&#39;s you know it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.839" end="00:56:24.559" style="s2">individual thing and it involves a lot</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.489" end="00:56:29.929" style="s2">of this like sticking your neck out and</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.559" end="00:56:32.269" style="s2">speaking truth to power so you know try</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.929" end="00:56:34.669" style="s2">to criticize somebody like from from</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.269" end="00:56:36.619" style="s2">like like like find some good</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.669" end="00:56:39.799" style="s2">foundations you know like I think of</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.619" end="00:56:41.569" style="s2">like another another juxtaposition I</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.799" end="00:56:43.489" style="s2">like to bring in is like Steven Pinker</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.569" end="00:56:45.049" style="s2">and Phil Torres you know there are two</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.489" end="00:56:47.959" style="s2">guys who&#39;ve just gone back and forth and</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.049" end="00:56:51.169" style="s2">no progress has been made but like you</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.959" end="00:56:54.199" style="s2">know take the critical side and try to</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.169" end="00:56:56.479" style="s2">criticize somebody like like like pink</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.199" end="00:56:57.439" style="s2">or an integral list or a centrist and</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.479" end="00:56:59.929" style="s2">and see what happens</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.439" end="00:57:02.089" style="s2">you know it&#39;s not fun and you&#39;re not</p>

<p begin="00:57:10.339" end="00:57:14.869" style="s2">start to learn with me like how</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.130" end="00:57:17.479" style="s2">difficult it is to try to insert</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.869" end="00:57:18.579" style="s2">yourself into people&#39;s like nonsense and</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.479" end="00:57:26.539" style="s2">bullshit</p>

<p begin="00:57:29.689" end="00:57:32.929" style="s2">maybe plug anything that you&#39;re working</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.069" end="00:57:34.969" style="s2">on articles that you&#39;d like people to</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.929" end="00:57:38.409" style="s2">read or whatnot or your any upcoming rap</p>

<p begin="00:58:14.419" end="00:58:17.869" style="s2">kind of relevant to today&#39;s talk right</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.640" end="00:58:19.579" style="s2">it didn&#39;t have a lot of chance to get</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.869" end="00:58:22.279" style="s2">into the details of the different ones</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.579" end="00:58:23.809" style="s2">but a lot of it is is aggregating other</p>
