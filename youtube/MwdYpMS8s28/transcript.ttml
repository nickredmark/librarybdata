<p begin="00:18:12.970" end="00:18:17.230" style="s2">more important than the words that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.160" end="00:18:18.130" style="s2">use and then when the government says</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.130" end="00:18:21.100" style="s2">using these words you should start</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.630" end="00:18:23.530" style="s2">thinking hard about your damn government</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.100" end="00:18:25.660" style="s2">because your words are no different than</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.010" end="00:18:33.940" style="s2">what it is that you have to think then</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.470" end="00:18:38.830" style="s2">because there&#39;s lots of terrible things</p>

<p begin="00:18:43.179" end="00:18:48.309" style="s2">it looks to me so but about the</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.660" end="00:18:50.799" style="s2">ideological context of this it seems</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.309" end="00:18:55.169" style="s2">like something has changed yes because</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.799" end="00:18:58.600" style="s2">if you think back decades earlier</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.169" end="00:19:01.419" style="s2">liberals were the champions of free</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.600" end="00:19:03.789" style="s2">speech yes it was the Conservatives at a</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.419" end="00:19:05.890" style="s2">certain moment in time who were the</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.789" end="00:19:10.150" style="s2">censors you know they they sought to</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.890" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">curb blasphemy and obscenity sedition</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.150" end="00:19:16.320" style="s2">and so on and and the Liberals said no</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:21.820" style="s2">free speech is the way we want to go and</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.320" end="00:19:26.770" style="s2">yet today that has flipped if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.820" end="00:19:29.950" style="s2">look back to what left-leaning officials</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.770" end="00:19:31.650" style="s2">and authorities and and and figures said</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.950" end="00:19:35.409" style="s2">let me just give you one quote this is</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.650" end="00:19:41.650" style="s2">Samuel Gompers who is the founder of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.409" end="00:19:43.799" style="s2">American Federation of Labor in 1886 he</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.650" end="00:19:46.659" style="s2">said this he said the freedom of speech</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.799" end="00:19:52.390" style="s2">has been granted to the people in order</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.659" end="00:19:54.429" style="s2">that they may say the things which sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.390" end="00:19:56.559" style="s2">who&#39;s quoted that have not been granted</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.429" end="00:19:59.650" style="s2">to the people in order that they may say</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.559" end="00:20:02.409" style="s2">the things which please and which are</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.650" end="00:20:05.580" style="s2">based upon accepted thought but the</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.090" end="00:20:18.190" style="s2">though they do are wrong now that is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.030" end="00:20:23.200" style="s2">a sentiment now carried on by the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.190" end="00:20:25.809" style="s2">and today what has happened well again I</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.200" end="00:20:29.049" style="s2">see that it&#39;s a consequence of continual</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.809" end="00:20:31.340" style="s2">a agitation by I would say a minority of</p>

<p begin="00:20:31.340" end="00:20:36.410" style="s2">particular and those are people who are</p>

<p begin="00:20:50.030" end="00:20:54.050" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s really distressing</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.310" end="00:20:55.880" style="s2">about that is that if you know anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.050" end="00:20:58.580" style="s2">about the history of oppressed people</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.850" end="00:21:07.130" style="s2">obvious that it&#39;s freedom of speeches is</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.820" end="00:21:08.600" style="s2">a freedom that&#39;s particularly important</p>

<p begin="00:21:08.600" end="00:21:12.230" style="s2">right it&#39;s if you&#39;re supporting freedom</p>

<p begin="00:21:14.240" end="00:21:18.530" style="s2">let&#39;s use the logic of the radical</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.070" end="00:24:57.080" style="s2">correct well yeah first of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.250" end="00:25:00.740" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of things I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.080" end="00:25:03.130" style="s2">say about that no I looked at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.740" end="00:25:06.530" style="s2">process by which the Ontario government</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.130" end="00:25:08.390" style="s2">formulated its legislation with regards</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.530" end="00:25:11.090" style="s2">to the pronouns and the consultation</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.390" end="00:25:14.990" style="s2">process they used and the consultation</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.090" end="00:25:17.450" style="s2">process was deeply flawed they contacted</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.990" end="00:25:19.880" style="s2">activists and say let&#39;s activists of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.450" end="00:25:21.230" style="s2">trans community okay well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.880" end="00:25:23.630" style="s2">couple of things I&#39;d like to say about</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.230" end="00:25:26.450" style="s2">that the first is there is no trans</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.630" end="00:25:28.970" style="s2">community right trans people are as</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.450" end="00:25:32.000" style="s2">diverse as any other group of people and</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.970" end="00:25:34.040" style="s2">to the idea that somehow because of one</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.000" end="00:25:36.230" style="s2">of their attributes they constitute a</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.040" end="00:25:37.820" style="s2">homogenous group is a well you think</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.230" end="00:25:41.570" style="s2">that that would be a falsehood that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.820" end="00:25:43.970" style="s2">people who are concerned about treating</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.570" end="00:25:46.880" style="s2">groups of people adequately would be</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.970" end="00:25:48.350" style="s2">loathe to to put forward but even more</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.880" end="00:25:50.330" style="s2">importantly there&#39;s absolutely no</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.350" end="00:25:52.850" style="s2">evidence whatsoever that the activist</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.330" end="00:25:54.380" style="s2">types are actually representatives of</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.850" end="00:25:56.600" style="s2">any of the communities that they</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.380" end="00:25:58.790" style="s2">hypothetically activate on behalf of</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.600" end="00:26:01.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like they&#39;re not elected they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.790" end="00:26:05.870" style="s2">not appointed they don&#39;t pull they do</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.880" end="00:26:08.090" style="s2">this they say look here&#39;s a group it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.870" end="00:26:10.220" style="s2">minority group and it&#39;s oppressed I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.090" end="00:26:12.530" style="s2">member of that group and therefore I</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.220" end="00:26:15.140" style="s2">stand for the group it&#39;s like actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.530" end="00:26:18.410" style="s2">no you don&#39;t you don&#39;t stand for your</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.140" end="00:26:20.330" style="s2">group you maybe stand for yourself you</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.410" end="00:26:22.280" style="s2">know I don&#39;t stand for men and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.330" end="00:26:24.320" style="s2">have to stand for white man I&#39;m not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.280" end="00:26:27.170" style="s2">not entitled to speak on their behalf</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.320" end="00:26:29.090" style="s2">and so the idea that it&#39;s the trans</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.170" end="00:26:31.550" style="s2">community that wanted this is a</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.090" end="00:26:34.070" style="s2">completely unsustainable idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.550" end="00:26:35.720" style="s2">certainly unproven I&#39;ve had like 40</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.070" end="00:26:40.030" style="s2">letters from trans people since I</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.720" end="00:26:42.810" style="s2">started to engage in this call it</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.030" end="00:26:45.120" style="s2">chaotic battle</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.810" end="00:26:47.550" style="s2">and only one of them was mildly critical</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.120" end="00:26:50.190" style="s2">of what I was doing all the other ones</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.550" end="00:26:52.260" style="s2">there aren&#39;t that many trans people you</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.190" end="00:26:54.180" style="s2">know so to get 40 letters is actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.260" end="00:26:56.490" style="s2">quite a few I&#39;m not saying that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.180" end="00:26:58.620" style="s2">a scientific poll but it&#39;s at least as</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.490" end="00:27:00.750" style="s2">scientific as the process by which the</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.620" end="00:27:05.630" style="s2">Ontario government generated its</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.750" end="00:27:05.630" style="s2">legislation and and I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.410" end="00:27:16.660" style="s2">and and I&#39;m not generating legislation</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.510" end="00:27:20.320" style="s2">and what these people said to a person</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.660" end="00:27:22.570" style="s2">was I didn&#39;t ask to be the newest</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.320" end="00:27:25.270" style="s2">whipping boy for the radical post</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.570" end="00:27:28.000" style="s2">modernists all it&#39;s done has made my</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.270" end="00:27:29.800" style="s2">life more difficult you know that basic</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.000" end="00:27:31.330" style="s2">letter would say well I&#39;m transitioning</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.800" end="00:27:32.830" style="s2">from one gender to the other and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.330" end="00:27:35.830" style="s2">very difficult and I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.830" end="00:27:39.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the right thing to do and this has</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.830" end="00:27:42.520" style="s2">made the process spectacularly more</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.640" end="00:27:45.010" style="s2">difficult on all fronts it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.520" end="00:27:47.230" style="s2">these people don&#39;t speak for me and just</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.010" end="00:27:49.630" style="s2">because they say they do that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.230" end="00:27:51.910" style="s2">mean they do and so the other thing that</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.630" end="00:27:55.210" style="s2">we seem to have swallowed as a society</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.910" end="00:27:56.830" style="s2">is this crazy notion that well first of</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.210" end="00:27:58.540" style="s2">all that we should be portioned up into</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.830" end="00:28:00.370" style="s2">our different minority groups which i</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.540" end="00:28:02.380" style="s2">think is a return to tribalism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.370" end="00:28:04.030" style="s2">unbelievably dangerous I can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.380" end="00:28:06.340" style="s2">think of anything more dangerous than</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.030" end="00:28:08.980" style="s2">that and then we&#39;ve swallowed the idea</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.340" end="00:28:10.930" style="s2">that if you identify yourself as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.980" end="00:28:12.940" style="s2">member of a minority group and then you</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.930" end="00:28:14.350" style="s2">bring forward a grievance you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.940" end="00:28:16.030" style="s2">treated as if you&#39;re a valid</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.350" end="00:28:18.610" style="s2">representative of that group it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.030" end="00:28:22.330" style="s2">well why in the world would we do that</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.610" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">it&#39;s guilt I suppose maybe that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.330" end="00:28:27.310" style="s2">of it or I think it&#39;s mostly guilt you</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:29.380" style="s2">don&#39;t want to stand up and say well you</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.310" end="00:28:34.330" style="s2">know who died and made you King so to</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.380" end="00:28:37.360" style="s2">speak you know can we stay on that logic</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.330" end="00:28:41.410" style="s2">for a moment the the idea so this this</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.360" end="00:28:46.330" style="s2">compelled speech material seems to</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.410" end="00:28:48.880" style="s2">insist upon treating people not as</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.330" end="00:28:52.180" style="s2">individuals but as members of groups so</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.880" end="00:28:54.340" style="s2">either blame them or to favor them as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.180" end="00:28:56.680" style="s2">member of a group if we take that logic</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.340" end="00:28:59.650" style="s2">and extend it you know that the group</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.680" end="00:29:01.720" style="s2">identity thing becomes intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.650" end="00:29:02.860" style="s2">where you&#39;re not just belonging to one</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.720" end="00:29:05.170" style="s2">group but you also have these</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.860" end="00:29:05.710" style="s2">characteristics spin that up worse what</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.170" end="00:29:07.720" style="s2">what</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.710" end="00:29:10.750" style="s2">what is the logic of that where does</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.720" end="00:29:13.090" style="s2">anybody use to well okay so the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.750" end="00:29:18.970" style="s2">thing I would say to everyone in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.090" end="00:29:21.220" style="s2">room is is I don&#39;t think and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.970" end="00:29:22.930" style="s2">I decided to do with what I did right</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.220" end="00:29:24.820" style="s2">from the beginning you know is that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.930" end="00:29:27.430" style="s2">don&#39;t want to play the group identity</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.820" end="00:29:29.650" style="s2">game I don&#39;t want to construe the world</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.430" end="00:29:31.360" style="s2">in those terms but I&#39;m not going to use</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.650" end="00:29:33.370" style="s2">terminology that would require me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.360" end="00:29:35.530" style="s2">formulate my thoughts in that manner I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.370" end="00:29:37.270" style="s2">think it&#39;s a terrible catastrophe to</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.530" end="00:29:39.400" style="s2">divide us all up into our tribal</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.270" end="00:29:43.330" style="s2">entities I don&#39;t see anything positive</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.400" end="00:29:45.490" style="s2">about that at all so I just don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.330" end="00:29:48.370" style="s2">to go there and then second I would say</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.490" end="00:29:49.860" style="s2">and maybe this is even more relevant you</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.370" end="00:29:52.480" style="s2">may or may not have heard about</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.860" end="00:29:54.430" style="s2">intersectionality but intersectionality</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.480" end="00:29:58.210" style="s2">is a new development on the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.430" end="00:30:00.700" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s actually if I wasn&#39;t so</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.210" end="00:30:03.220" style="s2">intent upon seriousness in these matters</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.700" end="00:30:05.350" style="s2">I would be constantly laughing about</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.220" end="00:30:07.420" style="s2">intersectionality and the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.350" end="00:30:10.600" style="s2">that is that it&#39;s the radical left has</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.420" end="00:30:12.460" style="s2">discovered its own Achilles heel so look</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.600" end="00:30:16.780" style="s2">what&#39;s the problem with dividing us up</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.460" end="00:30:18.580" style="s2">into groups well there&#39;s many and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.780" end="00:30:21.190" style="s2">descent into tribalism is not least</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.580" end="00:30:23.590" style="s2">among them but the next is that well</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.190" end="00:30:27.280" style="s2">then it turns out that we don&#39;t fit into</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.590" end="00:30:29.320" style="s2">one group any of us we fit into multiple</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.280" end="00:30:31.270" style="s2">groups and it&#39;s not obvious at all which</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.320" end="00:30:33.400" style="s2">of those groups should take should be of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.270" end="00:30:35.500" style="s2">paramount importance you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.400" end="00:30:37.090" style="s2">racial group and an F of ethnic group</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.500" end="00:30:38.440" style="s2">and there&#39;s groups of intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.090" end="00:30:39.820" style="s2">there&#39;s groups of temperament there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.440" end="00:30:41.560" style="s2">groups of attractiveness and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.820" end="00:30:43.990" style="s2">groups of wealth and you can multiply</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.560" end="00:30:46.150" style="s2">them really indefinitely and I do mean</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.990" end="00:30:48.340" style="s2">indefinitely because you can categorize</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.150" end="00:30:50.530" style="s2">a finite number of entities a virtually</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.340" end="00:30:52.390" style="s2">infinite number of ways and so the</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.530" end="00:30:54.310" style="s2">intersection lists discovered this they</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.390" end="00:30:56.290" style="s2">said well there&#39;s there&#39;s let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.310" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">there&#39;s Latinos and there&#39;s and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.290" end="00:31:00.880" style="s2">Asians it&#39;s like okay well wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:04.630" style="s2">there&#39;s male and female Latinos and</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.880" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">there&#39;s male and female Asians so so do</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.630" end="00:31:08.470" style="s2">we treat is is the division into two and</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.880" end="00:31:10.500" style="s2">off or do we need a division into four</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.470" end="00:31:12.970" style="s2">well and then well then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.500" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">socioeconomic class of male and female</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.970" end="00:31:18.950" style="s2">Asians and male and female Latinos and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:21.140" style="s2">you can keep fractionating the groups</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.950" end="00:31:23.120" style="s2">and technically without end and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.140" end="00:31:27.830" style="s2">actually see this happening in real time</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.120" end="00:31:30.740" style="s2">so to speak as the as the acronym for</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.830" end="00:31:34.160" style="s2">the LGBT activists continues to expand</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.740" end="00:31:36.260" style="s2">really without end and see what&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.160" end="00:31:38.210" style="s2">bottom of intersectionality and this I</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.260" end="00:31:40.130" style="s2">suspect will be discovered eventually by</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.210" end="00:31:41.960" style="s2">the radical leftist if they get that far</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.130" end="00:31:44.000" style="s2">is that you have to fractionate the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.960" end="00:31:46.970" style="s2">groups right down to the individual and</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.000" end="00:31:48.530" style="s2">that&#39;s what Western culture discussed</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.970" end="00:31:50.450" style="s2">and articulated discovered and</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.530" end="00:31:52.880" style="s2">articulated over the last 5000 years</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.450" end="00:31:55.280" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh right the group isn&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.880" end="00:31:57.200" style="s2">paramount division it&#39;s the individual</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.280" end="00:31:59.090" style="s2">because unless you treat each person</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.200" end="00:32:01.700" style="s2">like an individual you&#39;re not taking all</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.090" end="00:32:03.080" style="s2">the intersections into account and so</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.700" end="00:32:06.620" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinarily it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.080" end="00:32:10.130" style="s2">extraordinarily comedic but it also</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.620" end="00:32:11.900" style="s2">isn&#39;t as if it&#39;s treating everyone as</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.130" end="00:32:14.060" style="s2">they&#39;re an individual as if they&#39;re an</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.900" end="00:32:16.520" style="s2">individual is an instant solution that</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.060" end="00:32:18.320" style="s2">will bring us to utopia you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.520" end="00:32:21.140" style="s2">it&#39;s like Winston Churchill said of</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.320" end="00:32:23.690" style="s2">democracy right it&#39;s it&#39;s essentially</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.140" end="00:32:26.150" style="s2">the least terrible approach we have and</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.690" end="00:32:28.490" style="s2">life isn&#39;t the sort of problem that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.150" end="00:32:31.100" style="s2">amenable to an instantaneous utopian</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.490" end="00:32:34.520" style="s2">solution but our best bet is to meet</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.100" end="00:32:37.730" style="s2">each other with the desire for peace and</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.520" end="00:32:40.190" style="s2">productivity on this on this stage that</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.730" end="00:32:42.350" style="s2">enables individual interaction because</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.190" end="00:32:44.330" style="s2">then we meet soul to soul so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.350" end="00:32:46.700" style="s2">and we also meet in a domain that we</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.330" end="00:32:48.350" style="s2">bear responsibility for as individuals</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.700" end="00:32:50.360" style="s2">and that&#39;s also extremely important</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.350" end="00:32:52.160" style="s2">right you should be responsible for what</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.360" end="00:32:54.200" style="s2">you say you should have to suffer the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.160" end="00:32:58.220" style="s2">consequences of what you say not least</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.200" end="00:33:00.290" style="s2">so that you learn and so the individual</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.220" end="00:33:01.970" style="s2">is paramount as far as I&#39;m concerned I</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.290" end="00:33:04.100" style="s2">think that&#39;s the fundamental principle</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.970" end="00:33:06.440" style="s2">of Western civilization now it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.100" end="00:33:07.970" style="s2">only the West that has come across that</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.440" end="00:33:10.250" style="s2">discovery but I think we&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.970" end="00:33:12.710" style="s2">best job so far of articulating it and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.250" end="00:33:14.950" style="s2">so we don&#39;t want to lose that because</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.710" end="00:33:18.020" style="s2">the alternative isn&#39;t a multicultural</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.950" end="00:33:21.200" style="s2">utopia the alternative is a descent into</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.020" end="00:33:22.760" style="s2">tribal barbarism and and there are</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.200" end="00:33:25.370" style="s2">people who would be just as happy if</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.760" end="00:33:27.290" style="s2">that happened but I would system suggest</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.370" end="00:33:28.540" style="s2">that it&#39;s not a destiny that in the wake</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.290" end="00:33:33.640" style="s2">person with</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.540" end="00:33:36.250" style="s2">would would long for yeah do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.640" end="00:33:39.400" style="s2">like taking some questions do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.250" end="00:33:40.929" style="s2">like taking some questions sure all</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.400" end="00:33:42.850" style="s2">right so we&#39;re gonna have questions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.929" end="00:33:49.390" style="s2">we&#39;d like you to participate in this</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.850" end="00:33:52.840" style="s2">conversation now please do ask a</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.390" end="00:33:55.750" style="s2">question we welcome you up to say what</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.840" end="00:33:59.290" style="s2">you&#39;d like if there is a preamble to the</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.750" end="00:34:02.049" style="s2">question that&#39;s fairly short then so be</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.290" end="00:34:03.669" style="s2">it but please do ask a question we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.049" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">not actually anybody speeches and we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.669" end="00:34:08.080" style="s2">primarily want to hear what Jordan has</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:11.260" style="s2">to say so feel free to line up at the</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.080" end="00:34:15.159" style="s2">two microphones we&#39;ll take one at a time</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.260" end="00:34:16.629" style="s2">go ahead sir so first of all thank you</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.159" end="00:34:18.659" style="s2">so much for being here I really enjoyed</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.629" end="00:34:18.659" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.950" end="00:34:31.430" style="s2">and second I&#39;m this ties into my</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.910" end="00:34:32.900" style="s2">question I had just last week my free</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.430" end="00:34:35.570" style="s2">speech coalition at bishops University</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.900" end="00:34:36.980" style="s2">was officially ratified and I would love</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.570" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">to invite you to be our first guest</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.980" end="00:34:47.090" style="s2">speaker if that&#39;s at all possible and my</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:49.190" style="s2">question pertains to this for dr.</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.090" end="00:34:54.020" style="s2">Peterson what would you consider the</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.190" end="00:34:55.880" style="s2">most under discussed or overlooked ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.020" end="00:34:57.470" style="s2">and topics that you think should be</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.880" end="00:34:59.150" style="s2">discussed in the club because I know</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.470" end="00:35:01.430" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for controversial ideas</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.150" end="00:35:06.830" style="s2">that we think are maybe not as discussed</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.430" end="00:35:09.020" style="s2">as much as they should be well that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.830" end="00:35:14.470" style="s2">that&#39;s a difficult question I would say</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.020" end="00:35:16.790" style="s2">that it isn&#39;t obvious to me that on</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.470" end="00:35:18.850" style="s2">university campuses at the present time</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.790" end="00:35:22.100" style="s2">or in the education system in general</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.850" end="00:35:24.050" style="s2">we&#39;ve done a good job of taking stock of</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.100" end="00:35:26.330" style="s2">the advantages and disadvantages of our</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.050" end="00:35:29.360" style="s2">current socio-political systems</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.330" end="00:35:30.740" style="s2">now and I think there&#39;s enough data so</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.360" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">that we could start having intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.740" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">conversations so one thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:36.740" style="s2">recommend to you all if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.560" style="s2">interested is a book I just finished</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.740" end="00:35:42.790" style="s2">reading it it&#39;s called the great leveler</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.560" end="00:35:46.520" style="s2">the great leveler by Walter shy del and</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.790" end="00:35:48.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a discussion of inequality and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.520" end="00:35:51.500" style="s2">a very intelligent book so one of so</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.530" end="00:35:54.290" style="s2">inequality as you may or may not know is</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.500" end="00:35:56.240" style="s2">rife throughout human societies right</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.290" end="00:35:58.310" style="s2">and that&#39;s the case in the present day</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.240" end="00:35:59.900" style="s2">and it&#39;s being the case historically but</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.310" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case in animal societies</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.900" end="00:36:05.540" style="s2">by every measure so inequality is the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:07.610" style="s2">rule of life let&#39;s say and that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.540" end="00:36:10.760" style="s2">mean it&#39;s not an ethical catastrophe I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.610" end="00:36:13.010" style="s2">not saying that I&#39;m just saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.760" end="00:36:16.040" style="s2">fact of inequality cannot be laid at the</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.010" end="00:36:18.020" style="s2">feet of the West or of capitalism or</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.040" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">really of any human construction for</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.020" end="00:36:22.190" style="s2">them matter one of the things shy Dell</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:24.650" style="s2">did was to investigate empirically the</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.190" end="00:36:27.440" style="s2">relationship between inequality and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.650" end="00:36:30.470" style="s2">pole of government so because let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.440" end="00:36:32.380" style="s2">if you if you surveyed a very large</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.470" end="00:36:35.690" style="s2">number of states you could determine</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.380" end="00:36:37.250" style="s2">whether this the governments were</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.690" end="00:36:38.210" style="s2">left-wing or right-wing and then you</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.250" end="00:36:41.170" style="s2">could you</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.210" end="00:36:43.030" style="s2">do a compilation of inequality</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.170" end="00:36:46.040" style="s2">coefficients and you could find out if</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.030" end="00:36:48.590" style="s2">left-wing governments had any any</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.040" end="00:36:50.180" style="s2">ability to ameliorate inequality just as</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.590" end="00:36:52.580" style="s2">an empirical question and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.180" end="00:36:53.990" style="s2">that shy Dell generated was no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.580" end="00:36:55.640" style="s2">no difference whatsoever in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.990" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">inequality coefficients in left and</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.640" end="00:36:59.480" style="s2">right wing states and what that points</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:02.150" style="s2">to is a much more fundamental problem</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.480" end="00:37:04.040" style="s2">and the shy Dell in his book also points</p>

<p begin="00:43:32.570" end="00:43:37.670" style="s2">is generally they&#39;re only dealing with</p>

<p begin="00:43:53.450" end="00:43:58.580" style="s2">c16 one of the things that I suggested</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.510" end="00:44:01.820" style="s2">was that the act of making the video</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.580" end="00:44:04.310" style="s2">itself could well have been illegal and</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.820" end="00:44:06.320" style="s2">of course people immediately accused me</p>

<p begin="00:44:22.280" end="00:44:26.450" style="s2">been transgressing the law and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.380" end="00:44:30.470" style="s2">why they wrote me two letters telling me</p>

<p begin="00:46:24.160" end="00:46:29.410" style="s2">jail for this is silly</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.380" end="00:46:34.380" style="s2">in this sense remember every single</p>

<p begin="00:46:34.380" end="00:46:42.030" style="s2">because it is backed with the</p>

<p begin="00:46:48.400" end="00:46:53.750" style="s2">there&#39;s no such thing as a rule without</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.600" end="00:46:56.690" style="s2">punishment so if if for example there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.750" end="00:46:59.060" style="s2">a no parking sign what the parking sign</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.690" end="00:47:01.400" style="s2">says oh by the way please don&#39;t park</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.060" end="00:47:03.230" style="s2">here but there are no tickets well</p>

<p begin="00:47:03.230" end="00:47:07.970" style="s2">not really a rule so if you have a rule</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.990" end="00:47:10.070" style="s2">in the Human Rights Code and if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.970" end="00:47:13.310" style="s2">breach it if that&#39;s discrimination</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.070" end="00:47:14.990" style="s2">well then true that the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.310" end="00:47:18.050" style="s2">happens to you is not going to be thrown</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.990" end="00:47:21.440" style="s2">in jail but there&#39;s a process a series</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.050" end="00:47:23.450" style="s2">of steps right the first one might be a</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.440" end="00:47:25.310" style="s2">mediation or an investigation and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.450" end="00:47:27.200" style="s2">there might be a fine and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.310" end="00:47:29.030" style="s2">don&#39;t pay the fine then your wages might</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.200" end="00:47:31.880" style="s2">be garnished or you might be ordered to</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.030" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2">fix it but believe me if you refuse and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.880" end="00:47:37.369" style="s2">refuse and refuse and refuse that order</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:39.410" style="s2">will become a court order and then if</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.369" end="00:47:41.810" style="s2">you don&#39;t obey the court order you&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.410" end="00:47:44.240" style="s2">in contempt of court and then that will</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.810" end="00:47:48.070" style="s2">lead to arrest and imprisonment so every</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.240" end="00:47:51.350" style="s2">single rule in the Human Rights Code is</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.070" end="00:47:54.080" style="s2">effectively enforced with the most</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.350" end="00:47:56.390" style="s2">severe violence the state has even</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.080" end="00:48:00.350" style="s2">though it&#39;s not actually practiced most</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.390" end="00:48:02.990" style="s2">of the time because most people obey we</p>

<p begin="00:48:09.650" end="00:48:13.070" style="s2">would tell you that even if you don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:56:37.890" end="00:56:41.640" style="s2">of identity politics which is happening</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.690" end="00:56:45.839" style="s2">very rapidly in fact we&#39;re compelled to</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.640" end="00:56:47.940" style="s2">do so right so um well then then what</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.839" end="00:56:50.099" style="s2">happens is you get activity on the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.940" end="00:56:53.670" style="s2">identity politics front on the left and</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.099" end="00:56:55.380" style="s2">on the right the left says well the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.670" end="00:56:57.930" style="s2">oppressed shall rise and take their</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.380" end="00:56:59.099" style="s2">rightful place and the right says yeah</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.930" end="00:57:02.520" style="s2">over my dead body</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.099" end="00:57:04.920" style="s2">and probably yours too so as soon as we</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.520" end="00:57:07.349" style="s2">play the identity politics game that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.920" end="00:57:09.599" style="s2">where we&#39;re at and we start playing it</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.349" end="00:57:11.789" style="s2">by accepting the terminology you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:14.640" style="s2">already I find myself stumbling when I</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.789" end="00:57:15.990" style="s2">use the word sex instead of gender and</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.640" end="00:57:19.109" style="s2">that&#39;s not good like I have to</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.990" end="00:57:21.240" style="s2">consciously overcome a resistance to use</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.109" end="00:57:22.920" style="s2">the word sex instead of gender because</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.240" end="00:57:27.299" style="s2">you know I&#39;m actually quite an agreeable</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.920" end="00:57:29.460" style="s2">person and it actually pains me to to go</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.299" end="00:57:30.960" style="s2">against the crowd let&#39;s say you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.460" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">not temperamentally suited for it</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.960" end="00:57:34.619" style="s2">precisely</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:36.480" style="s2">strangely enough and so I feel the</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.619" end="00:57:40.710" style="s2">compulsion to use this kind of language</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.480" end="00:57:44.849" style="s2">welling up inside of me just to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.710" end="00:57:47.849" style="s2">nice I suppose you know but I know where</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.849" end="00:57:50.250" style="s2">identity politics leads it leads to the</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.849" end="00:57:52.109" style="s2">gulag it leads to the concentration</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.250" end="00:57:54.809" style="s2">camps it leads to blood in the streets</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.109" end="00:57:57.319" style="s2">we don&#39;t need that here we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.809" end="00:58:09.499" style="s2">pretty well so we</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.319" end="00:58:11.209" style="s2">leave it hi professor Peterson I studied</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.499" end="00:58:14.509" style="s2">history for the duration of my degree</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.209" end="00:58:17.150" style="s2">and I think it&#39;s just sickeningly ironic</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.509" end="00:58:19.640" style="s2">that the people who are using their free</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.150" end="00:58:21.769" style="s2">speech want to take away your free</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.640" end="00:58:23.329" style="s2">speech and furthermore that they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.769" end="00:58:25.910" style="s2">see the irony of the situation of how</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.329" end="00:58:28.489" style="s2">tyrannical their being my question is</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.910" end="00:58:29.599" style="s2">however I&#39;ve noticed from a lot of what</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.489" end="00:58:31.509" style="s2">you&#39;ve talked about and I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.599" end="00:58:34.910" style="s2">watching you since your rise in 2060</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.509" end="00:58:36.199" style="s2">2016 and I know that you&#39;re a Christian</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.910" end="00:58:39.199" style="s2">and I don&#39;t want to divulge into that</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.199" end="00:58:42.259" style="s2">but I noticed a lot of the sort of North</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.199" end="00:58:44.239" style="s2">American Protestant work ethic in in in</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.259" end="00:58:45.890" style="s2">your lessons like you know self</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.239" end="00:58:47.180" style="s2">redemption and to be your own person</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.890" end="00:58:49.719" style="s2">like we&#39;ve been talking about that the</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.180" end="00:58:53.019" style="s2">last like hour and a half I suppose and</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.719" end="00:58:55.369" style="s2">in a ever rising tide where people are</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.019" end="00:58:57.319" style="s2">rather in the Western world where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.369" end="00:58:59.479" style="s2">becoming increasingly rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.319" end="00:59:01.269" style="s2">decreasingly Christian specifically is</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.479" end="00:59:03.140" style="s2">yeah decreasingly religious and</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.269" end="00:59:05.420" style="s2">specifically decreasing the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.140" end="00:59:07.789" style="s2">how can you what do you think is the</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.420" end="00:59:10.279" style="s2">best suggestion in order to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.789" end="00:59:12.920" style="s2">uphold those such important values that</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.279" end="00:59:15.469" style="s2">have been across the world from American</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.920" end="00:59:18.339" style="s2">cultural influence I apologize for the</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.469" end="00:59:20.690" style="s2">long question no no it&#39;s fine</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.339" end="00:59:23.859" style="s2">you know people have asked me repeatedly</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.690" end="00:59:25.969" style="s2">about my religious views and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.859" end="00:59:29.029" style="s2">answered them in a variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.969" end="00:59:31.940" style="s2">ways but they say do you believe in God</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.029" end="00:59:33.859" style="s2">let&#39;s say and my response to that always</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.940" end="00:59:35.719" style="s2">is well I don&#39;t know what you mean when</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.859" end="00:59:37.130" style="s2">you ask me that question so I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.719" end="00:59:39.140" style="s2">how to answer it I don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.130" end="00:59:41.690" style="s2">mean by belief but I can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.140" end="00:59:44.239" style="s2">something that I believe and I would say</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.690" end="00:59:47.089" style="s2">this is a way of speaking symbolically I</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.239" end="00:59:49.339" style="s2">do believe so I was thinking the other</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.089" end="00:59:51.739" style="s2">day a week ago I was thinking about this</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.339" end="00:59:54.049" style="s2">little fantasy that entered my mind I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.739" end="00:59:57.140" style="s2">was thinking about st. Joseph&#39;s oratorio</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.049" end="00:59:58.910" style="s2">in Montreal and st. joseph´s oratorio is</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.140" end="01:00:00.829" style="s2">a very large religious building it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.910" end="01:00:02.329" style="s2">of the biggest cathedral like structures</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.829" end="01:00:04.369" style="s2">in the world and it&#39;s set on the hill</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.329" end="01:00:06.619" style="s2">won&#39;t Royal and it&#39;s set up where it can</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.369" end="01:00:08.690" style="s2">catch the Sun you know so it&#39;s an image</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.619" end="01:00:11.150" style="s2">of the heavenly City on the hill right</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.690" end="01:00:13.850" style="s2">it&#39;s an image of the structures that</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.150" end="01:00:15.770" style="s2">we strive to create that&#39;s what it is in</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.850" end="01:00:17.720" style="s2">independent of its specifically</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.770" end="01:00:19.580" style="s2">Christian or religious function that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.720" end="01:00:21.350" style="s2">what it stands for symbolically okay so</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.580" end="01:00:23.210" style="s2">it&#39;s the city on the hill it&#39;s it&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.350" end="01:00:25.250" style="s2">we&#39;re striving towards when we walk</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.210" end="01:00:28.100" style="s2">uphill in life</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.250" end="01:00:29.690" style="s2">okay now the way the oratorio is</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.100" end="01:00:31.880" style="s2">structured there&#39;s hundreds of steps</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.690" end="01:00:33.650" style="s2">leading to it up the front and in the</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.880" end="01:00:35.120" style="s2">early part of the 20th century a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.650" end="01:00:36.920" style="s2">people who had physical disabilities</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.120" end="01:00:38.870" style="s2">came there and they struggled up the</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.920" end="01:00:40.700" style="s2">step on their crutches and many of them</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.870" end="01:00:42.350" style="s2">left their crutches in the oratorio you</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.700" end="01:00:43.790" style="s2">can see hundreds of them if you go there</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.350" end="01:00:45.920" style="s2">it&#39;s quite an interesting sight</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.790" end="01:00:47.810" style="s2">and I was thinking about that and I was</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.920" end="01:00:50.780" style="s2">thinking about what that meant this is</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.810" end="01:00:53.240" style="s2">what it means it means that you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.780" end="01:00:54.890" style="s2">everyone has their disabilities let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.240" end="01:00:57.620" style="s2">say and I know that some people are far</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.890" end="01:00:59.660" style="s2">more terribly affected than other people</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.620" end="01:01:01.040" style="s2">I&#39;m perfectly aware of that but the</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.660" end="01:01:03.380" style="s2">question is what do you do about that</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.040" end="01:01:05.540" style="s2">and what you do is you you set yourself</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.380" end="01:01:08.180" style="s2">up on your damn crutches and you</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.540" end="01:01:09.830" style="s2">struggle up the bloody hill that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.180" end="01:01:12.350" style="s2">you do and you struggle up the hill</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.830" end="01:01:14.510" style="s2">towards the kingdom of God that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.350" end="01:01:17.090" style="s2">you do because the alternative is to</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.510" end="01:01:19.490" style="s2">descend into the abyss that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.090" end="01:01:21.230" style="s2">alternative and then so to say well do</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.490" end="01:01:23.450" style="s2">you believe it&#39;s like I believe that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.230" end="01:01:26.720" style="s2">should struggle uphill towards the City</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.450" end="01:01:29.150" style="s2">of God on your crutches that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.720" end="01:01:32.240" style="s2">should do that&#39;s the opposite of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.150" end="01:01:34.610" style="s2">descent into the abyss and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.240" end="01:01:38.060" style="s2">that&#39;s at the foundation of our</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.610" end="01:01:40.190" style="s2">civilization that idea well argue with</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.060" end="01:01:42.410" style="s2">it if you will see if you can figure out</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.190" end="01:01:44.060" style="s2">why that&#39;s not an acceptable idea maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.410" end="01:01:46.130" style="s2">you should help someone struggle up the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.060" end="01:01:47.450" style="s2">hill perhaps you should you know you can</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.130" end="01:01:49.040" style="s2">lend a hand to someone although you</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.450" end="01:01:51.350" style="s2">don&#39;t want to take the burden away from</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.040" end="01:01:53.420" style="s2">them entirely because there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.350" end="01:01:55.340" style="s2">noble about struggling up the damn Hill</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.420" end="01:01:58.340" style="s2">right there&#39;s something that&#39;s adventure</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.340" end="01:02:00.440" style="s2">that&#39;s the call to proper being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.340" end="01:02:03.500" style="s2">like well we don&#39;t need to forget this</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.440" end="01:02:05.390" style="s2">you know we don&#39;t need to forget it the</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.500" end="01:02:08.270" style="s2">universities have been there since time</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.390" end="01:02:10.100" style="s2">immemorial to try to push that idea</p>

<p begin="01:03:03.339" end="01:03:07.390" style="s2">obvious the connection between their</p>

<p begin="01:03:15.009" end="01:03:19.150" style="s2">political agenda I mean I see that the</p>

<p begin="01:03:20.680" end="01:03:25.900" style="s2">but at the same time I see a shocking</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.130" end="01:03:27.430" style="s2">similarity in the way that they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:04:17.469" end="01:04:23.349" style="s2">hate speech right like let&#39;s not be</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.739" end="01:04:25.239" style="s2">naive about this and you can use words</p>

<p begin="01:05:23.230" end="01:05:27.880" style="s2">offend them all right what if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.480" end="01:05:29.829" style="s2">talking to ten people do I have the</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.880" end="01:05:31.480" style="s2">right to offend one of those people when</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.829" end="01:05:33.630" style="s2">I speak to them what if it&#39;s a thousand</p>

<p begin="01:05:49.270" end="01:05:54.700" style="s2">without offense like if I&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.480" end="01:05:57.490" style="s2">about something serious like I offend</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.700" end="01:05:59.350" style="s2">myself you know and I&#39;d seriously mean</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.490" end="01:06:01.630" style="s2">that I really mean that so like if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.350" end="01:06:04.180" style="s2">laying out a set of hypotheses for</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.630" end="01:06:04.990" style="s2">example about a complex social social</p>

<p begin="01:06:04.990" end="01:06:09.369" style="s2">I might lay out 20 hypothesis and maybe</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.450" end="01:06:11.950" style="s2">two of them I think God I hope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.369" end="01:06:13.960" style="s2">not true but like maybe it is true you</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.950" end="01:06:15.880" style="s2">know sometimes you discover things as a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.960" end="01:06:17.500" style="s2">social scientist that you wish were true</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.880" end="01:06:19.270" style="s2">and those are usually the things that</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.500" end="01:06:20.500" style="s2">you&#39;ve discovered that are actually true</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.270" end="01:06:23.740" style="s2">right because they violate your</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.500" end="01:06:26.590" style="s2">assumptions so you can&#39;t even think if</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.740" end="01:06:28.810" style="s2">you&#39;re not willing to offend yourself</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.590" end="01:06:31.960" style="s2">that&#39;s what thinking does if you&#39;re ever</p>

<p begin="01:06:34.390" end="01:06:38.470" style="s2">people that&#39;s kind of how that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.190" end="01:06:40.180" style="s2">like the definition of seriousness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.470" end="01:06:43.060" style="s2">like well we can only talk about things</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.180" end="01:06:46.900" style="s2">that no one ever gets upset about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.060" end="01:06:49.330" style="s2">like well then it&#39;s like you&#39;re trapped</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.900" end="01:06:51.780" style="s2">in an elevator for for the rest of</p>
<p begin="01:06:49.330" end="01:06:54.940" style="s2">infinity listening to nothing but music</p>

<p begin="01:07:04.180" end="01:07:08.800" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna shatter them at times it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.340" end="01:07:10.720" style="s2">gonna be brutal absolutely brutal and</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.800" end="01:07:12.100" style="s2">you all know that because every single</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.720" end="01:07:13.869" style="s2">one of you has had a serious</p>

<p begin="01:07:13.869" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">and the probability that that was an</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.060" end="01:07:20.650" style="s2">easy conversation and that either of you</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:22.960" style="s2">escaped without offense and terror is</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.650" end="01:07:28.930" style="s2">zero if you haven&#39;t had a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.960" end="01:07:32.170" style="s2">like that well well you&#39;re not human</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.930" end="01:07:33.730" style="s2">right I mean right because everyone has</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.170" end="01:07:36.310" style="s2">conversations like that all the time</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.730" end="01:07:38.590" style="s2">except when they run from them which is</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.310" end="01:07:42.040" style="s2">most of the time and no bloody wonder</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.590" end="01:07:43.540" style="s2">you know real conversations are there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.040" end="01:07:45.970" style="s2">nothing worse than a real conversation</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.540" end="01:07:47.830" style="s2">except the war that you have if you</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.970" end="01:07:49.300" style="s2">don&#39;t have the conversation that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.830" end="01:07:52.080" style="s2">basically how it goes</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.300" end="01:07:52.080" style="s2">I just want to underline</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.810" end="01:08:03.000" style="s2">I just want to underline Jordans first</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.680" end="01:08:06.630" style="s2">point which is really that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.000" end="01:08:10.140" style="s2">dangerous thing any legal rule that</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.630" end="01:08:12.600" style="s2">relies on some kind of reasonableness</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.140" end="01:08:13.530" style="s2">because reasonableness lies in the eyes</p>

<p begin="01:08:13.530" end="01:08:20.310" style="s2">I mean those people out there think that</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.220" end="01:08:22.500" style="s2">you guys are uttering hate speech they</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.310" end="01:08:24.750" style="s2">think that you guys should be the one</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.500" end="01:08:27.450" style="s2">who are arrested and just imagine if</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.750" end="01:08:30.900" style="s2">they were the ones who had the reins of</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.450" end="01:08:33.180" style="s2">government power just all very well but</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.900" end="01:08:35.160" style="s2">think of hate speech is a reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.180" end="01:08:37.560" style="s2">idea but as soon as you give up the</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.160" end="01:08:41.930" style="s2">control about what that means you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.560" end="01:08:45.810" style="s2">liable to run into a real trouble next</p>

<p begin="01:09:03.780" end="01:09:09.630" style="s2">my question is in the face of when we</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.540" end="01:09:11.370" style="s2">have a social situation so divisive when</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.630" end="01:09:13.020" style="s2">you genuinely believe what you&#39;re doing</p>

<p begin="01:09:22.560" end="01:09:26.520" style="s2">you think&#39;s the best way to try and talk</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.480" end="01:09:28.710" style="s2">some sense into those folks outside and</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.520" end="01:09:31.530" style="s2">the one-on-one setting so the first</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.710" end="01:09:33.720" style="s2">thing is is I don&#39;t necessarily did I I</p>

<p begin="01:09:33.720" end="01:09:37.680" style="s2">doing is the right thing because you</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.030" end="01:09:39.510" style="s2">know you have to be careful when you</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.680" end="01:09:41.670" style="s2">make a claim like that but I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.510" end="01:09:44.580" style="s2">you one thing I&#39;m not going to let</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.670" end="01:09:46.460" style="s2">anyone stand in the way of me trying to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.580" end="01:09:49.060" style="s2">figure out what the right thing is</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.460" end="01:09:55.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.060" end="01:09:59.070" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.610" end="01:10:01.469" style="s2">and then I would say we&#39;re doing exactly</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.070" end="01:10:03.989" style="s2">what we should be doing right now in</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.469" end="01:10:08.670" style="s2">this discussion it&#39;s it&#39;s just exactly</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.989" end="01:10:10.650" style="s2">right right I mean admittedly we have to</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.670" end="01:10:13.020" style="s2">talk over the noise but that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.650" end="01:10:15.270" style="s2">not that big a catastrophe and everybody</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.020" end="01:10:17.010" style="s2">in here is comporting themselves in a</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.270" end="01:10:19.020" style="s2">reasonable manner and we&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.010" end="01:10:21.330" style="s2">struggle our way through the topics and</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.020" end="01:10:22.920" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re asking questions and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.330" end="01:10:25.110" style="s2">trying to have a genuine dialogue about</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.920" end="01:10:29.219" style="s2">them and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.110" end="01:10:30.590" style="s2">that we&#39;ve got three things we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.219" end="01:10:34.199" style="s2">negotiation</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.590" end="01:10:37.440" style="s2">we&#39;ve got slavery and we&#39;ve got tyranny</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.199" end="01:10:39.449" style="s2">and those are your choices and so this</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.440" end="01:10:41.489" style="s2">is negotiation right that&#39;s public</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.449" end="01:10:43.620" style="s2">discourse and the reason that freedom of</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.489" end="01:10:45.030" style="s2">speech thought is obviously important</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.620" end="01:10:46.409" style="s2">everyone can understand that you might</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.030" end="01:10:48.570" style="s2">say well you don&#39;t need to speak freely</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.409" end="01:10:50.489" style="s2">because you can think who&#39;s going to get</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.570" end="01:10:52.320" style="s2">inside your head but the problem with</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.489" end="01:10:54.630" style="s2">that is that that&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.320" end="01:10:56.670" style="s2">you can&#39;t think very well because there</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.630" end="01:10:58.770" style="s2">you are in your little world you know</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.670" end="01:11:00.659" style="s2">with all your biases and your ignorance</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.770" end="01:11:02.400" style="s2">you&#39;re wrong about so many things and</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.659" end="01:11:05.460" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna learn it really painfully</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.400" end="01:11:07.199" style="s2">and and then maybe you can trot out some</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.460" end="01:11:08.909" style="s2">of the things you think erroneously and</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.199" end="01:11:10.230" style="s2">ignorantly and other people will give</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.909" end="01:11:11.699" style="s2">you a tap on the side of the head</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.230" end="01:11:13.440" style="s2">instead of running you over with a</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.699" end="01:11:14.850" style="s2">freight train right they&#39;ll give you a</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.440" end="01:11:16.380" style="s2">little tap on the side of the head and</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.850" end="01:11:18.449" style="s2">maybe you&#39;ll walk away a little smarter</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.380" end="01:11:20.610" style="s2">and that&#39;s why freedom of speech is so</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.449" end="01:11:22.469" style="s2">important is because a lot of thinking</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.610" end="01:11:24.929" style="s2">especially about things that are beyond</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.469" end="01:11:27.150" style="s2">you for whatever reason have to take</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.929" end="01:11:29.670" style="s2">place publicly as we stumble around</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.150" end="01:11:32.489" style="s2">towards an adequate formulation of the</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.670" end="01:11:35.610" style="s2">problems that beset us so I would say</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.489" end="01:11:38.100" style="s2">well in this book I wrote I have a rule</p>
<p begin="01:11:35.610" end="01:11:41.070" style="s2">it&#39;s I think it&#39;s rule eight which is</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.100" end="01:11:43.640" style="s2">tell the truth or at least don&#39;t lie I</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.070" end="01:11:46.409" style="s2">would say well that&#39;s another reasonable</p>
<p begin="01:11:43.640" end="01:11:48.420" style="s2">reasonable way to start approaching the</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.409" end="01:11:50.130" style="s2">situation is it&#39;s not so easy to tell</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.420" end="01:11:52.350" style="s2">the truth because like what do you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.130" end="01:11:54.330" style="s2">you know you can&#39;t come out and say well</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.350" end="01:11:56.460" style="s2">here&#39;s the truth but I know what one</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.330" end="01:11:58.620" style="s2">thing you can do which is when you know</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.460" end="01:12:01.830" style="s2">that what you&#39;re saying is a lie by your</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.620" end="01:12:03.570" style="s2">own standards you cannot say it and you</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.830" end="01:12:06.030" style="s2">can have a consultation with yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.570" end="01:12:07.110" style="s2">and you can try to learn to say those</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.030" end="01:12:09.120" style="s2">things that make you</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.110" end="01:12:11.280" style="s2">strong instead of saying those things</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.120" end="01:12:13.650" style="s2">that make you weak and you you</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.280" end="01:12:16.380" style="s2">contribute to the health of the public</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.650" end="01:12:18.720" style="s2">dialogue in incalculable manner that way</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.380" end="01:12:20.490" style="s2">and this is another issue that pertains</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.720" end="01:12:22.680" style="s2">to the dignity and importance of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.490" end="01:12:24.570" style="s2">individual how you conduct yourself in</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.680" end="01:12:27.450" style="s2">your life is way more important than you</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.570" end="01:12:29.910" style="s2">think and I mean I think that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.450" end="01:12:31.410" style="s2">daunting idea because you know let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.910" end="01:12:33.300" style="s2">you&#39;re nihilistic and life is</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.410" end="01:12:35.610" style="s2">meaningless well what&#39;s the payoff for</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.300" end="01:12:37.020" style="s2">that I think well there&#39;s no payoff it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.610" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">like well yeah there is you have no</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.020" end="01:12:40.920" style="s2">responsibility that&#39;s a pretty decent</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:42.780" style="s2">payoff I mean you have to pay the price</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.920" end="01:12:44.760" style="s2">of meaninglessness but it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.780" end="01:12:48.390" style="s2">what you do well we&#39;ll flip that over</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.760" end="01:12:49.980" style="s2">and say no no sorry you&#39;re wrong your</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.390" end="01:12:52.020" style="s2">life is meaningful it&#39;s way more</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.980" end="01:12:53.880" style="s2">meaningful than you think but you have</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.020" end="01:12:56.130" style="s2">to bear a responsibility for your</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.880" end="01:12:57.600" style="s2">thoughts and your actions it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.130" end="01:12:59.700" style="s2">you&#39;ll there&#39;ll be plenty of meaning in</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.600" end="01:13:02.250" style="s2">that well that if you understand that</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.700" end="01:13:04.740" style="s2">property that will that will sleeve you</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.250" end="01:13:06.360" style="s2">to the depths of your soul and maybe you</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.740" end="01:13:07.920" style="s2">learn to speak carefully and to act</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.360" end="01:13:10.230" style="s2">carefully and that will have a</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.920" end="01:13:12.960" style="s2">beneficial effect on everyone around you</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.230" end="01:13:15.030" style="s2">if far more you&#39;re far more powerful in</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.960" end="01:13:16.860" style="s2">the place you stand in the place you sit</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.030" end="01:13:18.660" style="s2">and stand than you think and I think</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.860" end="01:13:20.550" style="s2">everyone has an intimation of that and</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.660" end="01:13:23.280" style="s2">if you don&#39;t think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.550" end="01:13:26.040" style="s2">then try treating people around you as</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.280" end="01:13:27.780" style="s2">if it&#39;s not true try treating people</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.040" end="01:13:28.440" style="s2">that you know in your life as if they</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.780" end="01:13:30.660" style="s2">don&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.440" end="01:13:33.060" style="s2">and just see what kind of response you</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.660" end="01:13:34.650" style="s2">get people are not going to be happy</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.060" end="01:13:36.210" style="s2">with you not in any sense whatsoever</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.650" end="01:13:38.250" style="s2">you&#39;ll you&#39;ll ruin all your</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.210" end="01:13:40.320" style="s2">relationships you have to treat people</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.250" end="01:13:41.790" style="s2">as if they matter and maybe you have to</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.320" end="01:13:45.000" style="s2">treat them as if they matter because</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.790" end="01:13:48.030" style="s2">maybe they do and that goes for you too</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.000" end="01:13:50.490" style="s2">and so if you matter then you should act</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.030" end="01:13:53.640" style="s2">like you matter and that&#39;s a very that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.490" end="01:13:58.430" style="s2">a very daunting proposition that&#39;s for</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.640" end="01:13:58.430" style="s2">sure and as a as a</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.180" end="01:14:08.890" style="s2">it&#39;s just a footnote to that let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.040" end="01:14:13.510" style="s2">observe this in legal terms there are</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.890" end="01:14:16.450" style="s2">only two categories of actions voluntary</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.510" end="01:14:17.310" style="s2">and involuntary don&#39;t let anybody tell</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.450" end="01:14:19.870" style="s2">you otherwise</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.310" end="01:14:22.660" style="s2">either you&#39;re choosing on your own and</p>
<p begin="01:14:19.870" end="01:14:23.920" style="s2">and handling the consequences or the</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.660" end="01:14:35.350" style="s2">government is telling you what to do</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.920" end="01:14:36.100" style="s2">those are the only two possibilities at</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.350" end="01:14:40.750" style="s2">the back go ahead</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.100" end="01:14:42.850" style="s2">Oh doc Oh dr. Peterson I would like to</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.750" end="01:14:45.640" style="s2">recall the part in your conversation in</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.850" end="01:14:49.710" style="s2">which you mentioned how the radical left</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.640" end="01:14:51.970" style="s2">switched from the 1960s and 70s to being</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.710" end="01:14:58.210" style="s2">back when they were a pro free speech</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.970" end="01:15:00.910" style="s2">and their recent opposition to it I know</p>
<p begin="01:14:58.210" end="01:15:03.720" style="s2">I know that you often mention their</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.910" end="01:15:07.120" style="s2">obsession with power at least among them</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.720" end="01:15:10.120" style="s2">yes at least among their more Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.120" end="01:15:12.880" style="s2">types I was one wondering if perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.120" end="01:15:14.380" style="s2">they think that now you know that now is</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.880" end="01:15:16.150" style="s2">the opportunity where they can</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.380" end="01:15:19.480" style="s2">consolidate their power and if they do</p>

<p begin="01:15:41.170" end="01:15:47.560" style="s2">understand the strategy of an ideology</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.140" end="01:15:50.380" style="s2">you know because all the people who were</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.560" end="01:15:53.440" style="s2">outside were were united in some sense</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.380" end="01:15:56.590" style="s2">under the umbrella of an idea and an</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.440" end="01:15:58.990" style="s2">idea as a living thing I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.590" end="01:16:01.000" style="s2">embedded in living tissue and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:17:34.780" end="01:17:39.490" style="s2">first question might be are the people</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.240" end="01:17:42.400" style="s2">who wish to tear it down builders or are</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.490" end="01:17:44.140" style="s2">they just destroyers and my strong</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.400" end="01:17:47.410" style="s2">sentiment is that they&#39;re primarily</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.140" end="01:17:50.380" style="s2">destroyers and then you might say well</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.410" end="01:17:52.000" style="s2">why do people wish to destroy well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.380" end="01:17:52.660" style="s2">because they&#39;re hurt by life and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.000" end="01:17:57.430" style="s2">resentful</p>
<p begin="01:17:52.660" end="01:18:00.060" style="s2">and resentful people become vengeful and</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.430" end="01:18:02.620" style="s2">vengeful people become dangerous and</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.060" end="01:18:05.860" style="s2">there&#39;s no shortage of motivation to</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.620" end="01:18:08.740" style="s2">make things worse now the school</p>

<p begin="01:18:12.070" end="01:18:18.210" style="s2">in the rhetoric is this appeal to an</p>
<p begin="01:18:13.720" end="01:18:21.910" style="s2">egalitarian utopia but we&#39;ve tried</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.210" end="01:18:23.920" style="s2">egalitarian utopias already we</p>

<p begin="01:18:26.500" end="01:18:31.630" style="s2">to produce one and so my sense is the</p>
<p begin="01:18:29.710" end="01:18:37.090" style="s2">corpses stacked up high enough to</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.630" end="01:18:39.250" style="s2">constitute proof so its destruction</p>
<p begin="01:18:37.090" end="01:18:43.230" style="s2">mostly that motivates it as far as I can</p>

<p begin="01:18:52.489" end="01:18:56.700" style="s2">thank you for that question</p>

<p begin="01:18:57.930" end="01:19:05.120" style="s2">today when political scientists would</p>

<p begin="01:19:05.270" end="01:19:09.540" style="s2">totalitarian regimes I&#39;ve studied I</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.989" end="01:19:11.220" style="s2">tried to look at the Iranian Revolution</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.540" end="01:19:13.590" style="s2">and the Islamic Republic in Iran and</p>
<p begin="01:19:11.220" end="01:19:15.480" style="s2">I&#39;ve argued how the Shia Islam that is</p>
<p begin="01:19:13.590" end="01:19:17.970" style="s2">teach in the Islamic Republic is very</p>
<p begin="01:19:15.480" end="01:19:19.890" style="s2">close to a totalitarian regime but now I</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.970" end="01:19:22.200" style="s2">live in a country where my ideas are</p>
<p begin="01:19:19.890" end="01:19:24.690" style="s2">considered controversial if you believe</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.200" end="01:19:26.280" style="s2">in God if you believe in family if you</p>
<p begin="01:19:24.690" end="01:19:27.270" style="s2">believe in having responsibility and</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.280" end="01:19:29.430" style="s2">traditional values</p>
<p begin="01:19:27.270" end="01:19:31.440" style="s2">I feel ostracized by the community here</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.430" end="01:19:33.150" style="s2">I came from UFC University of Calgary</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.440" end="01:19:34.590" style="s2">over there I didn&#39;t feel this way there</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.150" end="01:19:37.140" style="s2">was more welcoming here I feel</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.590" end="01:19:39.390" style="s2">marginalized and I do feel alone and</p>
<p begin="01:19:37.140" end="01:19:41.250" style="s2">when I see this it disgusts me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.390" end="01:19:43.050" style="s2">here they can do this but I couldn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.250" end="01:19:44.460" style="s2">to their events and do anything I&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.050" end="01:19:46.260" style="s2">to shut up there be a disciplinary</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.460" end="01:19:48.270" style="s2">committee for me but for them they can</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.260" end="01:19:50.070" style="s2">break windows to God knows how old this</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.270" end="01:19:52.590" style="s2">building is and it&#39;s okay for them to do</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.070" end="01:19:55.140" style="s2">that so my question to you is now being</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.590" end="01:19:56.970" style="s2">here experiencing this I&#39;m turning to</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.140" end="01:19:59.430" style="s2">second guess it may be the totalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.970" end="01:20:01.800" style="s2">Islamic regime that I was so you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:59.430" end="01:20:03.750" style="s2">talking about uncritical of back in Iran</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.800" end="01:20:05.130" style="s2">isn&#39;t so bad when I have a choice</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.750" end="01:20:07.530" style="s2">between having to be here and be</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.130" end="01:20:10.020" style="s2">oppressed and be there and at least have</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.530" end="01:20:13.200" style="s2">my ideas be okay with the regime so my</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.020" end="01:20:14.730" style="s2">argument is if this free speech and the</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.200" end="01:20:17.040" style="s2">arguments you guys are making here</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.730" end="01:20:18.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work would that not be the next</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.040" end="01:20:19.560" style="s2">step for people to go towards</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.510" end="01:20:21.780" style="s2">totalitarianism</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.560" end="01:20:22.860" style="s2">if dialogue fails and isn&#39;t force of</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.780" end="01:20:24.780" style="s2">arms the only thing left</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.860" end="01:20:26.160" style="s2">how can people compromise when they</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.780" end="01:20:29.520" style="s2">don&#39;t want to talk when they want to</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.160" end="01:20:35.020" style="s2">yell thank you</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.520" end="01:20:35.020" style="s2">[Applause]</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.310" end="01:20:41.340" style="s2">I think you make a very good point I I</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.330" end="01:20:46.710" style="s2">don&#39;t think we should pool ourselves</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.340" end="01:20:51.030" style="s2">this is about force and it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.710" end="01:20:54.120" style="s2">almost a dare to suggest that that</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.030" end="01:20:56.730" style="s2">certain elements are not allowed to</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.120" end="01:20:59.790" style="s2">enforce their view of the world and that</p>
<p begin="01:20:56.730" end="01:21:01.320" style="s2">speaking contrary to it isn&#39;t an affront</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.790" end="01:21:03.390" style="s2">to those values and they won&#39;t shut you</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.320" end="01:21:06.600" style="s2">down I mean that that is what is at</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.390" end="01:21:10.260" style="s2">stake we we are we are we are no longer</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.600" end="01:21:13.530" style="s2">really in a situation where this will</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.260" end="01:21:17.790" style="s2">all be resolved through sort of gentle</p>
<p begin="01:21:13.530" end="01:21:19.650" style="s2">reasonable civil dialogue that that</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.790" end="01:21:21.330" style="s2">happens on the side but it&#39;s not real</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.650" end="01:21:23.700" style="s2">anymore it&#39;s not really where the fight</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.330" end="01:21:27.180" style="s2">is happening this is an imposition of</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.700" end="01:21:28.950" style="s2">the force of the state and it is skewed</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.180" end="01:21:30.300" style="s2">it is skewed a certain way and we are</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.950" end="01:21:33.210" style="s2">getting to the point where a certain</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.300" end="01:21:35.670" style="s2">kind of language the curtain certain</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.210" end="01:21:38.040" style="s2">kind of dialogue is is approved and all</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.670" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">right and a certain kind is not and that</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.040" end="01:21:43.350" style="s2">is the campaign that is going on that</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:46.230" style="s2">this is all part of and I have to say</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.350" end="01:21:48.450" style="s2">that that your presence here and and</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.230" end="01:21:51.750" style="s2">your endorsement that this kind of event</p>
<p begin="01:21:48.450" end="01:21:55.140" style="s2">is the kind of thing that has the major</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.750" end="01:21:57.390" style="s2">push back to that trend but the trend is</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.140" end="01:22:02.070" style="s2">continuing it is a very dangerous one</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.390" end="01:22:04.590" style="s2">and these this is a difficult moment in</p>
<p begin="01:22:02.070" end="01:22:08.700" style="s2">the life of this country would you would</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.590" end="01:22:10.890" style="s2">you say Jordan so so some some comments</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.700" end="01:22:12.420" style="s2">about about your career let&#39;s say okay</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.890" end="01:22:14.520" style="s2">so you&#39;re a young mount and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.420" end="01:22:16.230" style="s2">lots of years ahead of you so you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.520" end="01:22:18.840" style="s2">you want to prepare for the war and not</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.230" end="01:22:20.580" style="s2">for the battle right okay because</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.840" end="01:22:22.620" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be many battles for you</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.580" end="01:22:23.910" style="s2">personally and perhaps politically and</p>
<p begin="01:22:22.620" end="01:22:25.890" style="s2">all of that and so you want to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.910" end="01:22:27.570" style="s2">yourself as articulate and educated as</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.890" end="01:22:29.610" style="s2">you can and you want to have patience I</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.570" end="01:22:32.520" style="s2">would say that there&#39;s no cause for</p>

<p begin="01:22:42.870" end="01:22:46.980" style="s2">think that there&#39;s no reason to assume</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.790" end="01:22:48.750" style="s2">that we can&#39;t push the devil back into</p>

<p begin="01:29:43.620" end="01:29:50.010" style="s2">into a question but I guess with the</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.640" end="01:29:54.210" style="s2">idea of archetypes in mind are you</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.010" end="01:29:58.410" style="s2">familiar with benoît mandelbrot idea of</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.210" end="01:30:00.450" style="s2">fractal patterns and if so what do you</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.410" end="01:30:04.080" style="s2">think and if is there a connection there</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.450" end="01:30:07.680" style="s2">may be to be found well there seems to</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.080" end="01:30:11.010" style="s2">be a metaphorical connection in that the</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.680" end="01:30:13.860" style="s2">the the great is is reproduced in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:11.010" end="01:30:16.620" style="s2">small and that&#39;s certainly an idea that</p>
<p begin="01:30:13.860" end="01:30:19.290" style="s2">permeates let&#39;s say religious and</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.620" end="01:30:23.370" style="s2">Theological speculation you know there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.290" end="01:30:26.070" style="s2">an idea that here&#39;s an idea that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.370" end="01:30:30.090" style="s2">like the idea of the genie which is the</p>
<p begin="01:30:26.070" end="01:30:32.460" style="s2">reap same root word as genius you know</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.090" end="01:30:34.560" style="s2">the genie is something of unimaginable</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.460" end="01:30:36.870" style="s2">power that&#39;s constrained in a very small</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.560" end="01:30:40.850" style="s2">space and that&#39;s kind of what a person</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.870" end="01:30:43.560" style="s2">is like you know we have this affinity</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.850" end="01:30:45.660" style="s2">we have this connection to the infinite</p>
<p begin="01:30:43.560" end="01:30:48.090" style="s2">we have this connection to the divine</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.660" end="01:30:51.390" style="s2">but work but it&#39;s constrained within</p>
<p begin="01:30:48.090" end="01:30:54.570" style="s2">within our frames right and we have to</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.390" end="01:30:56.940" style="s2">act out the divine narrative in the</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.570" end="01:30:58.869" style="s2">confines of our own life and so there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.940" end="01:31:01.979" style="s2">this overarching reality which is</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.869" end="01:31:04.119" style="s2">something like the for the forthright</p>
<p begin="01:31:01.979" end="01:31:06.760" style="s2">confrontation with the catastrophe of</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.119" end="01:31:08.739" style="s2">life right and but that has to be made</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.760" end="01:31:10.869" style="s2">personal you know so that that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.739" end="01:31:13.269" style="s2">you I would say deepest ideas is that</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.869" end="01:31:15.010" style="s2">the archetypal has to be made personal</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.269" end="01:31:17.979" style="s2">in your own life and so you take the</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.010" end="01:31:19.749" style="s2">generic pattern and you personalize it</p>
<p begin="01:31:17.979" end="01:31:21.550" style="s2">and then the infinite and the finite</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.749" end="01:31:23.909" style="s2">meet and that&#39;s the perfect combination</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.550" end="01:31:26.829" style="s2">and there&#39;s something about that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:31:23.909" end="01:31:30.099" style="s2">well uh not era bleep profound I would</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.829" end="01:31:30.699" style="s2">say and and and and as true as anything</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.099" end="01:31:33.129" style="s2">can be</p>
<p begin="01:31:30.699" end="01:31:36.039" style="s2">and I think people know this at a very</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.129" end="01:31:37.329" style="s2">deep level because you do know when</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.039" end="01:31:38.439" style="s2">you&#39;re struggling to go to sleep at</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.329" end="01:31:40.989" style="s2">night and your conscience is bothering</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.439" end="01:31:42.159" style="s2">you and you think through the things</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.989" end="01:31:43.749" style="s2">that you did in the day and the week</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.159" end="01:31:46.179" style="s2">you&#39;ll take solace and the things that</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.749" end="01:31:48.219" style="s2">you did that we&#39;re noble and true and</p>
<p begin="01:31:46.179" end="01:31:49.959" style="s2">you and you can you can breathe a sigh</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.219" end="01:31:52.590" style="s2">of relief that you&#39;re not completely</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.959" end="01:31:55.599" style="s2">corrupt and lost and then you can sleep</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.590" end="01:31:57.459" style="s2">it&#39;s like everyone knows this well we</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.599" end="01:31:59.530" style="s2">need to know it consciously right and</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.459" end="01:32:01.959" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the process of making the</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.530" end="01:32:03.909" style="s2">archetypal personal and that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="01:32:01.959" end="01:32:06.399" style="s2">what the religious process is supposed</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.909" end="01:32:08.349" style="s2">to be about is to outline the the</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.399" end="01:32:09.879" style="s2">archetypal pattern and then to say look</p>
<p begin="01:32:08.349" end="01:32:11.769" style="s2">you have to meditate on this and you</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.879" end="01:32:13.739" style="s2">have to figure out how to make it true</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.769" end="01:32:16.629" style="s2">in the confines of your own life and</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.739" end="01:32:18.760" style="s2">that gives see the reason that works I</p>
<p begin="01:32:16.629" end="01:32:20.769" style="s2">think is because there&#39;s no doubt that</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.760" end="01:32:22.809" style="s2">your life is tragic and and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:32:20.769" end="01:32:24.280" style="s2">doubt that you have a malevolent element</p>
<p begin="01:32:22.809" end="01:32:26.739" style="s2">and that you&#39;ll be touched by betrayal</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.280" end="01:32:28.329" style="s2">and all those terrible things but</p>
<p begin="01:32:26.739" end="01:32:30.369" style="s2">there&#39;s a nobility about you too and</p>
<p begin="01:32:28.329" end="01:32:33.039" style="s2">that nobility might be sufficient to</p>
<p begin="01:32:30.369" end="01:32:34.659" style="s2">transcend your limitations and I would</p>
<p begin="01:32:33.039" end="01:32:36.610" style="s2">say that your life is a struggle to</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.659" end="01:32:39.399" style="s2">determine if that might be the case and</p>
<p begin="01:32:36.610" end="01:32:41.320" style="s2">that&#39;s the act of faith but and I also</p>
<p begin="01:32:39.399" end="01:32:43.929" style="s2">do believe I was asked today by South</p>
<p begin="01:32:41.320" end="01:32:45.969" style="s2">African journalists if I&#39;m the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.929" end="01:32:47.800" style="s2">pessimist or the ultimate optimist</p>
<p begin="01:32:45.969" end="01:32:50.379" style="s2">you know and I would say in some ways I</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.800" end="01:32:52.869" style="s2">am the ultimate pessimist I know I think</p>
<p begin="01:32:50.379" end="01:32:55.749" style="s2">as much as I can tolerate how terrible</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.869" end="01:32:57.340" style="s2">life can be but I do believe that the</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.749" end="01:33:01.719" style="s2">human spirit can overcome that</p>
<p begin="01:32:57.340" end="01:33:05.409" style="s2">catastrophe and can rise out of it and I</p>
<p begin="01:33:01.719" end="01:33:08.590" style="s2">think the universities are that that</p>
<p begin="01:33:05.409" end="01:33:11.169" style="s2">idea expressed in stone and tradition</p>
<p begin="01:33:08.590" end="01:33:12.170" style="s2">that&#39;s a great idea everyone needs the</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.169" end="01:33:13.640" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="01:33:12.170" end="01:33:15.500" style="s2">especially people who are young you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.640" end="01:33:18.199" style="s2">your life is you know that your life is</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.500" end="01:33:20.000" style="s2">going to be difficult it&#39;s like no one</p>
<p begin="01:33:18.199" end="01:33:21.469" style="s2">can say well it&#39;s going to be easy but</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.000" end="01:33:24.699" style="s2">you might say well do you want it to be</p>
<p begin="01:33:21.469" end="01:33:27.560" style="s2">easy what&#39;s in it for you if it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:33:24.699" end="01:33:29.719" style="s2">well no you want it to be difficult and</p>
<p begin="01:33:27.560" end="01:33:31.670" style="s2">worthwhile and you want to be the sort</p>
<p begin="01:33:29.719" end="01:33:33.770" style="s2">of person that can manage that and</p>
<p begin="01:33:31.670" end="01:33:35.480" style="s2">that&#39;s what you should be that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:33:33.770" end="01:33:38.270" style="s2">you should be encouraged to be at</p>
<p begin="01:33:35.480" end="01:33:42.830" style="s2">University and and that&#39;s what the</p>
<p begin="01:33:38.270" end="01:33:44.600" style="s2">universities are for so well that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.830" end="01:33:54.620" style="s2">archetypal and the personal I would say</p>
<p begin="01:33:44.600" end="01:33:56.270" style="s2">yeah thank you very much this will have</p>
<p begin="01:33:54.620" end="01:34:00.320" style="s2">to be our last question go ahead sir</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.270" end="01:34:02.330" style="s2">in recent time I would probably identify</p>
<p begin="01:34:00.320" end="01:34:04.699" style="s2">the most recent u.s. election is the</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.330" end="01:34:06.290" style="s2">turning point for this and that&#39;s I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:34:04.699" end="01:34:07.910" style="s2">seen that as an American citizen this is</p>
<p begin="01:34:06.290" end="01:34:10.100" style="s2">my first time living in Canada</p>
<p begin="01:34:07.910" end="01:34:13.489" style="s2">I&#39;ve noticed that public discourse has</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.100" end="01:34:15.860" style="s2">taken to elevate fascism as the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:34:13.489" end="01:34:17.390" style="s2">evil and maybe rightfully so you know</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.860" end="01:34:18.830" style="s2">there are many horrific things committed</p>
<p begin="01:34:17.390" end="01:34:21.110" style="s2">by fascist States in the 20th century</p>
<p begin="01:34:18.830" end="01:34:23.270" style="s2">and you see people you know like</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.110" end="01:34:25.310" style="s2">Facebook cover photos like bash the fash</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.270" end="01:34:26.690" style="s2">you see let stickers on laptops this</p>

<p begin="01:34:26.690" end="01:34:30.890" style="s2">it is you know there&#39;s this big like</p>
<p begin="01:34:28.640" end="01:34:33.350" style="s2">backlash against fascism and the horrors</p>
<p begin="01:34:30.890" end="01:34:36.170" style="s2">that it caused but in spite of that you</p>
<p begin="01:34:33.350" end="01:34:37.940" style="s2">don&#39;t see the same reaction to the</p>
<p begin="01:34:36.170" end="01:34:40.790" style="s2">horrors and the genocide that were</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.940" end="01:34:45.040" style="s2">caused by socialist and communist states</p>

<p begin="01:34:47.739" end="01:34:53.199" style="s2">you see people who virtue signal</p>
<p begin="01:34:50.800" end="01:34:55.059" style="s2">endlessly about how horrible the</p>
<p begin="01:34:53.199" end="01:34:57.460" style="s2">Holocaust was about how awful these</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.059" end="01:34:59.380" style="s2">things were and then just hand-wave away</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.460" end="01:35:00.699" style="s2">the famine genocide of the Ukraine the</p>
<p begin="01:34:59.380" end="01:35:03.489" style="s2">Great Leap Forward they think these</p>
<p begin="01:35:00.699" end="01:35:06.340" style="s2">things are inconsequential or even</p>

<p begin="01:35:08.289" end="01:35:13.329" style="s2">and I personally find that morally</p>
<p begin="01:35:11.590" end="01:35:15.849" style="s2">reprehensible and I can&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="01:35:13.329" end="01:35:17.769" style="s2">where that where that comes in how you</p>
<p begin="01:35:15.849" end="01:35:20.320" style="s2">can stand there and be so opposed to</p>

<p begin="01:35:23.409" end="01:35:27.639" style="s2">problem and why do you think that how do</p>
<p begin="01:35:25.809" end="01:35:30.400" style="s2">you think that disconnect happens how do</p>
<p begin="01:35:27.639" end="01:35:31.630" style="s2">you think people can convince themselves</p>
<p begin="01:35:30.400" end="01:35:36.789" style="s2">of that and why do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:35:31.630" end="01:35:39.639" style="s2">happens it&#39;s a great question you know I</p>
<p begin="01:35:36.789" end="01:35:43.510" style="s2">have my house is covered with with art</p>
<p begin="01:35:39.639" end="01:35:45.639" style="s2">from the Soviet era and I have a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:35:43.510" end="01:35:47.230" style="s2">reasons for that part of it is to remind</p>
<p begin="01:35:45.639" end="01:35:49.269" style="s2">me of what happened part of it is to</p>
<p begin="01:35:47.230" end="01:35:51.190" style="s2">watch the struggle between the art and</p>
<p begin="01:35:49.269" end="01:35:52.539" style="s2">the propaganda on the canvas is sort of</p>
<p begin="01:35:51.190" end="01:35:54.969" style="s2">in real time you know I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:35:52.539" end="01:35:58.449" style="s2">interested in that but I would never</p>
<p begin="01:35:54.969" end="01:36:01.179" style="s2">decorate my house with Nazi regalia you</p>
<p begin="01:35:58.449" end="01:36:03.159" style="s2">know and and you think well why is that</p>
<p begin="01:36:01.179" end="01:36:04.929" style="s2">exactly it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="01:36:03.159" end="01:36:06.969" style="s2">what happened in the communist regimes</p>
<p begin="01:36:04.929" end="01:36:09.070" style="s2">was utterly reprehensible why is it and</p>
<p begin="01:36:06.969" end="01:36:10.780" style="s2">perhaps it&#39;s not acceptable to have you</p>

<p begin="01:36:18.940" end="01:36:25.239" style="s2">and I think you know back in 1918 at the</p>
<p begin="01:36:23.380" end="01:36:27.340" style="s2">dawn of the Russian Revolution when</p>

<p begin="01:36:41.380" end="01:36:46.630" style="s2">and and maybe maybe who knows how much</p>
<p begin="01:36:45.099" end="01:36:49.900" style="s2">of it was motivated by genuine</p>
<p begin="01:36:46.630" end="01:36:52.869" style="s2">benevolence some at least it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:36:49.900" end="01:36:54.900" style="s2">difficult to see that the Nazi the Nazi</p>
<p begin="01:36:52.869" end="01:36:57.039" style="s2">phenomena was ever generated by any</p>
<p begin="01:36:54.900" end="01:37:00.789" style="s2">genuine benevolence that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:36:57.039" end="01:37:01.540" style="s2">difficult to to make a case for so maybe</p>
<p begin="01:37:00.789" end="01:37:03.820" style="s2">you can forgive</p>
<p begin="01:37:01.540" end="01:37:05.590" style="s2">the the Socialists the Communists</p>

<p begin="01:37:10.690" end="01:37:15.640" style="s2">but still and then the other thing too</p>

<p begin="01:37:17.020" end="01:37:20.890" style="s2">problem and it doesn&#39;t go away like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:19.180" end="01:37:22.480" style="s2">very difficult when you walk down Bloor</p>
<p begin="01:37:20.890" end="01:37:24.490" style="s2">Street for example in Toronto and you</p>
<p begin="01:37:22.480" end="01:37:26.200" style="s2">see homeless people alcoholics and drug</p>

<p begin="01:37:29.410" end="01:37:33.070" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s really difficult for that to</p>
<p begin="01:37:31.120" end="01:37:35.050" style="s2">not tear it your heartstrings and say</p>
<p begin="01:37:33.070" end="01:37:37.270" style="s2">well isn&#39;t the world an unjust place or</p>
<p begin="01:37:35.050" end="01:37:40.510" style="s2">an unfair place which it is and so you</p>
<p begin="01:37:37.270" end="01:37:43.120" style="s2">can see the neverending Wellsprings of</p>
<p begin="01:37:40.510" end="01:37:46.330" style="s2">motivation to support the oppressed and</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.120" end="01:37:49.570" style="s2">I think the fact that the the Communists</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.330" end="01:37:53.050" style="s2">the Communist Dogma at least had that as</p>
<p begin="01:37:49.570" end="01:37:55.330" style="s2">part of its initiating ethos is partly</p>
<p begin="01:37:53.050" end="01:37:57.400" style="s2">what seems to make it forgivable I also</p>
<p begin="01:37:55.330" end="01:38:01.090" style="s2">think it&#39;s easier for people to identify</p>
<p begin="01:37:57.400" end="01:38:05.320" style="s2">why fascism is wrong we could say look</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.090" end="01:38:07.240" style="s2">racial superiority no ok it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="01:38:05.320" end="01:38:10.650" style="s2">simple right it&#39;s three words you can</p>
<p begin="01:38:07.240" end="01:38:10.650" style="s2">really get it but</p>
<p begin="01:38:11.990" end="01:38:19.460" style="s2">but but equality of outcome it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:38:16.940" end="01:38:22.160" style="s2">that&#39;s really wrong it&#39;s really wrong</p>
<p begin="01:38:19.460" end="01:38:24.500" style="s2">but it&#39;s not so obvious why right it</p>
<p begin="01:38:22.160" end="01:38:26.600" style="s2">isn&#39;t you can&#39;t just say quality of</p>
<p begin="01:38:24.500" end="01:38:29.300" style="s2">outcome no and have everyone clap</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.600" end="01:38:31.280" style="s2">because it isn&#39;t as well and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.300" end="01:38:34.100" style="s2">thing it&#39;s really difficult to it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.280" end="01:38:35.990" style="s2">difficult to isolate the pathological</p>
<p begin="01:38:34.100" end="01:38:38.000" style="s2">elements in radical left-wing thought</p>
<p begin="01:38:35.990" end="01:38:40.190" style="s2">because they&#39;re not self-evidently</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.000" end="01:38:43.160" style="s2">pathological like there&#39;s this old</p>

<p begin="01:38:47.390" end="01:38:51.290" style="s2">we have needs it&#39;s like let&#39;s have them</p>

<p begin="01:38:51.290" end="01:38:56.900" style="s2">well like manifest it it&#39;s like well it</p>
<p begin="01:38:54.740" end="01:38:58.880" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work in practice in fact its</p>
<p begin="01:38:56.900" end="01:39:00.650" style="s2">murderous in practice and it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="01:38:58.880" end="01:39:02.600" style="s2">catastrophe in some sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.650" end="01:39:04.430" style="s2">murderous in practice so I just think</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.600" end="01:39:06.230" style="s2">it&#39;s maybe part of it is it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.430" end="01:39:08.870" style="s2">hell of a lot harder to learn why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.230" end="01:39:11.030" style="s2">wrong that combined with you know the</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.870" end="01:39:14.570" style="s2">genuine outpouring of compassion for the</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.030" end="01:39:17.390" style="s2">oppressed and and which is like who&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:39:17.390" end="01:39:22.520" style="s2">inequality is a painful reality it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:39:22.520" end="01:39:26.480" style="s2">people who are self-righteous about</p>
<p begin="01:39:23.900" end="01:39:28.820" style="s2">their their status let&#39;s say in in the</p>
<p begin="01:39:26.480" end="01:39:32.030" style="s2">depths of their soul the struggling of</p>

<p begin="01:39:32.030" end="01:39:41.220" style="s2">them and so it&#39;s a more difficult lesson</p>
