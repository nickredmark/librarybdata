<p begin="00:01:18.639" end="00:01:24.039" style="s2">extremely useful for us in the present</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.889" end="00:01:27.670" style="s2">situation in the early 21st century as</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.039" end="00:01:30.189" style="s2">she describes how boom-bust cycles arise</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.670" end="00:01:32.679" style="s2">within financial systems and now these</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.189" end="00:01:34.780" style="s2">boom-bust cycles are related to changes</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.679" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">in economic paradigms now we&#39;ve just</p>

<p begin="00:01:42.939" end="00:01:48.759" style="s2">until late 2008-2009 when there was a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.149" end="00:01:50.590" style="s2">crash in the bubble and part of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.759" end="00:01:53.679" style="s2">bubble disappeared that&#39;s what we call</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.590" end="00:01:56.770" style="s2">the great financial crisis of 2009 or</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.679" end="00:01:59.740" style="s2">the Great Recession and since that time</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.770" end="00:02:02.020" style="s2">there has been a vast and yet subtle</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.740" end="00:02:04.389" style="s2">shift in the organization of our</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.020" end="00:02:06.539" style="s2">economic system moving away from a</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.539" end="00:02:10.380" style="s2">centralized and built around very large</p>

<p begin="00:02:10.380" end="00:02:17.330" style="s2">and moving into a world of distributed</p>

<p begin="00:02:31.200" end="00:02:36.180" style="s2">we really need to know what are the</p>
