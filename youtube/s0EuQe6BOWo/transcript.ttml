<p begin="00:00:05.700" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">things to say to junior high and high</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.130" end="00:00:12.630" style="s2">school students and their parents about</p>

<p begin="00:00:18.090" end="00:00:25.050" style="s2">radical suggestions I would say which I</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.420" end="00:00:26.760" style="s2">am NOT putting forth lightly I think</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.050" end="00:00:29.189" style="s2">that it is time for public school</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.930" end="00:00:48.719" style="s2">and review of recent events is in order</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.649" end="00:00:51.390" style="s2">so please bear with me while I walk</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.719" end="00:00:54.800" style="s2">through that process it&#39;s important to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.390" end="00:00:58.559" style="s2">get these things right and not to rush</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.800" end="00:01:03.719" style="s2">about a year ago actually on September</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.559" end="00:01:05.939" style="s2">27th 2016 I made a series of videos one</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.719" end="00:01:10.260" style="s2">of them criticized a new piece of</p>

<p begin="00:01:10.260" end="00:01:14.670" style="s2">and I&#39;m reading this directly from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.180" end="00:01:16.619" style="s2">government website an act to amend the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.670" end="00:01:20.220" style="s2">Canadian Human Rights Act and the</p>

<p begin="00:01:57.290" end="00:02:03.810" style="s2">now you may notice on careful reading</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.790" end="00:02:07.140" style="s2">that the Act modifies the Criminal Code</p>

<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:17.580" style="s2">- hate to a degree that&#39;s I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.870" end="00:02:19.880" style="s2">completely unacceptable but that&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:02:21.930" end="00:02:25.410" style="s2">problems are though unless you go read</p>

<p begin="00:02:38.430" end="00:02:42.630" style="s2">made the videos I said as much I said</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:45.210" style="s2">that there were two fundamental dangers</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.630" end="00:02:47.959" style="s2">to this bill one was that because the</p>

<p begin="00:02:55.440" end="00:03:02.880" style="s2">policies in the pursuit of its radical</p>

<p begin="00:03:06.780" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">prosecution for so-called offenses that</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.810" end="00:03:14.760" style="s2">should never be considered within the</p>

<p begin="00:03:14.760" end="00:03:20.040" style="s2">also objected to the manner in which the</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.950" end="00:04:16.950" style="s2">legislating compelled speech in</p>

<p begin="00:04:27.389" end="00:04:31.080" style="s2">acquired in Canada so that for the first</p>

<p begin="00:04:36.120" end="00:04:40.080" style="s2">than legislating what you can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.310" end="00:04:41.969" style="s2">which is already something that&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.080" end="00:04:44.520" style="s2">dangerous there are a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.969" end="00:04:46.710" style="s2">consequences of making this video which</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.520" end="00:04:48.689" style="s2">we&#39;re much more dramatic than I presume</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.710" end="00:04:52.110" style="s2">they might be although I did know that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.689" end="00:04:53.550" style="s2">bill c16 posed a genuine threat to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.110" end="00:04:55.889" style="s2">integrity of our state</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.550" end="00:04:58.409" style="s2">now the first consequence was that a</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.889" end="00:05:00.509" style="s2">very large number of faculty members at</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.409" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">the University of Toronto decided that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.509" end="00:05:06.240" style="s2">had made the campus an unsafe place by</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:07.590" style="s2">my statements and petitioned the</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.240" end="00:05:09.270" style="s2">university to do something about that</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.590" end="00:05:10.889" style="s2">and then there were a number of</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.270" end="00:05:12.930" style="s2">demonstrations and then the University</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.889" end="00:05:15.120" style="s2">of Toronto sent me two letters telling</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.930" end="00:05:18.060" style="s2">me that I was violating their policies</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.120" end="00:05:19.710" style="s2">and probably the law in Ontario which</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.060" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">was something I had warned about by the</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.710" end="00:05:24.210" style="s2">way because the law was written in such</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:26.969" style="s2">a dismal manner and over-inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.210" end="00:05:28.740" style="s2">matter to ensure that even criticizing</p>

<p begin="00:05:28.740" end="00:05:34.589" style="s2">guidelines let&#39;s say and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.099" end="00:05:37.529" style="s2">a debate that the university held we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.589" end="00:05:39.389" style="s2">defenders of Bill c16 insisted that I</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.969" end="00:05:49.439" style="s2">of its implementation would never</p>

<p begin="00:09:29.209" end="00:09:35.000" style="s2">and so everything that I thought was a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.209" end="00:09:37.670" style="s2">matter of public record and I had posted</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.000" end="00:09:39.579" style="s2">it on YouTube in the form of hundreds of</p>

<p begin="00:09:39.579" end="00:09:44.329" style="s2">scurrilous and self damning in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.290" end="00:09:46.760" style="s2">videos it&#39;s quite the contrary people</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.329" end="00:09:48.890" style="s2">have found the content extremely useful</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.760" end="00:09:50.660" style="s2">from a psychological perspective and and</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.660" end="00:09:55.279" style="s2">people and so it turns out that I&#39;m not</p>

<p begin="00:10:03.440" end="00:10:08.930" style="s2">to assume that I&#39;m an all right or even</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.160" end="00:10:11.440" style="s2">a far-right figure which is an</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.440" end="00:10:16.699" style="s2">many times in the last year and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.420" end="00:10:18.560" style="s2">also a reason for that the reason for</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.560" end="00:10:23.209" style="s2">right of the radical left is a very</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.019" end="00:10:25.820" style="s2">large group and it includes everyone</p>

<p begin="00:10:25.820" end="00:10:30.829" style="s2">type all the way to the most far-right</p>

<p begin="00:10:39.560" end="00:10:44.870" style="s2">fact that some of the members of a group</p>

<p begin="00:10:44.870" end="00:10:50.269" style="s2">not demonstrate that all of the members</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.510" end="00:10:52.279" style="s2">of that group are of that type now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.269" end="00:10:54.920" style="s2">very convenient for the radical left and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.279" end="00:10:57.230" style="s2">much more straightforward than actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.920" end="00:10:59.029" style="s2">formulating arguments to assume that</p>

<p begin="00:11:03.819" end="00:11:09.130" style="s2">there are many reasonable people in fact</p>

<p begin="00:11:09.130" end="00:11:12.940" style="s2">are firmly opposed to the agenda of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.140" end="00:11:14.980" style="s2">radical left and it&#39;s completely</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.940" end="00:11:17.680" style="s2">unreasonable to lump them in with all</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.980" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">right far-right and Nazi type figures</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.680" end="00:11:22.780" style="s2">part of the reason that the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:24.760" style="s2">neo-marxist find themselves compelled to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.780" end="00:11:27.460" style="s2">do so is because they believe that they</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.760" end="00:11:30.310" style="s2">are correct and that they have right on</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.460" end="00:11:32.710" style="s2">their side and if it turns out that</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.310" end="00:11:34.630" style="s2">anyone reasonable is objecting then the</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.710" end="00:11:36.850" style="s2">fact of that reasonable opposition would</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.630" end="00:11:39.790" style="s2">make it necessary for some things to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.850" end="00:11:41.830" style="s2">rethought and so it&#39;s much easier and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.790" end="00:11:43.720" style="s2">would also say much more gratifying to</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.830" end="00:11:48.310" style="s2">an inner sense of resentment and</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.720" end="00:11:50.250" style="s2">vengefulness to merely tar everyone who</p>

<p begin="00:11:50.250" end="00:11:57.010" style="s2">the argument be damned this brings us to</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.030" end="00:11:59.860" style="s2">the most fundamental reason why there</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.010" end="00:12:02.500" style="s2">has been such vociferous opposition</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.860" end="00:12:05.650" style="s2">generated in relationship to what I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.500" end="00:12:08.170" style="s2">been saying and that&#39;s because I got the</p>

<p begin="00:20:14.899" end="00:20:18.499" style="s2">everyone is to use a certain set of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.579" end="00:20:19.849" style="s2">words that I think are the constructions</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.499" end="00:20:21.499" style="s2">of people who have a political ideology</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.849" end="00:20:23.479" style="s2">that I don&#39;t believe in him that I also</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.499" end="00:20:25.849" style="s2">regard is as dangerous what are those</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.479" end="00:20:28.940" style="s2">words those are the made-up words to</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.849" end="00:20:32.239" style="s2">read that that people now describe as as</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.940" end="00:20:34.879" style="s2">gender-neutral and so to me they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.239" end="00:20:37.669" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re an attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.879" end="00:20:39.919" style="s2">control language and in a direction that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.669" end="00:20:41.329" style="s2">isn&#39;t happening organically it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.919" end="00:20:43.159" style="s2">happening naturally people aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.329" end="00:20:45.259" style="s2">picking up these words in the typical</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.159" end="00:20:47.359" style="s2">way that new words are picked up but by</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.259" end="00:20:49.070" style="s2">force and by Fiat and I would say by</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.359" end="00:20:51.049" style="s2">force because there&#39;s legislative power</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.070" end="00:20:53.509" style="s2">behind them so just like these made-up</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.049" end="00:20:55.219" style="s2">words Z and xur and that sort of thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.509" end="00:20:56.899" style="s2">what about the they&#39;re not all made up</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.219" end="00:20:58.999" style="s2">where quote-unquote made-up words for</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.899" end="00:21:00.889" style="s2">example they is one of them yeah but we</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.999" end="00:21:02.419" style="s2">speak to an individual as they write but</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.889" end="00:21:04.369" style="s2">we can&#39;t dispense with the distinction</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.419" end="00:21:05.599" style="s2">between singular and plural I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.369" end="00:21:07.279" style="s2">know that the advocates of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.599" end="00:21:09.049" style="s2">particular approach say that they has</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.279" end="00:21:11.239" style="s2">been used forever as a singular and</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.049" end="00:21:12.440" style="s2">that&#39;s actually not correct it&#39;s used as</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.239" end="00:21:14.269" style="s2">a singular and very exceptional</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.440" end="00:21:16.149" style="s2">circumstances so we understand your</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.269" end="00:21:18.919" style="s2">views and where you&#39;re coming from you</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.149" end="00:21:22.429" style="s2">decided to lay these views out in some</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.919" end="00:21:24.499" style="s2">YouTube discourses yes you put them up</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.429" end="00:21:25.999" style="s2">the response has been overwhelming did</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.499" end="00:21:27.829" style="s2">you anticipate that you would get this</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.999" end="00:21:29.599" style="s2">kind of feedback no there was no way of</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.829" end="00:21:30.950" style="s2">anticipating this and I think you</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.599" end="00:21:32.690" style="s2">mentioned in the intro you know that</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.950" end="00:21:33.710" style="s2">this is a consequence of what I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.690" end="00:21:35.330" style="s2">and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.710" end="00:21:37.460" style="s2">think that&#39;s true it&#39;s a it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.330" end="00:21:38.960" style="s2">consequence of the fact I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.460" end="00:21:41.510" style="s2">it and I think the right metaphor is</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.960" end="00:21:44.029" style="s2">that you know there&#39;s a large forest and</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.510" end="00:21:46.070" style="s2">it&#39;s been a hot dry summer or maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.029" end="00:21:48.799" style="s2">drought and there&#39;s plenty of dead wood</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.070" end="00:21:50.870" style="s2">gathered and I lit a spark and you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.799" end="00:21:52.940" style="s2">blame the forest fire on the spark there</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.870" end="00:21:54.470" style="s2">is out there an appetite against</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.940" end="00:21:55.820" style="s2">political correctness which is what you</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.470" end="00:21:57.950" style="s2">have described us as in fact your</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.820" end="00:21:59.630" style="s2">YouTube videos called professor against</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.950" end="00:22:00.620" style="s2">political correctness but let&#39;s make</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.630" end="00:22:03.010" style="s2">sure we&#39;re all speaking the same</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.620" end="00:22:05.720" style="s2">language here you would define that how</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.010" end="00:22:07.940" style="s2">political correctness well I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.720" end="00:22:09.860" style="s2">a particularly illogical game and I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.940" end="00:22:11.570" style="s2">think the outcome is twofold it&#39;s to</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.860" end="00:22:15.679" style="s2">make the player feel morally superior</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.570" end="00:22:18.169" style="s2">and also to take rather serious axe</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.679" end="00:22:20.990" style="s2">swings at the foundation of society and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.169" end="00:22:23.419" style="s2">so the game is identify a domain of</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.990" end="00:22:25.760" style="s2">human endeavor note that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.419" end="00:22:27.140" style="s2">distribution of success some people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.760" end="00:22:28.659" style="s2">doing comparatively better and some</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.140" end="00:22:31.390" style="s2">people are doing comparatively worse</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.659" end="00:22:33.380" style="s2">define those doing worse as victims</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.390" end="00:22:36.169" style="s2">define those doing better as</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.380" end="00:22:39.260" style="s2">perpetrators identify with the victims</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.169" end="00:22:41.630" style="s2">have yourself a set of enemies handy to</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.260" end="00:22:43.130" style="s2">vent your resentment on feel good about</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.630" end="00:22:45.529" style="s2">it even though it didn&#39;t really require</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.130" end="00:22:47.720" style="s2">any work on your part and then endlessly</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.529" end="00:22:48.799" style="s2">repeat Jordan let&#39;s do one more question</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.720" end="00:22:50.960" style="s2">here and then we&#39;ll get everybody else</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.799" end="00:22:52.850" style="s2">into the conversation you know of course</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.960" end="00:22:55.730" style="s2">that since this story broke you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.850" end="00:22:58.159" style="s2">called a lot of things yeah one of which</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.730" end="00:23:01.610" style="s2">is a transphobic yeah some people have</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.159" end="00:23:03.440" style="s2">accused you of using the free speech</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.610" end="00:23:05.659" style="s2">issue to mask what&#39;s really going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.440" end="00:23:07.370" style="s2">here which is an attempt to deprive</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.659" end="00:23:09.500" style="s2">other people of what they believe are</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.370" end="00:23:10.610" style="s2">their legitimate rights well I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.500" end="00:23:12.080" style="s2">want to give you the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.610" end="00:23:13.730" style="s2">speak to whether or not you are a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.080" end="00:23:15.080" style="s2">transphobic well I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.730" end="00:23:17.029" style="s2">I&#39;ve received more letters from</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.080" end="00:23:19.580" style="s2">transsexual people supporting me than</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.029" end="00:23:21.440" style="s2">opposing me and I never said anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.580" end="00:23:22.820" style="s2">really about transsexual people about</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.440" end="00:23:24.409" style="s2">their existence although that was the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.820" end="00:23:26.840" style="s2">first thing that I was accused of doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.409" end="00:23:29.330" style="s2">I didn&#39;t say that transsexual people</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.840" end="00:23:31.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t exist I said that gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.330" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">gender expression and biological sex do</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.640" end="00:23:37.010" style="s2">not vary independently which they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:38.890" style="s2">and so all this issue is in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.010" end="00:23:42.080" style="s2">only peripherally about about</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.890" end="00:23:44.809" style="s2">transsexual issues it&#39;s more essentially</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.080" end="00:23:46.429" style="s2">about gender issues and then on top of</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.809" end="00:23:47.330" style="s2">that and I think it&#39;s the biggest issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.429" end="00:23:49.549" style="s2">is is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.330" end="00:23:52.039" style="s2">it&#39;s a free speech issue okay let us</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.549" end="00:23:55.249" style="s2">continue to explore all of those issues</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.039" end="00:23:56.570" style="s2">that you have just raised and why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.249" end="00:23:58.070" style="s2">we do this let&#39;s take a moment we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.570" end="00:24:00.169" style="s2">going to explain a few basic things here</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.070" end="00:24:01.309" style="s2">the issue of so-called non-traditional</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.169" end="00:24:03.259" style="s2">pronouns goes together with</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.309" end="00:24:07.220" style="s2">non-traditional gender identities New</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.259" end="00:24:08.720" style="s2">York City for example recognizes 31 such</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.220" end="00:24:11.320" style="s2">gender expressions in other words</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.720" end="00:24:14.269" style="s2">besides man and woman there are 29 other</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.320" end="00:24:16.909" style="s2">gender expressions for example pangender</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.269" end="00:24:19.460" style="s2">queer gender gender fluid crossdresser</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.909" end="00:24:21.259" style="s2">by gendered gender blender and the list</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.460" end="00:24:22.129" style="s2">goes on and Nicholas this is where I</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.259" end="00:24:24.859" style="s2">want to bring you into the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.129" end="00:24:27.169" style="s2">because you teach this you teach trans</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.859" end="00:24:30.739" style="s2">studies so if you would give us a brief</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.169" end="00:24:33.769" style="s2">primer on so many gender identities that</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.739" end="00:24:38.419" style="s2">in your view require non-traditional</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.769" end="00:24:40.190" style="s2">pronouns basically it&#39;s not correct that</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.419" end="00:24:42.109" style="s2">there is such a thing as biological sex</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.190" end="00:24:44.239" style="s2">and I&#39;m a historian of medicine I can</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.109" end="00:24:46.009" style="s2">unpack that for you at great length if</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.239" end="00:24:48.259" style="s2">you want but in the interest of time I</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.009" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">won&#39;t so that&#39;s a very popular</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.259" end="00:24:52.100" style="s2">misconceptions it was like a YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:54.320" style="s2">debate it was one hour long but I showed</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.100" end="00:24:56.239" style="s2">about five minutes and then some I mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.320" end="00:24:57.889" style="s2">the students were we&#39;re very interested</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.239" end="00:25:00.139" style="s2">I could tell that all of their eyes were</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.889" end="00:25:01.759" style="s2">on the screen and after when we had a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.139" end="00:25:04.820" style="s2">debate there were people of all opinions</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.759" end="00:25:06.499" style="s2">and like from from what I could see it</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.820" end="00:25:08.239" style="s2">was a very friendly debate obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.499" end="00:25:11.090" style="s2">this person who had an issue did not</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.239" end="00:25:13.369" style="s2">express it to me they just went straight</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.090" end="00:25:17.330" style="s2">to whoever I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really know</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.369" end="00:25:20.149" style="s2">what happened so I&#39;m just for some</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.330" end="00:25:23.749" style="s2">additional context so you come you came</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.149" end="00:25:26.539" style="s2">from UT all right no no I said himself</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.749" end="00:25:29.779" style="s2">from sfuo I see you worked like one of</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.539" end="00:25:32.149" style="s2">Jordan Peters and students yeah so just</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.779" end="00:25:36.220" style="s2">to give you some context that of Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.149" end="00:25:39.049" style="s2">Pederson is he is a figure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.220" end="00:25:42.009" style="s2">basically highly involved with the with</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.049" end="00:25:46.070" style="s2">the alt-right he lectures about</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.009" end="00:25:49.759" style="s2">basically like critiquing feminism</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.070" end="00:25:54.139" style="s2">critiquing trans rights I&#39;m familiar</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.759" end="00:25:55.639" style="s2">like I Rosie I follow okay so the thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.139" end="00:25:58.570" style="s2">is can you shield people from those</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.639" end="00:26:01.280" style="s2">ideas am I supposed to comfort them and</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.570" end="00:26:03.080" style="s2">make sure that they are insulated away</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.280" end="00:26:06.380" style="s2">from this like is that what the point of</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.080" end="00:26:08.510" style="s2">this is because to me that is so against</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.380" end="00:26:11.450" style="s2">what a university is about so against it</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.510" end="00:26:14.090" style="s2">I was not taking sides I was presenting</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.450" end="00:26:17.210" style="s2">both arguments so the thing is about</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.090" end="00:26:20.720" style="s2">this is if you&#39;re presenting something</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.210" end="00:26:22.820" style="s2">like this it you have to think about the</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.720" end="00:26:26.090" style="s2">kind of teaching climate that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.820" end="00:26:29.530" style="s2">creating and this is actually these</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.090" end="00:26:33.020" style="s2">arguments are counter to the Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.530" end="00:26:34.300" style="s2">Human Rights Code ever since I know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.020" end="00:26:37.910" style="s2">you talked about</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.300" end="00:26:41.920" style="s2">c16 ever since this past it is</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.910" end="00:26:44.330" style="s2">discriminatory to be targeting someone</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.920" end="00:26:47.180" style="s2">due to their gender identity or gender</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.330" end="00:26:49.790" style="s2">expression so bringing something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.180" end="00:26:51.170" style="s2">that up in class not critically and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.790" end="00:26:53.150" style="s2">understand that you&#39;re trying to like it</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.170" end="00:26:56.510" style="s2">was critical why I introduced it</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.150" end="00:26:58.100" style="s2">critically how so like I said like I</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.510" end="00:27:00.340" style="s2">said I it was in the spirit of debate</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.100" end="00:27:03.410" style="s2">okay in the spirit of the debate is</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.340" end="00:27:05.480" style="s2">slightly different than being like okay</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.410" end="00:27:07.850" style="s2">this is this is like a problematic idea</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.480" end="00:27:10.190" style="s2">that we won make me wanna unpack but</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.850" end="00:27:12.020" style="s2">that&#39;s taking sides it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.190" end="00:27:13.610" style="s2">taking sides for me to be like oh look</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.020" end="00:27:14.870" style="s2">at this guy like everything that comes</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.610" end="00:27:18.140" style="s2">out his mouth is BS but we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.870" end="00:27:19.910" style="s2">watch anyway okay so I understand the</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.140" end="00:27:23.300" style="s2">position they are coming from and your</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.910" end="00:27:27.350" style="s2">positionality but the reality is that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.300" end="00:27:29.570" style="s2">has created a toxic climate or some of</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.350" end="00:27:33.410" style="s2">the students hey you know how many it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.570" end="00:27:37.730" style="s2">great oh how many okay one yeah it might</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.410" end="00:27:39.680" style="s2">be I know I have no concept of like how</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.730" end="00:27:41.030" style="s2">many people complain like what their</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.680" end="00:27:43.940" style="s2">complaint was you haven&#39;t showed me the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.030" end="00:27:45.890" style="s2">complaint yes I understand that this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.940" end="00:27:48.560" style="s2">upsetting but there&#39;s also confidential</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.890" end="00:27:51.500" style="s2">at comfy and confidentiality matters the</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.560" end="00:27:54.260" style="s2">number of people&#39;s are special yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.500" end="00:27:56.270" style="s2">is one or multiple students who have</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.260" end="00:27:57.650" style="s2">come forward saying that this is</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.270" end="00:27:59.950" style="s2">something that they were concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.650" end="00:28:04.160" style="s2">and that it made them uncomfortable if</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.950" end="00:28:06.920" style="s2">this is for example a trans student this</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.160" end="00:28:09.680" style="s2">is basically debating whether or not a</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.920" end="00:28:12.380" style="s2">trans student should have rights within</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.680" end="00:28:14.780" style="s2">one of their classes and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.380" end="00:28:15.049" style="s2">something that is really acceptable in</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.780" end="00:28:16.700" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.049" end="00:28:18.019" style="s2">context of the kind of learning</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.700" end="00:28:21.499" style="s2">environment that we&#39;re trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.019" end="00:28:24.649" style="s2">it would be the equivalent of debating</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.499" end="00:28:26.840" style="s2">whether or not you know a student of</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.649" end="00:28:28.309" style="s2">color should have rights or should be</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.840" end="00:28:30.830" style="s2">allowed to be married</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.309" end="00:28:32.600" style="s2">do you see weird like how this is not</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.830" end="00:28:36.019" style="s2">this is not something like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.600" end="00:28:37.909" style="s2">intellectually neutral that is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.019" end="00:28:39.379" style="s2">up for debate this I mean this is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.909" end="00:28:43.519" style="s2">Charter of Rights but it is up for</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.379" end="00:28:47.330" style="s2">debate but I mean you&#39;re perfectly</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.519" end="00:28:49.580" style="s2">welcome your own opinions but when</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.330" end="00:28:51.230" style="s2">you&#39;re bringing it into the context of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.580" end="00:28:53.809" style="s2">the classroom that can become</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.230" end="00:28:57.590" style="s2">problematic and that can become</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.809" end="00:29:00.080" style="s2">something that is that creates an unsafe</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.590" end="00:29:01.580" style="s2">learning environment for students but</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.080" end="00:29:03.470" style="s2">when they leave the university they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.580" end="00:29:06.109" style="s2">gonna be exposed to these ideas so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.470" end="00:29:08.899" style="s2">don&#39;t see how I&#39;m doing a disservice to</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.109" end="00:29:10.399" style="s2">the class by exposing them to ideas that</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.899" end="00:29:12.769" style="s2">are really out there and I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.399" end="00:29:15.769" style="s2">crying I&#39;m stressed out because this to</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.769" end="00:29:18.950" style="s2">me is so wrong can I mention the</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.769" end="00:29:23.029" style="s2">gendered violence gendered in sexual</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.950" end="00:29:26.090" style="s2">violence policy yeah please so I agree</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.029" end="00:29:27.679" style="s2">that it does gender violence I can just</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.090" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">include sexual violence but it also</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.679" end="00:29:33.799" style="s2">includes targeting folks based on gender</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:36.049" style="s2">so that includes transphobia biphobia</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.799" end="00:29:38.210" style="s2">homophobia all those sorts of things are</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.049" end="00:29:41.830" style="s2">protected under the policy and so those</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.210" end="00:29:44.720" style="s2">are things that Laurie has upheld as</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.830" end="00:29:47.749" style="s2">values as well as the Ontario Human</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.720" end="00:29:55.340" style="s2">Rights Code and so those are things that</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.749" end="00:29:58.460" style="s2">we&#39;re responsible for not impacting our</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.340" end="00:30:01.700" style="s2">students in that way I&#39;m not um not</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.460" end="00:30:03.350" style="s2">spreading transphobia okay so what I</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.700" end="00:30:07.850" style="s2">have a problem with is I didn&#39;t target</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.350" end="00:30:09.919" style="s2">anybody who did i target how by telling</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.850" end="00:30:13.989" style="s2">them ideas that are really out there by</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.919" end="00:30:21.009" style="s2">telling them that by telling time really</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.989" end="00:30:23.869" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not just telling them in</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.009" end="00:30:26.450" style="s2">legitimizing this as a valid perspective</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.869" end="00:30:28.610" style="s2">as this is another valid perspective in</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.450" end="00:30:30.950" style="s2">a university it&#39;s all perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.610" end="00:30:33.380" style="s2">are valid that&#39;s not necessarily true</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.950" end="00:30:35.179" style="s2">and well this this is something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.380" end="00:30:37.429" style="s2">being debated in current society and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.179" end="00:30:39.230" style="s2">don&#39;t feel the need to shield people</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.429" end="00:30:41.090" style="s2">from what&#39;s going on in society like</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.230" end="00:30:44.929" style="s2">okay to imagine that this is happening</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.090" end="00:30:48.590" style="s2">in university it&#39;s just bad okay so just</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.929" end="00:30:51.730" style="s2">to give you a context also within all of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.590" end="00:30:54.520" style="s2">this is happening Laurier&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.730" end="00:30:58.490" style="s2">blanketed with white supremacists</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.520" end="00:31:02.630" style="s2">posters currently there&#39;s another debate</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.490" end="00:31:04.850" style="s2">in society which is whether or not North</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.630" end="00:31:07.309" style="s2">America should be a set of white</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.850" end="00:31:09.919" style="s2">nationalist states and that it should be</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.309" end="00:31:12.830" style="s2">ethnically cleansed of other people that</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.919" end="00:31:16.910" style="s2">is also a current debate Society would</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.830" end="00:31:19.340" style="s2">you show something in your tutorial that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.910" end="00:31:21.770" style="s2">you had you know white supremacist and</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.340" end="00:31:24.200" style="s2">non white supremacists debating whether</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.770" end="00:31:26.090" style="s2">or not other people should live in North</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.200" end="00:31:29.480" style="s2">America is that something that you would</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.090" end="00:31:30.770" style="s2">show if that was related to the content</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.480" end="00:31:33.950" style="s2">of the week and we were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.770" end="00:31:36.110" style="s2">right-wing speech bubbles maybe it</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.950" end="00:31:37.549" style="s2">depends on the content like I mean if</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.110" end="00:31:41.750" style="s2">there&#39;s really ideas that are existing</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.549" end="00:31:43.760" style="s2">out there like that then I mean look the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.750" end="00:31:45.860" style="s2">thing is like I don&#39;t see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.760" end="00:31:48.919" style="s2">transphobic about showing a video during</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.860" end="00:31:51.230" style="s2">Petersons he&#39;s a real person he&#39;s out</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.919" end="00:31:55.309" style="s2">there he is a real person but he is a</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.230" end="00:32:01.040" style="s2">real person who has engaged in targeted</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.309" end="00:32:04.040" style="s2">behavior that are targeting of trans</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.040" end="00:32:06.410" style="s2">students in the particular like like</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.040" end="00:32:08.120" style="s2">basically daxing them if you know the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.410" end="00:32:09.320" style="s2">term like giving out their personal</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.120" end="00:32:12.020" style="s2">information so that they will be</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.320" end="00:32:15.679" style="s2">attacked harassed so that death threats</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.020" end="00:32:18.080" style="s2">will find them this is something that he</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.679" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">has done to his own students he has done</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.080" end="00:32:22.130" style="s2">to other students and this is also</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:25.549" style="s2">something that the students are aware of</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.130" end="00:32:29.480" style="s2">so this is this is basically like</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.549" end="00:32:30.830" style="s2">playing not to kind of do the thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.480" end="00:32:34.669" style="s2">where everything is kind of compared to</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.830" end="00:32:37.460" style="s2">Hitler but it&#39;s like neutrally playing a</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.669" end="00:32:40.730" style="s2">speech by by Hitler or Milo you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.460" end="00:32:42.040" style="s2">police from gamergate this is the kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.730" end="00:32:45.050" style="s2">of thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.040" end="00:32:46.820" style="s2">departmentally in terms of like critical</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.050" end="00:32:49.100" style="s2">communication studies and in terms of</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.039" end="00:38:38.119" style="s2">very interesting point because president</p>

<p begin="00:38:58.069" end="00:39:02.089" style="s2">worth my suspicions are that the</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.019" end="00:39:04.609" style="s2">policies are written so badly like bill</p>

<p begin="00:39:08.539" end="00:39:13.309" style="s2">possible it&#39;s convenient for the</p>

<p begin="00:39:27.589" end="00:39:33.770" style="s2">settled that to anyone&#39;s satisfaction</p>
