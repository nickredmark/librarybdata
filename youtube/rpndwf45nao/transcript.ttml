<p begin="00:04:02.799" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">dies of as a young age of 33 he has a</p>

<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:12.819" style="s2">young and is therefore quickly killed</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.109" end="00:04:14.829" style="s2">and his major generals fight amongst</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.819" end="00:04:17.380" style="s2">themselves and they carve his empire up</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.829" end="00:04:19.329" style="s2">into four smaller empires that are</p>

<p begin="00:17:53.720" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">more to do with something else so the</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.120" end="00:18:07.760" style="s2">Epicureans are often translated I think</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:09.860" style="s2">correctly I&#39;m not talking about an</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.760" end="00:18:13.880" style="s2">autonomic and silastic point as talking</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.860" end="00:18:16.730" style="s2">about how we are suffering because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.880" end="00:18:18.530" style="s2">can&#39;t manage fear I think a better way</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.730" end="00:18:21.530" style="s2">of understanding it given this</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.530" end="00:18:23.000" style="s2">distinction and following on telic is we</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.530" end="00:18:25.190" style="s2">suffer because we can&#39;t manage our</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:28.700" style="s2">anxiety because they think the fears</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.190" end="00:18:31.070" style="s2">they talk about are not really things</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.700" end="00:18:35.230" style="s2">that are a clear threat where we clearly</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.070" end="00:18:35.230" style="s2">know what to do okay</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.520" end="00:18:47.610" style="s2">so according to Epicureans basically we</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.160" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">don&#39;t control our imagination or in our</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.610" end="00:18:59.730" style="s2">thinking and so we suffer from anxieties</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:19:05.040" style="s2">that cripple our ability to get a grip</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.730" end="00:19:18.179" style="s2">on the world so let me give you one</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.040" end="00:19:21.360" style="s2">many people are anxious about death in</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.179" end="00:19:25.110" style="s2">fact sort of prototypically people will</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.360" end="00:19:27.030" style="s2">often say well they&#39;ll often use the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.110" end="00:19:29.490" style="s2">existence of death as a way of talking</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.030" end="00:19:31.170" style="s2">about how their how their life is</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.490" end="00:19:33.960" style="s2">ultimately meaningless I&#39;m gonna die</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.170" end="00:19:36.240" style="s2">anyway so it doesn&#39;t matter I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.960" end="00:19:38.730" style="s2">die and it&#39;s terrifying I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.240" end="00:19:41.160" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna add I&#39;m just afraid of death</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.730" end="00:19:43.650" style="s2">we know that if you expose people to</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.160" end="00:19:45.720" style="s2">triggers about their own mortality they</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.650" end="00:19:47.309" style="s2">become cognitively rigid they go into</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.720" end="00:19:52.309" style="s2">something very much like this parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.309" end="00:19:52.309" style="s2">processing they get locked down right</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.760" end="00:20:01.650" style="s2">now there&#39;s there&#39;s a couple things you</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.170" end="00:20:03.540" style="s2">can do you can pursue immortality and of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.650" end="00:20:05.190" style="s2">course the religions of the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.540" end="00:20:09.300" style="s2">world and some versions of the modern</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.190" end="00:20:11.250" style="s2">world offer this I have very little to</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.300" end="00:20:12.929" style="s2">say for this other than as a cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.250" end="00:20:16.260" style="s2">scientists I think that is an utterly</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.929" end="00:20:17.970" style="s2">doomed strategy the evidence that your</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.260" end="00:20:20.460" style="s2">mind and your consciousness are</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.970" end="00:20:25.260" style="s2">completely dependent and emergent from</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.460" end="00:20:29.010" style="s2">your brain is overwhelming and one thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.260" end="00:20:31.590" style="s2">is indisputable your brain dies and when</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.010" end="00:20:35.940" style="s2">your brain dies your consciousness your</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.590" end="00:20:38.460" style="s2">character yourself died with it I know</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.940" end="00:20:41.550" style="s2">that&#39;s even I suppose antithetical to</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.460" end="00:20:46.440" style="s2">what many Buddhists believe but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.550" end="00:20:49.850" style="s2">that&#39;s irrelevant so I think the</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.440" end="00:20:53.190" style="s2">strategy of pursuing immortality is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.850" end="00:20:57.730" style="s2">going to work</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.190" end="00:21:00.299" style="s2">it makes a fundamental confusion it</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.730" end="00:21:04.330" style="s2">confuses somebody something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.299" end="00:21:06.429" style="s2">phenomenologically in like mysterious to</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.330" end="00:21:09.159" style="s2">you with making a conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.429" end="00:21:10.990" style="s2">look I can&#39;t experience my own death I</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.159" end="00:21:12.970" style="s2">can&#39;t imagine it because whenever I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.990" end="00:21:15.669" style="s2">trying to imagine being dead I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.970" end="00:21:18.250" style="s2">consciously aware and so death is like</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.669" end="00:21:19.960" style="s2">uh-huh and therefore I conclude well</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.250" end="00:21:23.590" style="s2">this must be something about me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.960" end="00:21:25.509" style="s2">right immortal because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.590" end="00:21:29.250" style="s2">inconceivable that I can&#39;t be at some</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.509" end="00:21:32.169" style="s2">level but of course that&#39;s false and</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.250" end="00:21:34.720" style="s2">that points to what the Epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.169" end="00:21:36.970" style="s2">talked about right they talked about</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.720" end="00:21:41.259" style="s2">there&#39;s another strategy instead of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.970" end="00:21:46.750" style="s2">trying to achieve immortality can you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.259" end="00:21:48.519" style="s2">radically accept your mortality because</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.750" end="00:21:54.039" style="s2">it&#39;s indisputable that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.519" end="00:21:56.559" style="s2">die now how do you do that well first of</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.039" end="00:21:59.980" style="s2">all realize that you can&#39;t possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.559" end="00:22:02.169" style="s2">anxious about your death and you say yes</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.980" end="00:22:02.700" style="s2">I am okay well give the Epicureans a</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.169" end="00:22:05.440" style="s2">chance</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.700" end="00:22:09.159" style="s2">first of all if what you mean by this</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:10.899" style="s2">your non-existence and you say I just I</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.159" end="00:22:13.899" style="s2">can&#39;t conceive of my non-existant well</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.899" end="00:22:16.600" style="s2">okay this is this is a standard move by</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.899" end="00:22:18.960" style="s2">Epicurus well what about all of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.600" end="00:22:21.990" style="s2">world before you were born</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.960" end="00:22:25.330" style="s2">do you have trouble conceiving of that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.990" end="00:22:30.820" style="s2">no does it terrify you that you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.330" end="00:22:38.700" style="s2">exist then no so your non existence</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.820" end="00:22:44.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t itself terrifying and you say ah</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.700" end="00:22:45.700" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s the loss well the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.320" end="00:22:49.779" style="s2">with that the Epicureans would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.700" end="00:22:51.909" style="s2">that&#39;s equivocal do you mean write</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.779" end="00:22:55.000" style="s2">reduction or you do me do you mean the</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.909" end="00:22:57.580" style="s2">absence and you mean well death is total</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.000" end="00:22:59.289" style="s2">loss and then they say - ah but you</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.580" end="00:23:01.570" style="s2">can&#39;t ever experience total loss they</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.289" end="00:23:04.710" style="s2">famously said the following where I am</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.570" end="00:23:08.770" style="s2">death is not where death is I am NOT</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.710" end="00:23:12.040" style="s2">what that means is if I&#39;m aware that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.770" end="00:23:14.680" style="s2">losing I&#39;m still alive and if I&#39;ve lost</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.040" end="00:23:16.150" style="s2">everything I&#39;ve lost awareness and I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.680" end="00:23:21.550" style="s2">can&#39;t be aware that I&#39;ve lost anything</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.150" end="00:23:26.410" style="s2">so that can&#39;t be what it means okay so</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.550" end="00:23:29.560" style="s2">it means partial loss ah so what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.410" end="00:23:36.670" style="s2">actually afraid of is losing some of</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.560" end="00:23:40.210" style="s2">your agency you&#39;re afraid of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.670" end="00:23:43.570" style="s2">reduction in your capacities as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.210" end="00:23:46.810" style="s2">dying but of course you&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.570" end="00:23:49.290" style="s2">all the time so what is it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.810" end="00:23:52.990" style="s2">actually afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.290" end="00:24:00.040" style="s2">well the Epicureans say you&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.990" end="00:24:03.940" style="s2">losing what&#39;s good okay well what does</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.040" end="00:24:08.320" style="s2">that mean here&#39;s where the Epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.940" end="00:24:11.110" style="s2">they are sort of very very modern right</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.320" end="00:24:13.450" style="s2">they say well good is ultimately you</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.110" end="00:24:16.540" style="s2">know something like pleasure and they</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.450" end="00:24:20.170" style="s2">got associated with hedonism and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.540" end="00:24:23.160" style="s2">not quite right but they don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.170" end="00:24:28.540" style="s2">pleasure in terms of bodily sensation</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.160" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">they mean pay attention to those things</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.540" end="00:24:33.480" style="s2">that actually give you the most meaning</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.320" end="00:24:41.320" style="s2">okay now what is it that really gives</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.530" end="00:24:43.770" style="s2">you meaning now the things that we are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.320" end="00:24:49.390" style="s2">locked where most liable to lose as we</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.770" end="00:24:51.340" style="s2">age or as we&#39;re sick we&#39;re liable to</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.390" end="00:24:55.630" style="s2">lose our fame we&#39;re liable to lose our</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.340" end="00:25:01.960" style="s2">fortune right we&#39;re liable to lose our</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.630" end="00:25:07.300" style="s2">wealth and that&#39;s scary but then they</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.960" end="00:25:09.880" style="s2">say quite rightly but those aren&#39;t the</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.300" end="00:25:12.940" style="s2">things that give you the most meaning in</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.880" end="00:25:14.350" style="s2">life what is it that gives you the most</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.940" end="00:25:17.880" style="s2">meaning in life and here&#39;s where the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.350" end="00:25:17.880" style="s2">Epicureans have a beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.940" end="00:25:23.230" style="s2">sort of beautiful answer and they pick</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.900" end="00:25:26.440" style="s2">it up from Socrates the thing that gives</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.230" end="00:25:28.420" style="s2">you meaning is friendship and they mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.440" end="00:25:30.070" style="s2">that very broadly so they were unique in</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.420" end="00:25:32.260" style="s2">their community they included women in</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.070" end="00:25:35.650" style="s2">their community not primarily for sexual</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.260" end="00:25:37.240" style="s2">relations but they considered that the</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.650" end="00:25:43.450" style="s2">ability to obtain meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.240" end="00:25:45.910" style="s2">relationships was crucial and with those</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.450" end="00:25:48.190" style="s2">and okay meaningful relationships not</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.910" end="00:25:50.980" style="s2">just the relationships but being able to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.190" end="00:25:53.500" style="s2">exercise philosophy ah the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.980" end="00:25:56.440" style="s2">wisdom and self transcendence and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.500" end="00:26:00.490" style="s2">point is that as long as you are that is</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.440" end="00:26:02.260" style="s2">always available to you and that any of</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.490" end="00:26:04.360" style="s2">the pain you&#39;re suffering from the loss</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.260" end="00:26:07.750" style="s2">of any of the any of these things is</p>

<p begin="00:26:07.750" end="00:26:14.290" style="s2">learn to manage it now whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.370" end="00:26:20.100" style="s2">you ultimately agree with the Epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.290" end="00:26:23.500" style="s2">right do you see what they&#39;re doing here</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.100" end="00:26:25.720" style="s2">they&#39;re refusing to accept I&#39;m afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.500" end="00:26:30.810" style="s2">death they&#39;re saying wait wait wait wait</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.720" end="00:26:30.810" style="s2">are you do you really want immortality</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.410" end="00:26:37.450" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually afraid of is losing</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.020" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">your agency which you&#39;ve identified with</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.450" end="00:26:47.500" style="s2">these things but that&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:51.280" style="s2">where your ultimate happiness lies that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.500" end="00:26:54.990" style="s2">as long as you have cognitive agency you</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.280" end="00:26:58.120" style="s2">can cultivate philosophical friendships</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.990" end="00:27:00.160" style="s2">and Epicurus did this right to his very</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.120" end="00:27:04.390" style="s2">last moment even though suffering from</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.160" end="00:27:05.770" style="s2">some horrible stomach illness so he</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.390" end="00:27:11.830" style="s2">exemplified what he&#39;s talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.770" end="00:27:12.340" style="s2">such that when you die it doesn&#39;t matter</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.830" end="00:27:16.900" style="s2">to you</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.340" end="00:27:19.810" style="s2">so his disciples practical they would</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.900" end="00:27:23.220" style="s2">and Epicurus had other ways he tried to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.810" end="00:27:26.260" style="s2">get us to not be anxious about the gods</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.220" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">right famously crafting some of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.260" end="00:27:29.710" style="s2">first arguments that are used by</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:32.350" style="s2">modern-day atheists</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.710" end="00:27:34.600" style="s2">against you know being concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.350" end="00:27:37.360" style="s2">the gods I know I wouldn&#39;t say Epicurus</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.600" end="00:27:39.100" style="s2">was an atheist he&#39;s a non-theist he</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.360" end="00:27:44.800" style="s2">basically argues that the gods are</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.100" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">irrelevant and therefore paying</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.800" end="00:27:49.600" style="s2">attention to them or being overtly</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:52.060" style="s2">concerned with them being anxious about</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.600" end="00:27:55.950" style="s2">them and their nebulous threat is not</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.060" end="00:27:58.660" style="s2">something you should rationally do so</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.950" end="00:28:00.970" style="s2">Epicurus his disciples would practice</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.660" end="00:28:03.280" style="s2">internalizing Epicurus they would write</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.970" end="00:28:05.260" style="s2">his sentences on their household walls</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.280" end="00:28:07.690" style="s2">on their household utensils they would</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.260" end="00:28:10.900" style="s2">practice they would form communities</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.690" end="00:28:13.630" style="s2">together where they would reinforce all</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.900" end="00:28:18.820" style="s2">of these practices where you constantly</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.630" end="00:28:24.850" style="s2">train in being able to accept your</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.820" end="00:28:28.180" style="s2">mortality now I think this is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.850" end="00:28:32.800" style="s2">to us and I think one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.180" end="00:28:36.160" style="s2">any wisdom tradition should do is give</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.800" end="00:28:39.550" style="s2">us a way of responding to our mortality</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.160" end="00:28:41.140" style="s2">I would recommend that that project</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.550" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">hasn&#39;t stopped I recommend Tillich&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.140" end="00:28:45.940" style="s2">book the courage to be as a discussion</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:50.170" style="s2">about that from a more modern context</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.940" end="00:28:53.680" style="s2">and as I said to you we are not caught</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.170" end="00:28:56.350" style="s2">by the usual framing right either you</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.680" end="00:28:59.820" style="s2">believe in an afterlife or your life</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.350" end="00:29:05.050" style="s2">your current life is meaningless</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.820" end="00:29:07.120" style="s2">instead the Epicureans say there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.050" end="00:29:09.880" style="s2">alternative strategy there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.120" end="00:29:15.340" style="s2">alternative therapy for dealing with the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.880" end="00:29:17.140" style="s2">anxiety and that is by learning how not</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.340" end="00:29:24.190" style="s2">just learning beliefs but learning how</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.140" end="00:29:29.260" style="s2">to live in the acceptance of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.190" end="00:29:32.350" style="s2">mortality now well I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.260" end="00:29:35.800" style="s2">relevant I don&#39;t think that their</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.350" end="00:29:37.630" style="s2">diagnosis is sufficient I do not think</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.800" end="00:29:40.570" style="s2">that the meaning crisis of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.630" end="00:29:43.540" style="s2">Hellenistic period was driven primarily</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.570" end="00:29:47.020" style="s2">or solely by a fear of more</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.540" end="00:29:48.820" style="s2">why because mortality has always been</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.020" end="00:29:52.170" style="s2">with us and always will be with us I</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.820" end="00:29:55.540" style="s2">think they&#39;re right that periods of</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.170" end="00:29:57.760" style="s2">chaos and Dom aside exacerbate we know</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.540" end="00:30:02.290" style="s2">this from mortality salience research</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.760" end="00:30:04.980" style="s2">right things that are making us feel</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.290" end="00:30:08.410" style="s2">more vulnerable tend to make our</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.980" end="00:30:12.280" style="s2">mortality and our terror around it more</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.410" end="00:30:14.200" style="s2">salient to us but I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.280" end="00:30:18.940" style="s2">another school that gets a better</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.200" end="00:30:20.950" style="s2">understanding of what was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.940" end="00:30:24.700" style="s2">the Hellenistic period and gives a more</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.950" end="00:30:28.470" style="s2">comprehensive answer and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.700" end="00:30:32.830" style="s2">stoic school now stoicism is very</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.470" end="00:30:38.290" style="s2">relevant because stoicism is a direct</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.830" end="00:30:41.980" style="s2">and explicit ancestor to some of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.290" end="00:30:43.780" style="s2">current forms of psychotherapy the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.980" end="00:30:45.520" style="s2">current forms of psychotherapy that are</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.780" end="00:30:46.390" style="s2">the most evidence-based for being</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.520" end="00:30:48.610" style="s2">effective</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.390" end="00:30:50.260" style="s2">the cognitive therapies like cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.610" end="00:30:54.730" style="s2">therapy cognitive behavioral therapy</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.260" end="00:30:57.730" style="s2">rational emotive therapy etc directly</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.730" end="00:30:59.470" style="s2">come out of stoicism you read Aaron</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.730" end="00:31:02.500" style="s2">Beck&#39;s book for example on cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.470" end="00:31:05.770" style="s2">therapy he repeatedly states this and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.500" end="00:31:10.870" style="s2">cites epictetus Marcus Aurelius and</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.770" end="00:31:13.060" style="s2">others so the way we are trying to deal</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.870" end="00:31:14.820" style="s2">with issues of anxiety and if you</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.060" end="00:31:20.560" style="s2">probably notice we have an anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.820" end="00:31:22.260" style="s2">depression crisis in our culture is we</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.560" end="00:31:24.640" style="s2">are very much putting into practice</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.260" end="00:31:29.940" style="s2">things that are resonated with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.640" end="00:31:32.710" style="s2">Stoics not as much from the Epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.940" end="00:31:37.420" style="s2">so that means the Stoics have a</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.710" end="00:31:42.130" style="s2">different diagnosis of the problem and a</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.420" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">different prognosis for the answer so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.130" end="00:31:51.810" style="s2">what&#39;s their issue they also believe</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:51.810" style="s2">we&#39;re suffering from a kind of anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.820" end="00:31:59.220" style="s2">a kind of suffering of a loss of agency</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.700" end="00:32:03.960" style="s2">and a distress around that because</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.220" end="00:32:06.060" style="s2">that&#39;s of course what&#39;s shared by all of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.960" end="00:32:09.450" style="s2">these schools confronting the</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.060" end="00:32:13.650" style="s2">hellenistic crisis meaning crisis the</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.450" end="00:32:16.920" style="s2">crisis of dama side but they have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.650" end="00:32:18.690" style="s2">different interpretation of it now we</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.920" end="00:32:19.830" style="s2">have to do a bit of history there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.690" end="00:32:26.730" style="s2">look there&#39;s quite a bit more history</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.830" end="00:32:29.100" style="s2">that comes out of out directly out of</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.730" end="00:32:30.750" style="s2">Socrates and flows into stoicism I want</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.100" end="00:32:38.280" style="s2">to go over this a little bit carefully</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.750" end="00:32:39.960" style="s2">with you so they have Socrates and we</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.280" end="00:32:41.940" style="s2">know one of his greatest disciples is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.960" end="00:32:49.890" style="s2">Plato but he has another one and</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.940" end="00:32:52.460" style="s2">ticinese Plato wrote dialogues because</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.890" end="00:32:55.530" style="s2">he was trying to get us to emulate and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.460" end="00:32:58.050" style="s2">eventually internalized Socratic and</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.530" end="00:33:02.880" style="s2">Linkous that question and answer process</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.050" end="00:33:07.260" style="s2">that Socrates made famous when intestine</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.880" end="00:33:11.220" style="s2">is was asked what he had learned from</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.260" end="00:33:12.630" style="s2">Socrates he argued he didn&#39;t argue he</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.220" end="00:33:15.150" style="s2">just simply stated he didn&#39;t make an</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.630" end="00:33:22.380" style="s2">argument he just simply stated that he</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.150" end="00:33:27.930" style="s2">learned how to converse with himself now</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.380" end="00:33:30.840" style="s2">that sounds like well I talk to myself</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.930" end="00:33:31.320" style="s2">all day long okay so that&#39;s exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.840" end="00:33:34.350" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.320" end="00:33:36.570" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t mean right</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.350" end="00:33:38.610" style="s2">your internal just talking to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.570" end="00:33:42.330" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really and the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.610" end="00:33:45.060" style="s2">that is that talking to yourself is</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.330" end="00:33:47.010" style="s2">often what goes seriously awry in</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.060" end="00:33:49.290" style="s2">anxiety and depression this is what</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.010" end="00:33:50.760" style="s2">psycho psychologists and</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.290" end="00:33:52.680" style="s2">psychotherapists mean by rumination when</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.760" end="00:33:55.500" style="s2">that talking to yourself gets caught up</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.680" end="00:33:59.430" style="s2">in those parasitic processing spirals</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.500" end="00:34:01.710" style="s2">and it just spins out of control and</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.430" end="00:34:04.380" style="s2">destinies means something else he means</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.710" end="00:34:06.730" style="s2">he learned to do with himself what</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.380" end="00:34:09.260" style="s2">Socrates was able to do with</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.730" end="00:34:10.190" style="s2">he really learned how to internalize</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.260" end="00:34:15.230" style="s2">Socrates</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.190" end="00:34:17.030" style="s2">so although the Epicureans right pattern</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.230" end="00:34:18.679" style="s2">themselves on Socrates there they come</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.030" end="00:34:21.859" style="s2">out of Socrates right</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.679" end="00:34:23.480" style="s2">the stoicism is really something close</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.859" end="00:34:31.280" style="s2">to being a religion that&#39;s trying to</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.480" end="00:34:33.820" style="s2">internalize Socrates so that Socrates is</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.280" end="00:34:35.450" style="s2">basically and I don&#39;t mean this</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.820" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">disrespectfully because the stoic</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.450" end="00:34:39.440" style="s2">certainly wouldn&#39;t Socrates is turned</p>

<p begin="00:34:39.440" end="00:34:53.690" style="s2">technologies that you internalize into</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.869" end="00:34:57.710" style="s2">your meta cognition so what became</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.690" end="00:35:03.410" style="s2">crucial for Plato as we saw was</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.710" end="00:35:07.580" style="s2">argumentation but Francis tonie&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.410" end="00:35:12.640" style="s2">actual confrontation with Socrates was</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.580" end="00:35:15.080" style="s2">more important both Plato and</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:18.140" style="s2">anticipated in the transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.080" end="00:35:20.170" style="s2">Socrates is affording Plato sees this</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.140" end="00:35:22.400" style="s2">Hopf eating through argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.170" end="00:35:25.609" style="s2">this thing he sees it as happening</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.400" end="00:35:27.830" style="s2">through confrontation because and you</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.609" end="00:35:29.780" style="s2">can see how they&#39;re both right because</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.830" end="00:35:31.880" style="s2">in Socratic and lanka&#39;s Socrates comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.780" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">up and he argues with you but of course</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.880" end="00:35:36.230" style="s2">he&#39;s also confronting you we talked</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.550" style="s2">about how he sort of slamming the actual</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.230" end="00:35:39.550" style="s2">revolution into your face so</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.540" end="00:36:00.650" style="s2">anticipation is and Diogenes epitomizes</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.540" end="00:36:02.210" style="s2">this this confrontation and by looking</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.650" end="00:36:05.330" style="s2">at the kinds of confrontation we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.210" end="00:36:07.240" style="s2">start to see what the followers are</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.330" end="00:36:10.760" style="s2">Antasari</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.240" end="00:36:14.230" style="s2">so Diogenes basically does something</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.760" end="00:36:17.210" style="s2">analogous to provocative performance art</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.230" end="00:36:19.050" style="s2">he gets in your face in a way that tries</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.210" end="00:36:24.690" style="s2">to provoke you</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.050" end="00:36:27.420" style="s2">two realizations those kinds of insights</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.690" end="00:36:30.300" style="s2">that will challenge you he tries to</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.420" end="00:36:33.030" style="s2">basically create aporia in you that</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.300" end="00:36:34.920" style="s2">shocked experience that you had when</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.030" end="00:36:38.370" style="s2">confronting Socrates that challenges you</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.920" end="00:36:40.380" style="s2">to radically transform your life but</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.370" end="00:36:42.060" style="s2">instead of using argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.380" end="00:36:43.710" style="s2">discussion as Socrates did and Plato</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.060" end="00:36:45.540" style="s2">picked up on they were really trying to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.710" end="00:36:53.580" style="s2">hone in on how to try to be as</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.540" end="00:36:55.650" style="s2">provocative as possible right so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.580" end="00:36:58.470" style="s2">famously you know about one of these</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.650" end="00:37:01.260" style="s2">it became a card in the Tarot and it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.470" end="00:37:04.140" style="s2">became a album cover for Led Zeppelin</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.260" end="00:37:07.050" style="s2">you have the man right with with the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.140" end="00:37:09.150" style="s2">lamp walking wandering about the Hermit</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.050" end="00:37:11.550" style="s2">with the lamp well this is Diogenes he</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.150" end="00:37:13.140" style="s2">walked into the marketplace carrying</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.550" end="00:37:16.440" style="s2">around a lamp and looking and looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.140" end="00:37:19.260" style="s2">and looking and looking and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.440" end="00:37:20.970" style="s2">said well what are you looking for and</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.260" end="00:37:22.140" style="s2">then he just kept looking and looking</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.970" end="00:37:23.220" style="s2">what are you looking for what do you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.140" end="00:37:24.900" style="s2">what is it what is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.220" end="00:37:28.860" style="s2">and then he said I&#39;m looking for one</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.900" end="00:37:31.650" style="s2">honest man and then everybody gets got</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.860" end="00:37:33.990" style="s2">pissed off at him because they are so</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.650" end="00:37:35.880" style="s2">intrigued by all this looking and</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.990" end="00:37:39.660" style="s2">questing and then when it comes</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.880" end="00:37:41.670" style="s2">something that right and they&#39;re pissed</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.660" end="00:37:42.510" style="s2">off because they know he&#39;s right because</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.670" end="00:37:44.010" style="s2">they&#39;re in the marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.510" end="00:37:47.070" style="s2">everybody&#39;s lying and cheating and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.010" end="00:37:49.110" style="s2">stealing right but they don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.070" end="00:37:54.510" style="s2">know that they don&#39;t want to pay</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.110" end="00:37:56.160" style="s2">attention to that right now that sounds</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.510" end="00:37:57.810" style="s2">sort of yeah that&#39;s kind of cool and</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.160" end="00:37:59.730" style="s2">creatives yeah but there are journeys</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.810" end="00:38:02.520" style="s2">does other things that you might not</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.730" end="00:38:03.750" style="s2">find so cool or courageous well they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.520" end="00:38:04.680" style="s2">courageous at least but they&#39;re not you</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.750" end="00:38:07.350" style="s2">don&#39;t find them cool</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.680" end="00:38:08.700" style="s2">Diogenes also famously came into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.350" end="00:38:12.210" style="s2">center of the marketplace and</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.700" end="00:38:16.470" style="s2">masturbated in public and most raw we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.210" end="00:38:20.640" style="s2">all going like ooh ooh all right how are</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.470" end="00:38:25.950" style="s2">these two things possibly related well</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.640" end="00:38:28.740" style="s2">here&#39;s how they&#39;re related right</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.950" end="00:38:30.660" style="s2">the group of people that start to take</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.740" end="00:38:33.210" style="s2">shape in this tradition are called the</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.660" end="00:38:35.990" style="s2">cynics it&#39;s not our modern meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:38.790" style="s2">the word so I&#39;m gonna use a capital C</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.990" end="00:38:41.010" style="s2">because this just means you know being</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.790" end="00:38:43.440" style="s2">suspicious that everybody has an</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.010" end="00:38:46.319" style="s2">ulterior motive or a secret agenda</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.440" end="00:38:48.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not what is meant here this means</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.319" end="00:38:50.369" style="s2">actually living like a dog because</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.000" end="00:38:54.990" style="s2">Diogenes also famously lived outside of</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.369" end="00:38:56.640" style="s2">Athens in a barrel so let me tell you</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.990" end="00:38:59.730" style="s2">one more stories and we&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.640" end="00:39:01.619" style="s2">connect all of them so Alexander the</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.730" end="00:39:06.319" style="s2">future emperor of the world on his</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.619" end="00:39:06.319" style="s2">ascendance into godhood comes to visit</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.710" end="00:39:15.089" style="s2">Diogenes so you can imagine here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.430" end="00:39:17.640" style="s2">whole like all of this entourage and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.089" end="00:39:19.440" style="s2">error and here comes Alexander to visit</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.640" end="00:39:24.359" style="s2">Diogenes and he comes up to Dodge and</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.440" end="00:39:25.290" style="s2">easy says um I can give you like half of</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.359" end="00:39:28.530" style="s2">the world what do you want</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.290" end="00:39:30.270" style="s2">and all Diogenes says is could you move</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.530" end="00:39:35.309" style="s2">a little to the left you&#39;re blocking my</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.270" end="00:39:37.230" style="s2">sunlight so why is he living in a barrel</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.309" end="00:39:39.690" style="s2">why is that it that his answer to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.230" end="00:39:41.430" style="s2">Alexander why does he look for one</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.690" end="00:39:47.520" style="s2">honest man why does he masturbate in</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.430" end="00:39:50.099" style="s2">like what is going on well the cynics</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.520" end="00:39:57.210" style="s2">had a particular understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.099" end="00:40:00.750" style="s2">Hellenistic homicide they had the idea</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.210" end="00:40:02.930" style="s2">that what causes us to suffer isn&#39;t what</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.750" end="00:40:05.460" style="s2">we set up is what we set our heart on</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.930" end="00:40:07.319" style="s2">it&#39;s not just a particular that we set</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.460" end="00:40:09.809" style="s2">our heart on our life and we&#39;re afraid</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.319" end="00:40:11.970" style="s2">of losing it in death we can set our</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.809" end="00:40:17.420" style="s2">heart on all kinds of things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.970" end="00:40:20.250" style="s2">ultimately will cause us to suffer why</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.420" end="00:40:22.200" style="s2">well their idea is when we set our</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.250" end="00:40:26.450" style="s2">hearts on the wrong things those things</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.200" end="00:40:29.040" style="s2">will fail us and that&#39;s how we suffer</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.450" end="00:40:31.170" style="s2">you can see some similarities to some</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.040" end="00:40:33.900" style="s2">aspects of Buddhism and to some of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:36.859" style="s2">asceticism that the Buddha first</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.900" end="00:40:36.859" style="s2">practiced himself</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.200" end="00:40:43.749" style="s2">so the cynics came to the conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.970" end="00:40:45.700" style="s2">that what the Hellenistic period was</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.749" end="00:40:48.970" style="s2">showing is that many of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.700" end="00:40:50.829" style="s2">we take for granted and think about what</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.970" end="00:40:53.170" style="s2">that mean where it means we take them as</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.829" end="00:40:56.859" style="s2">being part of the structure of reality</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.170" end="00:40:59.019" style="s2">are actually not fundamentally real they</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.859" end="00:41:01.869" style="s2">don&#39;t have staying power they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.019" end="00:41:04.930" style="s2">permanent they&#39;re actually man-made they</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.869" end="00:41:08.890" style="s2">are historically culturally dependent</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.930" end="00:41:10.329" style="s2">and they are temporary and when we set</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.890" end="00:41:13.329" style="s2">ourselves on these things</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.329" end="00:41:15.910" style="s2">the current of events can easily and</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.329" end="00:41:19.329" style="s2">readily wash them away and then we are</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.910" end="00:41:24.359" style="s2">left bereft our hearts are torn from us</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.329" end="00:41:24.359" style="s2">and that is how we experience Thomas I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.569" end="00:41:32.890" style="s2">okay so what should we do then</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.319" end="00:41:35.859" style="s2">well you should learn not just acquire a</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.890" end="00:41:37.329" style="s2">set of beliefs progenies isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.859" end="00:41:42.849" style="s2">believing things he&#39;s living in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.329" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">certain place in a certain way right you</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.849" end="00:41:49.180" style="s2">should learn how to set your heart on</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:52.839" style="s2">the kinds of things that are not</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.180" end="00:41:57.069" style="s2">man-made are not contingent that will</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.839" end="00:41:59.200" style="s2">not be swept away by events what are</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.069" end="00:42:02.049" style="s2">those kinds of things well one it are</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.200" end="00:42:06.239" style="s2">the laws of the natural world so this is</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.049" end="00:42:09.249" style="s2">why this dodging Eve&#39;s lives in a barrel</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.239" end="00:42:11.440" style="s2">he wants to live as much as he can like</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.249" end="00:42:12.670" style="s2">an animal in one sense in another sense</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.440" end="00:42:15.640" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want to live like an animal</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.670" end="00:42:19.119" style="s2">at all but he wants to live as much by</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.640" end="00:42:21.549" style="s2">natural law as opposed to man-made law</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.119" end="00:42:24.039" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t want to be invested in</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.549" end="00:42:27.849" style="s2">man-made cultural institutions or</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.039" end="00:42:31.210" style="s2">practices cultural political value</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.849" end="00:42:33.220" style="s2">systems because those will end and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.210" end="00:42:39.069" style="s2">if we have set our heart upon them our</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.220" end="00:42:44.710" style="s2">hearts will be broken so you want to as</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.069" end="00:42:48.430" style="s2">much as you can live according to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.710" end="00:42:52.920" style="s2">patterns of nature because those are not</p>

<p begin="00:42:52.920" end="00:43:00.249" style="s2">with the change in history or culture</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:03.339" style="s2">now if it was just that then of course</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.249" end="00:43:09.849" style="s2">dodging ease would just live like an</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.339" end="00:43:12.640" style="s2">animal but the cynics also said in</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.849" end="00:43:21.160" style="s2">addition to natural law there are moral</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.640" end="00:43:28.980" style="s2">laws there are moral laws as to what is</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.160" end="00:43:28.980" style="s2">a proper way to be a good human being</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.940" end="00:43:35.019" style="s2">now and you may say but isn&#39;t that all</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.220" end="00:43:37.210" style="s2">culturally relative and of course that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.019" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">a big dispute but one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.210" end="00:43:43.690" style="s2">the cynics did was to try and make a</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:47.259" style="s2">distinction between moral principles</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.690" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">that are culturally based sorry moral</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.259" end="00:43:52.359" style="s2">principles that are not culturally based</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:56.170" style="s2">and purity codes that are culturally</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.359" end="00:43:58.569" style="s2">historically based and they are similar</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.170" end="00:44:01.829" style="s2">to each other in ways such that we can</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.569" end="00:44:01.829" style="s2">often confuse them together</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.730" end="00:44:10.450" style="s2">so a good way of understanding this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.770" end="00:44:17.980" style="s2">in terms of more modern language of</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.450" end="00:44:21.760" style="s2">guilt versus shame now again we use</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.980" end="00:44:23.619" style="s2">these terms interchangeably and we</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.760" end="00:44:26.349" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t because having a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.619" end="00:44:28.570" style="s2">between them is useful guilt is your</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.349" end="00:44:31.960" style="s2">distress at having realized you&#39;ve both</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.570" end="00:44:34.599" style="s2">broken a moral principle shame is your</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.960" end="00:44:38.950" style="s2">distress at having violated a purity</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.599" end="00:44:41.770" style="s2">code let me give you an example if as I</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.950" end="00:44:43.780" style="s2">was delivering this video there was some</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.770" end="00:44:46.359" style="s2">sort of malfunction in my clothing and</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.780" end="00:44:48.280" style="s2">my clothing suddenly fell down I would</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.359" end="00:44:53.230" style="s2">be deeply embarrassed I would experience</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.280" end="00:44:56.109" style="s2">shame why because I violated a code a</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.230" end="00:44:58.690" style="s2">cultural code which is I&#39;m supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.109" end="00:45:04.300" style="s2">be fully clothed in a public discourse</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.690" end="00:45:07.720" style="s2">and I am alright but if that happened</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.300" end="00:45:08.890" style="s2">have I done anything immoral well so you</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.720" end="00:45:11.650" style="s2">would say no you didn&#39;t do anything</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.890" end="00:45:17.130" style="s2">immoral you didn&#39;t do anything wrong so</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.650" end="00:45:20.020" style="s2">I don&#39;t feel guilt I feel shame right</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.130" end="00:45:25.980" style="s2">sometimes they can be against each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.020" end="00:45:28.510" style="s2">right you may be made to feel ashamed</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.980" end="00:45:32.170" style="s2">even though you&#39;re doing something that</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.510" end="00:45:34.810" style="s2">you believe let&#39;s say in a justified way</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.170" end="00:45:36.609" style="s2">is morally right many people who</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.810" end="00:45:39.040" style="s2">supported blacks during the civil rights</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.609" end="00:45:42.310" style="s2">movement were subjected to terrific</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.040" end="00:45:44.349" style="s2">amounts of shaming even though they</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.310" end="00:45:46.500" style="s2">didn&#39;t experience any guilt in what they</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.349" end="00:45:46.500" style="s2">were doing</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.250" end="00:45:53.740" style="s2">see purity codes are designed to keep</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.770" end="00:45:55.900" style="s2">the categorical boundaries that make a</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.740" end="00:45:57.700" style="s2">culture in a particular historical</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.900" end="00:46:00.190" style="s2">period run the way it&#39;s running</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.700" end="00:46:02.410" style="s2">they are highly tied up with the</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.190" end="00:46:04.270" style="s2">invested power structures who are</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.410" end="00:46:08.220" style="s2">usually highly invested in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.270" end="00:46:08.220" style="s2">things running the way they&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.420" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">so we have lots of important boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.790" end="00:46:16.690" style="s2">that are protected by purity codes so</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:17.530" style="s2">for example just to give you one more</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.690" end="00:46:20.110" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.530" end="00:46:21.610" style="s2">just to make it clear none of you I hope</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.110" end="00:46:29.530" style="s2">would be distressed my me doing the</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.610" end="00:46:32.380" style="s2">following here&#39;s some water okay imagine</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.530" end="00:46:35.050" style="s2">if I do the following I collect lots of</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.380" end="00:46:38.590" style="s2">saliva in my mouth lots of it just tons</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.050" end="00:46:42.190" style="s2">and tons of saliva and then I spit it</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.590" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">into the glass yeah until there&#39;s gobs</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.190" end="00:46:47.350" style="s2">and gobs of saliva in my glass and now</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:51.700" style="s2">that I swirl it around just imagine it</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.350" end="00:46:55.750" style="s2">come on and then I drink it and now</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.700" end="00:46:58.060" style="s2">you&#39;re going air now notice if I mix the</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.750" end="00:47:01.090" style="s2">water inside my mouth and swallow you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.060" end="00:47:03.790" style="s2">fine with that but if the saliva comes</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.090" end="00:47:07.930" style="s2">outside of my mouth into the glass you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.790" end="00:47:10.570" style="s2">find it repellent okay that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.930" end="00:47:13.000" style="s2">there&#39;s an important purity code here</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.570" end="00:47:15.820" style="s2">the purity code is this is the boundary</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.000" end="00:47:18.430" style="s2">of John and things inside this are John</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.820" end="00:47:20.950" style="s2">and pieces of John should not come out</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.430" end="00:47:22.930" style="s2">into the world John should not spit John</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.950" end="00:47:25.180" style="s2">should not fart John should not burp</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.930" end="00:47:28.810" style="s2">John should not cut his fingernails off</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.180" end="00:47:31.080" style="s2">and leave them in front of you John</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.810" end="00:47:33.370" style="s2">should even not leave his bed unmade</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.080" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">because he&#39;s leaving his impression</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.370" end="00:47:40.780" style="s2">behind and that&#39;s yucky okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:43.660" style="s2">purity code now very often we confuse</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.780" end="00:47:47.070" style="s2">purity codes with moral codes we confuse</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.660" end="00:47:50.950" style="s2">purity codes because we confuse our</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.070" end="00:47:54.700" style="s2">disgust reaction that&#39;s often purity</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.950" end="00:47:56.860" style="s2">code based with a moral judgment that</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.700" end="00:48:01.420" style="s2">should be based on reasoning and</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.860" end="00:48:04.900" style="s2">evidence please listen to me very</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.420" end="00:48:05.590" style="s2">carefully with what I want to say first</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.900" end="00:48:07.720" style="s2">I&#39;ll give you something</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.590" end="00:48:09.550" style="s2">non-controversial both of my parents are</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.720" end="00:48:14.080" style="s2">dead but suppose they were alive I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.550" end="00:48:22.390" style="s2">want to see them having sex I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.080" end="00:48:23.050" style="s2">would go ooh is that a moral argument of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.390" end="00:48:24.850" style="s2">course not</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.050" end="00:48:28.120" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing immoral with them having</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.850" end="00:48:30.760" style="s2">sex that&#39;s why I&#39;m here in a similar way</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.120" end="00:48:31.450" style="s2">and please hear what I&#39;m saying I might</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.450" end="00:48:38.620" style="s2">see two men having sex that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.590" end="00:48:39.490" style="s2">that that is anyway a moral judgment on</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.620" end="00:48:43.420" style="s2">my part</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.490" end="00:48:45.850" style="s2">a lot of the waves we have persecuted</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.420" end="00:48:48.730" style="s2">gay people is because we have confused a</p>

<p begin="00:48:48.730" end="00:48:57.340" style="s2">legitimate moral argument the people who</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:49:00.010" style="s2">started the process and we&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.340" end="00:49:02.920" style="s2">pulling them apart today right now right</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.010" end="00:49:05.470" style="s2">here right now were the cynics what</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.920" end="00:49:08.500" style="s2">Diogenes was trying to do was get you to</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.470" end="00:49:11.290" style="s2">pull apart the moral code from the</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.500" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">purity code he did nothing immoral by</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.290" end="00:49:18.040" style="s2">masturbating in public but although lots</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:20.410" style="s2">of people were doing stuff that was</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.040" end="00:49:25.530" style="s2">culturally acceptable in the marketplace</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.410" end="00:49:25.530" style="s2">most of it was immoral do you see</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.070" end="00:49:31.930" style="s2">alexander comes to him and offers him</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.390" end="00:49:35.230" style="s2">power and fame but those are all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.930" end="00:49:37.030" style="s2">things the stoic say are no good because</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.230" end="00:49:39.880" style="s2">sorry the cynics they&#39;re no good because</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.030" end="00:49:44.290" style="s2">if you set your hearts on them those are</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.880" end="00:49:47.980" style="s2">man-made human defined and therefore</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.290" end="00:49:53.610" style="s2">your heart will eventually be broken set</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.980" end="00:49:58.170" style="s2">your heart on what won&#39;t get broken</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.610" end="00:50:02.530" style="s2">so the cynics developed this very</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.170" end="00:50:06.160" style="s2">powerful provocative way of enacting</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.530" end="00:50:09.280" style="s2">Socrates and trying to get us the cynics</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.160" end="00:50:11.590" style="s2">are trying to get us to realize what</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.280" end="00:50:14.950" style="s2">we&#39;re setting our heart on and to pull</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.590" end="00:50:19.150" style="s2">apart our automatic disgust reactions</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.950" end="00:50:21.180" style="s2">from moral reflection on what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.150" end="00:50:21.180" style="s2">doing</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.720" end="00:50:35.430" style="s2">now a Dodge eni&#39;s has a disciple cradies</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.420" end="00:50:38.380" style="s2">and then creatives has a disciple Zeno</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.430" end="00:50:43.750" style="s2">this is not the Zeno of Zeno&#39;s paradoxes</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.380" end="00:50:46.210" style="s2">this is a difference you know now</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.750" end="00:50:48.250" style="s2">whereas the cynics tended to be sort of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.210" end="00:50:51.220" style="s2">hostile to Plato because of his emphasis</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.250" end="00:50:53.020" style="s2">on argumentation Zeno was deeply</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.220" end="00:50:55.960" style="s2">influenced by the cynics but he also</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.020" end="00:50:58.660" style="s2">really liked Plato he saw that there was</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.960" end="00:51:01.030" style="s2">value in the argumentation and he</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.660" end="00:51:02.410" style="s2">realized that there&#39;s deep connections</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.030" end="00:51:04.720" style="s2">between your ability to rationally</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.410" end="00:51:07.510" style="s2">reflect and your ability to use your</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.720" end="00:51:12.330" style="s2">reason so what he wanted to do was</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.510" end="00:51:15.880" style="s2">integrate the rational argumentation and</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.330" end="00:51:21.550" style="s2">reasoning of Plato with right the</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.880" end="00:51:25.060" style="s2">provocative aspects of the cynics so he</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.550" end="00:51:26.530" style="s2">crafted a way of life that put the two</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.060" end="00:51:29.650" style="s2">together and then he would walk up and</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.530" end="00:51:33.990" style="s2">down a stoah this is a covered colonnade</p>
