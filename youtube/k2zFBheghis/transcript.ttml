<p begin="00:00:17.369" end="00:00:23.820" style="s2">I decided to come in so as socially</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:26.130" style="s2">isolate in Alberta instead of in BC</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.820" end="00:00:27.960" style="s2">partly because we have the trip planned</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.130" end="00:00:29.160" style="s2">for a while it cost me a lot of money it</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.960" end="00:00:33.899" style="s2">took me a long time to say out for this</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.160" end="00:00:36.989" style="s2">trip and also because my roommate back</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.899" end="00:00:40.829" style="s2">in Vancouver is more medically fragile</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.989" end="00:00:42.440" style="s2">than my mom and stepped out here so if</p>

<p begin="00:00:42.440" end="00:00:48.300" style="s2">we&#39;re a lot less likely to pass it on to</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.670" end="00:00:51.750" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s more medically fragile as</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.300" end="00:00:54.210" style="s2">well as it&#39;s what&#39;s besides going</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.750" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">through the airport which was very dead</p>

<p begin="00:01:03.120" end="00:01:07.799" style="s2">other when itself but during this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.129" end="00:01:11.340" style="s2">over the last few days I&#39;ve realized</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.799" end="00:01:13.140" style="s2">that I have a lot to offer both just Who</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.340" end="00:01:16.590" style="s2">I am on this planet and what I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.140" end="00:01:18.720" style="s2">and the technology cooperative and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.590" end="00:01:20.729" style="s2">troops that that I&#39;m my journey when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.720" end="00:01:24.270" style="s2">have to give but also as somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.729" end="00:01:25.290" style="s2">had to solve isolate for a long time we</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.270" end="00:01:27.360" style="s2">need the world to do what I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.290" end="00:01:29.100" style="s2">doing for the last few years I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.360" end="00:01:33.240" style="s2">doing it for contagion reasons I was</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.100" end="00:01:36.930" style="s2">doing it for sensory reasons and mental</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.240" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">issues but now the world needs to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.930" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">that the world needs to be in their</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:47.600" style="s2">house 90% of the time and with that is a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:51.600" style="s2">lot of emotional and financial and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.600" end="00:01:52.860" style="s2">interpersonal emotions and stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.600" end="00:01:55.079" style="s2">going to be brought up so I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.860" end="00:01:57.240" style="s2">release a few videos on that on what</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2">hopefully if anyone can get anything out</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.240" end="00:02:00.450" style="s2">of what I&#39;ve been through the last few</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.680" end="00:02:03.299" style="s2">years I want to offer that to people</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.450" end="00:02:07.259" style="s2">also what I am here to do in the journey</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.299" end="00:02:09.300" style="s2">that I&#39;m showcasing is that everyone has</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.259" end="00:02:11.190" style="s2">something to contribute and my something</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.300" end="00:02:12.740" style="s2">to contribute the more I step into it</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.190" end="00:02:16.610" style="s2">and the more I let go of everything</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.740" end="00:02:18.770" style="s2">contribute is my brain likes to create</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.610" end="00:02:21.140" style="s2">solutions it can&#39;t actually make the</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.770" end="00:02:23.720" style="s2">solutions I don&#39;t have the energy or</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.140" end="00:02:26.270" style="s2">finances to pay somebody else to use</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.720" end="00:02:29.480" style="s2">their energy to make them but I can</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.270" end="00:02:31.490" style="s2">generate solutions between my house in</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.480" end="00:02:33.080" style="s2">Vancouver and staying with my mom I</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.490" end="00:02:36.310" style="s2">think I generated about a dozen I could</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.080" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">even tweet because we were in the air</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.310" end="00:02:41.330" style="s2">and I can have a conversation and that</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:46.430" style="s2">is what I&#39;ve been doing before the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.330" end="00:02:49.460" style="s2">coronavirus hit I&#39;ve been offering my</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.430" end="00:02:51.710" style="s2">solutions to the world and what a great</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.460" end="00:02:54.620" style="s2">time to be able to come together and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.710" end="00:02:56.300" style="s2">create a world that works for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.620" end="00:02:57.830" style="s2">from love abundance and peace because we</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.300" end="00:02:59.540" style="s2">can see what happens when we feel like</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.830" end="00:03:01.550" style="s2">we&#39;re in LAC and we feel like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.540" end="00:03:03.470" style="s2">scared in scarcity and we want someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.550" end="00:03:05.480" style="s2">else to have the answers they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.470" end="00:03:06.920" style="s2">the answers which I think more and more</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.480" end="00:03:09.410" style="s2">people can see clearly during this</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.920" end="00:03:12.320" style="s2">crisis our governments are doing kind of</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.410" end="00:03:15.020" style="s2">the best job they can and it is woefully</p>

<p begin="00:04:28.680" end="00:04:33.150" style="s2">what I can offer during this time of</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:37.080" style="s2">crisis is to let go of certainty and</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.150" end="00:04:39.810" style="s2">embrace uncertainty because life gets</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.080" end="00:04:43.770" style="s2">easier but that will be its own series</p>
