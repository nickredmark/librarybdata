<p begin="00:00:06.450" end="00:00:14.820" style="s2">April 2019 Q&amp;A probably won&#39;t do another</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.400" end="00:00:16.410" style="s2">one till June I&#39;m traveling almost</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:18.170" style="s2">completely through May although it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.410" end="00:00:21.570" style="s2">getting easier to do these on the road</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.170" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">camera quality usually isn&#39;t as good so</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.570" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">we&#39;ll see what happens I like doing but</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:28.890" style="s2">but be nice to do it with the right</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">equipment so look before we get started</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.890" end="00:00:32.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a bunch of things I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:35.940" style="s2">tell you about I hope that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.340" end="00:00:38.700" style="s2">interested in them the first one and the</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.940" end="00:00:41.640" style="s2">oddest one I suppose is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.700" end="00:00:45.390" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be debating the renowned</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.640" end="00:00:47.579" style="s2">Marxist philosopher Slava Dziedzic who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.390" end="00:00:51.690" style="s2">a very well well-known continental</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.579" end="00:00:55.070" style="s2">academic tomorrow at the Sony Centre in</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.690" end="00:00:59.879" style="s2">Toronto at 7:30 on the topic happiness</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.070" end="00:01:01.920" style="s2">capitalism versus Marxism we&#39;ve decided</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.879" end="00:01:03.960" style="s2">we&#39;ll livestream this event for those</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.920" end="00:01:07.500" style="s2">who might be what interested in watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.960" end="00:01:09.030" style="s2">the events as they unfold tickets for</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.500" end="00:01:09.570" style="s2">the livestream are available on my</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.030" end="00:01:11.939" style="s2">website</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.570" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">Jordan B Petersen calm but I&#39;ll put all</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.939" end="00:01:17.460" style="s2">the proper links below so if you pick up</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:19.500" style="s2">a livestream ticket you can view the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.460" end="00:01:21.960" style="s2">debate at any time up to 30 days</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.500" end="00:01:24.570" style="s2">afterwards we&#39;re also going to put the</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.960" end="00:01:27.090" style="s2">debate eventually up on YouTube probably</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.570" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">within a month so if you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.090" end="00:01:30.299" style="s2">watch it live well then you can always</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">wait watch it later but if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.299" end="00:01:35.430" style="s2">participate in it in so far as you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:38.520" style="s2">do that electronically then I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.430" end="00:01:40.020" style="s2">live stream idea is the right one we</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.520" end="00:01:42.240" style="s2">thought we&#39;d run it as an experiment</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.020" end="00:01:44.970" style="s2">anyways maybe you can have a Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.240" end="00:01:47.220" style="s2">vs. Dziedzic party if that&#39;s the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.970" end="00:01:50.250" style="s2">party you&#39;re interested in on a Friday</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.220" end="00:01:53.460" style="s2">night I&#39;d also like to know let you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.250" end="00:01:56.790" style="s2">that season two of the Jordan B Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.460" end="00:01:58.979" style="s2">podcast is now started with the first</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.790" end="00:02:01.110" style="s2">three episodes up two of them are twelve</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.979" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">rules for life lectures taken from my</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.110" end="00:02:07.320" style="s2">tour last year one of them from Seattle</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">and one from Portland as well as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.320" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">interview with General Stanley</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:12.840" style="s2">McChrystal retired four-star general and</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">former commander</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.840" end="00:02:20.310" style="s2">US forces Afghanistan we partnered this</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:22.650" style="s2">year with Westwood one largest audio</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.310" end="00:02:25.680" style="s2">network in the US and my daughter</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.650" end="00:02:27.569" style="s2">Mikaela is going to serve as co-host</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.680" end="00:02:31.140" style="s2">so hopefully that allowed a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.569" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">of lightness and warmth and a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.140" end="00:02:36.300" style="s2">of humor to the podcast and we&#39;re hoping</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:38.670" style="s2">as a consequence of partnering with</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.300" end="00:02:40.380" style="s2">Westwood One which also means by the way</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.670" end="00:02:44.040" style="s2">that the podcast will now be</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.380" end="00:02:46.110" style="s2">ad-supported that that would help</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.040" end="00:02:48.090" style="s2">incentivize me to make sure that I got a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.110" end="00:02:51.090" style="s2">podcast out every week it was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.090" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">haphazard over the last year the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.090" end="00:02:56.130" style="s2">was generally a lower priority item and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:59.099" style="s2">we&#39;ve decided this year to make it well</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.130" end="00:03:03.780" style="s2">a top priority or perhaps at least in</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.099" end="00:03:05.400" style="s2">the top five let&#39;s say so and we hope</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.780" end="00:03:07.290" style="s2">we&#39;ll get higher production quality out</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.400" end="00:03:09.330" style="s2">of it and be able to find a larger</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.290" end="00:03:11.010" style="s2">audience and so I guess we&#39;ll see how</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.330" end="00:03:14.489" style="s2">that goes the initial feedback has been</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.010" end="00:03:18.510" style="s2">pretty good with about 600 thousand or</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.489" end="00:03:20.220" style="s2">so views per episode so that seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.510" end="00:03:21.410" style="s2">performing quite nicely so thank you all</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.220" end="00:03:24.120" style="s2">for that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.410" end="00:03:26.820" style="s2">Jordan B Petersen videos on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.120" end="00:03:28.650" style="s2">which will will also feature most of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.820" end="00:03:33.569" style="s2">podcast content like it has in the past</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.650" end="00:03:36.150" style="s2">will remain unmonitored as previously no</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.569" end="00:03:39.750" style="s2">next we will get to the questions I</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.150" end="00:03:41.880" style="s2">promise I&#39;m going to London in May to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.750" end="00:03:44.850" style="s2">celebrate and promote the release of the</p>

<p begin="00:03:58.889" end="00:04:04.950" style="s2">I&#39;ll leave the links below I&#39;m extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.269" end="00:04:06.989" style="s2">excited one of the things I was really</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.950" end="00:04:10.579" style="s2">excited about this year you know I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.989" end="00:04:15.180" style="s2">the foreword to Alexander Solzhenitsyn</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.579" end="00:04:17.459" style="s2">abridged Gulag Archipelago so that was</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.180" end="00:04:20.100" style="s2">that was a I was a pretty good honor</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:22.440" style="s2">that was a last week by the way in New</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.100" end="00:04:26.100" style="s2">York I talked to his son ignite and we</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.440" end="00:04:28.950" style="s2">we spent about an hour discussing as</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.100" end="00:04:30.480" style="s2">Oracle material related to the Gulag and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.950" end="00:04:32.670" style="s2">that&#39;ll be released with the audio</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.480" end="00:04:34.470" style="s2">version which I&#39;ve read the foreword</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.670" end="00:04:36.060" style="s2">because I as I said I wrote the foreword</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.470" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">and they&#39;d not I believe read the rest</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.060" end="00:04:39.630" style="s2">of the audio but that will be released</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:41.250" style="s2">an audiobook form fairly soon along with</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.630" end="00:04:43.320" style="s2">that interview so that was extremely</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.250" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">interesting he&#39;s a very accomplished man</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.320" end="00:04:48.860" style="s2">in his own right is a pianist and and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:53.100" style="s2">conductor and has a very successful</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.860" end="00:04:55.880" style="s2">international career so he has his</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.100" end="00:04:58.950" style="s2">father&#39;s intellect that&#39;s for sure so</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.880" end="00:05:00.510" style="s2">it&#39;s really exciting for me it was very</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.950" end="00:05:02.460" style="s2">exciting for me to do that forward but</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.510" end="00:05:04.530" style="s2">it&#39;s I would say equally exciting to</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.460" end="00:05:06.780" style="s2">have a paperback in the great tradition</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.530" end="00:05:09.450" style="s2">of penguin paperbacks which I&#39;ve loved</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.780" end="00:05:12.630" style="s2">ever since I was old enough to know the</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.450" end="00:05:14.850" style="s2">difference between let&#39;s know let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.630" end="00:05:19.040" style="s2">rephrase that old enough to start to</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.850" end="00:05:22.410" style="s2">read serious literature and so to have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.040" end="00:05:25.260" style="s2">paperback come out on the penguin label</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.410" end="00:05:28.200" style="s2">is well I just saw the first copy of it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.260" end="00:05:32.430" style="s2">this week they sent it to me it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.200" end="00:05:34.020" style="s2">to believe man it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a I think I</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.430" end="00:05:35.940" style="s2">don&#39;t even how you think I even had that</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.020" end="00:05:38.370" style="s2">as a dream you know I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.940" end="00:05:40.800" style="s2">think that was there ever any likelihood</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.370" end="00:05:42.450" style="s2">of that so it&#39;s better than a dream come</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.800" end="00:05:45.390" style="s2">true in some sense because it&#39;s a dream</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.450" end="00:05:48.720" style="s2">that I never even suspected might occur</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.390" end="00:05:51.630" style="s2">that came true so that&#39;s good anyways</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.720" end="00:05:54.930" style="s2">you can pre-order that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.630" end="00:05:56.730" style="s2">inclined to it&#39;s discounted in price of</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.930" end="00:06:00.030" style="s2">course too though in comparison to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.730" end="00:06:02.910" style="s2">hardcover maybe it make a good gift for</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.030" end="00:06:09.060" style="s2">someone you like assuming you like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.910" end="00:06:10.950" style="s2">book so finally most of the time when I</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.060" end="00:06:13.500" style="s2">do a Q&amp;A I also talk a little bit about</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.950" end="00:06:15.980" style="s2">two programs that my colleagues and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.500" end="00:06:19.500" style="s2">have developed one called self authoring</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.980" end="00:06:21.780" style="s2">dot-com and the other called understand</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.500" end="00:06:23.640" style="s2">myself common the first one is a set of</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.780" end="00:06:26.070" style="s2">writing programs that help you write an</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.640" end="00:06:28.560" style="s2">autobiography and a description of your</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.070" end="00:06:32.130" style="s2">present personality and a plan for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.560" end="00:06:37.020" style="s2">future and they&#39;re all laid out so that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.130" end="00:06:39.260" style="s2">doing that is what guided and scaffold</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.020" end="00:06:42.050" style="s2">and and simplified</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.260" end="00:06:44.240" style="s2">so that you don&#39;t have to answer the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.050" end="00:06:47.450" style="s2">terribly difficult question who was I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.240" end="00:06:51.380" style="s2">when I grew up till now all as one</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.450" end="00:06:53.150" style="s2">question anyway a lot of people have</p>

<p begin="00:08:43.430" end="00:08:48.710" style="s2">that we have but I have had many people</p>

<p begin="00:08:48.710" end="00:08:52.060" style="s2">authoring program a lot of the things</p>

<p begin="00:08:52.060" end="00:08:56.529" style="s2">other democratically had begin to recede</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.400" end="00:08:59.620" style="s2">into the past where they belonged so</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.529" end="00:09:01.660" style="s2">anyways we&#39;re offering those programs</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.620" end="00:09:04.690" style="s2">the self authoring program you could buy</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.660" end="00:09:06.700" style="s2">two for one there&#39;s a special on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.690" end="00:09:08.020" style="s2">rather permanent special because it</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.700" end="00:09:09.790" style="s2">seems to be very popular</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.020" end="00:09:12.700" style="s2">anyways that means you can buy one for</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.790" end="00:09:16.570" style="s2">you and a friend and it&#39;s 20% off and so</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.700" end="00:09:18.670" style="s2">is understand myself calm that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.570" end="00:09:20.440" style="s2">personality test that I developed with</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.670" end="00:09:22.720" style="s2">my colleagues that gives you a big five</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.440" end="00:09:25.020" style="s2">read out extraversion neuroticism</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.720" end="00:09:28.570" style="s2">agreeableness conscientiousness and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.020" end="00:09:31.779" style="s2">openness I think I got all five there</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.570" end="00:09:33.760" style="s2">and ten of the aspects that make them up</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.779" end="00:09:36.400" style="s2">so it&#39;s very high resolution personality</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.760" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">test and it&#39;s bit on the harsh side it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.400" end="00:09:40.180" style="s2">not designed to make you feel good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:42.220" style="s2">designed to actually tell you about your</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.180" end="00:09:44.080" style="s2">strengths and weaknesses and look man</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.220" end="00:09:46.450" style="s2">everybody has strengths and weaknesses</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.080" end="00:09:48.940" style="s2">so you know if there&#39;s a bit that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.450" end="00:09:50.560" style="s2">harsh in the in the test results don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.940" end="00:09:53.830" style="s2">feel too bad it&#39;s not like you&#39;re alone</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.560" end="00:09:57.790" style="s2">in that anyways the code for the 20%</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.830" end="00:10:01.030" style="s2">discount is May and it&#39;s valid until the</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.790" end="00:10:04.870" style="s2">end of May and so look these these</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.030" end="00:10:07.150" style="s2">programs you know let&#39;s to think about</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.870" end="00:10:08.560" style="s2">the future authoring program it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.150" end="00:10:11.530" style="s2">really a good thing to have a plan for</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.560" end="00:10:13.300" style="s2">your life you know you&#39;re not gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.530" end="00:10:15.010" style="s2">what you need you want less you aim at</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.300" end="00:10:16.690" style="s2">it and you know I&#39;m gonna aim at it</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.010" end="00:10:17.890" style="s2">unless you know what it is and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.690" end="00:10:20.110" style="s2">not gonna know what it is unless you</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.890" end="00:10:22.270" style="s2">think about what it is that you need and</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.110" end="00:10:23.860" style="s2">you want and it&#39;s hard for people to do</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.270" end="00:10:26.170" style="s2">that and we&#39;re not trained to do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.860" end="00:10:28.510" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen to us in school doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.170" end="00:10:31.000" style="s2">happen to us in university we liked</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.510" end="00:10:32.680" style="s2">future authoring program and just and</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.000" end="00:10:35.200" style="s2">the past authoring program in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.680" end="00:10:37.030" style="s2">present Ottoman program they all the</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.200" end="00:10:38.470" style="s2">clinical evidence about programs like</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.030" end="00:10:42.820" style="s2">this suggests that they work very well</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.470" end="00:10:44.560" style="s2">and they&#39;re there and you can do them</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.820" end="00:10:47.190" style="s2">badly that&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.560" end="00:10:48.880" style="s2">of cool is you don&#39;t have to get all</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.190" end="00:10:50.500" style="s2">perfectionistic about it you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.880" end="00:10:51.520" style="s2">to write a perfect account of your past</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.500" end="00:10:53.980" style="s2">and you don&#39;t have to come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.520" end="00:10:55.810" style="s2">right plan for the future cuz you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.980" end="00:10:57.610" style="s2">gonna anyways because what do you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.810" end="00:10:59.800" style="s2">about what the future is going to bring</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.610" end="00:11:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s still worthwhile to chart a course</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.800" end="00:11:03.070" style="s2">though you know because it increases the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.600" end="00:11:05.470" style="s2">probability that you&#39;ll get what you</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.070" end="00:11:08.110" style="s2">want so</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.470" end="00:11:11.080" style="s2">you know my my colleagues Daniel Higgins</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.110" end="00:11:13.900" style="s2">he&#39;s at Harvard and or was at Harvard</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.080" end="00:11:17.260" style="s2">he&#39;s a Pete as a PhD from Harvard and</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.900" end="00:11:20.560" style="s2">and Bob peel who it&#39;s just resigned or</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.260" end="00:11:22.180" style="s2">just retired from McGill we built these</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.560" end="00:11:23.470" style="s2">programs over a couple of years along</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.180" end="00:11:27.160" style="s2">with some of my graduate students</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.470" end="00:11:30.540" style="s2">particularly Raymond Mawr and we think</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.160" end="00:11:33.130" style="s2">they&#39;ve been really useful for people so</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.540" end="00:11:36.730" style="s2">and you know we were trying to figure</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.130" end="00:11:39.490" style="s2">out low-cost psychological interventions</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.730" end="00:11:41.650" style="s2">that could be scaled that would not do</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.490" end="00:11:43.120" style="s2">people any harm that they could do on</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.650" end="00:11:46.330" style="s2">their own with minimal administrative</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.120" end="00:11:49.960" style="s2">overhead and cost and so like that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.330" end="00:11:52.120" style="s2">philosophy that underlies them so well</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.960" end="00:11:54.370" style="s2">that&#39;s enough of that I should also</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.120" end="00:11:56.770" style="s2">mention finally for those of you who</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.370" end="00:12:00.910" style="s2">might be interested I was in New York</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.770" end="00:12:04.210" style="s2">this week on Monday for example I taped</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.910" end="00:12:06.040" style="s2">16 interviews with dr. oz now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.210" end="00:12:07.780" style="s2">man with energy I&#39;ll tell you we did</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.040" end="00:12:10.180" style="s2">that I was pretty much fried by the end</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.780" end="00:12:12.330" style="s2">of that his wife Lisa who&#39;s very bright</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.180" end="00:12:15.520" style="s2">person and who knows my work very well</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.330" end="00:12:18.640" style="s2">asked wrote out all the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.520" end="00:12:20.200" style="s2">dr. oz used to interview me and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.640" end="00:12:22.240" style="s2">were killer questions I had to think</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.200" end="00:12:23.650" style="s2">about every one of them and so we seemed</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.240" end="00:12:25.660" style="s2">to have a good time there there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.650" end="00:12:29.290" style="s2">bit of a studio audience there and they</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.660" end="00:12:32.230" style="s2">seem to like the discussion and so these</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.290" end="00:12:36.100" style="s2">will appear as 10 to 15 minute video</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.230" end="00:12:40.000" style="s2">clips either on dr. Oz&#39;s broadcast show</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.100" end="00:12:41.980" style="s2">or on youtube or both and you know never</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.000" end="00:12:42.910" style="s2">know they might show up on my channel as</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.980" end="00:12:46.780" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.910" end="00:12:49.540" style="s2">but be forewarned they&#39;re coming and</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.780" end="00:12:50.950" style="s2">hopefully what did he call them he</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.540" end="00:12:53.200" style="s2">thought it would be useful if there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.950" end="00:12:54.790" style="s2">good 10 minute clips of some of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.200" end="00:12:57.040" style="s2">things that I&#39;ve talked about for people</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.790" end="00:12:58.930" style="s2">to access and so he&#39;s got a nice</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.040" end="00:13:02.890" style="s2">professional studio and I like working</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.930" end="00:13:04.750" style="s2">with him so well that was New York house</p>

<p begin="00:13:04.750" end="00:13:12.430" style="s2">Theater which was sold out so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:14.020" style="s2">third time the Beacon is sold out so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.430" end="00:13:15.400" style="s2">don&#39;t know what it is about New Yorkers</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.020" end="00:13:17.850" style="s2">but they seem to like to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.400" end="00:13:21.329" style="s2">sorrow and suffering and</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.850" end="00:13:23.370" style="s2">and Russian communists camps and well</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.329" end="00:13:25.800" style="s2">maybe also the possibility of having a</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.370" end="00:13:28.019" style="s2">reasonable and productive and meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.800" end="00:13:30.300" style="s2">life and that&#39;s really why people are</p>

<p begin="00:13:46.860" end="00:13:53.940" style="s2">helpful as well so anyways there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.509" end="00:13:57.720" style="s2">of news hopefully it wasn&#39;t too much and</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.940" end="00:14:02.339" style="s2">so now I&#39;ll do my best to answer your</p>

<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:09.060" style="s2">about the debate was jejak tomorrow I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:10.889" style="s2">not a political philosopher you know and</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.060" end="00:14:13.230" style="s2">it&#39;s been a long time since I read Marx</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.889" end="00:14:15.180" style="s2">reread the Communist Manifesto over the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.230" end="00:14:17.850" style="s2">last couple of weeks and tried to think</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.180" end="00:14:20.160" style="s2">it through and so I&#39;m gonna talk to more</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.850" end="00:14:23.490" style="s2">about the essence of the capitalist flaw</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.160" end="00:14:27.660" style="s2">or the communist philosophy um I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.490" end="00:14:28.139" style="s2">think I&#39;ve read a book well we&#39;ll leave</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.660" end="00:14:30.779" style="s2">it at that</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.139" end="00:14:34.709" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna take it apart tomorrow at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.779" end="00:14:36.449" style="s2">lecture and I hope I&#39;m ready I&#39;ve got 25</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.709" end="00:14:38.730" style="s2">minutes to make my case pretty short</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.449" end="00:14:41.519" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t take a lot of prep time if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.730" end="00:14:43.860" style="s2">careful but I I can&#39;t waste any of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.519" end="00:14:45.319" style="s2">time and and I&#39;d really like to do a</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.860" end="00:14:48.750" style="s2">good job because I think it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.319" end="00:14:50.579" style="s2">important debate know it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.750" end="00:14:52.709" style="s2">subject I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s gonna be an</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.579" end="00:14:55.980" style="s2">important debate I know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.709" end="00:14:59.040" style="s2">in Europe will be watching it so alright</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.980" end="00:15:03.720" style="s2">everyone let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve got here</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.040" end="00:15:08.699" style="s2">to to address if you had been allotted</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.720" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">the opportunity asked Michael Mix what</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.699" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">would you have discussed with Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.189" end="00:15:19.910" style="s2">well I think I would</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.810" end="00:15:21.889" style="s2">discussed with them what the</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.910" end="00:15:23.720" style="s2">psychoanalysts discovered in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.889" end="00:15:27.949" style="s2">century or what they claimed to have</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.720" end="00:15:31.670" style="s2">discovered which I believe was a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.949" end="00:15:35.149" style="s2">discovery see when Nietzsche announced</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.670" end="00:15:36.709" style="s2">the death of God which by the way as you</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.149" end="00:15:40.399" style="s2">may know from listening to my lectures</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.709" end="00:15:42.170" style="s2">was not precisely a trump &#39;fl was an</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.399" end="00:15:45.529" style="s2">announcement of triumph it was announced</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.170" end="00:15:48.050" style="s2">it was a warning and the tolling of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.529" end="00:15:49.790" style="s2">bells of sorrow that&#39;s a that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.050" end="00:15:54.490" style="s2">way of thinking about it even though</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.790" end="00:15:58.579" style="s2">Nietzsche was a style himself as a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.490" end="00:16:00.529" style="s2">vicious an intellectually vicious critic</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.579" end="00:16:03.740" style="s2">of institutionalized Christianity which</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.529" end="00:16:08.240" style="s2">he certainly was it was also a strange</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.740" end="00:16:11.149" style="s2">friend to the faith I think in the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.240" end="00:16:12.649" style="s2">fundamental sense that&#39;s the truth he</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.149" end="00:16:15.740" style="s2">wrote some things about Christ for</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.649" end="00:16:17.839" style="s2">example which were very positive and I</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.740" end="00:16:20.180" style="s2">think the reason he he understood as</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.839" end="00:16:21.860" style="s2">well how important the narrative sub</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.180" end="00:16:23.449" style="s2">structure of the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.860" end="00:16:26.000" style="s2">tradition was to the maintenance of</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.449" end="00:16:27.439" style="s2">Western civilization i unders he&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.000" end="00:16:35.000" style="s2">of the people I learned that from you</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.439" end="00:16:37.220" style="s2">know so see so when each announced the</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.000" end="00:16:40.009" style="s2">death of God he did it sorrowfully and</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.220" end="00:16:41.689" style="s2">and then he tried to think about what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.009" end="00:16:43.309" style="s2">might be able to do about that because</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.689" end="00:16:46.000" style="s2">it was gonna lead us down two bad</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.309" end="00:16:49.790" style="s2">pathways either towards nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.000" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">and the belief or what would you call</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.790" end="00:16:53.389" style="s2">the direct experience that because God</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:56.379" style="s2">was dead everything might be permitted</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.389" end="00:16:59.000" style="s2">as as Dostoevsky pointed out or</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.379" end="00:17:01.790" style="s2">totalitarianism which would arise as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.000" end="00:17:04.339" style="s2">rational substitute for them dogmas of</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.790" end="00:17:06.980" style="s2">religion and he knew that that both of</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.339" end="00:17:09.380" style="s2">those would be catastrophic occurrences</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.980" end="00:17:14.059" style="s2">and so he was trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.380" end="00:17:15.679" style="s2">we could do to to heal ourselves I</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.059" end="00:17:17.809" style="s2">suppose as a consequence of this great</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.679" end="00:17:19.520" style="s2">loss because Nietzsche also believed</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.809" end="00:17:22.730" style="s2">well I mentioned this that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.520" end="00:17:25.100" style="s2">belief in God which is not something so</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.730" end="00:17:28.220" style="s2">simple as belief and you know a bearded</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.100" end="00:17:31.110" style="s2">man in the sky it&#39;s sad to even have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.220" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">say that maybe it&#39;s not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.110" end="00:17:39.240" style="s2">but but at least you know more more</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:45.059" style="s2">profoundly that the death of the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.240" end="00:17:47.100" style="s2">a a universe ordered by something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.059" end="00:17:52.399" style="s2">akin to the living and conscience and</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.100" end="00:17:55.830" style="s2">conscious and and aware and intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.399" end="00:17:58.289" style="s2">so it&#39;s rough to replace that with pure</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.830" end="00:17:59.960" style="s2">random meaninglessness and of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.289" end="00:18:01.200" style="s2">that&#39;s the path weighted nihilism</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.960" end="00:18:02.370" style="s2">anyways</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.200" end="00:18:05.880" style="s2">Nietzsche thought we would have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.370" end="00:18:07.850" style="s2">create our own values to replace those</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.880" end="00:18:11.250" style="s2">that would fall because of the death of</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.850" end="00:18:14.610" style="s2">Christianity and the psychoanalysts</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.250" end="00:18:19.590" style="s2">Freud and Jung particularly young but</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.610" end="00:18:22.529" style="s2">Freud began at I think and and you made</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.590" end="00:18:25.769" style="s2">this explicit I think found a fatal flaw</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.529" end="00:18:28.529" style="s2">in Nietzsche&#39;s theorizing and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.769" end="00:18:31.769" style="s2">a fatal flaw in relationship to</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.529" end="00:18:35.730" style="s2">modernism per se even to the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.769" end="00:18:39.480" style="s2">rational thought itself as master of its</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.730" end="00:18:43.710" style="s2">own house eat you&#39;re not you can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.480" end="00:18:45.480" style="s2">your own values like you can aim you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.710" end="00:18:49.169" style="s2">direct your life you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.480" end="00:18:52.049" style="s2">cooperate in determining the values that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.169" end="00:18:55.019" style="s2">you pursue but you cooperate with forces</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.049" end="00:18:58.440" style="s2">in yourself that aren&#39;t you and and</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.019" end="00:19:00.899" style="s2">can&#39;t be made you not not in any</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.440" end="00:19:03.059" style="s2">straightforward way and it&#39;s easy to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.899" end="00:19:05.220" style="s2">understand this if you think about for</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.059" end="00:19:07.409" style="s2">example the fact that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.220" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">something that you shouldn&#39;t do or if</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.409" end="00:19:12.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t do something that you should</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:14.909" style="s2">do that you&#39;ll lay awake in bed at night</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.360" end="00:19:16.710" style="s2">and torment yourself about it and worry</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.909" end="00:19:19.740" style="s2">about it and consider yourself an</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.710" end="00:19:22.260" style="s2">unworthy person you know as if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.740" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">believed in the idea of sin it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.260" end="00:19:27.570" style="s2">strange thing that there&#39;s an ethic that</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.720" end="00:19:29.730" style="s2">calls to you from within that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.570" end="00:19:32.669" style="s2">control that that holds you responsible</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.730" end="00:19:35.519" style="s2">for your actions that&#39;s just one of many</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.669" end="00:19:37.440" style="s2">sub personalities in some sense that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.519" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">operative within people and it it</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.440" end="00:19:42.149" style="s2">depends I suppose on how integrated</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.840" end="00:19:44.380" style="s2">their personality is though less</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.149" end="00:19:46.870" style="s2">integrated people are more different</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.380" end="00:19:49.270" style="s2">what emotional state they&#39;re in but you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.870" end="00:19:51.460" style="s2">know with the the you that&#39;s overwhelmed</p>

<p begin="00:22:12.470" end="00:22:17.000" style="s2">he discovers in the aftermath of what he</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.360" end="00:22:19.580" style="s2">did is that he was no where near as in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.000" end="00:22:21.169" style="s2">control of himself and his personality</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.580" end="00:22:24.409" style="s2">and his emotional reactions and he says</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.169" end="00:22:27.130" style="s2">he thought and he tortures himself for a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.409" end="00:22:29.690" style="s2">very long time with very interesting</p>

<p begin="00:22:29.690" end="00:22:34.669" style="s2">well as driving the plot ahead very</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.549" end="00:22:37.640" style="s2">rapidly with what what he&#39;s done</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.669" end="00:22:40.610" style="s2">absolute start traumatised disbelief at</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.640" end="00:22:42.380" style="s2">what he&#39;s done so what I&#39;d like to ask</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.610" end="00:22:44.679" style="s2">Nietzsche because that&#39;s the question</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.380" end="00:22:48.380" style="s2">that I&#39;m supposed to be answering is</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.679" end="00:22:50.779" style="s2">given the mutability of man the fact</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.380" end="00:22:53.059" style="s2">that we are composed of multiple sub</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.779" end="00:22:55.010" style="s2">personalities which by the way it was</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.059" end="00:22:57.140" style="s2">something that Nietzsche actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.010" end="00:22:58.880" style="s2">mentioned and that I believe that both</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.140" end="00:23:00.350" style="s2">Freud and you relied on when they were</p>

<p begin="00:23:02.860" end="00:23:11.000" style="s2">masters of our own houses given the fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.409" end="00:23:12.890" style="s2">that were divided amongst ourselves how</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.000" end="00:23:16.700" style="s2">in the world is it possible for us to</p>

<p begin="00:23:35.840" end="00:23:40.130" style="s2">motivations well then you certainly</p>

<p begin="00:25:42.169" end="00:25:46.010" style="s2">I learned from Jung and and this is</p>

<p begin="00:27:00.850" end="00:27:08.920" style="s2">can&#39;t trust and that&#39;s that&#39;s not good</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.260" end="00:27:12.280" style="s2">like you you can&#39;t afford that life is</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.920" end="00:27:15.070" style="s2">difficult and it contains many pitfalls</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.280" end="00:27:18.250" style="s2">and unless you&#39;re careful and you search</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.070" end="00:27:20.280" style="s2">your cellphone properly and you aim high</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.250" end="00:27:23.670" style="s2">and walk on the straight and narrow path</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.280" end="00:27:26.230" style="s2">you don&#39;t have a hope of understanding</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.670" end="00:27:30.730" style="s2">where you should be and at what time</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.230" end="00:27:33.580" style="s2">when the crisis hits and the crisis will</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.730" end="00:27:35.320" style="s2">hit so you want to get all those little</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.580" end="00:27:37.060" style="s2">sub personalities in line if you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.320" end="00:27:38.560" style="s2">it&#39;s part of the reason for example why</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.060" end="00:27:40.150" style="s2">you thought you had me integrate your</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.560" end="00:27:42.520" style="s2">shadow which is the dark part of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.150" end="00:27:44.050" style="s2">character thought that was necessary or</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.520" end="00:27:46.240" style="s2">where would go and have a little</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.050" end="00:27:48.160" style="s2">autonomous life of its own maybe</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.240" end="00:27:49.930" style="s2">manifesting itself for example when</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.160" end="00:27:51.340" style="s2">you&#39;re angry or drunk instead of</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.930" end="00:27:55.210" style="s2">integrated into the rest of your</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.340" end="00:27:57.460" style="s2">personality like a properly disciplined</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.210" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">player in a complex and sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.460" end="00:28:01.980" style="s2">game so</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.950" end="00:28:23.130" style="s2">hmm Oh lots of tough questions today</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.140" end="00:28:25.590" style="s2">here&#39;s one from Basel I live in constant</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.130" end="00:28:26.250" style="s2">worry my children are going to be hit by</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.590" end="00:28:28.890" style="s2">a car</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.250" end="00:28:42.810" style="s2">kidnapped murdered beaten up it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.890" end="00:28:44.880" style="s2">torture how can I stop well I guess the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.810" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">first thing I would say is that you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.880" end="00:28:52.500" style="s2">should reassure yourself and I know</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:54.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a paradoxical weighted think</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.500" end="00:28:58.710" style="s2">about it that these things could happen</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.980" end="00:29:00.240" style="s2">you know look I&#39;ve never been surprised</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.710" end="00:29:02.730" style="s2">as a clinician that people are anxious</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.240" end="00:29:05.310" style="s2">so what you say doesn&#39;t surprise me</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.730" end="00:29:08.100" style="s2">except that the constancy part of it</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.310" end="00:29:10.530" style="s2">perhaps is surprising because children</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.100" end="00:29:14.220" style="s2">can get hit by cars kidnapped murdered</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.530" end="00:29:16.380" style="s2">and beaten up and it is a torture to</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.220" end="00:29:19.890" style="s2">contemplate that and so you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.380" end="00:29:22.110" style="s2">yourself not basil not why so much</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.890" end="00:29:23.670" style="s2">you&#39;re living in constant worry that</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.110" end="00:29:26.250" style="s2">that could happen to your children but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.670" end="00:29:27.860" style="s2">why everyone else isn&#39;t always living in</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.250" end="00:29:31.320" style="s2">constant worried that that could happen</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.860" end="00:29:33.210" style="s2">you know because tragedy can strike and</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.320" end="00:29:35.280" style="s2">it strikes children and apparently</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.210" end="00:29:39.240" style="s2">you&#39;re quite attached to your children</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.280" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">and so aren&#39;t very what would you say</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.240" end="00:29:45.150" style="s2">soothe by the realization that something</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:48.150" style="s2">terrible could happen to them now you</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.150" end="00:29:50.160" style="s2">know first of all I might say you might</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.150" end="00:29:53.430" style="s2">want to go talk to somebody professional</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.160" end="00:29:55.350" style="s2">about this you know because maybe you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.430" end="00:29:58.770" style="s2">depressed more than you should be and</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.350" end="00:30:01.620" style="s2">maybe you have an anxiety disorder I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.770" end="00:30:03.180" style="s2">not saying that that is not a diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.620" end="00:30:05.010" style="s2">and I certainly couldn&#39;t derive that</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.180" end="00:30:07.260" style="s2">from what you said but it&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.010" end="00:30:10.100" style="s2">possible things that could contribute to</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.260" end="00:30:14.070" style="s2">this constant worry you know or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.100" end="00:30:16.620" style="s2">you&#39;re physiologically ill and less</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.070" end="00:30:18.810" style="s2">resilient than you should be maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.620" end="00:30:20.580" style="s2">you&#39;re not eating enough one thing I</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.810" end="00:30:23.040" style="s2">would recommend to begin with is to make</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.580" end="00:30:25.140" style="s2">sure that you just try this I know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.040" end="00:30:26.190" style="s2">surprising advice but try to eat a big</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.140" end="00:30:28.620" style="s2">breakfast for</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.190" end="00:30:30.690" style="s2">like two weeks see what happens see if</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.620" end="00:30:32.340" style="s2">that drives the worry down now then the</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.690" end="00:30:34.289" style="s2">next thing I would ask is when does it</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.340" end="00:30:36.090" style="s2">happen like is it are these dreams are</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.289" end="00:30:37.440" style="s2">these thoughts before you go to bed do</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.090" end="00:30:39.539" style="s2">you wake up in the middle of the night</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.440" end="00:30:43.860" style="s2">with these visions running through your</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.539" end="00:30:45.990" style="s2">head and again this has to do with food</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.860" end="00:30:47.580" style="s2">is it more likely to happen if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.990" end="00:30:49.110" style="s2">hungry that&#39;s where something worth</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.580" end="00:30:50.460" style="s2">checking out because the next time you</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.110" end="00:30:51.990" style="s2">get worried in the middle of the day you</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.460" end="00:30:54.000" style="s2">might try eating something I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.990" end="00:30:56.610" style="s2">recommend something high protein high</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.000" end="00:30:58.529" style="s2">fat rather than high carbohydrate and</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.610" end="00:31:00.059" style="s2">just see if that helps because that</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.529" end="00:31:02.580" style="s2">might indicate that some of your worry</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.059" end="00:31:04.289" style="s2">is consequence of hyperglycemia and</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.580" end="00:31:05.129" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot more common than people</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.289" end="00:31:08.490" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.129" end="00:31:10.980" style="s2">so if it&#39;s dreams and visions at night</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.490" end="00:31:13.649" style="s2">you know one of the things you can do</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.980" end="00:31:15.990" style="s2">that&#39;s counterproductive is take one of</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.649" end="00:31:18.029" style="s2">those fantasies that&#39;s torturing you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.990" end="00:31:20.009" style="s2">know and that euro print you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.029" end="00:31:22.350" style="s2">suppressing because you will be</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.009" end="00:31:25.230" style="s2">suppressing it and let it play itself</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.350" end="00:31:28.049" style="s2">out you see what&#39;s happening is that the</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.230" end="00:31:31.549" style="s2">parts of you mind the parts of your</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.049" end="00:31:34.259" style="s2">brain the parts of your psyche that our</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.549" end="00:31:37.620" style="s2">alarm system so that&#39;s the anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.259" end="00:31:39.840" style="s2">systems are they&#39;re trying to think</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.620" end="00:31:42.750" style="s2">something through and they&#39;re using</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.840" end="00:31:44.100" style="s2">fantasy to think it through right and so</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.750" end="00:31:47.070" style="s2">this is actually a form of thought</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.100" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">that&#39;s torturing you because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.070" end="00:31:51.120" style="s2">reasonable for the parts of your brain</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:53.820" style="s2">that are on the outlook for negative</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.120" end="00:31:57.360" style="s2">occurrences to think well what if what</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.820" end="00:32:00.000" style="s2">if what if that&#39;s what thinking is and</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.360" end="00:32:01.740" style="s2">sometimes you think positively what if</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.000" end="00:32:06.899" style="s2">and sometimes you think negatively and</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.740" end="00:32:08.519" style="s2">well you&#39;re in all likelihood doing</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.899" end="00:32:10.289" style="s2">everything you can to escape from these</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.519" end="00:32:13.950" style="s2">thoughts when they make themselves</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.289" end="00:32:15.720" style="s2">manifest but all that does is make the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.950" end="00:32:17.610" style="s2">systems that are producing those</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.720" end="00:32:19.860" style="s2">thoughts even more likely to produce</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.610" end="00:32:22.860" style="s2">them because now they think the alarm</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.860" end="00:32:25.110" style="s2">system thinks oh well here&#39;s a danger</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.860" end="00:32:29.279" style="s2">which is basically the vulnerability of</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.110" end="00:32:33.179" style="s2">children and I&#39;m trying to present the</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.279" end="00:32:36.750" style="s2">active agent the person who I inhabit</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.179" end="00:32:39.879" style="s2">with evidence of this potential threat</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.750" end="00:32:41.709" style="s2">as a good alarm system should</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.879" end="00:32:43.389" style="s2">turns out that they&#39;re so afraid of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.709" end="00:32:44.669" style="s2">message that I&#39;m delivering that they</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.389" end="00:32:47.829" style="s2">won&#39;t even listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.669" end="00:32:50.589" style="s2">therefore the situation must be much</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.829" end="00:32:53.559" style="s2">more dire than I supposed and I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.589" end="00:32:57.099" style="s2">to am going to have to amplify and</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.559" end="00:33:01.690" style="s2">increase the emotion of my statement and</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.099" end="00:33:03.429" style="s2">the repetitiveness of the thought and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.690" end="00:33:04.839" style="s2">that&#39;s just not helpful at all</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.429" end="00:33:06.609" style="s2">right because what you&#39;ve done is you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.839" end="00:33:09.219" style="s2">taken a worry and you&#39;ve now</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.609" end="00:33:10.959" style="s2">recategorize it as a worry that&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.219" end="00:33:13.599" style="s2">terrible that you won&#39;t even think about</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.959" end="00:33:17.079" style="s2">it and so now the alarm systems think</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.599" end="00:33:19.659" style="s2">that you&#39;re being chased by he who can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.079" end="00:33:21.219" style="s2">be named that&#39;s a good way of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.659" end="00:33:23.559" style="s2">about it and a good allusion to</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.219" end="00:33:25.659" style="s2">something popular in culture and so</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.559" end="00:33:29.289" style="s2">they&#39;re just gonna be screaming non-stop</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.659" end="00:33:31.089" style="s2">so what do you have to do well man this</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.289" end="00:33:33.519" style="s2">is counterproductive but I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.089" end="00:33:34.959" style="s2">it works next time you have a there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.519" end="00:33:38.469" style="s2">couple of wit things you could do you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.959" end="00:33:40.899" style="s2">could start by bringing to mind those</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.469" end="00:33:42.789" style="s2">fantasies sit down somewhere take some</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.899" end="00:33:47.469" style="s2">deep breaths try to calm yourself down a</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.789" end="00:33:50.949" style="s2">little bit and let those thoughts come</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.469" end="00:33:52.749" style="s2">forward you know what they are and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.949" end="00:33:54.849" style="s2">watch them like you&#39;re watching a movie</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.749" end="00:33:57.569" style="s2">even if it&#39;s a horror movie watch them</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.849" end="00:34:01.989" style="s2">let the whole fantasy play out and see</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.569" end="00:34:03.729" style="s2">what what comes out at the end now even</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.989" end="00:34:08.500" style="s2">if it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna be frightening to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.729" end="00:34:10.509" style="s2">this now look even if the vision is</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.500" end="00:34:14.079" style="s2">quite horrific right the entire thought</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.509" end="00:34:15.970" style="s2">is quite horrific you have now indicated</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.079" end="00:34:19.690" style="s2">to your anxiety systems that you have</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.970" end="00:34:23.049" style="s2">enough courage to face the worrisome</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.690" end="00:34:24.940" style="s2">event and just that alone should be</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.049" end="00:34:27.700" style="s2">helpful now you may have to do this</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.940" end="00:34:30.549" style="s2">multiple times and you might have to do</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.700" end="00:34:33.429" style="s2">it with all the thoughts and you&#39;ll know</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.549" end="00:34:35.649" style="s2">that you&#39;re you know that you&#39;ll have</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.429" end="00:34:38.139" style="s2">done it you&#39;ll know that you&#39;ve done it</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.649" end="00:34:41.259" style="s2">enough when doing it starts to become</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.139" end="00:34:43.809" style="s2">mundane when all the emotion goes out of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.259" end="00:34:45.849" style="s2">it and if you&#39;re particularly frightened</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.809" end="00:34:47.079" style="s2">that might take a long time now the</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.849" end="00:34:49.839" style="s2">other thing that you might really</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.079" end="00:34:51.940" style="s2">consider this is something you can do as</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.839" end="00:34:53.799" style="s2">an adjunct is you should think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.940" end="00:34:56.980" style="s2">what you would do if this would</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.799" end="00:34:58.900" style="s2">if this happened you know as if it</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.980" end="00:35:01.180" style="s2">happened in real life and and to take</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.900" end="00:35:04.089" style="s2">even the worst-case situation you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.180" end="00:35:06.130" style="s2">so let&#39;s say let&#39;s say that you received</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.089" end="00:35:09.670" style="s2">the news that your child would was hit</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.130" end="00:35:11.710" style="s2">by a car well you know you could receive</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.670" end="00:35:13.960" style="s2">news like that and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.710" end="00:35:16.450" style="s2">well what would you do and what usually</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.960" end="00:35:19.029" style="s2">what should you do and the answer is you</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.450" end="00:35:21.210" style="s2">don&#39;t know you think that that would</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.029" end="00:35:24.579" style="s2">kill you you think that that would be</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.210" end="00:35:27.160" style="s2">unbearable and and the end of the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.579" end="00:35:30.190" style="s2">and it&#39;s not surprising that you think</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.160" end="00:35:31.930" style="s2">that but it&#39;s not helpful you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.190" end="00:35:34.269" style="s2">because people have to live through</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.930" end="00:35:36.009" style="s2">catastrophe and you have more than one</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.269" end="00:35:37.660" style="s2">child apparently and I would presume as</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.009" end="00:35:40.539" style="s2">well that you have a spouse and other</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.660" end="00:35:43.720" style="s2">people that love you and need you and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.539" end="00:35:47.200" style="s2">it isn&#39;t good that you would fall apart</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.720" end="00:35:49.750" style="s2">and die like in an in an apocalyptic</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.200" end="00:35:51.460" style="s2">dread if something happened to one of</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.750" end="00:35:52.779" style="s2">the people that you love because then</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.460" end="00:35:55.630" style="s2">you would leave all the other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.779" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">bereft of you as well and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.630" end="00:36:01.599" style="s2">helpful and so if your child was hit by</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:02.440" style="s2">a car well what would you do we have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.599" end="00:36:05.079" style="s2">think it through</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.440" end="00:36:08.099" style="s2">you know you&#39;d grieve you&#39;d go to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.079" end="00:36:12.089" style="s2">hospital you&#39;d have a terrible time</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.099" end="00:36:15.400" style="s2">you&#39;d have a terrible year you know and</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.089" end="00:36:17.980" style="s2">and that would be that and you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.400" end="00:36:24.539" style="s2">the funeral end you&#39;d have the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.980" end="00:36:28.599" style="s2">the child and all of that would be awful</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.539" end="00:36:30.970" style="s2">but people live through that you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.599" end="00:36:33.700" style="s2">and maybe you could have a name a name</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.970" end="00:36:35.619" style="s2">would be that if that happened your</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.700" end="00:36:35.950" style="s2">determination would be to live through</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.619" end="00:36:38.410" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.950" end="00:36:40.269" style="s2">so that you could be there for the rest</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.410" end="00:36:43.299" style="s2">of your people and so that you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.269" end="00:36:45.819" style="s2">fall apart and collapse because the</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.299" end="00:36:49.869" style="s2">death of someone and the subsequent</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.819" end="00:36:52.180" style="s2">utter collapse of a person closely</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.869" end="00:36:54.849" style="s2">associated with them that that second</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.180" end="00:36:57.460" style="s2">event does not improve the first one it</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.849" end="00:37:00.130" style="s2">makes it worse and it&#39;s incumbent upon</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.460" end="00:37:02.740" style="s2">you to develop the psychological</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.130" end="00:37:06.250" style="s2">strength to be able to tolerate what it</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.740" end="00:37:07.030" style="s2">is that your anxiety alarm systems are</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.250" end="00:37:09.130" style="s2">tormenting you</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.030" end="00:37:11.920" style="s2">with and you know you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.130" end="00:37:13.630" style="s2">that&#39;s impossible but you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.920" end="00:37:16.210" style="s2">impossible because people live through</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.630" end="00:37:20.650" style="s2">catastrophe and they do that in large</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.210" end="00:37:23.650" style="s2">part there are no small part by by</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.650" end="00:37:26.230" style="s2">discovering that there are darker and</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.650" end="00:37:28.510" style="s2">stronger forces within them than they</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.230" end="00:37:30.580" style="s2">might be willing to appreciate and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.510" end="00:37:32.740" style="s2">one of the consequences of integrating</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.580" end="00:37:36.850" style="s2">those forces is that you have the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.740" end="00:37:41.860" style="s2">strength and the cruelty in some strange</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.850" end="00:37:46.420" style="s2">sense to endure right to dare continue</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.860" end="00:37:50.200" style="s2">to live even if the unthinkable happens</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.420" end="00:37:54.250" style="s2">and it&#39;s no simple matter to think of</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.200" end="00:37:58.090" style="s2">that as a moral step forward but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.250" end="00:38:00.820" style="s2">know people are called upon to be strong</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.090" end="00:38:03.640" style="s2">and strong in the face of the worst</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.820" end="00:38:05.800" style="s2">catastrophe and your psyche is</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.640" end="00:38:08.620" style="s2">tormenting you with precisely that you</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.800" end="00:38:11.290" style="s2">know it won&#39;t let you go it&#39;ll shake you</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.620" end="00:38:15.730" style="s2">like a dog shakes a rack it won&#39;t let</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.290" end="00:38:17.980" style="s2">you go until you deal with it deal with</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.730" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">mortality even the mortality of your</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.980" end="00:38:23.140" style="s2">children and you find within you what</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:28.060" style="s2">would allow you to withstand that</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.140" end="00:38:33.190" style="s2">damaged or not to withstand that and you</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.060" end="00:38:35.770" style="s2">do that by letting yourself go where</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.190" end="00:38:39.280" style="s2">your thoughts take you even though you</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.770" end="00:38:41.410" style="s2">don&#39;t want to now it&#39;s a trip into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.280" end="00:38:43.900" style="s2">abyss you know that&#39;s a trip into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.410" end="00:38:46.150" style="s2">underworld and those are best taken</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.900" end="00:38:48.100" style="s2">voluntarily you&#39;re being dragged down</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.150" end="00:38:51.580" style="s2">there by forces that are beyond your</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.100" end="00:38:53.860" style="s2">control and the mythological motif is</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.580" end="00:38:55.360" style="s2">that those who are pulled into the</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.860" end="00:38:58.630" style="s2">underworld by forces beyond their</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.360" end="00:39:03.370" style="s2">control do not come out not come out</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.630" end="00:39:05.170" style="s2">easily it can be the end you know so you</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.370" end="00:39:08.680" style="s2">go there courageously</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.170" end="00:39:11.560" style="s2">and so if you&#39;re a parent one of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.680" end="00:39:14.170" style="s2">places you have to go courageously is to</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.560" end="00:39:20.320" style="s2">that place where your children are ill</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.170" end="00:39:20.859" style="s2">or dying or deceased you have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.320" end="00:39:23.950" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.859" end="00:39:26.039" style="s2">haven&#39;t grown up until you have done</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.950" end="00:39:30.779" style="s2">that even though it&#39;s a terrible thing</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.039" end="00:39:34.869" style="s2">so that&#39;s how you could deal with that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.779" end="00:39:37.029" style="s2">it&#39;s rough man but I&#39;ll tell you it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.869" end="00:39:38.980" style="s2">lot better than living in constant worry</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.029" end="00:39:39.730" style="s2">that your children are going to be hit</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.980" end="00:39:41.980" style="s2">by a car</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.789" end="00:39:58.839" style="s2">could go left and that&#39;s rough and you</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.619" end="00:40:02.140" style="s2">can go right and that&#39;s rough and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.839" end="00:40:05.529" style="s2">all you&#39;ve got and I would say you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.140" end="00:40:07.269" style="s2">the freedom to choose which of the two</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.529" end="00:40:10.119" style="s2">difficult paths you&#39;re going to choose</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.269" end="00:40:13.749" style="s2">and the one that involves voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.119" end="00:40:16.960" style="s2">confrontation with what tortures and</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.749" end="00:40:21.069" style="s2">torments you with the terrible predator</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.960" end="00:40:26.140" style="s2">of death that&#39;s the pathway that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.069" end="00:40:28.299" style="s2">to lead back to the stability that not</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.140" end="00:40:39.369" style="s2">only you need but that your family</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.299" end="00:40:40.690" style="s2">requires you to have so that&#39;s that and</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.369" end="00:40:45.430" style="s2">you guys you&#39;re asking tough questions</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.690" end="00:40:47.440" style="s2">tonight news of real atrocities</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.430" end="00:40:49.150" style="s2">committed by humans especially tortured</p>

<p begin="00:41:04.019" end="00:41:08.829" style="s2">could take a personality test and find</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.640" end="00:41:10.690" style="s2">out but your personality traits are that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.829" end="00:41:12.609" style="s2">probably be the best that really be the</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.690" end="00:41:14.559" style="s2">best way of figuring it out my guess is</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.609" end="00:41:18.730" style="s2">that you&#39;re extremely high in compassion</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.559" end="00:41:21.430" style="s2">which is a an aspect of agreeableness</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.730" end="00:41:23.380" style="s2">and it&#39;s the maternal aspect</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.430" end="00:41:27.999" style="s2">fundamentally and so you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.380" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">probably very high in compassion I have</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.999" end="00:41:32.499" style="s2">a personality test at a site called</p>

<p begin="00:42:09.980" end="00:42:13.660" style="s2">openness which is the creative</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.570" end="00:42:16.100" style="s2">creativity dimension it would mean that</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.660" end="00:42:18.350" style="s2">you&#39;re someone who can get really lost</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.100" end="00:42:20.420" style="s2">in the stories of other people so high</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.350" end="00:42:22.010" style="s2">people are high in openness like fiction</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.420" end="00:42:24.950" style="s2">for example and the reason for that is</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.010" end="00:42:27.980" style="s2">that they they they&#39;re imitative in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.950" end="00:42:30.260" style="s2">sense cognitively they can really take</p>

<p begin="00:42:32.450" end="00:42:37.880" style="s2">else so that they&#39;re deeply engrossed in</p>

<p begin="00:42:37.880" end="00:42:41.450" style="s2">high in openness you can kind of tell</p>

<p begin="00:49:30.880" end="00:49:35.980" style="s2">simple because to repent and to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.580" end="00:49:39.490" style="s2">redeemed is to truly understand what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.980" end="00:49:42.610" style="s2">did to allow the parts of yourself that</p>

<p begin="00:49:44.380" end="00:49:50.830" style="s2">because there&#39;s plenty of pain involved</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.690" end="00:49:53.110" style="s2">to chart a new course and to swear by</p>

<p begin="00:50:00.310" end="00:50:06.490" style="s2">find out how even now knowing something</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.930" end="00:50:09.910" style="s2">about the evil that can possess people</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.490" end="00:50:11.830" style="s2">and even people that you love even</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.910" end="00:50:13.710" style="s2">yourself you&#39;ll have to find it within</p>

<p begin="00:50:22.390" end="00:50:30.880" style="s2">you&#39;ve now discovered is someone you</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.020" end="00:50:33.760" style="s2">love and so good luck cuz that&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.880" end="00:50:38.190" style="s2">that&#39;s a tough road you&#39;ve got to walk</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.760" end="00:50:41.950" style="s2">there so but like I said I would say</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.190" end="00:50:49.119" style="s2">read ordinary man that&#39;ll teach you</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.950" end="00:50:53.589" style="s2">something that you need to know the</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.119" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">Greeks is by anonymous the Greeks had</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.589" end="00:50:59.260" style="s2">the maxim know thyself how do we come to</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:00.880" style="s2">know ourselves in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.260" end="00:51:11.260" style="s2">personalities and more importantly</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.880" end="00:51:13.030" style="s2">potential well you know one of the</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.260" end="00:51:15.640" style="s2">things I often told my students and all</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.030" end="00:51:18.069" style="s2">my clinical clients as well I guess I</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.640" end="00:51:21.970" style="s2">probably told my family members this as</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.069" end="00:51:23.470" style="s2">well some of the many ways that one of</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.970" end="00:51:27.329" style="s2">the first ways to come to know yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.470" end="00:51:29.589" style="s2">is to understand that you don&#39;t and that</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.329" end="00:51:34.780" style="s2">you all still know the people you love</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.589" end="00:51:36.339" style="s2">very well but we&#39;ll get to that you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.780" end="00:51:38.740" style="s2">you can learn to kind of watch yourself</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.339" end="00:51:40.630" style="s2">like you&#39;re watching a stranger but you</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.740" end="00:51:43.210" style="s2">have to adopt a position is a position</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.630" end="00:51:48.670" style="s2">of radical humility I would say both</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.210" end="00:51:52.180" style="s2">both humility in two senses so one sense</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.670" end="00:51:54.369" style="s2">would be the humility of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.180" end="00:51:55.780" style="s2">your ignorance so you have to understand</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.369" end="00:51:59.079" style="s2">that you don&#39;t know who you are and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.780" end="00:52:01.030" style="s2">that&#39;s not easy to understand cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.079" end="00:52:03.490" style="s2">think you know but then you know you</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.030" end="00:52:05.170" style="s2">remember you can&#39;t control yourself very</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.490" end="00:52:07.119" style="s2">well you&#39;re not very disciplined you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.170" end="00:52:09.790" style="s2">full of flaws maybe you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.119" end="00:52:14.890" style="s2">yourself as well as you think but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.790" end="00:52:16.900" style="s2">hard to get low enough to understand how</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.890" end="00:52:19.869" style="s2">deeply it is the case that you are</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.900" end="00:52:22.329" style="s2">ignorant about who you are now there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.869" end="00:52:23.890" style="s2">an upside to that too which also is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.329" end="00:52:27.160" style="s2">you&#39;re also ignorant about who you could</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.890" end="00:52:30.550" style="s2">be and so the discovery of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.160" end="00:52:34.060" style="s2">you know is some reward for the horror</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.550" end="00:52:35.080" style="s2">of determining who you actually are then</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.060" end="00:52:37.450" style="s2">I would say well whoa</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.080" end="00:52:38.890" style="s2">then he watch yourself you know and and</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.450" end="00:52:40.390" style="s2">you attend to your conscience and you</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.890" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">see you watch yourself like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.390" end="00:52:45.340" style="s2">watching a stranger you watch what you</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:47.320" style="s2">say and you listen you think what what</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.340" end="00:52:48.730" style="s2">sort of person would say that and how am</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.320" end="00:52:51.340" style="s2">i reacting emotionally when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.730" end="00:52:53.170" style="s2">communicating in that manner you know is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.340" end="00:52:55.540" style="s2">that making me feel stronger weaker is</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.170" end="00:52:58.960" style="s2">it is it is filling me with shame is it</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.540" end="00:52:59.830" style="s2">helping my confidence am i am i laying</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.960" end="00:53:02.260" style="s2">out a lie</p>

<p begin="00:53:25.060" end="00:53:31.420" style="s2">and why what am i unwilling to do um</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.050" end="00:53:33.880" style="s2">what do I think is good what do I</p>

<p begin="00:53:33.880" end="00:53:41.200" style="s2">and what do I berate myself for failing</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.280" end="00:53:43.810" style="s2">to confront and to implement those are</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.200" end="00:53:46.390" style="s2">all incredibly complicated questions and</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.810" end="00:53:48.790" style="s2">you don&#39;t know the answers to them so</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.390" end="00:53:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a start</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.790" end="00:53:54.490" style="s2">and then in terms of potential well</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.480" end="00:53:56.230" style="s2">you&#39;ll discover a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.490" end="00:53:58.060" style="s2">your potential as you discover who you</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.230" end="00:54:00.430" style="s2">are especially the darker parts of</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.060" end="00:54:02.650" style="s2">yourself because then you discover your</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.430" end="00:54:05.620" style="s2">potential for mayhem there&#39;s some real</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.650" end="00:54:07.840" style="s2">utility in that you know the discovery</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.620" end="00:54:10.540" style="s2">that you&#39;re dangerous it&#39;s such a useful</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.840" end="00:54:13.270" style="s2">discovery it&#39;s actually something that</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.540" end="00:54:17.800" style="s2">strengthens you because the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.270" end="00:54:25.390" style="s2">that a realization like that can in fact</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.800" end="00:54:27.520" style="s2">produce is the the ambition to</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.390" end="00:54:29.170" style="s2">incorporate that danger into a higher</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.520" end="00:54:31.510" style="s2">order personality that dangerousness</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.170" end="00:54:34.390" style="s2">into a higher order personality and that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.510" end="00:54:36.220" style="s2">can make you implacable I can make you</p>

<p begin="00:54:40.220" end="00:54:46.099" style="s2">conflict and so that&#39;s unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.550" end="00:54:48.460" style="s2">useful and so that&#39;s one of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.099" end="00:54:50.900" style="s2">potentials that you might discover um</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.460" end="00:54:53.240" style="s2">the other thing you do to discover your</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.900" end="00:54:59.990" style="s2">potential is - well you challenge</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.240" end="00:55:02.030" style="s2">yourself you know it&#39;s like rule 4 in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.990" end="00:55:03.650" style="s2">book 12 rules for life is comparing</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.030" end="00:55:05.570" style="s2">yourself to who you were yesterday and</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.650" end="00:55:07.010" style="s2">not to some who someone else is today</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.570" end="00:55:12.140" style="s2">and that&#39;s kind of a good way to start</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.010" end="00:55:14.570" style="s2">this it&#39;s like well take a bit of a look</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.140" end="00:55:18.020" style="s2">at yourself and think about what&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.570" end="00:55:20.330" style="s2">so good that you could improve that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.020" end="00:55:23.780" style="s2">should improve by your own standards and</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.330" end="00:55:26.900" style="s2">that you would improve you know and set</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.780" end="00:55:28.970" style="s2">yourself a little goal you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.900" end="00:55:31.490" style="s2">you&#39;re not studying at all at you and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.970" end="00:55:33.590" style="s2">your university or maybe you&#39;re maybe</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.490" end="00:55:35.330" style="s2">you&#39;re at work and you&#39;ve got this stack</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.590" end="00:55:36.770" style="s2">of paper there you know and you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.330" end="00:55:38.840" style="s2">looked at that damn stack for like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.770" end="00:55:41.270" style="s2">month and you know that you should be</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.840" end="00:55:43.190" style="s2">and you&#39;re bored bothering yourself at</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.270" end="00:55:45.560" style="s2">night because you&#39;re avoiding that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.190" end="00:55:47.359" style="s2">like maybe they got avoided that stack</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.560" end="00:55:49.280" style="s2">of paper completely for one month I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.359" end="00:55:51.290" style="s2">quite a coward when it comes to whatever</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.280" end="00:55:54.980" style="s2">snakes might be hidden in that stack of</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.290" end="00:55:56.960" style="s2">paper how about tomorrow I just like put</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.980" end="00:56:01.570" style="s2">that stack of paper in front of me on my</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.960" end="00:56:05.660" style="s2">desk and I like a glance through it for</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.570" end="00:56:08.540" style="s2">15 seconds see if I can do that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.660" end="00:56:10.220" style="s2">like well you set yourself a goal of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.540" end="00:56:14.420" style="s2">improvement you know it&#39;s a humble goal</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.220" end="00:56:15.890" style="s2">because really are you such a coward</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.420" end="00:56:18.380" style="s2">that the best that you can bloody well</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.890" end="00:56:20.630" style="s2">manage after a month of avoidance is 15</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.380" end="00:56:23.210" style="s2">seconds of exposure to a stack of paper</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.630" end="00:56:24.770" style="s2">you know it could easily be you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.210" end="00:56:27.230" style="s2">avoiding it so you&#39;re obviously afraid</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.770" end="00:56:29.930" style="s2">of it and so the situation could be that</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.230" end="00:56:36.200" style="s2">dismal and dire and you might think well</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.930" end="00:56:39.080" style="s2">geez it&#39;s no bomb to my ego it&#39;s no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.200" end="00:56:41.990" style="s2">no it&#39;s not fostering the strength of my</p>

<p begin="00:56:58.970" end="00:57:04.840" style="s2">is are you big enough to take those</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.100" end="00:57:07.040" style="s2">small steps you know are you capable of</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.840" end="00:57:09.530" style="s2">grappling with the fact that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:57:13.820" end="00:57:20.210" style="s2">and the answer to that is yeah you are</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.590" end="00:57:21.910" style="s2">and that&#39;s the Lord of I don&#39;t know if</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.250" end="00:57:52.760" style="s2">there something slightly larger and more</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.110" end="00:57:55.340" style="s2">challenging that I can do that would be</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.760" end="00:57:58.040" style="s2">better and and you try it and you find</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.340" end="00:58:00.050" style="s2">out and as you try it and you find out</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.040" end="00:58:02.270" style="s2">generally you get better at it and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.050" end="00:58:05.390" style="s2">can take on larger and larger challenges</p>

<p begin="01:14:32.309" end="01:14:36.630" style="s2">problem that Nietzsche posed was that we</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.530" end="01:14:39.659" style="s2">had to go into the abyss to rescue the</p>

<p begin="01:15:12.239" end="01:15:16.380" style="s2">book in a funny way there&#39;s three books</p>

<p begin="01:15:34.690" end="01:15:38.920" style="s2">on the presumptuous side and I guess you</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.270" end="01:15:40.390" style="s2">could also include Joseph Campbell&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.920" end="01:15:42.670" style="s2">book the hero with a thousand faces</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.610" end="01:19:49.970" style="s2">it&#39;s definitely easier I&#39;ve got 25</p>

<p begin="01:19:51.430" end="01:19:56.710" style="s2">the way I prepared for that was that I</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.600" end="01:20:00.920" style="s2">reread the Communist Manifesto and</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.710" end="01:20:04.300" style="s2">thought it through and I&#39;ve identified</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.920" end="01:20:06.980" style="s2">what I think the fundamental every</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.300" end="01:20:08.510" style="s2">philosophical treatise or every tree</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.980" end="01:20:12.470" style="s2">dice that purports to be philosophical</p>

<p begin="01:20:20.170" end="01:20:24.950" style="s2">some of them anyways I won&#39;t have time</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.820" end="01:20:26.960" style="s2">to cover all of them so I&#39;ve identified</p>

<p begin="01:20:29.630" end="01:20:42.880" style="s2">I&#39;ve thought through whether or not they</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.180" end="01:20:46.130" style="s2">were credible as axioms and I I don&#39;t I</p>

<p begin="01:23:32.570" end="01:23:39.019" style="s2">guess that an an era of super abundance</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.860" end="01:23:42.169" style="s2">material super abundance would manifest</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.019" end="01:23:43.880" style="s2">itself in which everyone would have what</p>

<p begin="01:23:43.880" end="01:23:49.309" style="s2">their creative endeavors in freedom and</p>
<p begin="01:23:47.419" end="01:23:52.820" style="s2">that would constitute the communist</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.309" end="01:23:55.639" style="s2">utopia it&#39;s like there&#39;s so many</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.820" end="01:23:57.439" style="s2">unexamined assumptions in that set of</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.639" end="01:24:00.800" style="s2">propositions that it&#39;s almost impossible</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.439" end="01:24:02.840" style="s2">to know even where to start it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.800" end="01:24:04.489" style="s2">don&#39;t understand how this hyper</p>
<p begin="01:24:02.840" end="01:24:08.599" style="s2">abundance was supposed to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.489" end="01:24:12.039" style="s2">itself um it certainly didn&#39;t manifest</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.599" end="01:24:15.409" style="s2">itself in any actual communist countries</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.039" end="01:24:17.269" style="s2">it&#39;s especially peculiar because Marx</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.409" end="01:24:20.329" style="s2">even in the communist men</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.269" end="01:24:22.309" style="s2">Festo admits that one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.329" end="01:24:27.709" style="s2">communism is really good at doing is</p>
<p begin="01:24:22.309" end="01:24:29.959" style="s2">producing a surplus of commodities but</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.709" end="01:24:34.609" style="s2">and these are material commodities and</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.959" end="01:24:37.489" style="s2">because and and so that seems to me in</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.609" end="01:24:40.699" style="s2">paradoxical contradiction with the whole</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.489" end="01:24:43.549" style="s2">communist what would you call it</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.699" end="01:24:45.019" style="s2">ambition because if it&#39;s hyper abundance</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.549" end="01:24:49.179" style="s2">that&#39;s going to bring about the Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.019" end="01:24:51.799" style="s2">utopia and eventual classless Ness and</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.179" end="01:24:53.599" style="s2">capitalism is good at producing hyper</p>
<p begin="01:24:51.799" end="01:24:56.149" style="s2">abundance why wouldn&#39;t you just let the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.599" end="01:24:58.849" style="s2">capitalist system run out until it</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.149" end="01:25:00.979" style="s2">produced universal hyper abundance and</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.849" end="01:25:02.539" style="s2">we&#39;d have the Utopia now the Marxist</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.979" end="01:25:06.769" style="s2">answer to that would because would be</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.539" end="01:25:11.289" style="s2">that it would be because the selfish</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.769" end="01:25:13.669" style="s2">capitalists for structural and</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.289" end="01:25:17.510" style="s2">class-based reasons would keep all the</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.669" end="01:25:19.760" style="s2">excess production to themselves but god</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.510" end="01:25:21.649" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of pessimism with regards</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.760" end="01:25:24.079" style="s2">to those on the capitalist side and a</p>
<p begin="01:25:21.649" end="01:25:26.239" style="s2">lot of optimism with regards to those on</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.079" end="01:25:28.429" style="s2">the working-class side no real</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.239" end="01:25:31.459" style="s2">understanding whatsoever of their common</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.429" end="01:25:33.949" style="s2">humanity and common flaws and then the</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.459" end="01:25:38.269" style="s2">idea that the best way to read history</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.949" end="01:25:41.809" style="s2">is as the struggle between the</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.269" end="01:25:46.569" style="s2">proletariat numbers or Z that strikes me</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.809" end="01:25:49.549" style="s2">as almost impossibly one-sided and naive</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.569" end="01:25:51.349" style="s2">I won&#39;t get into that tonight because</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.549" end="01:25:55.519" style="s2">I&#39;m going to discuss that quite</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.349" end="01:25:57.699" style="s2">substantially tomorrow but first of all</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.519" end="01:26:00.649" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of reasons for conflict and</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.699" end="01:26:03.049" style="s2">class position might be one of them but</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.649" end="01:26:05.479" style="s2">it is by no means the only one and even</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.049" end="01:26:07.909" style="s2">if it was there&#39;s no reason to assume</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.479" end="01:26:11.029" style="s2">that that&#39;s a natural and unique</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.909" end="01:26:12.729" style="s2">consequence of capitalism and so the</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.029" end="01:26:17.349" style="s2">other thing that&#39;s staggering about</p>
<p begin="01:26:12.729" end="01:26:21.289" style="s2">Marx&#39;s Communist Manifesto is its</p>
<p begin="01:26:17.349" end="01:26:26.599" style="s2">absolute the absolute absence of any</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.599" end="01:26:29.359" style="s2">know and maybe that&#39;s not surprising</p>
<p begin="01:26:28.039" end="01:26:30.869" style="s2">given when it was written you know it</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.359" end="01:26:33.570" style="s2">was pre Darwin and</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.869" end="01:26:35.909" style="s2">and biology is really exploded in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.570" end="01:26:39.030" style="s2">20th century but I read that track now</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.909" end="01:26:41.250" style="s2">and I think well you just didn&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.030" end="01:26:43.980" style="s2">just don&#39;t know anything about human</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.250" end="01:26:46.889" style="s2">nature and I don&#39;t mean the human nature</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.980" end="01:26:49.020" style="s2">that&#39;s on the surface you know that we</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.889" end="01:26:51.570" style="s2">only share with other human beings for</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.020" end="01:26:54.719" style="s2">example I mean nature itself and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.570" end="01:26:56.940" style="s2">nature of social interactions and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.719" end="01:26:59.880" style="s2">structure of social hierarchies and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.940" end="01:27:02.369" style="s2">nature of implicit motivation you knew</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.880" end="01:27:04.679" style="s2">none of that and like that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:27:02.369" end="01:27:08.849" style="s2">you that&#39;s actually a big problem a</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.679" end="01:27:10.469" style="s2">hundred and sixty years later when we do</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.849" end="01:27:14.820" style="s2">know something about human psychology</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.469" end="01:27:18.119" style="s2">and so well and then the other thing I</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.820" end="01:27:20.070" style="s2">hope to do see I&#39;ve probably taken 15</p>
<p begin="01:27:18.119" end="01:27:22.139" style="s2">minutes up just to answer that I&#39;ve only</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.070" end="01:27:23.880" style="s2">got 25 minutes in total the other thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:22.139" end="01:27:25.170" style="s2">that I want to do is just lay out some</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.880" end="01:27:27.659" style="s2">of the statistics that have been</p>
<p begin="01:27:25.170" end="01:27:29.940" style="s2">gathered over the last 10 years by</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.659" end="01:27:33.630" style="s2">people like Steven Pinker and Hans</p>
<p begin="01:27:29.940" end="01:27:38.489" style="s2">Rosling and Miriam 2p at human progress</p>
<p begin="01:27:33.630" end="01:27:40.590" style="s2">and just point out the magnitude of the</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.489" end="01:27:42.469" style="s2">absolute economic miracle that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.590" end="01:27:45.449" style="s2">occurring all around the world as</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.469" end="01:27:48.710" style="s2">millions of poverty-stricken people are</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.449" end="01:27:54.540" style="s2">lifted out of abject and horrible</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.710" end="01:27:57.030" style="s2">privation at a rate that&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.540" end="01:28:00.599" style="s2">incomprehensible and that was unforeseen</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.030" end="01:28:04.830" style="s2">and so I don&#39;t know what a Marxist does</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.599" end="01:28:07.770" style="s2">with that deny it I suppose certainly</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.830" end="01:28:09.480" style="s2">the working class in the US and perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:28:07.770" end="01:28:12.179" style="s2">elsewhere in the Western world has taken</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.480" end="01:28:14.969" style="s2">us a certain relative hit as a</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.179" end="01:28:17.099" style="s2">consequence of opening up competition to</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.969" end="01:28:19.980" style="s2">the rest of the world and then being</p>

<p begin="01:28:19.980" end="01:28:25.139" style="s2">working class people who could you know</p>

<p begin="01:28:25.139" end="01:28:31.260" style="s2">consequence of that as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.239" end="01:28:33.409" style="s2">is that it&#39;s not a mere opinion on my</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.260" end="01:28:37.230" style="s2">part that things are so much better</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.409" end="01:28:40.949" style="s2">economically now than they were like</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.230" end="01:28:43.530" style="s2">when I was born that you can only</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.949" end="01:28:44.370" style="s2">describe it as miraculous I mean one</p>

<p begin="01:28:44.370" end="01:28:47.850" style="s2">example is the child mortality rate now</p>

<p begin="01:28:47.850" end="01:28:53.280" style="s2">Europe in 1952 like that&#39;s within the</p>
<p begin="01:28:51.060" end="01:28:56.280" style="s2">span of a single lifetime and that&#39;s in</p>

<p begin="01:28:56.880" end="01:29:03.480" style="s2">it&#39;s absolutely miraculous and so you</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.780" end="01:29:05.850" style="s2">know I know 10 statistics of that</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.480" end="01:29:08.220" style="s2">magnitude and well I&#39;m gonna review them</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.850" end="01:29:11.550" style="s2">and make sure I get this the correct ten</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.220" end="01:29:14.310" style="s2">to just make the case that while all the</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.550" end="01:29:16.350" style="s2">dismal consequences of capitalism have</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.310" end="01:29:18.750" style="s2">fundamentally failed to manifest</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.350" end="01:29:21.630" style="s2">themselves especially in comparison to</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.750" end="01:29:25.140" style="s2">the sins of other forms of communal</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.630" end="01:29:27.320" style="s2">organization and so then after that well</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.140" end="01:29:29.160" style="s2">he&#39;ll have a chance to make his case and</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.320" end="01:29:32.010" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna ask each other some</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.160" end="01:29:34.020" style="s2">questions and then the moderator and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.010" end="01:29:35.910" style="s2">audience will participate in questions</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.020" end="01:29:38.390" style="s2">and I hope I can have a good</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.910" end="01:29:41.130" style="s2">conversation with cheese yet because</p>
<p begin="01:29:38.390" end="01:29:43.980" style="s2">he&#39;s an interesting thinker and it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.130" end="01:29:46.230" style="s2">even clear to me why he identifies as a</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.980" end="01:29:48.480" style="s2">Marxist because he&#39;s creative in it</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.230" end="01:29:53.040" style="s2">enough in his own right in some sense to</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.480" end="01:29:57.980" style="s2">be his own man you know to be his own</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.040" end="01:30:02.490" style="s2">thinker so anyways that&#39;s how I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:29:57.980" end="01:30:07.260" style="s2">that&#39;s how I&#39;ve prepared well that you</p>
<p begin="01:30:02.490" end="01:30:10.080" style="s2">know whatever preparation forty years of</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.260" end="01:30:17.250" style="s2">thinking and argumentation might also</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.080" end="01:30:19.170" style="s2">constitute so ok so look it&#39;s 9:30 and</p>
<p begin="01:30:17.250" end="01:30:21.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a big day tomorrow because I</p>

<p begin="01:30:24.240" end="01:30:32.690" style="s2">because it&#39;s an important topic and it</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.760" end="01:30:32.690" style="s2">could have</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.219" end="01:30:39.489" style="s2">repercussions that are of sufficient</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.090" end="01:30:42.550" style="s2">magnitude so that it should be taken</p>
<p begin="01:30:39.489" end="01:30:45.070" style="s2">with the utmost seriousness I hope I can</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.550" end="01:30:48.760" style="s2">keep my sense of humor and I can keep my</p>
<p begin="01:30:45.070" end="01:30:51.729" style="s2">anger under control I hope I can listen</p>
