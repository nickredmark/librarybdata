<p begin="00:00:34.079" end="00:00:37.020" style="s2">talking to Paul today by the way we</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.790" end="00:00:41.460" style="s2">spoke very highly of both of you</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:42.870" style="s2">especially you Mary and I was saying</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.460" end="00:00:45.390" style="s2">well I was concerned about the one</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.870" end="00:00:46.800" style="s2">analogy I drew and you know Jordan had</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.390" end="00:00:49.980" style="s2">sort of spoke back and say John is</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.800" end="00:00:52.020" style="s2">trying to do this but it looks like</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.980" end="00:00:55.980" style="s2">looks like in general people are</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.020" end="00:00:57.719" style="s2">responding you know with charity but</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.980" end="00:00:59.609" style="s2">I&#39;ve never lost I&#39;m grateful for you</p>

<p begin="00:01:13.710" end="00:01:17.729" style="s2">so yeah one of the things I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.020" end="00:01:20.189" style="s2">could talk about was to come back on the</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.729" end="00:01:24.780" style="s2">issue of rationalization on the ground</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.189" end="00:01:27.060" style="s2">in the ground of B and if we can see any</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.780" end="00:01:30.329" style="s2">sort of person in there mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.060" end="00:01:32.970" style="s2">and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about this</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.329" end="00:01:36.450" style="s2">in the past few weeks especially using</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.970" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">original John by the way for the book</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.450" end="00:01:40.590" style="s2">recommendations those were very useful</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:43.500" style="s2">yeah and I very very interested in your</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.590" end="00:01:45.390" style="s2">Regina&#39;s thought as you know JP I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.500" end="00:01:47.880" style="s2">well you know I commented on it I really</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.390" end="00:01:52.380" style="s2">liked the video you did sort of trying</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.880" end="00:01:54.329" style="s2">to integrate era genus ideas was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.380" end="00:01:56.100" style="s2">my ideas about the but you know the</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.329" end="00:01:58.829" style="s2">bipolarity between emergence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.100" end="00:02:01.439" style="s2">emanation I wanted to say right now that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.829" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">that&#39;s very very close to how I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.439" end="00:02:05.969" style="s2">interpreting in Aegina and why I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">attracted to him and so I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.969" end="00:02:08.610" style="s2">thank you for that I thought what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:09.959" style="s2">did was very clear you&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.610" end="00:02:12.060" style="s2">getting other people telling you that</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.959" end="00:02:13.700" style="s2">that that video was a very very clear</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.060" end="00:02:15.709" style="s2">video and I thought it was very well</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.700" end="00:02:17.000" style="s2">and Mary thank you for the link you sent</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.709" end="00:02:19.340" style="s2">me I haven&#39;t had a chance to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.000" end="00:02:23.569" style="s2">yet about the era Gina talks but oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.340" end="00:02:26.810" style="s2">right I will do that well that professor</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.569" end="00:02:30.170" style="s2">um thinks that era Gina should be up</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.810" end="00:02:35.870" style="s2">there with Thomas Aquinas and Agustin</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.170" end="00:02:37.400" style="s2">she&#39;s very thinking I would - I would -</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.870" end="00:02:40.750" style="s2">and I mean era Gina&#39;s gonna figure in</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.400" end="00:02:44.000" style="s2">the after Socrates video because I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.750" end="00:02:45.920" style="s2">what you see is dialectic of being taken</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.000" end="00:02:47.180" style="s2">up right first of all it&#39;s written you</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.920" end="00:02:49.940" style="s2">know the division of nature is written</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.180" end="00:02:51.560" style="s2">as a dialogue right so it&#39;s very much</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.940" end="00:02:53.870" style="s2">Socratic like that but then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.560" end="00:02:55.430" style="s2">dialectic is it&#39;s sort of the the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.870" end="00:02:57.140" style="s2">culmination of the neo platonic vision</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.430" end="00:03:01.730" style="s2">it&#39;s not only between people and within</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.140" end="00:03:05.720" style="s2">thought but it sort all Tomica form -</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.730" end="00:03:07.100" style="s2">the structure of being itself and so era</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.720" end="00:03:10.250" style="s2">Jean is definitely going to be in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.100" end="00:03:12.200" style="s2">acts of Socrates video series and so I</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.250" end="00:03:16.459" style="s2">mean thank you both because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.200" end="00:03:18.950" style="s2">helpful to me yeah and now I also want</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.459" end="00:03:21.200" style="s2">to rather play mention you made a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.950" end="00:03:24.290" style="s2">point I think when you talk to Jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.200" end="00:03:27.049" style="s2">about Regina especially that one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.290" end="00:03:28.790" style="s2">you&#39;re one of the reasons why you were</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.049" end="00:03:31.579" style="s2">reticent to associate the original with</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.790" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">classical theism was that it was later</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.579" end="00:03:36.650" style="s2">persecuted as a as a heretic yeah which</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:42.950" style="s2">is really good evidence that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.650" end="00:03:44.870" style="s2">running afoul of classical so as I was</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:47.090" style="s2">researching no even in general I also</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.870" end="00:03:48.890" style="s2">tried to see a few reasons why it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.090" end="00:03:51.400" style="s2">classified as a as they you hear it</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.890" end="00:03:54.079" style="s2">again I mean because I don&#39;t Oh</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.400" end="00:03:56.299" style="s2">ideally I would avoid try to I would</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.079" end="00:03:58.700" style="s2">avoid being neurotic myself so I try to</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.299" end="00:04:00.769" style="s2">steer away from this and there are a few</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.700" end="00:04:03.650" style="s2">accusations which came up and as you</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.769" end="00:04:05.299" style="s2">raised also with Jonathan it&#39;s not clear</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.650" end="00:04:06.459" style="s2">exactly what your dream was persecuted</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.299" end="00:04:09.380" style="s2">as he yes</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.459" end="00:04:12.319" style="s2">comments all over the place um yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.380" end="00:04:15.079" style="s2">one thing yeah one thing which showed up</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.319" end="00:04:16.789" style="s2">was the accusation of the pantheism as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.079" end="00:04:18.289" style="s2">said in one of the videos I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.789" end="00:04:20.510" style="s2">something that I think it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.289" end="00:04:23.240" style="s2">lazy accusation because you original</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.510" end="00:04:25.729" style="s2">never tries to reduce God to anything so</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.240" end="00:04:27.350" style="s2">yeah yeah I think that yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.729" end="00:04:29.450" style="s2">that&#39;s like when they</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.350" end="00:04:30.620" style="s2">Socrates of atheism and corrupting the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.450" end="00:04:32.440" style="s2">youth yeah I think that way I think</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.620" end="00:04:35.090" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of a that was sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.440" end="00:04:37.370" style="s2">stand-in for some you know who this is</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.090" end="00:04:40.190" style="s2">like paganism or something so I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.370" end="00:04:43.100" style="s2">suspect that that&#39;s not that that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.190" end="00:04:45.080" style="s2">the thing I do I don&#39;t I do suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.100" end="00:04:47.630" style="s2">the accusations had some sincerity in</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.080" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">them because he was thought of so highly</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.630" end="00:04:52.480" style="s2">before he presented the division of</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:54.770" style="s2">nature so I what I mean is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.480" end="00:04:56.780" style="s2">again that the evidence is someone to</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.770" end="00:04:58.190" style="s2">determine but it sounds like people were</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.780" end="00:05:00.140" style="s2">sort of shocked when he produced it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.190" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">because he had such a people had such a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.140" end="00:05:03.770" style="s2">high opinion of going in so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.970" end="00:05:06.680" style="s2">think they were out to get him initially</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.770" end="00:05:08.960" style="s2">that that so I I don&#39;t think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.680" end="00:05:10.730" style="s2">plausible either so there&#39;s some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.960" end="00:05:14.090" style="s2">of his work that really really stepped</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.730" end="00:05:16.490" style="s2">on people&#39;s toes and and his fall was</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.090" end="00:05:18.410" style="s2">precipitous he was he was basically you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.490" end="00:05:22.390" style="s2">know the the court philosopher the court</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.410" end="00:05:30.860" style="s2">theologian and then like many disappears</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.390" end="00:05:35.230" style="s2">it&#39;s such an extreme fall the professor</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.860" end="00:05:39.610" style="s2">that I was listening to today said she</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.230" end="00:05:42.920" style="s2">made it sound like his he was actually</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.610" end="00:05:45.590" style="s2">condemned many centuries or several</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.920" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">centuries later that it was he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.590" end="00:05:48.430" style="s2">sound to me like she was saying it was</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:53.750" style="s2">during his lifetime</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.430" end="00:05:55.610" style="s2">after this scholastic oh yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.750" end="00:05:58.760" style="s2">yeah the official declaration of him his</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.610" end="00:06:01.340" style="s2">heresy comes later but the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.760" end="00:06:04.190" style="s2">again my understanding and many people</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.340" end="00:06:06.050" style="s2">with it&#39;s like this right is that</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.190" end="00:06:08.870" style="s2">somehow goes back to something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.050" end="00:06:10.690" style="s2">happened I mean like in his in his</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.870" end="00:06:13.610" style="s2">lifetime that was my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.690" end="00:06:15.740" style="s2">because like I said he&#39;s he disappears</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.610" end="00:06:20.060" style="s2">and he disappears under a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.740" end="00:06:23.150" style="s2">cloud of suspicion you know my my</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.060" end="00:06:26.000" style="s2">strategy to deal with this safety was to</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.150" end="00:06:28.460" style="s2">try to then bridge from original to st.</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.000" end="00:06:32.330" style="s2">Maximus the Confessor because Louisa say</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.460" end="00:06:34.040" style="s2">figure because he&#39;s a saint and a priest</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.330" end="00:06:36.200" style="s2">is insane so he&#39;s a saint in all</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.040" end="00:06:39.560" style="s2">traditions so if I can make it there it</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.200" end="00:06:41.060" style="s2">will be safer at least oh yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.560" end="00:06:43.790" style="s2">would be fair to Jonathan too</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.060" end="00:06:49.190" style="s2">Oh Joe because Maximus is pretty very</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.790" end="00:06:51.320" style="s2">much his hero with you yeah yeah well we</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.190" end="00:06:54.530" style="s2">I really like that conversation I mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.320" end="00:06:59.600" style="s2">it got a little heady and so hopefully</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.530" end="00:07:01.190" style="s2">we can make some some good analogies for</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.600" end="00:07:03.560" style="s2">people who are watching so that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.190" end="00:07:06.500" style="s2">get too too too too lost in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.560" end="00:07:11.030" style="s2">concept space yeah I liked I liked the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.500" end="00:07:13.130" style="s2">discussion about relevance realization</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.030" end="00:07:15.260" style="s2">and era Gina and what that might mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.130" end="00:07:17.570" style="s2">and Jonathan had this very extended</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.260" end="00:07:20.090" style="s2">notion of personhood you know which I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.570" end="00:07:21.740" style="s2">can&#39;t actually I couldn&#39;t quite make I</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.090" end="00:07:24.880" style="s2">was getting pieces of it but I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.740" end="00:07:29.000" style="s2">quite see how it work you know anyways</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.880" end="00:07:31.580" style="s2">this was also get to one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.000" end="00:07:34.190" style="s2">why original was seen as at least</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.580" end="00:07:36.410" style="s2">suspiciously and ultimately condemned as</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.190" end="00:07:41.020" style="s2">a heretic is there&#39;s a distinction in</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.410" end="00:07:44.180" style="s2">which it sort of it sort of emerges in</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.020" end="00:07:47.270" style="s2">especially the Christian East there is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.180" end="00:07:48.770" style="s2">recent loss of her name David Russia was</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.270" end="00:07:51.040" style="s2">written about this is it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.770" end="00:07:53.150" style="s2">distinction between essence and energies</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.040" end="00:07:55.070" style="s2">especially in the eastern of their</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.150" end="00:07:58.100" style="s2">extradition and apparently you can trace</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.070" end="00:08:00.260" style="s2">it all the way back to st. Paul in in</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.100" end="00:08:02.540" style="s2">his writings he is the first one to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.260" end="00:08:04.910" style="s2">the terms of energies only when talking</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.540" end="00:08:07.940" style="s2">about the actions or the manifestations</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.910" end="00:08:12.530" style="s2">of iron level beings like like God or</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.940" end="00:08:15.710" style="s2">demons and it&#39;s a distinction which you</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.530" end="00:08:19.220" style="s2">can see also apparently in st. Maximus</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.710" end="00:08:22.660" style="s2">and this allows them to explain ow so</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.220" end="00:08:26.020" style="s2">you can have a vision of personhood with</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.660" end="00:08:30.380" style="s2">sort of very deep manifestations and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.020" end="00:08:35.450" style="s2">ultimately one of the ways to see it</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.380" end="00:08:38.270" style="s2">maybe is in the in the West there was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.450" end="00:08:39.680" style="s2">as you as you point out John a natural</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.270" end="00:08:40.940" style="s2">supernatural distinction which became</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.680" end="00:08:42.800" style="s2">clearer and clearer and then fully</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.940" end="00:08:45.860" style="s2">articulated with the same Thomas Aquinas</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.800" end="00:08:50.990" style="s2">whereas in in the East instead of having</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.860" end="00:08:54.779" style="s2">a very clean cut to world mythology it</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.990" end="00:08:59.160" style="s2">was always more of a a continuous cosmos</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.779" end="00:09:01.500" style="s2">where the distinction they see between</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.160" end="00:09:03.480" style="s2">God&#39;s essence and his energies is not</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.500" end="00:09:04.379" style="s2">like at one level you have a sense and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.480" end="00:09:06.540" style="s2">then at the other level you have</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.379" end="00:09:10.290" style="s2">energies the energy sort of always</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.540" end="00:09:12.930" style="s2">received it always depends on our on</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.290" end="00:09:16.410" style="s2">where you stand on how you can look at</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.930" end="00:09:18.329" style="s2">it so even anytime we comes up with</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.410" end="00:09:20.129" style="s2">something simpler maybe like when my</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.329" end="00:09:22.980" style="s2">essence and my energies like I&#39;m a human</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.129" end="00:09:27.149" style="s2">and I can as a human person as a human</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.980" end="00:09:29.540" style="s2">hypostasis I can deploy some I can</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.149" end="00:09:33.930" style="s2">manifest I can manifest the energies of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.540" end="00:09:35.310" style="s2">a human nature let&#39;s say I&#39;m typing on</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.930" end="00:09:37.829" style="s2">this keyboard I&#39;m doing something very</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.310" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">human at this moment so only human</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.829" end="00:09:46.620" style="s2">hypothesis I have the power to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:50.100" style="s2">the the human nature there and in this</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.620" end="00:09:51.870" style="s2">manifestation I can bring some some</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.100" end="00:09:53.699" style="s2">lower beings into participation there</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.870" end="00:09:56.810" style="s2">like my aunt for instance I can bring my</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.699" end="00:10:00.600" style="s2">hands into typing on the keyboard and</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.810" end="00:10:03.540" style="s2">the important point there is that when</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.600" end="00:10:05.759" style="s2">my aunt participate in my energies in</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.540" end="00:10:08.069" style="s2">mind my typing there they can</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.759" end="00:10:09.660" style="s2">participate more or less like maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.069" end="00:10:12.990" style="s2">have a disease in my hand and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.660" end="00:10:16.019" style="s2">fully respond to our typing but if my</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.990" end="00:10:18.839" style="s2">end my enter are fully healthy and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.019" end="00:10:21.300" style="s2">fully participate in my typing they if</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.839" end="00:10:24.449" style="s2">they be fully participate in my energies</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.300" end="00:10:26.430" style="s2">then my end is also more fully a hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.449" end="00:10:28.410" style="s2">it&#39;s healthier it does what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.430" end="00:10:33.029" style="s2">supposed to do and so on so yeah a</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.410" end="00:10:36.420" style="s2">notion not only oh I am a human enzyme</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.029" end="00:10:37.800" style="s2">an institution of the human nature I can</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.420" end="00:10:41.279" style="s2">manifest this in doing certain things</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.800" end="00:10:44.430" style="s2">and I can bring lower things in certain</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.279" end="00:10:48.389" style="s2">positions in my energies and with this</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.430" end="00:10:49.740" style="s2">distinction this allows st. Maximus to</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.389" end="00:10:52.949" style="s2">do things especially I mean to do with</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.740" end="00:10:55.050" style="s2">bodies which originate doesn&#39;t and some</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.949" end="00:10:55.980" style="s2">things which seem very suspicious from a</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.050" end="00:10:57.629" style="s2">Christian point of view</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.980" end="00:11:00.350" style="s2">so for princess original doesn&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.629" end="00:11:03.899" style="s2">that we add bodies before the fall and</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.350" end="00:11:06.779" style="s2">also on the other end of the spectrum</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.899" end="00:11:08.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear in original system why</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.779" end="00:11:10.230" style="s2">the Incarnation was</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.040" end="00:11:13.139" style="s2">was it important that they said the</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.230" end="00:11:15.300" style="s2">logos became a body and also it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.139" end="00:11:18.000" style="s2">talk much about how we can participate</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.300" end="00:11:19.949" style="s2">in this how we can participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.000" end="00:11:21.449" style="s2">body of Christ whereas it&#39;s all over the</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.949" end="00:11:24.779" style="s2">place if you read about few assists in</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.449" end="00:11:26.339" style="s2">st. Maximus that define ization takes</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.779" end="00:11:28.470" style="s2">place within the body of Christ or as</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.339" end="00:11:31.740" style="s2">Mary you&#39;ve been talking you know leaf</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.470" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">in your videos in a community of logos</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.740" end="00:11:34.940" style="s2">it takes place with it so me really a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:37.620" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.940" end="00:11:40.610" style="s2">so this is those are all touch points</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.620" end="00:11:42.690" style="s2">which you would you know doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.610" end="00:11:45.060" style="s2">sometimes when you read the provision</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.690" end="00:11:48.899" style="s2">you can see it even there where you</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.060" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">mentioned the Incarnation and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.899" end="00:11:52.350" style="s2">that the word became flesh and so on but</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.160" end="00:11:54.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not clear why it matters really it</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.350" end="00:11:56.850" style="s2">doesn&#39;t give the sort of precise</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.000" end="00:12:00.029" style="s2">arguments which Maximus is able to give</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.850" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">and I think it will come down to this</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.029" end="00:12:06.750" style="s2">link between our lessons when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:10.500" style="s2">instituted into a person between</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.750" end="00:12:15.149" style="s2">apotheosis can then manifest itself at</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.500" end="00:12:16.500" style="s2">those different levels what is the</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.149" end="00:12:21.170" style="s2">difference between what you&#39;re calling</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.500" end="00:12:21.170" style="s2">energies and what we would call works</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.199" end="00:12:26.100" style="s2">that&#39;s a good question I would do in</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.600" end="00:12:29.880" style="s2">bank works especially with what sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.100" end="00:12:31.620" style="s2">bit of examples we have well like just</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.880" end="00:12:33.720" style="s2">what you said about like typing on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.620" end="00:12:36.420" style="s2">computer it&#39;s like it&#39;s you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.720" end="00:12:40.529" style="s2">you&#39;re doing work right and I&#39;m isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.420" end="00:12:42.269" style="s2">there isn&#39;t there etymologically a</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.529" end="00:12:46.500" style="s2">connection between the word energy and</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.269" end="00:12:48.389" style="s2">the word work it&#39;s odd atom illogical as</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.500" end="00:12:51.540" style="s2">definitional energies the capacity to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.389" end="00:12:53.339" style="s2">worked with in physics okay okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.540" end="00:12:57.630" style="s2">what I thought you know with some</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.339" end="00:12:59.069" style="s2">connection so would so I guess my my</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.630" end="00:13:02.310" style="s2">question is then what&#39;s the difference</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.069" end="00:13:04.439" style="s2">between what you&#39;re describing when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.310" end="00:13:08.069" style="s2">talk about like typing on a computer or</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.439" end="00:13:11.069" style="s2">doing something that you know it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.069" end="00:13:13.380" style="s2">your essence becomes manifested through</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.069" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">a work well I don&#39;t see the difference</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.380" end="00:13:17.730" style="s2">between and we&#39;re done today I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.350" style="s2">why are we using the word if energy is</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.730" end="00:13:21.779" style="s2">the capacity to do work but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.350" end="00:13:26.100" style="s2">talking about the doing then why</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.779" end="00:13:27.810" style="s2">using the word continuing good point</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.100" end="00:13:29.790" style="s2">one the important thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.810" end="00:13:35.730" style="s2">especially in the East they will</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.790" end="00:13:39.360" style="s2">identify in a I guess in an illogical</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.730" end="00:13:42.930" style="s2">way in d the hypostasis</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.360" end="00:13:45.240" style="s2">with the the energies so in the case of</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.930" end="00:13:48.059" style="s2">God for instance if you participate in</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.240" end="00:13:50.610" style="s2">God&#39;s energies you do participate in God</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.059" end="00:13:52.379" style="s2">so actually don&#39;t participate in God&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.610" end="00:13:55.379" style="s2">essence is that the idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.379" end="00:13:58.019" style="s2">nope not in existence we we humans never</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.379" end="00:14:00.779" style="s2">reach God&#39;s essence we can&#39;t participate</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.019" end="00:14:03.980" style="s2">to diverse degrees in his energies so</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.779" end="00:14:07.079" style="s2">even the mere fact that we exist is is</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.980" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">signifies that we&#39;re being held in</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.079" end="00:14:10.559" style="s2">existence by the common being so we</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.240" style="s2">participate in the energies to this</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.559" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">extent but we can participate more fully</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.240" end="00:14:17.790" style="s2">they see like when I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:21.269" style="s2">my hand know my end if it&#39;s if it&#39;s sick</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.790" end="00:14:23.129" style="s2">in responding properly it&#39;s still for</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.269" end="00:14:24.720" style="s2">them it can still participate in what</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.129" end="00:14:26.699" style="s2">I&#39;m doing but to a lesser degree then</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.720" end="00:14:29.300" style="s2">weighted food when it fully obeys when</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.699" end="00:14:32.129" style="s2">it fully becomes part of part of me and</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.300" end="00:14:34.620" style="s2">but I&#39;m interested in the participation</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.129" end="00:14:37.129" style="s2">the other way JP you know maybe Mary is</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.620" end="00:14:40.050" style="s2">- I&#39;m interested not so much how your</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.129" end="00:14:42.870" style="s2">hand can participate in things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.050" end="00:14:44.879" style="s2">interested in is the relationship is a</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.870" end="00:14:47.670" style="s2">relationship of participation between</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.879" end="00:14:50.009" style="s2">the dynamics because that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.670" end="00:14:51.809" style="s2">would say in your aerosol between the</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.009" end="00:14:54.509" style="s2">dynamics of your hand and your essence</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.809" end="00:14:56.879" style="s2">like your hand is part of your identity</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.509" end="00:15:00.480" style="s2">such that if I if I cut your hand you</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.879" end="00:15:02.759" style="s2">say oh you cut me right you don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:05.699" style="s2">right you know and I&#39;d be guilty of</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.759" end="00:15:08.730" style="s2">hurting you as a person if I damaged</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.699" end="00:15:12.569" style="s2">your hand is that what&#39;s being invoked</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.730" end="00:15:14.309" style="s2">here that you know that I mean it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.569" end="00:15:15.509" style="s2">if they talk about the hand of God in</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.309" end="00:15:18.029" style="s2">the Bible so what might we could even</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.509" end="00:15:20.490" style="s2">use that as a metaphor perhaps I mean is</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.029" end="00:15:24.720" style="s2">you know I&#39;m trying to I&#39;m trying to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.490" end="00:15:27.420" style="s2">what this does in terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.720" end="00:15:29.420" style="s2">participation in God that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.420" end="00:15:33.449" style="s2">trying to get it so the idea is we could</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.420" end="00:15:35.459" style="s2">we can interact with God&#39;s hand and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.449" end="00:15:37.829" style="s2">God&#39;s hand has a participatory</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.459" end="00:15:40.259" style="s2">identity with him but God&#39;s hand is not</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.829" end="00:15:42.059" style="s2">his essence is it something like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.259" end="00:15:43.619" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to understand what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.059" end="00:15:49.619" style="s2">yes yes</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.619" end="00:15:54.240" style="s2">so we yes I&#39;m not sure I see you the</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.619" end="00:15:55.740" style="s2">point you just read about how you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:58.259" style="s2">to see the other way around in the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.740" end="00:16:00.209" style="s2">oh my and you were telling me how the</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.259" end="00:16:02.459" style="s2">Hitman you&#39;re here could participate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.209" end="00:16:04.350" style="s2">the world but I was interested in how</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.459" end="00:16:05.730" style="s2">your hand participates in your essence</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.350" end="00:16:07.589" style="s2">okay trying to get out I&#39;m trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.730" end="00:16:09.929" style="s2">him I&#39;m trying to get at the relation</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.589" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">with him God between his energy and his</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.929" end="00:16:14.189" style="s2">essence what&#39;s that what&#39;s the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:15.389" style="s2">that relay relations because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.189" end="00:16:18.389" style="s2">there&#39;s must be some metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.389" end="00:16:20.279" style="s2">difference because I can participate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.389" end="00:16:22.199" style="s2">God&#39;s energy according to you you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.279" end="00:16:24.600" style="s2">but I can&#39;t participate in God&#39;s essence</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.199" end="00:16:27.929" style="s2">so there the relation can&#39;t be one of</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.600" end="00:16:29.730" style="s2">identity between God&#39;s energy and his</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.929" end="00:16:32.579" style="s2">essence but it can&#39;t be one of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.730" end="00:16:35.129" style="s2">identity or then I can&#39;t enter into a</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.579" end="00:16:37.199" style="s2">relationship with God that&#39;s what that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.129" end="00:16:39.209" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying yeah that&#39;s a very deep</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.199" end="00:16:41.009" style="s2">question and I suspect that this will</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.209" end="00:16:43.649" style="s2">have something deep to do as well with</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.009" end="00:16:47.160" style="s2">our original reunites the four divisions</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.649" end="00:16:49.470" style="s2">of nature in because ultimately all the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.160" end="00:16:51.869" style="s2">divisions do well together there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.470" end="00:16:54.089" style="s2">sense in which they see the created</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.869" end="00:16:57.629" style="s2">uncreated mm-hmm they created on</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.089" end="00:17:00.059" style="s2">treating is part of God itself in being</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.629" end="00:17:02.879" style="s2">in God it cannot exist outside of it or</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.059" end="00:17:04.740" style="s2">it will just see existing so there has</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.879" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">to be a relationship that&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.740" end="00:17:07.709" style="s2">articulate and I think this is what</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:11.909" style="s2">they&#39;re pointing at with the essence</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.709" end="00:17:13.709" style="s2">energy distinction but I mean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.909" end="00:17:17.039" style="s2">something like then I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.709" end="00:17:18.899" style="s2">something like you know and Jonathan was</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.039" end="00:17:20.610" style="s2">talking about this you know the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.899" end="00:17:25.589" style="s2">Neoplatonic idea that the hypostasis</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:28.590" style="s2">right it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.589" end="00:17:30.029" style="s2">essentially identical to that with it</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.590" end="00:17:33.149" style="s2">that&#39;s why it&#39;s a relationship of</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.029" end="00:17:36.510" style="s2">participation right the intellect the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.149" end="00:17:38.820" style="s2">the the the realm of the forms the inner</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.510" end="00:17:42.169" style="s2">pair the eternal interpenetrating system</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.820" end="00:17:44.159" style="s2">of the forms in the platonic sense</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.169" end="00:17:46.260" style="s2">participates the one it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.159" end="00:17:48.310" style="s2">transitive verb right it participates</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.260" end="00:17:52.150" style="s2">the one it proceeds and returns</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.310" end="00:17:54.640" style="s2">but it is not identical to the one and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.150" end="00:17:56.620" style="s2">it sounds like your truck you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.640" end="00:17:58.540" style="s2">that you see maximus doing the same kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.620" end="00:18:01.150" style="s2">of thing yeah but I do think that also</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.540" end="00:18:02.440" style="s2">as Jonathan said that in Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.150" end="00:18:04.060" style="s2">like the most important thing is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.440" end="00:18:06.370" style="s2">the infinite is equal with the</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.060" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">manifestation of the infinite that you</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.370" end="00:18:14.050" style="s2">you really do want to identify yes God</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:17.670" style="s2">is energy okay okay so okay so okay now</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.050" end="00:18:22.270" style="s2">I see so did so you&#39;re suggesting that</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.670" end="00:18:25.390" style="s2">the the participation of God&#39;s essence</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.270" end="00:18:28.780" style="s2">into his energies it does not have the</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.390" end="00:18:31.930" style="s2">dominion did the diminishment in being</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.780" end="00:18:35.950" style="s2">that the Neoplatonic process of a nation</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.930" end="00:18:37.990" style="s2">as it is that is oh I see yes that that</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.950" end="00:18:46.830" style="s2">I would say that&#39;s really I would say</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.990" end="00:18:46.830" style="s2">that that&#39;s really key yeah yeah work so</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.790" end="00:18:53.080" style="s2">and this is where I would think that we</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.890" end="00:18:56.410" style="s2">make the great distinction between the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.080" end="00:18:59.680" style="s2">created and the uncreated that God the</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.410" end="00:19:04.420" style="s2">uncreated and all of the creation right</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.680" end="00:19:10.960" style="s2">that okay let&#39;s see how I can put this</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.420" end="00:19:12.340" style="s2">into words so the the the things that</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.960" end="00:19:19.300" style="s2">are contingent the things that are</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.340" end="00:19:23.530" style="s2">created can participate to a greater or</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.300" end="00:19:26.920" style="s2">lesser extent in God&#39;s energies by</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.530" end="00:19:29.080" style="s2">cooperation okay and this would</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.920" end="00:19:31.240" style="s2">especially be true of the intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.080" end="00:19:37.930" style="s2">creation which can choose to cooperate</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.240" end="00:19:41.880" style="s2">right but as but they&#39;re it&#39;s not as</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.930" end="00:19:48.910" style="s2">though it&#39;s not as though God is sending</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.880" end="00:19:55.510" style="s2">forth beings that are less and less and</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.910" end="00:20:01.590" style="s2">less him down down hmm I&#39;m kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.510" end="00:20:04.290" style="s2">losing a the way to express it</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.590" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">okay maybe JP kind of understands what</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.290" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">saying we&#39;re not we&#39;re not like</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:11.870" style="s2">everything that in a set there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:18.360" style="s2">in which everything that is created from</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.870" end="00:20:24.030" style="s2">the highest angel to the you know lowest</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.360" end="00:20:29.300" style="s2">you know slug to every you know Adam is</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.030" end="00:20:32.300" style="s2">is in a way um he equal in being</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.300" end="00:20:32.300" style="s2">creation</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.980" end="00:20:40.380" style="s2">yes contrasted to God who is uncreated</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.860" end="00:20:43.470" style="s2">okay so let me give you an example this</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.380" end="00:20:46.620" style="s2">is something I thought of years ago but</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.470" end="00:20:49.230" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s just an illustration so</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.620" end="00:20:50.910" style="s2">many years ago there I don&#39;t know if was</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.230" end="00:20:52.710" style="s2">National Geographic Scientific American</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.910" end="00:20:55.680" style="s2">or what magazine it was but they would</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.710" end="00:20:57.780" style="s2">have a page in there and what they would</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.680" end="00:21:01.140" style="s2">be doing is showing you something a</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.780" end="00:21:03.210" style="s2">great magnification yeah and then you</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.140" end="00:21:04.950" style="s2">would try to guess what the thing was</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.210" end="00:21:07.770" style="s2">and you were you could never guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.950" end="00:21:10.140" style="s2">really because it would be so different</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.770" end="00:21:14.880" style="s2">from the thing that you saw if you</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.140" end="00:21:18.150" style="s2">looked at the thing one time they had an</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.880" end="00:21:21.420" style="s2">image that it looked like the surface of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.150" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">the Moon with all these craters and</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.420" end="00:21:27.150" style="s2">everything it looked just that you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:29.040" style="s2">like the world like there were um cliffs</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.150" end="00:21:31.710" style="s2">that you could fall over and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.040" end="00:21:33.240" style="s2">and then you know you tried to guess</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.710" end="00:21:36.600" style="s2">what it was well it turned out that it</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.240" end="00:21:38.700" style="s2">was the surface of an egg hmm okay would</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.600" end="00:21:41.460" style="s2">you wait which seems so smooth to you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.700" end="00:21:42.870" style="s2">when you hold it in your hand right even</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.460" end="00:21:44.220" style="s2">though it might have slight texture it</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.870" end="00:21:46.800" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look anything like it it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.220" end="00:21:49.800" style="s2">two craters and cliffs on it and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.800" end="00:21:53.040" style="s2">remember thinking when I saw that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.800" end="00:21:57.200" style="s2">remember thinking down here in the realm</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.040" end="00:22:02.250" style="s2">of creation or down here on earth we see</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.200" end="00:22:04.170" style="s2">so many differences you know we like</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.250" end="00:22:06.060" style="s2">even between human beings and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.170" end="00:22:07.920" style="s2">always looking at you know who&#39;s at the</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.060" end="00:22:09.610" style="s2">top of the hierarchy and who&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.920" end="00:22:11.590" style="s2">middle of news at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.610" end="00:22:13.570" style="s2">all these differences but maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.590" end="00:22:18.059" style="s2">remember having this thought maybe from</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.570" end="00:22:23.100" style="s2">God&#39;s perspective we&#39;re all equal</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.059" end="00:22:23.100" style="s2">because I turn off my email</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.429" end="00:22:35.650" style="s2">so anyway does that does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.770" end="00:22:37.870" style="s2">as an illustration of what I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.650" end="00:22:41.440" style="s2">say that the difference there&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.870" end="00:22:44.860" style="s2">this absolute difference between the the</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.440" end="00:22:47.980" style="s2">uncreated between God the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.860" end="00:22:50.470" style="s2">being and all of creation that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.980" end="00:22:55.240" style="s2">way in which all of creation is actually</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.470" end="00:22:58.630" style="s2">just that has the same status it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.240" end="00:23:01.059" style="s2">it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a diminishment even</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.630" end="00:23:02.799" style="s2">though think I think I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.059" end="00:23:11.590" style="s2">definitely a diminishment just I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.799" end="00:23:13.510" style="s2">to do with the fall that&#39;s fall for just</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.590" end="00:23:16.570" style="s2">a minute just to talk about it in terms</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.510" end="00:23:18.700" style="s2">of the creation for a minute because we</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.570" end="00:23:24.070" style="s2">can always come back and talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.700" end="00:23:25.990" style="s2">fall you know sorry Barry I wanna make</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.070" end="00:23:29.110" style="s2">sure you done yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.990" end="00:23:31.240" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to get yes I think I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.110" end="00:23:34.390" style="s2">getting a glimmer but I&#39;m not it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.240" end="00:23:36.100" style="s2">clear because I&#39;m trying to and I mean</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.390" end="00:23:39.910" style="s2">this was a point that Jonathan was also</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.100" end="00:23:44.980" style="s2">he was trying to you know emphasize that</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.910" end="00:23:47.910" style="s2">there right there&#39;s kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.980" end="00:23:50.790" style="s2">Christianity sees goodness throughout</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.910" end="00:23:54.520" style="s2">whereas Neoplatonism sees a diminishment</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.790" end="00:23:58.270" style="s2">as things emanate okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.520" end="00:24:01.419" style="s2">and so is that now one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.270" end="00:24:03.309" style="s2">that of course for me a deep innovator</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.419" end="00:24:06.059" style="s2">so in new platonism you have the</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.309" end="00:24:08.559" style="s2">procession you have you moved from</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.059" end="00:24:10.360" style="s2">singularity not not which is not the</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.559" end="00:24:12.280" style="s2">same thing as a single it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.360" end="00:24:14.650" style="s2">the singularity of the Big Bang right</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.280" end="00:24:16.960" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s that kind right</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.650" end="00:24:19.300" style="s2">it it&#39;s condemned debate it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.960" end="00:24:22.720" style="s2">intelligibility back to its ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.300" end="00:24:23.010" style="s2">unity etc and then it proceeds out but</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.720" end="00:24:24.060" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.010" end="00:24:26.730" style="s2">everything is also simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.060" end="00:24:28.920" style="s2">returning which you know right but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.730" end="00:24:31.740" style="s2">the the big difference I think in era</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.920" end="00:24:33.510" style="s2">Gina for me and why I&#39;m so interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.740" end="00:24:34.260" style="s2">and I&#39;ll give me a second guys and I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.510" end="00:24:36.330" style="s2">try and connect those two points</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.260" end="00:24:39.840" style="s2">together so I don&#39;t mean to trust fasten</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.330" end="00:24:42.060" style="s2">your patience right is right for</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.840" end="00:24:43.680" style="s2">platonist for example if there is the</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.060" end="00:24:46.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t there&#39;s the diminishment all the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.680" end="00:24:48.420" style="s2">way down right and there&#39;s a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.140" end="00:24:50.490" style="s2">which the emergence isn&#39;t really the</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.420" end="00:24:51.840" style="s2">return isn&#39;t emergency you know in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.490" end="00:24:53.760" style="s2">sense I would talk about it it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.840" end="00:24:57.420" style="s2">contribute it&#39;s just it&#39;s a return think</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.760" end="00:24:59.070" style="s2">of the language right um so for example</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.420" end="00:25:01.800" style="s2">if I go down and Platonists like yet at</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.070" end="00:25:03.690" style="s2">the bottom which is pure right pure lack</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.800" end="00:25:04.590" style="s2">of form pure matter and for Platonists</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.690" end="00:25:09.120" style="s2">that&#39;s pure evil</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.590" end="00:25:12.150" style="s2">right but what I see in era Gina is no</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.120" end="00:25:13.530" style="s2">no that&#39;s for him right that&#39;s the flow</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.150" end="00:25:14.700" style="s2">the way you&#39;re explaining it to it I</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.530" end="00:25:16.680" style="s2">think you agree with it that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.700" end="00:25:19.500" style="s2">inexhaustible right and that&#39;s from</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.680" end="00:25:20.760" style="s2">which every an emergence is just as if</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.500" end="00:25:22.590" style="s2">you&#39;ll allow me this word I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.760" end="00:25:24.810" style="s2">to trespass on your space but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.590" end="00:25:27.990" style="s2">emergence upward is just as sacred as</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.810" end="00:25:29.460" style="s2">the emanation down right because the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.990" end="00:25:32.310" style="s2">emergence upward expresses the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.460" end="00:25:35.720" style="s2">inexhaustible in a sense and then the</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.310" end="00:25:38.670" style="s2">emanation down expresses the ultimate</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.720" end="00:25:40.470" style="s2">unity and integrity of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.670" end="00:25:45.390" style="s2">and both of those are worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.470" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">sacredness is that yes yes yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.390" end="00:25:58.110" style="s2">that&#39;s why I wanted to mention the fall</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:26:00.090" style="s2">just because you coming down and going</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.110" end="00:26:05.130" style="s2">back there&#39;s another language we could</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.090" end="00:26:09.270" style="s2">use we could use origin and Tilos right</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.130" end="00:26:11.460" style="s2">well Tilos is really the origin right so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.270" end="00:26:17.880" style="s2">we could talk about beginning and end</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.460" end="00:26:20.580" style="s2">alpha and omega yeah yeah so I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.880" end="00:26:22.950" style="s2">interested yeah I mean well I think they</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.580" end="00:26:26.790" style="s2">should I think the vertical ontological</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.950" end="00:26:30.240" style="s2">and the horizontal historical actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.790" end="00:26:31.500" style="s2">should be sort of triangulated but</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.240" end="00:26:33.570" style="s2">because in era Gina they&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.500" end="00:26:35.700" style="s2">be triangulated into something that</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.570" end="00:26:37.110" style="s2">transcends both of them in him I</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.700" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">understand it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.110" end="00:26:43.920" style="s2">so I think using both is is good but I</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.080" style="s2">think they they pre go different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.920" end="00:26:50.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t know this is important at that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.080" end="00:26:54.060" style="s2">point right now I guess what about what</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.340" end="00:26:56.070" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in is what Mary said</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.060" end="00:26:57.810" style="s2">first I also want to hold off before we</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.070" end="00:27:00.090" style="s2">get to the fall if that&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.810" end="00:27:03.750" style="s2">so I&#39;m trying to understand Mary because</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.090" end="00:27:05.790" style="s2">I can see I was trying to capture the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.750" end="00:27:08.610" style="s2">smoothness of the egg is one way in</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.790" end="00:27:11.880" style="s2">which it&#39;s sacred because the smoothness</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.610" end="00:27:14.910" style="s2">points towards that that the oneness of</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.880" end="00:27:18.210" style="s2">the intelligibility but the differences</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.910" end="00:27:21.180" style="s2">of the a is all those differences</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.210" end="00:27:24.420" style="s2">actually generate all of the capacity</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.180" end="00:27:29.060" style="s2">for for things to emerge for new things</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.420" end="00:27:32.040" style="s2">to happen and and so and that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.060" end="00:27:35.130" style="s2">worthy of being thought of as sacred</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.040" end="00:27:37.020" style="s2">justice as much as as as the smoothness</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.130" end="00:27:38.790" style="s2">of the egg the dappled it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.020" end="00:27:41.820" style="s2">out manly Hoffman&#39;s right the dappled</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.790" end="00:27:44.130" style="s2">nurse of things it&#39;s just as much as a</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.820" end="00:27:46.140" style="s2">sacredness as the smoothness if I could</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.130" end="00:27:50.010" style="s2">usually metaphor is that doing justice</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.140" end="00:27:54.330" style="s2">to what you were saying yes all creation</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.010" end="00:27:57.320" style="s2">is good yes but but but but the I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.330" end="00:27:57.320" style="s2">trying to get that there&#39;s two different</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.130" end="00:28:05.280" style="s2">languages go ahead JP I&#39;m talking too</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.440" end="00:28:07.890" style="s2">much I definitely agree with the to the</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.280" end="00:28:10.500" style="s2">fact that there is emanation from God</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.890" end="00:28:14.340" style="s2">from the ground of intelligibility and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.500" end="00:28:16.370" style="s2">emergence from the common being and to</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.340" end="00:28:18.960" style="s2">meet the inexhaustible and the ground</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.370" end="00:28:23.100" style="s2">what you don&#39;t need they completely</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.960" end="00:28:24.570" style="s2">interpenetrate yeah yeah yeah yeah every</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.100" end="00:28:27.360" style="s2">place where do you meet then things</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.570" end="00:28:29.010" style="s2">exist in creation exists that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.360" end="00:28:31.530" style="s2">and that&#39;s the dialectic that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.010" end="00:28:34.290" style="s2">dialectic in creation yeah yes and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.530" end="00:28:35.880" style="s2">is what I I this is where participation</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.290" end="00:28:39.030" style="s2">can come in as well because we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.880" end="00:28:41.160" style="s2">frustrate this or such if we do not</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.030" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">participate in being properly we can</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.160" end="00:28:45.990" style="s2">avoid the emergence from reaching what</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.440" end="00:28:48.060" style="s2">it should yes this is why I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.990" end="00:28:50.140" style="s2">mention the fall and here was this also</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.060" end="00:28:52.780" style="s2">ultimately in especially</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.140" end="00:28:56.200" style="s2">that&#39;s I think this could be one of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.780" end="00:28:58.179" style="s2">reasons why my and example was was a bit</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.200" end="00:28:59.440" style="s2">messy at the beginning because no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.179" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">not perfectly identified with my</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.440" end="00:29:05.500" style="s2">manifestations and similarly right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:08.140" style="s2">you can say that the the the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.500" end="00:29:09.790" style="s2">and the emanation are not in the proper</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.140" end="00:29:11.860" style="s2">relationship because we&#39;re after the</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.790" end="00:29:13.690" style="s2">fall but the idea is that especially the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.860" end="00:29:18.120" style="s2">human being and especially in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.690" end="00:29:19.960" style="s2">original as the role of working in this</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.120" end="00:29:22.150" style="s2">relationship between Negro being in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.960" end="00:29:24.970" style="s2">ground of its logic intelligibility we</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.150" end="00:29:27.240" style="s2">have the before the fall and then after</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.970" end="00:29:29.980" style="s2">its services we have the role of</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.240" end="00:29:33.820" style="s2">mediating between the two so there&#39;s re</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.980" end="00:29:36.040" style="s2">fracture in being yeah I get that and I</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.820" end="00:29:38.860" style="s2">think I mean and and the point of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.040" end="00:29:41.380" style="s2">dialectic in the division of nature is</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.860" end="00:29:43.059" style="s2">to exemplify how we can come into</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.380" end="00:29:45.549" style="s2">control how we can come into greater</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.059" end="00:29:49.480" style="s2">conformity not in what we say but in</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.549" end="00:29:51.160" style="s2">what we in how we think and interact</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.480" end="00:29:53.320" style="s2">with each other so it&#39;s more about our</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.160" end="00:29:55.540" style="s2">being and that is how we can come into a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.320" end="00:29:58.630" style="s2">better alignment with sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.540" end="00:30:01.720" style="s2">the flow of the dialectic of being I I</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.630" end="00:30:04.299" style="s2">think I think that&#39;s deeply right so</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.720" end="00:30:06.040" style="s2">it&#39;s what I wanted to say I mean this is</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.299" end="00:30:13.030" style="s2">what was also going on with with</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.040" end="00:30:17.559" style="s2">Jonathan is for me so be charitable to</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.030" end="00:30:20.740" style="s2">me guys I&#39;m trying okay so in in deep</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.559" end="00:30:22.299" style="s2">learning which is you know some of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.740" end="00:30:24.760" style="s2">best artificial intelligence and it</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.299" end="00:30:25.990" style="s2">looks like how the brain and this is and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.760" end="00:30:28.030" style="s2">I make use of it and relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.990" end="00:30:29.799" style="s2">realization and that&#39;s where Jonathan I</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.030" end="00:30:31.780" style="s2">made it might have had a connecting</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.799" end="00:30:33.730" style="s2">point what you see is you see it you see</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.780" end="00:30:35.470" style="s2">the system cycling you see the system</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.730" end="00:30:37.360" style="s2">cycling so what it does is it does</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.470" end="00:30:39.880" style="s2">compression and it tries to get what is</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.360" end="00:30:43.570" style="s2">invariant and in that sense eternally</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.880" end="00:30:47.140" style="s2">sort of one and then it flows out to all</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.570" end="00:30:48.910" style="s2">the variations right and then they are</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.140" end="00:30:50.230" style="s2">gathered back up again and that&#39;s of</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.910" end="00:30:52.120" style="s2">course you know the model of relevance</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.230" end="00:30:55.929" style="s2">realization the model of evolution and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.120" end="00:30:58.419" style="s2">for me right I was thinking oh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.929" end="00:31:00.610" style="s2">kind of interesting because that might</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.419" end="00:31:03.450" style="s2">be a potential way of seeing something</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.610" end="00:31:04.649" style="s2">deeply analogous but we</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.450" end="00:31:06.779" style="s2">which is what you and I&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.649" end="00:31:08.669" style="s2">about JP and you and all three of us</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.779" end="00:31:11.490" style="s2">last time Mary is that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.669" end="00:31:13.860" style="s2">analogous you know it&#39;s a it&#39;s an invest</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.490" end="00:31:16.919" style="s2">in I are an Augustinian idea you know</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.860" end="00:31:20.639" style="s2">that sort of the not content of our</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.919" end="00:31:24.090" style="s2">ideas but the very structural functional</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.639" end="00:31:26.279" style="s2">flow of our mind is something that</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.090" end="00:31:30.809" style="s2">reveals the structure the deeper</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.279" end="00:31:32.610" style="s2">structure of reality so okay you can see</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.809" end="00:31:36.029" style="s2">the flow of relevance realization as</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.610" end="00:31:38.070" style="s2">deeply conforming to era Gina&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.029" end="00:31:39.899" style="s2">dialectic of being that&#39;s what I was</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.070" end="00:31:41.429" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was that&#39;s where I saw as</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.899" end="00:31:44.279" style="s2">a potential connection point between</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.429" end="00:31:47.130" style="s2">Jonathan and I is that is that fair to</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.279" end="00:31:49.970" style="s2">say that yeah did you say Mary I want to</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.130" end="00:31:53.549" style="s2">hear from you well I want to say that</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.970" end="00:31:54.690" style="s2">you know I like all of this stuff I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.549" end="00:31:59.580" style="s2">loved everything you&#39;ve done with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.690" end="00:32:01.769" style="s2">relevance realization okay so if you you</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.580" end="00:32:04.019" style="s2">talk about so there&#39;s something deeply</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.769" end="00:32:06.240" style="s2">analogous between our mind and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.019" end="00:32:09.809" style="s2">structures of reality sure deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.240" end="00:32:13.380" style="s2">structures of reality and and I would</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.809" end="00:32:14.909" style="s2">say and also the structures of reality</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.380" end="00:32:20.309" style="s2">all the way up like all the way up and</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.909" end="00:32:22.440" style="s2">all the way down right though so like we</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.309" end="00:32:24.389" style="s2">may find that there like even like the</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.440" end="00:32:27.990" style="s2">formation of crystals or something like</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.389" end="00:32:29.580" style="s2">that is I think the the auto pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.990" end="00:32:31.529" style="s2">relevance realization has a deep</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.580" end="00:32:37.049" style="s2">continuity with some organization of the</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.529" end="00:32:39.720" style="s2">fire etc yes I know what so don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.049" end="00:32:43.049" style="s2">more like to JP&#39;s points about Willis</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.720" end="00:32:46.080" style="s2">this goes down but also why wouldn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.049" end="00:32:47.880" style="s2">continue to go up and so then I have to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.080" end="00:32:51.179" style="s2">come back to the question that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.880" end="00:32:52.950" style="s2">like the point of the point of attention</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.179" end="00:32:56.100" style="s2">between us which has to do with why</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.950" end="00:32:59.340" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t that be mind on there and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.100" end="00:33:06.029" style="s2">person you know because it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.340" end="00:33:08.059" style="s2">that we that we value mind sure we value</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.029" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">mind over matter</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.059" end="00:33:15.950" style="s2">you know we that we value mind over</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:17.840" style="s2">matter because it&#39;s the mind that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.950" end="00:33:21.680" style="s2">to use pomander clays wording right</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.840" end="00:33:23.180" style="s2">colonizes the matter right so we and we</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.680" end="00:33:26.240" style="s2">value mind over matter give me an</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.180" end="00:33:29.740" style="s2">example in an example like if someone if</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.240" end="00:33:34.670" style="s2">someone um injures me let&#39;s say someone</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.740" end="00:33:36.530" style="s2">hits me and harms me in some way okay so</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.670" end="00:33:40.490" style="s2">there&#39;s the physical reality of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.530" end="00:33:44.030" style="s2">thing happening but my my sense of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.490" end="00:33:48.080" style="s2">incident is that vary greatly between</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.030" end="00:33:54.590" style="s2">whether that person accidentally hurt me</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.080" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">or had the intention to hurt me right so</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.590" end="00:34:02.720" style="s2">we&#39;re not the mind the mind the state of</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:09.550" style="s2">the mind if we&#39;ve we value it over the</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.720" end="00:34:12.860" style="s2">over just the map the material reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.550" end="00:34:16.010" style="s2">so I mean in some sense as I understand</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.860" end="00:34:19.240" style="s2">you but so what I&#39;m trying to get at is</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.010" end="00:34:23.900" style="s2">if we value mind if we value mind over</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.240" end="00:34:31.850" style="s2">matter okay and if if we can&#39;t go up</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.900" end="00:34:34.070" style="s2">above the human in value then then isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.850" end="00:34:38.570" style="s2">it the case that we have to look and go</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.070" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">well we&#39;re at the top you know the human</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.570" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">the humans are at the top because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.330" end="00:34:45.200" style="s2">the ones with the minds and we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:47.750" style="s2">only ones with minds and therefore we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.200" end="00:34:48.050" style="s2">at the top so okay now I see what you</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.750" end="00:34:50.810" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.050" end="00:34:52.640" style="s2">okay so you want you the idea is more</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.810" end="00:34:55.220" style="s2">overvaluation i me because there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.640" end="00:34:56.929" style="s2">ways this well i because there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.220" end="00:34:59.420" style="s2">circumstances where we give priority to</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.929" end="00:35:01.460" style="s2">the physical over our the mentor like if</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.420" end="00:35:04.280" style="s2">i if I&#39;m causing you hunger that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.460" end="00:35:06.590" style="s2">considered a greater crime that I might</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.280" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">just sort of insulting you and giving</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.590" end="00:35:12.860" style="s2">you a painful mental state right so but</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:14.180" style="s2">I did I want to put that aside because I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.860" end="00:35:16.340" style="s2">was misunderstood</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.180" end="00:35:18.530" style="s2">I think the way I&#39;m understanding you is</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.340" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">saying the the thing that we think is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.530" end="00:35:22.490" style="s2">most inherently valuable in all of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.650" style="s2">creation or people is that is that a</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.490" end="00:35:29.200" style="s2">fair way of putting it well or let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.650" end="00:35:31.750" style="s2">persons yeah wait person okay and so</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.200" end="00:35:34.240" style="s2">and so if when you talk about things</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.750" end="00:35:35.980" style="s2">coming down like you it sounds like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.240" end="00:35:38.500" style="s2">something above us but how can it be</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.980" end="00:35:45.849" style="s2">above us if it&#39;s not first not a person</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.500" end="00:35:49.119" style="s2">in what way well I mean it&#39;s above us in</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.849" end="00:35:51.190" style="s2">terms up well III I want to go slowly</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.119" end="00:35:53.859" style="s2">here because there&#39;s many ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.190" end="00:35:56.470" style="s2">that could be answered so I&#39;ll say one</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.859" end="00:35:59.500" style="s2">and then maybe I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s above us</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.470" end="00:36:02.700" style="s2">in that it it everything else is</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.500" end="00:36:08.440" style="s2">asymmetrically dependent on it all right</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.700" end="00:36:10.930" style="s2">so that means that if realness is</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.440" end="00:36:12.400" style="s2">actually what we is another thing with</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.930" end="00:36:15.190" style="s2">that we intrinsically value which I</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.400" end="00:36:17.530" style="s2">think we do then something being more</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.190" end="00:36:19.809" style="s2">real in that sense in that more of</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.530" end="00:36:22.720" style="s2">reality is dependent on it would make it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.809" end="00:36:24.880" style="s2">more valuable than me even though it</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.720" end="00:36:27.099" style="s2">does it&#39;s not it&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.880" end="00:36:29.380" style="s2">person that&#39;s what that&#39;s what I wanted</p>

<p begin="00:39:58.030" end="00:40:01.510" style="s2">just wanted to put that in because I</p>

<p begin="00:40:08.200" end="00:40:13.720" style="s2">be all that they will really need for</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.289" end="00:40:17.109" style="s2">classical theism at least in the east is</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.720" end="00:40:18.760" style="s2">that we can see we can use the modern</p>

<p begin="00:40:24.910" end="00:40:28.539" style="s2">what happens within yourself about with</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.920" end="00:40:29.799" style="s2">let&#39;s say the relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.539" end="00:40:32.920" style="s2">ground of intelligibility in the ground</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.799" end="00:40:35.619" style="s2">of being what happens between the</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.920" end="00:40:38.500" style="s2">relationship in themselves I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.619" end="00:40:40.000" style="s2">we won&#39;t reach this point anyways so</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.500" end="00:40:42.010" style="s2">then it becomes more of a question of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.000" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">how is it that the ground of being</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.010" end="00:40:48.010" style="s2">manifests itself does it do it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:49.630" style="s2">that looks like reverse transition in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.010" end="00:40:51.490" style="s2">way that we would associate with</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.630" end="00:40:53.349" style="s2">personhood or would it rather be</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.490" end="00:40:56.230" style="s2">something like emptiness like the</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.349" end="00:41:00.970" style="s2">Buddhist conferences yeah so I&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.230" end="00:41:02.830" style="s2">happy with that and so the</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.970" end="00:41:04.660" style="s2">way in which I could talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.830" end="00:41:07.480" style="s2">that might upset you guys as I would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.660" end="00:41:09.820" style="s2">well of course our non-theist would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.480" end="00:41:13.180" style="s2">that often we will enter into personal</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.820" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">relationships and perhaps entering into</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.180" end="00:41:19.599" style="s2">a personal relationship it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.940" style="s2">is is a valuable way of disclosing</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.599" end="00:41:22.869" style="s2">certain aspects of the one or the ground</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.940" end="00:41:24.369" style="s2">of being in the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.869" end="00:41:26.440" style="s2">intelligibility I&#39;m going to use the</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.369" end="00:41:28.330" style="s2">word one but I&#39;m going to be using it in</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.440" end="00:41:30.490" style="s2">era genus sense not just in China</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.330" end="00:41:32.260" style="s2">systems because we need we need a term</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.490" end="00:41:36.400" style="s2">of reference or for what it is I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.260" end="00:41:38.710" style="s2">talking about and so the the more</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.400" end="00:41:40.990" style="s2">important issue then might be what you</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.710" end="00:41:42.310" style="s2">want to say I I think there&#39;s a move you</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.990" end="00:41:44.560" style="s2">can make and I maybe I&#39;ll make it on</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.310" end="00:41:47.440" style="s2">your behalf and you&#39;ll stay aha but John</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.560" end="00:41:50.109" style="s2">we we sort of we were talking earlier</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.440" end="00:41:53.080" style="s2">about how the manifestations have a kind</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.109" end="00:41:56.920" style="s2">of they participate the one in some way</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.080" end="00:41:59.740" style="s2">so there&#39;s something if the personal</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.920" end="00:42:02.140" style="s2">relationship participates the one then</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.740" end="00:42:04.540" style="s2">there&#39;s something being disclosed about</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.140" end="00:42:06.160" style="s2">what the one is even though it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.540" end="00:42:07.599" style="s2">part of the essence of the one it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.160" end="00:42:11.080" style="s2">kind of move you&#39;re trying to make is</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:13.390" style="s2">that yes yes okay the only remaining</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.080" end="00:42:16.450" style="s2">move that we may or may not make and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.390" end="00:42:19.480" style="s2">it&#39;s not sure it&#39;s in like a medieval</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.450" end="00:42:22.330" style="s2">dispute in the east in like the 40s but</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.480" end="00:42:24.010" style="s2">there the move is that you know the same</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.330" end="00:42:27.070" style="s2">sort of manifestations which let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.010" end="00:42:29.710" style="s2">we see between us and the one could well</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.070" end="00:42:31.330" style="s2">old within the one between let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.710" end="00:42:33.820" style="s2">gonna being and the run of intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.330" end="00:42:37.060" style="s2">this may be this is at or that could be</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.820" end="00:42:38.770" style="s2">open as well that it could be difficult</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.060" end="00:42:43.210" style="s2">in unity between the manifestations we</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.770" end="00:42:45.130" style="s2">observe between humans and the between</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.210" end="00:42:48.190" style="s2">humans and the one and also within the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.130" end="00:42:49.950" style="s2">one himself but we can I think most as a</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.190" end="00:42:52.869" style="s2">quotes of Christians would be happy to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.950" end="00:42:54.910" style="s2">remain apathetic about what this board</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.869" end="00:42:59.380" style="s2">okay so let me give you an example of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.910" end="00:43:01.030" style="s2">what I&#39;m talking about so I I sort of</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.380" end="00:43:03.580" style="s2">spoke on your behalf and I you said you</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.030" end="00:43:06.910" style="s2">thought it was charitable um so let me</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.580" end="00:43:08.500" style="s2">let let&#39;s take like Vedanta as at least</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.910" end="00:43:11.680" style="s2">something that&#39;s officially supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.500" end="00:43:13.819" style="s2">be a non-theistic because Brahman is is</p>

<p begin="00:43:13.819" end="00:43:19.239" style="s2">but Vedanta says that the individual</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.249" end="00:43:21.559" style="s2">gods right are the personal</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.239" end="00:43:24.619" style="s2">manifestation so that we can enter into</p>

<p begin="00:43:46.099" end="00:43:51.709" style="s2">video or Paul Bantu plays video where he</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.339" end="00:43:55.249" style="s2">talked about the meta divine realm</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.709" end="00:43:57.499" style="s2">you know that many polytheistic systems</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.249" end="00:43:59.989" style="s2">also posited a meta divine realm and the</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.499" end="00:44:07.029" style="s2">meta divine realm could be personal or</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.989" end="00:44:17.349" style="s2">could be impersonal or it could be a a</p>

<p begin="00:44:17.349" end="00:44:23.239" style="s2">we know that when we are talking like if</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.349" end="00:44:25.279" style="s2">we go back to classical theism even when</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.239" end="00:44:27.410" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.279" end="00:44:30.140" style="s2">say about the Trinity when we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.410" end="00:44:33.920" style="s2">about God you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.140" end="00:44:37.359" style="s2">God as God and God the three persons in</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.920" end="00:44:43.249" style="s2">God that we we know we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.359" end="00:44:48.859" style="s2">analogously analogously to per to person</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.249" end="00:44:51.289" style="s2">and yet there&#39;s a relationship so so</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.859" end="00:44:54.229" style="s2">we&#39;re not so the idea that you know that</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.289" end="00:44:58.309" style="s2">God transcends the category of person is</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.229" end="00:45:04.759" style="s2">already part of it&#39;s already part of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.309" end="00:45:07.009" style="s2">Christianity so um so I don&#39;t have I</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.759" end="00:45:12.289" style="s2">don&#39;t have an and don&#39;t have such a</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.009" end="00:45:15.949" style="s2">problem with that um you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.289" end="00:45:21.210" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s tremendous like I say</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.949" end="00:45:24.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of there</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.210" end="00:45:27.390" style="s2">a lot of utility definitely in person in</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.600" end="00:45:30.120" style="s2">a personal God in many many ways</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.390" end="00:45:33.630" style="s2">I mean psychologically for humans there</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.120" end="00:45:36.990" style="s2">certainly is plus if that if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.630" end="00:45:38.430" style="s2">real revelation you know which we</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.990" end="00:45:42.000" style="s2">believe there is that there is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:38.430" end="00:45:44.400" style="s2">revelation that God gave us to enter</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.000" end="00:45:49.200" style="s2">into this personal relationship with him</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.400" end="00:45:51.570" style="s2">so so we&#39;re not you know we can grab</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.200" end="00:45:54.950" style="s2">many things but at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.570" end="00:45:59.820" style="s2">we&#39;re we&#39;re sticking with a God who is</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.950" end="00:46:04.770" style="s2">personal that&#39;s not to slight or to say</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.820" end="00:46:09.180" style="s2">that that&#39;s not to make that&#39;s not to</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.770" end="00:46:11.430" style="s2">make light of or not respect the</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.180" end="00:46:14.460" style="s2">experiences and the traditions of those</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.430" end="00:46:16.650" style="s2">who say this God is not personal because</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.460" end="00:46:18.800" style="s2">even for those who have a non-person or</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.650" end="00:46:20.700" style="s2">got the ground of being more</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.800" end="00:46:24.960" style="s2">intelligibility it&#39;s not personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.700" end="00:46:26.790" style="s2">because usually in almost all cases as</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.960" end="00:46:31.020" style="s2">far as I know there are personal</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.790" end="00:46:33.270" style="s2">entities that that come between the</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.020" end="00:46:35.250" style="s2">human person and background of being</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.270" end="00:46:42.270" style="s2">such that like as you said that a</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.250" end="00:46:46.680" style="s2">relationship can can form and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.270" end="00:46:52.860" style="s2">I guess I you know we we talked before</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.680" end="00:46:56.940" style="s2">about the ambiguity you know they taking</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.860" end="00:47:03.420" style="s2">that as as seriously as as possible or</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.940" end="00:47:05.550" style="s2">as you know as factually as possible you</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.420" end="00:47:10.620" style="s2">know when we talk about how things are</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.550" end="00:47:13.260" style="s2">how the the structures of reality go all</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.620" end="00:47:16.590" style="s2">the way down and through I think this</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.260" end="00:47:19.740" style="s2">applies even to our like to how we</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.590" end="00:47:21.750" style="s2">relate to persons in the sense that if</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.740" end="00:47:25.470" style="s2">when we&#39;re in doubt as to whether</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.750" end="00:47:30.870" style="s2">there&#39;s a person there when we have an</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.470" end="00:47:33.600" style="s2">ambiguous situation in life we go for</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.870" end="00:47:35.040" style="s2">the person for example it uses an</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.600" end="00:47:36.510" style="s2">example in one of my videos</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.040" end="00:47:38.550" style="s2">if someone is going to knock down a</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.510" end="00:47:40.320" style="s2">building and they&#39;re in doubt as to</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.550" end="00:47:43.230" style="s2">whether there&#39;s a person there they</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.320" end="00:47:46.440" style="s2">don&#39;t knock the building though you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.230" end="00:47:48.810" style="s2">or try think I&#39;d use it Oh a hunter a</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.440" end="00:47:51.480" style="s2">hunter out in the woods if he sees a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.810" end="00:47:53.160" style="s2">movement behind a tree and he&#39;s not sure</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.480" end="00:47:54.990" style="s2">if it&#39;s a deer or a person he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.160" end="00:47:58.560" style="s2">just shoot because it doesn&#39;t matter if</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.990" end="00:48:00.630" style="s2">it&#39;s a person so like we we opt for what</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.560" end="00:48:05.490" style="s2">do we have in a bigger situation in this</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.630" end="00:48:08.160" style="s2">in life we opt for person okay I think</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.490" end="00:48:11.310" style="s2">that&#39;s very good Mary and so I want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.160" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">respond to that in depth and then maybe</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.310" end="00:48:15.780" style="s2">it will actually be a response that</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:17.850" style="s2">closes some distance um first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.780" end="00:48:19.320" style="s2">want to bring out that I there was two</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.850" end="00:48:21.450" style="s2">parts to my argument there was the</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.320" end="00:48:23.280" style="s2">ambiguity right and then there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.450" end="00:48:25.530" style="s2">that there is no logical decidability</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.280" end="00:48:28.470" style="s2">for similarity there&#39;s no there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.530" end="00:48:30.750" style="s2">algorithm that can say this is this is</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.470" end="00:48:34.980" style="s2">objectively more act is objectively more</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.750" end="00:48:36.510" style="s2">similar than why because well if you</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.980" end="00:48:38.310" style="s2">remember the argument any any two</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.510" end="00:48:40.980" style="s2">objects are actually indefinitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.310" end="00:48:42.840" style="s2">similar to each other or indefinitely</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.980" end="00:48:44.220" style="s2">dissimilar to each other logically so</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.840" end="00:48:45.720" style="s2">there&#39;s no algorithmic there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.220" end="00:48:48.300" style="s2">logical there&#39;s no way you give a</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.720" end="00:48:51.330" style="s2">deductive evidence or proof or decisions</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.300" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">or teaser for similarity so I just want</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.330" end="00:48:57.660" style="s2">to point out that though that&#39;s both of</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:48:59.700" style="s2">those so that means that actually puts a</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.660" end="00:49:01.080" style="s2">lot of weight on the pragmatic aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.700" end="00:49:02.700" style="s2">your argument do you see what I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.080" end="00:49:04.410" style="s2">to say is dude you can&#39;t sort of say oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.700" end="00:49:06.330" style="s2">here&#39;s the rule and if you follow it</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.410" end="00:49:08.250" style="s2">that will show that this is the correct</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.330" end="00:49:09.360" style="s2">analogy which is not what you&#39;re doing I</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.250" end="00:49:12.180" style="s2">just want to make it really clear the</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.360" end="00:49:16.080" style="s2">way it will read of where we&#39;re playing</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.180" end="00:49:20.340" style="s2">right okay so and then the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.080" end="00:49:22.500" style="s2">issue but the pragmatism is again what</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.340" end="00:49:25.470" style="s2">that it&#39;s so pragmatism is ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.500" end="00:49:27.420" style="s2">how things are relevant to us and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.470" end="00:49:28.620" style="s2">know I&#39;m sort of on record as saying I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.420" end="00:49:32.730" style="s2">don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.620" end="00:49:35.610" style="s2">ultimately always always has priority</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.730" end="00:49:38.070" style="s2">and relevance and so I do think we do</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.610" end="00:49:40.260" style="s2">make those kinds of decisions again when</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.070" end="00:49:42.600" style="s2">we have moral concern but when we have</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.260" end="00:49:45.480" style="s2">epistemic concerns we sometimes go the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.600" end="00:49:46.970" style="s2">opposite way we say for example we got</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.480" end="00:49:48.980" style="s2">we made tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.970" end="00:49:51.440" style="s2">progress and disease when we stopped</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.980" end="00:49:52.849" style="s2">personalizing diseases and realizes</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.440" end="00:49:55.730" style="s2">realize that they were created by these</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.849" end="00:49:57.380" style="s2">impersonal forces bacteria etc things</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.730" end="00:50:00.980" style="s2">like that when we stop thinking of them</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.380" end="00:50:02.660" style="s2">as demonic possession etc we made we</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.980" end="00:50:05.690" style="s2">made tremendous progress and we</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.660" end="00:50:08.270" style="s2">alleviated a lot of suffering and so you</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.690" end="00:50:10.069" style="s2">can say well in that situation you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.270" end="00:50:12.800" style="s2">it was actually the better going</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.069" end="00:50:15.410" style="s2">impersonal actually had great moral</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.800" end="00:50:17.780" style="s2">benefit too and so the right thing to do</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.410" end="00:50:20.270" style="s2">there was to actually you what we did</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.780" end="00:50:22.130" style="s2">which was to go impersonal and thereby</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.270" end="00:50:24.410" style="s2">we were able to alleviate so much more</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.130" end="00:50:27.050" style="s2">suffering than when we treated the</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.410" end="00:50:31.460" style="s2">unknown thing as if it was a person so</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.050" end="00:50:32.720" style="s2">again you see what if I&#39;m not I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.460" end="00:50:38.240" style="s2">trying to one-up you Mary I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.720" end="00:50:41.510" style="s2">trying to say yeah I&#39;m trying to say you</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.240" end="00:50:42.980" style="s2">know III I think there&#39;s context in</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.510" end="00:50:44.480" style="s2">which you&#39;re right there&#39;s context in</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.980" end="00:50:46.099" style="s2">which we say there might be you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.480" end="00:50:47.450" style="s2">there might be a person there and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.099" end="00:50:49.250" style="s2">what I should do but there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.450" end="00:50:51.500" style="s2">contexts in which it turns out notes</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.250" end="00:50:54.410" style="s2">sort of taking the risk that it&#39;s an in</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.500" end="00:50:56.150" style="s2">first so no thing has actually had huge</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.410" end="00:50:59.420" style="s2">moral benefit for us that&#39;s why I try to</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.150" end="00:51:02.240" style="s2">give that example in the arena of</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.420" end="00:51:04.099" style="s2">gratitude and Thanksgiving ok this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.240" end="00:51:06.079" style="s2">another one of you good arguments I hope</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.099" end="00:51:08.270" style="s2">you take that I&#39;m responding to you with</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.079" end="00:51:12.130" style="s2">some good arguments as indication that I</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.270" end="00:51:14.450" style="s2">think you&#39;re giving good arguments and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.130" end="00:51:17.720" style="s2">hope that&#39;s understood I want everybody</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.450" end="00:51:19.339" style="s2">who&#39;s hearing me to hear that so I like</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.720" end="00:51:21.890" style="s2">I thought I thought a lot about that</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.339" end="00:51:23.839" style="s2">because and you mentioned I think very</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.890" end="00:51:25.670" style="s2">correctly that you know the expression</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.839" end="00:51:29.900" style="s2">of gratitude is part of what is part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.670" end="00:51:33.260" style="s2">my daily practice for example and and I</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.900" end="00:51:36.349" style="s2">was I was trying to think about so the</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.260" end="00:51:38.060" style="s2">idea is first of all I want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.349" end="00:51:39.950" style="s2">I understand you so this is not a</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.060" end="00:51:40.339" style="s2">challenge at criticism this is an open</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.950" end="00:51:44.690" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.339" end="00:51:49.040" style="s2">it&#39;s the is the idea that what part of</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.690" end="00:51:51.560" style="s2">the phenomenology that needs personhood</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.040" end="00:51:55.369" style="s2">is that people experience deep gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.560" end="00:51:59.150" style="s2">and it&#39;s not to another human person and</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.369" end="00:52:00.830" style="s2">it&#39;s not to a collective</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.150" end="00:52:04.820" style="s2">a bunch of you but there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.830" end="00:52:09.230" style="s2">sense of gratitude it&#39;s real and there</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.820" end="00:52:13.220" style="s2">needs to be like what we&#39;re do I want to</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.230" end="00:52:16.130" style="s2">use someone nice ah yeah there needs to</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.220" end="00:52:18.650" style="s2">be a someone to whom the gratitude is</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.130" end="00:52:21.410" style="s2">directed and so what I think my question</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.650" end="00:52:23.090" style="s2">is what&#39;s the nature of there needs to</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.410" end="00:52:25.100" style="s2">be as someone is it the idea that if</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.090" end="00:52:27.560" style="s2">there isn&#39;t someone there my gratitude</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.100" end="00:52:29.300" style="s2">will sort of dissipate and be frustrated</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.560" end="00:52:30.950" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get the phenomenology that</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.300" end="00:52:33.860" style="s2">you&#39;re pointing to well</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.950" end="00:52:36.560" style="s2">what I&#39;m I come back to the if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.860" end="00:52:40.430" style="s2">person versus if there&#39;s not a person so</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.560" end="00:52:45.110" style="s2">for example if which would be which</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.430" end="00:52:48.050" style="s2">would be the better option to to say</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.110" end="00:52:51.830" style="s2">thank you to a person who is not there</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.050" end="00:52:58.520" style="s2">or to fail to thank a person who is</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.830" end="00:53:01.760" style="s2">there well I I get your point we would</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.520" end="00:53:04.100" style="s2">generally say it would be better to you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.760" end="00:53:06.050" style="s2">fail when there&#39;s no person there then</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.100" end="00:53:10.480" style="s2">fail when there is a person there I get</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.050" end="00:53:11.960" style="s2">that and I want to acknowledge that but</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.480" end="00:53:14.450" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.960" end="00:53:16.850" style="s2">Spinoza famously said in the ethics that</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.450" end="00:53:19.730" style="s2">the wise man desires nothing less than</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.850" end="00:53:21.800" style="s2">to have God love him in return because</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.730" end="00:53:23.720" style="s2">if he is desire and forgot to love him</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.800" end="00:53:25.700" style="s2">in return that he&#39;s not actually loving</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.720" end="00:53:29.180" style="s2">God for being God he&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.700" end="00:53:31.850" style="s2">loving God has an exposed a is a pure</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.180" end="00:53:36.200" style="s2">expression of the goodness of being and</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.850" end="00:53:40.970" style="s2">so aha what are you loving her are you</p>
<p begin="00:53:36.200" end="00:53:44.330" style="s2">are you not loving a who no for spinosus</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.970" end="00:53:45.950" style="s2">God is much more I think you could make</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.330" end="00:53:49.820" style="s2">a really strong case that but because</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.950" end="00:53:51.440" style="s2">it&#39;s God or nature right for but knows</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.820" end="00:53:53.180" style="s2">it means the things that we have</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.440" end="00:53:54.950" style="s2">separated in terms of God and creator</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.180" end="00:53:56.870" style="s2">and God in nature are actually</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.950" end="00:54:01.880" style="s2">ultimately just one thing God or nature</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.870" end="00:54:05.450" style="s2">and that is what he means by God and so</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.880" end="00:54:09.109" style="s2">he&#39;s not loving a who he&#39;s he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.450" end="00:54:14.709" style="s2">he&#39;s arguing that</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.109" end="00:54:18.529" style="s2">if we actually care about the truth as</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.709" end="00:54:21.469" style="s2">truth then we should love the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.529" end="00:54:23.959" style="s2">being without desiring that it love us</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.469" end="00:54:26.329" style="s2">in return because only the love for it</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.959" end="00:54:30.589" style="s2">without wanting the love in return is</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.329" end="00:54:32.149" style="s2">actually the love of truth because if</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.589" end="00:54:34.399" style="s2">it&#39;s anything else I&#39;m not loving it</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.149" end="00:54:37.549" style="s2">because it&#39;s true I&#39;m loving it because</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.399" end="00:54:41.029" style="s2">of what it&#39;s doing for me that was sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.549" end="00:54:45.789" style="s2">of you know in Christianity we do say we</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.029" end="00:54:52.789" style="s2">do say that we love God for who he is</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.789" end="00:54:55.969" style="s2">but it&#39;s that it&#39;s a it&#39;s a much more</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.789" end="00:54:58.219" style="s2">less developed form of spirituality to</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.969" end="00:55:01.699" style="s2">be loving God because what he does for</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.219" end="00:55:07.929" style="s2">me I could be but that but that God is</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.699" end="00:55:07.929" style="s2">deserving of of love for who he is</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.559" end="00:55:13.429" style="s2">so that okay so let&#39;s at least say</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.779" end="00:55:16.630" style="s2">there&#39;s something close between what</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.429" end="00:55:20.160" style="s2">your identity and what Spinoza is saying</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.630" end="00:55:24.210" style="s2">well and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.160" end="00:55:27.300" style="s2">as what I am loving is good like the</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.210" end="00:55:28.920" style="s2">truth is good then can I not love it and</p>
<p begin="00:55:27.300" end="00:55:32.790" style="s2">be grateful for it without it being a</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.920" end="00:55:34.950" style="s2">person well I mean there&#39;s a difference</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.790" end="00:55:39.000" style="s2">between grateful for something and</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.950" end="00:55:42.300" style="s2">grateful to someone for the thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.000" end="00:55:43.680" style="s2">but why do we okay but I acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.300" end="00:55:47.640" style="s2">there&#39;s the difference but our question</p>
<p begin="00:55:43.680" end="00:55:49.080" style="s2">is which one of those is the one that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.640" end="00:55:51.240" style="s2">happening in for example in my</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.080" end="00:55:55.160" style="s2">phenomenology but I I expect I</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.240" end="00:55:57.330" style="s2">experience deep gratitude for the</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.160" end="00:55:58.470" style="s2">goodness of the ground of the England</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.330" end="00:56:00.600" style="s2">for the ways we&#39;ve been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.470" end="00:56:03.570" style="s2">today and for the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.600" end="00:56:04.830" style="s2">intelligibility and I don&#39;t desire for</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.570" end="00:56:07.650" style="s2">the Reapers because I&#39;m a deep devotee</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.830" end="00:56:11.160" style="s2">of Spinoza I don&#39;t desire that it love</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.650" end="00:56:14.670" style="s2">me in return I thought for me that would</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.160" end="00:56:19.560" style="s2">be a diminishment of both what my love</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.670" end="00:56:22.620" style="s2">is directed to you and of my love well I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.560" end="00:56:28.500" style="s2">I understand that I mean I I understand</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.620" end="00:56:31.020" style="s2">what you&#39;re coming from okay so where do</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.500" end="00:56:33.960" style="s2">these things you&#39;re grateful for come</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.020" end="00:56:35.190" style="s2">from them I mean we get into questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.960" end="00:56:38.190" style="s2">about you know basically the</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.190" end="00:56:41.250" style="s2">cosmological arguments about that so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.190" end="00:56:43.740" style="s2">part of the reason for the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.250" end="00:56:47.340" style="s2">being is also the origin of being in</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.740" end="00:56:49.410" style="s2">Christian thought so and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.340" end="00:56:51.620" style="s2">reasons we say that there has to be and</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.410" end="00:56:55.170" style="s2">this is apart from any other</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.620" end="00:56:58.620" style="s2">distinctions about God like Trinity or</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.170" end="00:57:01.560" style="s2">anything like that is that their hat</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.620" end="00:57:04.910" style="s2">there there was a willful decision to</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.560" end="00:57:06.240" style="s2">bring things other than God into being</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.910" end="00:57:08.340" style="s2">exact</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.240" end="00:57:12.180" style="s2">that makes sense what I&#39;m saying that if</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.340" end="00:57:15.330" style="s2">God that there was there was just God</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.180" end="00:57:17.640" style="s2">and now there&#39;s other things other than</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.330" end="00:57:20.790" style="s2">God that have a real existence that are</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.640" end="00:57:23.280" style="s2">really that really having existence not</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.790" end="00:57:26.070" style="s2">that they&#39;re not held in existence by</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.280" end="00:57:31.910" style="s2">God but that they&#39;re given by God a</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.070" end="00:57:35.270" style="s2">certain kind of freedom to be to be</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.910" end="00:57:35.270" style="s2">actual um</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.360" end="00:57:46.740" style="s2">to make things happen in the universe to</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.460" end="00:57:51.870" style="s2">be causes in their own right causes but</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.740" end="00:57:54.510" style="s2">the first cause is a is a decision so</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.870" end="00:57:58.740" style="s2">your seems to be in your ontology you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.510" end="00:58:02.250" style="s2">lacking an explanation for this was it</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.740" end="00:58:05.850" style="s2">Leibnitz who said why there is something</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.250" end="00:58:10.320" style="s2">instead of nothing okay well there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.850" end="00:58:13.260" style="s2">questions here and what one is sort of</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.320" end="00:58:14.700" style="s2">how did it all get started question I&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.260" end="00:58:15.690" style="s2">like to put that aside because I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.700" end="00:58:19.320" style="s2">that&#39;s just going to get us into</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.690" end="00:58:21.750" style="s2">arguments about you know a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.320" end="00:58:23.760" style="s2">origin story and a non-scientific origin</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.750" end="00:58:26.820" style="s2">story that I don&#39;t know we if we could</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.760" end="00:58:29.580" style="s2">make much progress on that the other one</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.820" end="00:58:31.230" style="s2">that I&#39;m trying to get because I think</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.580" end="00:58:33.900" style="s2">this maybe this is one of the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.230" end="00:58:36.240" style="s2">why era Gina was saw thought to be a</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.900" end="00:58:38.310" style="s2">heretic I mean because error Gina thinks</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.240" end="00:58:42.000" style="s2">that eat that God&#39;s creation ultimately</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.310" end="00:58:46.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t leave God that God&#39;s creation is</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.000" end="00:58:48.390" style="s2">ultimately an expression of an away and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.260" end="00:58:51.780" style="s2">and continuous with God&#39;s self knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.390" end="00:58:53.580" style="s2">and that sounds to me also like what you</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.780" end="00:58:57.720" style="s2">guys were saying earlier about the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.580" end="00:59:02.880" style="s2">manifestations of God are still God and</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.720" end="00:59:05.300" style="s2">so I I&#39;m not quite see what what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.880" end="00:59:08.040" style="s2">want me to give up because I&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.300" end="00:59:12.120" style="s2">I&#39;m not sure you you I&#39;m not sure that</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.040" end="00:59:16.370" style="s2">you gave it up earlier anyway they you I</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.120" end="00:59:20.900" style="s2">mean up well I guess it&#39;s window jr. in</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.370" end="00:59:23.070" style="s2">the way in which the ground of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.900" end="00:59:25.350" style="s2">possibility the ground of being will</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.070" end="00:59:29.280" style="s2">constrain himself into making things</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.350" end="00:59:33.870" style="s2">exist then the the question will be in</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.280" end="00:59:35.880" style="s2">this manifestation is there how much</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.870" end="00:59:37.380" style="s2">room I guess maybe is there left to</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.880" end="00:59:38.910" style="s2">change to chance</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.380" end="00:59:40.980" style="s2">how much relevance transition is there</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.910" end="00:59:42.870" style="s2">guiding it towards something because I</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.980" end="00:59:45.570" style="s2">could see if we just leave it there I</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.870" end="00:59:47.140" style="s2">could see this leaving I could see this</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.570" end="00:59:51.549" style="s2">going either way</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.140" end="00:59:53.499" style="s2">where if we just take those two ideas</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.549" end="00:59:54.819" style="s2">that well we know that there&#39;s a grow</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.499" end="00:59:56.319" style="s2">that there&#39;s real possibility in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.819" end="00:59:57.759" style="s2">world there is real emergence of things</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.319" end="01:00:00.730" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know that they&#39;re there is</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.759" end="01:00:03.279" style="s2">real constraints on those puzzle isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.730" end="01:00:06.819" style="s2">that the world exists between those two</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.279" end="01:00:08.980" style="s2">if all we have is this it&#39;s sort of an</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.819" end="01:00:11.950" style="s2">empirical question to see where will of</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.980" end="01:00:14.829" style="s2">this meeting of emergence and emanation</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.950" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">lead where will this end - maybe this</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.829" end="01:00:21.400" style="s2">meeting is conscious maybe it&#39;s not if</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:25.960" style="s2">that&#39;s all yeah I think it could go both</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.400" end="01:00:28.029" style="s2">ways yeah I think I mean III want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.960" end="01:00:29.680" style="s2">acknowledge that because I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.029" end="01:00:31.059" style="s2">all I mean we&#39;re all coming at this and</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.680" end="01:00:32.200" style="s2">one of the users are like talking with</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.059" end="01:00:34.180" style="s2">you guys well coming at this with</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.200" end="01:00:36.700" style="s2">humility and we&#39;re all acknowledging we</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.180" end="01:00:39.579" style="s2">don&#39;t have arguments that for clothes or</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.700" end="01:00:42.309" style="s2">anything like that so yeah I I started I</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.579" end="01:00:46.329" style="s2">see that - what you just said and I and</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.309" end="01:00:48.339" style="s2">I I do like the idea that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.329" end="01:00:52.599" style="s2">switched from similarity to conformity</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.339" end="01:00:55.019" style="s2">that I I can put aside my worry about</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.599" end="01:00:59.410" style="s2">similarity if there is a sense in which</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.019" end="01:01:02.019" style="s2">right my mind can conform to reality not</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.410" end="01:01:03.730" style="s2">in the content of mine but in like I say</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.019" end="01:01:06.400" style="s2">in a very structural functional flow of</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.730" end="01:01:09.210" style="s2">my mind that it is conforming to a de</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.400" end="01:01:15.009" style="s2">structural functional flow of reality i</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.210" end="01:01:16.660" style="s2">and that to me arm is a powerful thing I</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.009" end="01:01:19.690" style="s2">think that&#39;s very close to fear with</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.660" end="01:01:21.430" style="s2">this by the way this person yeah I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.690" end="01:01:27.220" style="s2">so too I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.430" end="01:01:29.700" style="s2">what theosis is as well I just I and I</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.220" end="01:01:35.680" style="s2">don&#39;t want I think all of this is good</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.700" end="01:01:37.450" style="s2">and what you just said I guess I even</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.680" end="01:01:39.970" style="s2">though I&#39;ve been responding to Marian</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.450" end="01:01:45.400" style="s2">challenging her I I also respect her</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.970" end="01:01:46.599" style="s2">concerns I there I keep asking this</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.400" end="01:01:47.200" style="s2">question and I&#39;m not trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.599" end="01:01:50.289" style="s2">badgering</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.200" end="01:01:54.759" style="s2">even after we view this I do I I have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.289" end="01:01:59.289" style="s2">sense that you guys I sound like some</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.759" end="01:02:00.680" style="s2">sort of alien species you guys have a</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.289" end="01:02:05.790" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.680" end="01:02:07.970" style="s2">that calls you beyond where if you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.790" end="01:02:12.900" style="s2">allow me to personalize this where I am</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.970" end="01:02:14.940" style="s2">and and you know and and it like I say</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.900" end="01:02:16.410" style="s2">there&#39;s sup and I use this one term very</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.940" end="01:02:18.150" style="s2">broadly there&#39;s a phenom there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.410" end="01:02:20.060" style="s2">something in your phenomenology and</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.150" end="01:02:23.370" style="s2">there is happy to use that term I know</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.060" end="01:02:24.990" style="s2">maybe I can tell you a story okay</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.370" end="01:02:26.700" style="s2">recently you know I spent a few months</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.990" end="01:02:29.700" style="s2">in France earlier this fall</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.700" end="01:02:31.320" style="s2">and I had a chance to go to a special</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.700" end="01:02:33.750" style="s2">Mass that was organized for that all the</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.320" end="01:02:37.440" style="s2">students in Paris and they were like</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.750" end="01:02:39.570" style="s2">three four thousand of us maybe and this</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.440" end="01:02:42.360" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a fairly big church and old</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.570" end="01:02:44.370" style="s2">church all made of stone beautiful</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.360" end="01:02:46.530" style="s2">building so we were so many people we</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.370" end="01:02:48.330" style="s2">couldn&#39;t even really sit down we could</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.530" end="01:02:50.100" style="s2">either sit right on the floor or stand</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.330" end="01:02:52.710" style="s2">up because we&#39;re so packed and you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.100" end="01:02:54.660" style="s2">there were lots of also clergy there</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.710" end="01:02:56.880" style="s2">there was like a few bishops several</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.660" end="01:03:00.870" style="s2">priests the world also servers and so on</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.880" end="01:03:04.940" style="s2">I know there was a great choir lots of</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.870" end="01:03:07.290" style="s2">it so in a sense it was very involved</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.940" end="01:03:09.450" style="s2">lots of people very intricately involved</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.290" end="01:03:13.590" style="s2">and I remember there was a process</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.450" end="01:03:15.750" style="s2">moment in in the mess where I I looked</p>
<p begin="01:03:13.590" end="01:03:18.590" style="s2">up were singing some some enzyme</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.750" end="01:03:21.390" style="s2">remember which ones and there&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.590" end="01:03:24.930" style="s2">sort of living continuty in what we sing</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.390" end="01:03:28.140" style="s2">their songs we sing or like hundreds or</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.930" end="01:03:30.540" style="s2">I don&#39;t maybe even more more than a</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.140" end="01:03:32.090" style="s2">thousand years over and swimming Greek</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.540" end="01:03:34.980" style="s2">some are in Latin so there&#39;s my teeth</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.090" end="01:03:36.900" style="s2">historical depth to them right yeah that</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.980" end="01:03:39.000" style="s2">people have been saying from the</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.900" end="01:03:42.030" style="s2">beginnings of Christianity and we also</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.000" end="01:03:43.980" style="s2">have some more modern songs but the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.030" end="01:03:45.360" style="s2">process moment where I remember was with</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.980" end="01:03:47.040" style="s2">we were singing one of those and you</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.360" end="01:03:48.920" style="s2">know in unison with lots of people</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.040" end="01:03:52.260" style="s2">around me I had people I left around me</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.920" end="01:03:54.360" style="s2">all combining our voices into one while</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.260" end="01:03:56.760" style="s2">the the priests and the bishops were</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.360" end="01:04:00.900" style="s2">also a portent we&#39;re all looking at them</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.760" end="01:04:02.910" style="s2">towards the the altar and we was certain</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.900" end="01:04:08.370" style="s2">sensing and I sort of looked up and I</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.910" end="01:04:11.100" style="s2">saw this this old rock ceiling with a</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.370" end="01:04:11.930" style="s2">thick layer of incense that had raised</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.100" end="01:04:16.700" style="s2">up and</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.930" end="01:04:19.010" style="s2">this felt really maybe otherworldly</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.700" end="01:04:22.099" style="s2">would be putting it may be too too</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.010" end="01:04:24.440" style="s2">strong cast it more Catholic I was as</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.099" end="01:04:29.630" style="s2">much maybe in in the Middle Ages as I</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.440" end="01:04:31.940" style="s2">was in - and 2019 I it really did feel</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.630" end="01:04:34.640" style="s2">like when I was talking history earlier</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.940" end="01:04:35.950" style="s2">about st. Maximus in his view of fuses</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.640" end="01:04:40.430" style="s2">occurring within the body of Christ</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.950" end="01:04:41.990" style="s2">where this new you this movement of</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.430" end="01:04:43.970" style="s2">between the ground of intelligibility</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.990" end="01:04:45.950" style="s2">and the college being which was so</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.970" end="01:04:48.559" style="s2">broken by the fall and then the idea is</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.950" end="01:04:50.630" style="s2">that when Christ became man he went all</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.559" end="01:04:53.329" style="s2">the way down to to the bottom of things</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.630" end="01:04:56.510" style="s2">yeah to the grown-ups for yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.329" end="01:04:57.859" style="s2">then when he you and then you raise</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.510" end="01:04:59.750" style="s2">everything back up in a way that is</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.859" end="01:05:01.490" style="s2">deeply continuous between the between</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.750" end="01:05:02.960" style="s2">heaven earth between the ground of being</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.490" end="01:05:05.630" style="s2">and the ground possibility because you</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.960" end="01:05:07.849" style="s2">is both the Son of man having emerged</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.630" end="01:05:12.380" style="s2">from from the earth and also the the Son</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.849" end="01:05:16.279" style="s2">of God I think I get that yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.380" end="01:05:18.770" style="s2">very powerful yeah and then he raised us</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.279" end="01:05:21.410" style="s2">by allowing us to enter into communion</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.770" end="01:05:24.559" style="s2">with them so II it became very close to</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.410" end="01:05:27.079" style="s2">twelve people made them his friends and</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.559" end="01:05:30.170" style="s2">then when after after he died those</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.079" end="01:05:31.940" style="s2">people those apostles founded churches</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.170" end="01:05:33.260" style="s2">it&#39;s what they made loving connections</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.940" end="01:05:36.500" style="s2">with people under them and this</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.260" end="01:05:37.819" style="s2">established a hierarchy ultimately would</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.500" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">sit between heaven and earth and how</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.819" end="01:05:44.059" style="s2">soon a a strong movement in history we</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:48.710" style="s2">wish I can take part and by entering</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.059" end="01:05:51.020" style="s2">into this I I get a strong sense of how</p>

<p begin="01:06:02.420" end="01:06:08.029" style="s2">deeply important but I&#39;ve had those</p>

<p begin="01:06:29.360" end="01:06:33.770" style="s2">have I mean I I I had an experience very</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.670" end="01:06:35.270" style="s2">similar when I went to Delphi and I</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.770" end="01:06:37.370" style="s2">stood in front of the old fellows and</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.270" end="01:06:39.290" style="s2">people have been there for millennia and</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.370" end="01:06:40.820" style="s2">you have the part of that it goes down</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.290" end="01:06:43.040" style="s2">into the ravine and for the earth and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.820" end="01:06:44.900" style="s2">part of it reaches up into the sky and</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.040" end="01:06:47.120" style="s2">you get the sense of the continuity and</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.900" end="01:06:48.620" style="s2">you know that Socrates had come you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.120" end="01:06:50.600" style="s2">the people that come here and asked</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.620" end="01:06:54.580" style="s2">about Socrates and all of that is there</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.600" end="01:06:57.230" style="s2">and you get this yeah I&#39;ve had I think</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.580" end="01:06:59.690" style="s2">you know even a sense of being called by</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.230" end="01:07:01.820" style="s2">on myself very deeply deeply connected</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.690" end="01:07:03.260" style="s2">to the emanation and the emergence</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.820" end="01:07:04.840" style="s2">that&#39;s why I wanted is why I talk about</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.260" end="01:07:13.310" style="s2">this stuff because I&#39;ve had these these</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.840" end="01:07:15.740" style="s2">experiences um so again this may be your</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.310" end="01:07:17.390" style="s2">ontology really is rich enough to know</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.740" end="01:07:19.340" style="s2">and composite that the old phenomenology</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.390" end="01:07:21.580" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s another person because</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.340" end="01:07:23.300" style="s2">ultimately I think this is one point</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.580" end="01:07:24.650" style="s2">especially when we talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.300" end="01:07:27.320" style="s2">personalism of the ground maybe I</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.650" end="01:07:29.150" style="s2">suspect maybe now that I may be even a</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.320" end="01:07:31.700" style="s2">bit closer to you then to Mary</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.150" end="01:07:32.930" style="s2">yeah yeah I think I was too rash in</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.700" end="01:07:34.430" style="s2">saying that lots of Christians would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.930" end="01:07:37.460" style="s2">happy with the deep continuity of</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.430" end="01:07:39.260" style="s2">relevance realization up until the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.460" end="01:07:40.820" style="s2">ground of being I think in the East</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.260" end="01:07:44.840" style="s2">that&#39;s true most Christians would be</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.820" end="01:07:47.780" style="s2">aptitude to leave it that well God is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.840" end="01:07:50.270" style="s2">what person and beyond person even maybe</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.780" end="01:07:54.350" style="s2">yeah yeah that what the father in</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.270" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">himself is only doing realms transition</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.350" end="01:07:56.420" style="s2">with the son and not really maybe within</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:07:58.820" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.420" end="01:08:00.950" style="s2">I don&#39;t know maybe you could please play</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.820" end="01:08:02.600" style="s2">with this well well I mean he is called</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.950" end="01:08:05.000" style="s2">the logos and that would work that would</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.600" end="01:08:07.960" style="s2">go very nicely with your what you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:05.000" end="01:08:15.380" style="s2">just said maybe this is better left to</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.960" end="01:08:17.180" style="s2">two particular theologians I mean please</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.380" end="01:08:21.500" style="s2">Mary and I just want to acknowledge that</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.180" end="01:08:23.270" style="s2">I do feel like we got a little closer in</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.500" end="01:08:25.070" style="s2">an important way and I don&#39;t mean just</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.270" end="01:08:28.570" style="s2">affectionately a book that&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.070" end="01:08:32.089" style="s2">is well I just met like I think you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.570" end="01:08:34.220" style="s2">JP you often use the metaphor of bridge</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.089" end="01:08:36.050" style="s2">building I think the chasm was less</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.220" end="01:08:38.599" style="s2">chasm estat the bridge has to go across</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.050" end="01:08:44.299" style="s2">if I could put it that way yeah</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.599" end="01:08:48.049" style="s2">how&#39;s Mary okay I really like the stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.299" end="01:08:50.690" style="s2">that you said about the way that human</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.049" end="01:08:52.900" style="s2">beings are prone to that the machinery</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.690" end="01:08:55.940" style="s2">of relevance realization can be hijacked</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.900" end="01:08:58.549" style="s2">they&#39;re prone to these perennial</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.940" end="01:09:01.790" style="s2">problems and how the religious</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.549" end="01:09:03.589" style="s2">traditions have honed the psycho</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.790" end="01:09:09.139" style="s2">technologies to help them to deal with</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.589" end="01:09:11.690" style="s2">that yes yes you said that very well you</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.139" end="01:09:14.509" style="s2">you often interpret me very well so</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.690" end="01:09:16.579" style="s2">here&#39;s my question here&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.509" end="01:09:18.230" style="s2">though that I have is that what I hear</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.579" end="01:09:25.339" style="s2">you talk about the purpose of religion</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.230" end="01:09:31.730" style="s2">as being - for for wisdom for as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.339" end="01:09:36.529" style="s2">home for with medic and agape okay I</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.730" end="01:09:40.460" style="s2">think what what I think about that is as</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.529" end="01:09:44.210" style="s2">a Christian is that that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.460" end="01:09:46.699" style="s2">primary purpose of our religion and I</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.210" end="01:09:49.279" style="s2">cannot really speak that deeply about</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.699" end="01:09:52.369" style="s2">other religions but I&#39;m sure this is</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.279" end="01:09:56.630" style="s2">true for Judaism you know Orthodox</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.369" end="01:09:59.989" style="s2">Judaism and for Christianity is that for</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.630" end="01:10:05.360" style="s2">us the primary purpose of the religion</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.989" end="01:10:09.380" style="s2">is worship and the wisdom the whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.360" end="01:10:12.020" style="s2">the the wisdom effects on the human</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.380" end="01:10:15.619" style="s2">person or that we would see them as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.020" end="01:10:18.800" style="s2">byproduct of the worship so that you</p>
<p begin="01:10:15.619" end="01:10:21.380" style="s2">know classically worship is seen as the</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.800" end="01:10:24.380" style="s2">the virtue of justice has applied to the</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.380" end="01:10:26.750" style="s2">relationship with the divine does that</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.380" end="01:10:28.369" style="s2">mean treating the divine appropriately</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.750" end="01:10:31.040" style="s2">is that what you mean appropriately in</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.369" end="01:10:32.719" style="s2">the according according you know what</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.040" end="01:10:34.460" style="s2">maybe they want to put in crude way</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.719" end="01:10:37.639" style="s2">giving God what he deserves</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.460" end="01:10:39.199" style="s2">sure you know and and then we carry that</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.639" end="01:10:41.989" style="s2">further in the Christian tradition and</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.199" end="01:10:45.500" style="s2">say we can&#39;t give God what he deserves</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.989" end="01:10:47.540" style="s2">so we have to so Jesus comes in to give</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.500" end="01:10:51.409" style="s2">himself to us so that we can give him</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.540" end="01:10:52.380" style="s2">inside in a sacrificial way through the</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.409" end="01:10:54.810" style="s2">Eucharist back</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.380" end="01:10:59.580" style="s2">the father so that then we are giving</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.810" end="01:11:03.510" style="s2">God what he really deserves and so but</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.580" end="01:11:06.810" style="s2">that that the virtue of justice in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.510" end="01:11:09.449" style="s2">soul or righteousness by the same word</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.810" end="01:11:13.070" style="s2">is the word is the same translated</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.449" end="01:11:17.400" style="s2">sometimes right sometimes justice is</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.070" end="01:11:21.000" style="s2">that by developing that righteousness in</p>
<p begin="01:11:17.400" end="01:11:29.150" style="s2">the soul through doing the worship that</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.000" end="01:11:33.090" style="s2">is what then guys what then I would say</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.150" end="01:11:34.739" style="s2">the the other wisdom the other wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.090" end="01:11:37.489" style="s2">things follow from that the other</p>
<p begin="01:11:34.739" end="01:11:41.760" style="s2">orderings of the soul followed from</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.489" end="01:11:45.270" style="s2">follow from that so but the primary</p>
<p begin="01:11:41.760" end="01:11:46.469" style="s2">purpose of our religion is not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.270" end="01:11:48.739" style="s2">saying this because you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.469" end="01:11:52.710" style="s2">the religion that started religion and</p>
<p begin="01:11:48.739" end="01:11:57.480" style="s2">wisdom and getting the wisdom and the</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.710" end="01:11:59.940" style="s2">meaning and meaning but that that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:57.480" end="01:12:02.010" style="s2">I just wanted to say that that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.940" end="01:12:06.210" style="s2">see that as the prime we don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.010" end="01:12:08.520" style="s2">getting wisdom as the primary purpose of</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.210" end="01:12:13.290" style="s2">our religion so makes sense no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.520" end="01:12:14.969" style="s2">I&#39;m not like I&#39;m not trying to to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.290" end="01:12:18.690" style="s2">that anything that you&#39;ve said about it</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.969" end="01:12:22.860" style="s2">is not correct had this extra element</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.690" end="01:12:26.190" style="s2">that we that it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.860" end="01:12:29.400" style="s2">truncated view of our religion to say</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.190" end="01:12:31.320" style="s2">well the purpose is to be to gain wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.400" end="01:12:33.150" style="s2">so sure</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.320" end="01:12:37.469" style="s2">and I get that I want to ask you about</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.150" end="01:12:39.210" style="s2">it I mean I mean I I could take some</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.469" end="01:12:40.469" style="s2">biblical stuff like you know wisdom is</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.210" end="01:12:51.270" style="s2">the principal thing from the book of</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.469" end="01:12:55.290" style="s2">Proverbs so high up there is a priority</p>
<p begin="01:12:51.270" end="01:12:58.170" style="s2">just that it&#39;s not it&#39;s the price it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.290" end="01:13:01.350" style="s2">not the top priority yeah I want to be</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.170" end="01:13:03.540" style="s2">fairly so let&#39;s do that</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.350" end="01:13:05.500" style="s2">I mean so if you&#39;ll allow me a way of</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.540" end="01:13:07.060" style="s2">talking about this because</p>
<p begin="01:13:05.500" end="01:13:09.520" style="s2">I need a way of translating this into</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.060" end="01:13:11.140" style="s2">you you know the phenomenology because I</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.520" end="01:13:12.370" style="s2">don&#39;t want it just to be a circle of</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.140" end="01:13:14.199" style="s2">doctrine I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.370" end="01:13:17.170" style="s2">that so I&#39;m what I&#39;m doing I was trying</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.199" end="01:13:18.370" style="s2">to translate it okay part of what you</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.170" end="01:13:20.260" style="s2">might be saying is part of my</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.370" end="01:13:22.630" style="s2">phenomenology is I feel called to</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.260" end="01:13:27.880" style="s2">worship and that call being called to</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.630" end="01:13:31.930" style="s2">worship I take to be the primary thing</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.880" end="01:13:35.560" style="s2">of my religion I just say call but then</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.930" end="01:13:39.270" style="s2">I I sense you know we talked about</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.560" end="01:13:43.540" style="s2">creatureliness as part of the numinous</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.270" end="01:13:47.620" style="s2">that has a creature in relation to the</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.540" end="01:13:52.469" style="s2">Creator I am uh I am obligated to</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.620" end="01:13:57.219" style="s2">worship that to not worship is to not be</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.469" end="01:14:01.360" style="s2">fully a creature but that sounds to me</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.219" end="01:14:05.650" style="s2">like the ultimate standard is again the</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.360" end="01:14:07.510" style="s2">fullness of your being that but that you</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.650" end="01:14:08.830" style="s2">can&#39;t come into a fullness of being</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.510" end="01:14:16.510" style="s2">unless you&#39;re into the right</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.830" end="01:14:17.110" style="s2">relationship with God so for example if</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.510" end="01:14:24.880" style="s2">I</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.110" end="01:14:27.820" style="s2">I mean this is tricky so you say you are</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.880" end="01:14:29.260" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to get above I was trying to</p>
<p begin="01:14:27.820" end="01:14:31.480" style="s2">convey that with a sense of being called</p>
<p begin="01:14:29.260" end="01:14:35.260" style="s2">in a sense that this is the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.480" end="01:14:43.270" style="s2">for me to do right that it&#39;s appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:14:35.260" end="01:14:45.400" style="s2">and right that I should treat the what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:43.270" end="01:14:47.560" style="s2">ultimate I mean maybe fulfill X language</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.400" end="01:14:49.660" style="s2">that I still don&#39;t I have to treat the</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.560" end="01:14:51.489" style="s2">ultimate with ultimate concern and</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.660" end="01:14:53.530" style="s2">anything less than ultimate concern is</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.489" end="01:14:55.239" style="s2">not treating it as ultimate I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.530" end="01:14:57.640" style="s2">to use language that I can sort of make</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.239" end="01:15:01.780" style="s2">work that&#39;s not specific to Christian</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.640" end="01:15:07.080" style="s2">doctrines so it is it something like</p>
<p begin="01:15:01.780" end="01:15:09.510" style="s2">that because because I get that I get so</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.080" end="01:15:12.430" style="s2">you&#39;ve heard me talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.510" end="01:15:14.800" style="s2">difficulty with idolatry is we tend to</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.430" end="01:15:17.670" style="s2">we treat something that&#39;s not ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.800" end="01:15:19.720" style="s2">as if its ultimate and then that</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.670" end="01:15:22.630" style="s2">radically disconnects</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.720" end="01:15:24.250" style="s2">from reality and that that&#39;s - that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.630" end="01:15:26.140" style="s2">fundamental loss of meaning because</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.250" end="01:15:28.780" style="s2">never idly meaning a semantic meaning</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.140" end="01:15:31.510" style="s2">I mean connectedness to what&#39;s most real</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.780" end="01:15:34.840" style="s2">and so it sounds to me like what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.510" end="01:15:37.060" style="s2">saying I&#39;m sorry is that well what</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.840" end="01:15:39.460" style="s2">worship means is I want I want the I</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.060" end="01:15:41.350" style="s2">want I want to I want to realize the</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.460" end="01:15:43.390" style="s2">most relevant connection to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.350" end="01:15:44.890" style="s2">ultimate and part of that means means</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.390" end="01:15:48.630" style="s2">that I should always be treating it as</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.890" end="01:15:53.260" style="s2">if it&#39;s ultimate is that is that right</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.630" end="01:15:58.840" style="s2">well yes I should be treating I should</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.260" end="01:16:05.200" style="s2">be treating God as as ultimate I should</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.840" end="01:16:07.240" style="s2">be treating him in that way but other</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.200" end="01:16:12.420" style="s2">religions do that I mean and right so</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.240" end="01:16:14.950" style="s2">and other I mean so for example you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:12.420" end="01:16:17.260" style="s2">Buddhism Buddhist said you know</p>
<p begin="01:16:14.950" end="01:16:19.710" style="s2">everything that I do is for the ultimate</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.260" end="01:16:22.840" style="s2">concern of Nirvana right if you like</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.710" end="01:16:24.700" style="s2">everything is in the service of this and</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.840" end="01:16:26.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not in the service of him right</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.700" end="01:16:28.120" style="s2">it&#39;s that only in the relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.680" end="01:16:29.950" style="s2">Nirvana well human beings achieve</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.120" end="01:16:32.260" style="s2">enlightenment which is the Buddhist way</p>
<p begin="01:16:29.950" end="01:16:34.540" style="s2">of trying to say the best possible life</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.260" end="01:16:38.590" style="s2">they could achieve and and to use your</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.540" end="01:16:39.850" style="s2">order of causation right the wisdom is</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.590" end="01:16:41.080" style="s2">ultimately in the service of</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.850" end="01:16:42.930" style="s2">enlightenment which is demister</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.080" end="01:16:47.140" style="s2">ultimately in the service of realizing</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.930" end="01:16:49.060" style="s2">Nirvana so that seems to be structurally</p>
<p begin="01:16:47.140" end="01:16:50.200" style="s2">the case and that they at least deeply</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.060" end="01:16:55.000" style="s2">structurally analogous in other</p>
<p begin="01:16:50.200" end="01:16:58.410" style="s2">religions is that is that I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.000" end="01:17:01.930" style="s2">familiar enough I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.410" end="01:17:07.740" style="s2">that&#39;s fine no no problem that I have</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.930" end="01:17:10.660" style="s2">many have many am holes in my education</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.740" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">but I just want to say that if you ask</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.660" end="01:17:16.060" style="s2">you know what is the what is</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:17.530" style="s2">Christianity you know and see there are</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.060" end="01:17:19.030" style="s2">some Christians who had said you ask</p>
<p begin="01:17:17.530" end="01:17:22.150" style="s2">someone&#39;s Christianity about they&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.030" end="01:17:25.300" style="s2">well it&#39;s about getting saved but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.150" end="01:17:28.710" style="s2">a that&#39;s a rather truncated view of</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.300" end="01:17:33.139" style="s2">Christianity really is about you know</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.710" end="01:17:35.630" style="s2">that giving God what what is due him</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.139" end="01:17:38.780" style="s2">and then like I said we know we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.630" end="01:17:42.619" style="s2">because of our fallenness give God what</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.780" end="01:17:44.630" style="s2">is justly do him the praise and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.619" end="01:17:47.030" style="s2">worship that is justly do him so he has</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.630" end="01:17:49.369" style="s2">made that possible for him now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.030" end="01:17:51.590" style="s2">one part of it but that&#39;s like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.369" end="01:17:55.639" style="s2">the most important part and I would say</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.590" end="01:17:57.619" style="s2">that shows in at least in the Catholic</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.639" end="01:18:03.679" style="s2">and Orthodox churches end up the divine</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.619" end="01:18:06.860" style="s2">liturgy or the mass the Eucharist is as</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.679" end="01:18:08.960" style="s2">we Catholics say that the Orthodox would</p>
<p begin="01:18:06.860" end="01:18:12.139" style="s2">agree the source and summit of our faith</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.960" end="01:18:15.800" style="s2">it&#39;s that is a that is the sacrifice</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.139" end="01:18:19.190" style="s2">provided to us to give back to God by</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.800" end="01:18:21.949" style="s2">Christ by which all these by which all</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.190" end="01:18:27.260" style="s2">the other things come listen the agape</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.949" end="01:18:30.139" style="s2">the everything okay that&#39;s good so I</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.260" end="01:18:32.239" style="s2">guess so the difference may be is that</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.139" end="01:18:35.510" style="s2">in the way in which we can participate</p>
<p begin="01:18:32.239" end="01:18:38.690" style="s2">in the groan of being its exhibits</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.510" end="01:18:41.600" style="s2">closer to the body or closer to to to</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.690" end="01:18:45.530" style="s2">matter in within Christianity where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:41.600" end="01:18:47.570" style="s2">not the way we confirm with the illness</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.530" end="01:18:52.070" style="s2">with a cosmic relevance realization is</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.570" end="01:18:55.699" style="s2">not just an effort on our part to let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.070" end="01:18:57.500" style="s2">see do make a good form yeah it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.699" end="01:18:59.600" style="s2">just an effort on our part we also think</p>
<p begin="01:18:57.500" end="01:19:02.480" style="s2">that God reaches down so that it became</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.600" end="01:19:05.570" style="s2">the manifestations of the ground of D so</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.480" end="01:19:06.949" style="s2">didn&#39;t don&#39;t just sort of do the bare</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.570" end="01:19:08.600" style="s2">minimum may be obsessed anding the world</p>
<p begin="01:19:06.949" end="01:19:12.920" style="s2">into existence so that things can can</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.600" end="01:19:14.690" style="s2">emerge and so on but that and this is</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.920" end="01:19:21.860" style="s2">this get pregnant to the point of</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.690" end="01:19:23.810" style="s2">miracles but that and this would tie in</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.860" end="01:19:26.389" style="s2">with the phenomenology we&#39;re in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:23.810" end="01:19:30.590" style="s2">phenomenology of Christianity we may be</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.389" end="01:19:32.630" style="s2">we we give a greater part of we</p>
<p begin="01:19:30.590" end="01:19:34.460" style="s2">acknowledge more that may be the effort</p>
<p begin="01:19:32.630" end="01:19:36.739" style="s2">that being does for us that the ground</p>
<p begin="01:19:34.460" end="01:19:39.920" style="s2">of being does towards us you think</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.739" end="01:19:41.570" style="s2">that&#39;s care is that fair to me or</p>
<p begin="01:19:39.920" end="01:19:44.060" style="s2">furtive Mary Mary who are you are as</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.570" end="01:19:46.700" style="s2">well to everyone</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.060" end="01:19:49.670" style="s2">I mean I think I feel like you shift the</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.700" end="01:19:51.850" style="s2">ground away from Mary ability I think</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.670" end="01:19:53.780" style="s2">Mary was saying something like</p>
<p begin="01:19:51.850" end="01:19:57.170" style="s2">independent of whatever it might have</p>
<p begin="01:19:53.780" end="01:20:00.320" style="s2">done for us the ultimate is deserving of</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.170" end="01:20:02.570" style="s2">being treated as ultimate and then but</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.320" end="01:20:04.580" style="s2">that&#39;s how I put it and then I heard</p>
<p begin="01:20:02.570" end="01:20:07.760" style="s2">Mary saying yeah John but something more</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.580" end="01:20:10.550" style="s2">there there&#39;s I&#39;m trying to put my is it</p>
<p begin="01:20:07.760" end="01:20:13.160" style="s2">something like a sense of service I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.550" end="01:20:15.080" style="s2">trying to get what what&#39;s because not</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.160" end="01:20:16.520" style="s2">all not only do their worship religions</p>
<p begin="01:20:15.080" end="01:20:18.950" style="s2">right so the Buddhists don&#39;t worship</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.520" end="01:20:21.710" style="s2">Nirvana but they think it&#39;s alternative</p>
<p begin="01:20:18.950" end="01:20:23.960" style="s2">should be treated ultimately that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.710" end="01:20:26.750" style="s2">I&#39;m saying that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying that</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.960" end="01:20:31.460" style="s2">it&#39;s a I&#39;m saying that we have a</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.750" end="01:20:33.500" style="s2">disjunction between okay I I hate</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.460" end="01:20:37.310" style="s2">because when I hear you talking about</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.500" end="01:20:41.320" style="s2">religion and like I say what you saying</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.310" end="01:20:43.820" style="s2">about religion being these you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.320" end="01:20:46.090" style="s2">containers for the set of psycho</p>

<p begin="01:21:19.250" end="01:21:28.700" style="s2">Christianity the concept of worship as</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.250" end="01:21:30.980" style="s2">that worship is the is what you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.700" end="01:21:35.660" style="s2">what is the church for it&#39;s for worship</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.980" end="01:21:37.640" style="s2">now you know beyond that of course</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.660" end="01:21:39.440" style="s2">there&#39;s many other things there is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:37.640" end="01:21:42.290" style="s2">wisdom there is the agape there is the</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.440" end="01:21:43.790" style="s2">community there is there is them by</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.290" end="01:21:49.580" style="s2">their fruits you shall know them to</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.790" end="01:21:51.230" style="s2">write all that but but what is for is</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.580" end="01:21:53.090" style="s2">worship that&#39;s why when Christ</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.230" end="01:21:55.010" style="s2">establishes the church he does it at</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.090" end="01:21:58.070" style="s2">that Eucharistic sacrifice with these</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.010" end="01:22:00.739" style="s2">disciples and stuff so it&#39;s more thing</p>
<p begin="01:21:58.070" end="01:22:03.230" style="s2">I guess maybe maybe this is part of it</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.739" end="01:22:07.699" style="s2">then and so I want to tread very lightly</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.230" end="01:22:10.789" style="s2">and I have to go soon guys but um so you</p>
<p begin="01:22:07.699" end="01:22:12.530" style="s2">want to like I&#39;m totally me I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.789" end="01:22:15.139" style="s2">the Neoplatonic idea it&#39;s in Platonist</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.530" end="01:22:17.389" style="s2">week right we we have to treat the</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.139" end="01:22:19.280" style="s2">alternate ultimately and like I said</p>
<p begin="01:22:17.389" end="01:22:21.980" style="s2">that&#39;s clearly in other religions and</p>
<p begin="01:22:19.280" end="01:22:23.449" style="s2">then there&#39;s something you there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:21.980" end="01:22:27.949" style="s2">something more you want to add here</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.449" end="01:22:30.320" style="s2">about it&#39;s not just relating to what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.949" end="01:22:33.110" style="s2">ultimate appropriately it&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.320" end="01:22:35.289" style="s2">sense that God needs to be given things</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.110" end="01:22:38.630" style="s2">is that is that what you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.289" end="01:22:41.119" style="s2">because that&#39;s sort of futile to me that</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.630" end="01:22:42.710" style="s2">because I don&#39;t think God needs anything</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.119" end="01:22:44.449" style="s2">that would make that would that would</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.710" end="01:22:46.969" style="s2">undermine everything we&#39;ve been talking</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.449" end="01:22:54.349" style="s2">about how everything is right so God</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.969" end="01:22:56.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t need that sort of the yeah the</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.349" end="01:22:58.340" style="s2">son gives something to the father with</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.599" end="01:23:01.250" style="s2">us that we can participate in what God</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.340" end="01:23:03.880" style="s2">gives himself in distance is that sort</p>
<p begin="01:23:01.250" end="01:23:07.190" style="s2">of what you&#39;re pointing at Mary well</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.880" end="01:23:08.780" style="s2">remember when we were talking I know we</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.190" end="01:23:14.179" style="s2">did this and also when I was talking to</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.780" end="01:23:16.550" style="s2">Karen talking about the the you know a</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.179" end="01:23:18.800" style="s2">lot of times we when we talk as</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.550" end="01:23:21.559" style="s2">Christians we talk about Jesus loving us</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.800" end="01:23:23.449" style="s2">you know that you know how much Christ</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.559" end="01:23:26.179" style="s2">loved us that he sacrificed himself for</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.449" end="01:23:29.719" style="s2">us and all but that the primary love of</p>
<p begin="01:23:26.179" end="01:23:34.550" style="s2">Christ was the father that it&#39;s his love</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.719" end="01:23:37.340" style="s2">for the father is the is what is what</p>
<p begin="01:23:34.550" end="01:23:39.409" style="s2">was most in his you know his top</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.340" end="01:23:41.960" style="s2">priority you know even over and above</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.409" end="01:23:43.280" style="s2">his love for us that it was a obedience</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.960" end="01:23:46.849" style="s2">to his father I would love for his</p>
<p begin="01:23:43.280" end="01:23:50.960" style="s2">father so that it&#39;s the love between the</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.849" end="01:23:53.480" style="s2">father and the son that is really what</p>
<p begin="01:23:50.960" end="01:23:57.019" style="s2">creates everything because as the</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.480" end="01:24:00.409" style="s2">creation is for the son it&#39;s to where</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.019" end="01:24:04.610" style="s2">the Sun would have something to give to</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.409" end="01:24:08.150" style="s2">the father so it&#39;s what creation is for</p>
<p begin="01:24:04.610" end="01:24:10.519" style="s2">the father and the son is a is a way</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.150" end="01:24:11.039" style="s2">that the father of the son express their</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.519" end="01:24:13.889" style="s2">love for</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.039" end="01:24:15.929" style="s2">on another and then draws into that draw</p>
<p begin="01:24:13.889" end="01:24:17.399" style="s2">us into that love that they have for one</p>
<p begin="01:24:15.929" end="01:24:19.469" style="s2">another and we&#39;ve been speaking</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.399" end="01:24:21.389" style="s2">Christian easier but we can translate it</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.469" end="01:24:23.909" style="s2">into being in the ground of</p>
<p begin="01:24:21.389" end="01:24:27.089" style="s2">intelligibility so I give thing</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.909" end="01:24:29.309" style="s2">themselves to one another through us but</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.089" end="01:24:31.349" style="s2">then but then we&#39;re back to what we were</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.309" end="01:24:32.789" style="s2">talking about before and I think we</p>
<p begin="01:24:31.349" end="01:24:35.999" style="s2">might have lost something in the circle</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.789" end="01:24:37.979" style="s2">because I&#39;ve already said that I think I</p>
<p begin="01:24:35.999" end="01:24:39.869" style="s2">think part of what I was arguing for</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.979" end="01:24:43.499" style="s2">when I was arguing for wisdom and</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.869" end="01:24:45.989" style="s2">religion is to to fall deeply in love</p>
<p begin="01:24:43.499" end="01:24:47.699" style="s2">with being for its own sake I mean</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.989" end="01:24:53.399" style="s2">that&#39;s why that&#39;s why I invoke Spinoza</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.699" end="01:24:56.219" style="s2">and then how would that so okay so we I</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.399" end="01:24:57.899" style="s2">would say as a Christian so let&#39;s see if</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.219" end="01:25:01.229" style="s2">we did the translation back and forth I</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.899" end="01:25:06.449" style="s2">would say as a Christian that to fall to</p>
<p begin="01:25:01.229" end="01:25:10.639" style="s2">fall in love with God is then to want to</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.449" end="01:25:14.519" style="s2">give to God the praise that God deserves</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.639" end="01:25:17.669" style="s2">but God knows that I cannot do that</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.519" end="01:25:18.949" style="s2">and so God provides for me the means to</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.669" end="01:25:22.289" style="s2">do that</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.949" end="01:25:24.479" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the sacrifice of Christ</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.289" end="01:25:26.309" style="s2">there&#39;s many other things accomplished</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.479" end="01:25:27.869" style="s2">by that and you know that in Christian</p>
<p begin="01:25:26.309" end="01:25:30.059" style="s2">theology but I&#39;m just sticking with that</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.869" end="01:25:32.909" style="s2">that well I I&#39;m not trying to say that</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.059" end="01:25:38.579" style="s2">you&#39;re making excuses claim so they take</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.909" end="01:25:43.469" style="s2">that totally for granted okay so what</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.579" end="01:25:45.569" style="s2">did you say just before Bali so I&#39;ve my</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.469" end="01:25:51.749" style="s2">question that would be okay so you have</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.569" end="01:25:57.539" style="s2">fallen in love with being okay so the</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.749" end="01:25:59.549" style="s2">ground being how do you express you know</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.539" end="01:26:01.499" style="s2">and this is I&#39;m not you know this is not</p>
<p begin="01:25:59.549" end="01:26:08.909" style="s2">like an argument it&#39;s just like a you</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.499" end="01:26:11.639" style="s2">know how do you express your love for</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.909" end="01:26:15.019" style="s2">the ground of being how would you say</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.639" end="01:26:15.019" style="s2">that works and you are</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.719" end="01:26:29.960" style="s2">so if it depends what you mean I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.180" end="01:26:33.410" style="s2">would be analogous to you come upon the</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.960" end="01:26:36.170" style="s2">Grand Canyon and you realize there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.410" end="01:26:40.310" style="s2">something above and beyond you and you</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.170" end="01:26:45.800" style="s2">say ah you express our you express right</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.310" end="01:26:48.530" style="s2">reverence and or like when I&#39;m listening</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.800" end="01:26:49.940" style="s2">to a I&#39;m using I&#39;m only using this as an</p>
<p begin="01:26:48.530" end="01:26:53.989" style="s2">analogy because we&#39;re trying to talk</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.940" end="01:26:56.060" style="s2">here so I&#39;m using aesthetic analogy I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:26:53.989" end="01:26:58.760" style="s2">listening to perhaps you know the</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.060" end="01:27:01.880" style="s2">seventh symphony by Beethoven and I feel</p>
<p begin="01:26:58.760" end="01:27:04.640" style="s2">tremendous I it causes me to sense a</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.880" end="01:27:08.000" style="s2">depths of thing a depth of things and I</p>
<p begin="01:27:04.640" end="01:27:10.880" style="s2">and I love that depth I just feel the</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.000" end="01:27:13.070" style="s2">love of that depth and I I appreciate in</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.880" end="01:27:15.380" style="s2">both the senses of value and understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:13.070" end="01:27:17.739" style="s2">and grow because appreciate means all of</p>
<p begin="01:27:15.380" end="01:27:27.739" style="s2">those and I appreciate it very very</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.739" end="01:27:31.480" style="s2">profoundly I get it so because to you</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.739" end="01:27:36.080" style="s2">the ground of being is not personal then</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.480" end="01:27:37.810" style="s2">then just merely having the personal</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.080" end="01:27:41.930" style="s2">experience that you&#39;re having of</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.810" end="01:27:46.280" style="s2">appreciating of feeling connected to it</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.930" end="01:27:49.160" style="s2">that way that but but then we get back</p>
<p begin="01:27:46.280" end="01:27:51.920" style="s2">to if you if you know the ground of</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.160" end="01:27:54.710" style="s2">being as personal you can understand</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.920" end="01:27:57.730" style="s2">then there would be a difference there</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.710" end="01:28:02.390" style="s2">would be some phenomenologically</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.730" end="01:28:06.350" style="s2">different responses to a person versus</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.390" end="01:28:09.410" style="s2">it the non personal I get I get that I</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.350" end="01:28:13.219" style="s2">get I get that I I totally acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:28:09.410" end="01:28:15.770" style="s2">and understand I think that there that</p>
<p begin="01:28:13.219" end="01:28:16.880" style="s2">you want to say in worship I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:15.770" end="01:28:19.730" style="s2">something other than what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.880" end="01:28:21.290" style="s2">John but what I&#39;m trying to get from the</p>
<p begin="01:28:19.730" end="01:28:23.510" style="s2">other way but that&#39;s after you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.290" end="01:28:25.430" style="s2">concluded that the ground is first of</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.510" end="01:28:27.410" style="s2">all at which to me is to get the cart</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.430" end="01:28:29.660" style="s2">before the horse I want to know what it</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.410" end="01:28:31.670" style="s2">is and maybe this is where you have to</p>
<p begin="01:28:29.660" end="01:28:33.260" style="s2">ultimately flee towards revelation or</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.670" end="01:28:34.620" style="s2">something I want to know what it is in</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.260" end="01:28:36.900" style="s2">the phenomenology that then</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.620" end="01:28:39.060" style="s2">first it calls you to attribute the</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.900" end="01:28:40.170" style="s2">person the person who had I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:28:39.060" end="01:28:43.050" style="s2">sick personality because that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.170" end="01:28:46.890" style="s2">wrong word such that that worship they</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.050" end="01:28:49.440" style="s2">make sense to you right we like my</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.890" end="01:28:50.640" style="s2">question is my question is if what sorry</p>
<p begin="01:28:49.440" end="01:28:52.440" style="s2">I just want to finish my point married</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.640" end="01:28:55.950" style="s2">is just a sentence right my question</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.440" end="01:28:59.220" style="s2">isn&#39;t what follows from you treating it</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.950" end="01:29:03.990" style="s2">as a person my question was what lead</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.220" end="01:29:08.580" style="s2">you to treat it as a person okay so I</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.990" end="01:29:11.210" style="s2">would say crescents presence that you</p>
<p begin="01:29:08.580" end="01:29:16.230" style="s2">get it so you get a sense of the of a</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.210" end="01:29:21.060" style="s2">presence of a person yes hmm and then I</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.230" end="01:29:23.430" style="s2">don&#39;t know and so that&#39;s what that and</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.060" end="01:29:25.590" style="s2">not because in fairness to me I wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.430" end="01:29:28.320" style="s2">around a lot of people who claimed that</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.590" end="01:29:30.660" style="s2">and tried to get me to they brought me</p>
<p begin="01:29:28.320" end="01:29:35.280" style="s2">up to try and experience that and feel</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.660" end="01:29:36.870" style="s2">that so if it if that&#39;s what it comes</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.280" end="01:29:39.300" style="s2">down to then I have nothing I have</p>
<p begin="01:29:36.870" end="01:29:41.940" style="s2">nothing to say to you like and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.300" end="01:29:43.650" style="s2">mean in the reticent I&#39;m pulling away I</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.940" end="01:29:45.960" style="s2">still want to be in relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.650" end="01:29:47.100" style="s2">communion with you it says I don&#39;t and I</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.960" end="01:29:48.510" style="s2">don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know what to say</p>
<p begin="01:29:47.100" end="01:29:53.250" style="s2">that yeah</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.510" end="01:29:56.690" style="s2">so there is a there is the revelation</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.250" end="01:30:00.360" style="s2">there is the you know the ontological</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.690" end="01:30:04.020" style="s2">arguments about you know the creation</p>
<p begin="01:30:00.360" end="01:30:06.150" style="s2">being a decision of a person there is</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.020" end="01:30:08.720" style="s2">all that but then there is the sense of</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.150" end="01:30:12.540" style="s2">presence which I think JP was kind of</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.720" end="01:30:15.720" style="s2">hinting at him himself so there is a</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.540" end="01:30:19.290" style="s2">there there is all you know there is all</p>
<p begin="01:30:15.720" end="01:30:21.540" style="s2">of that that&#39;s why I say that when I</p>
<p begin="01:30:19.290" end="01:30:24.510" style="s2">when I&#39;m hearing you talk about what</p>
<p begin="01:30:21.540" end="01:30:27.530" style="s2">religion is for I feel a little bit like</p>
<p begin="01:30:24.510" end="01:30:33.510" style="s2">you&#39;re not it&#39;s not totally grasping</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.530" end="01:30:36.390" style="s2">what we&#39;re experiencing within our</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.510" end="01:30:41.940" style="s2">religious experience however that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.390" end="01:30:47.880" style="s2">to say that I would in any way impugn</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.940" end="01:30:51.480" style="s2">the endeavor to bring as much wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.880" end="01:30:58.320" style="s2">to people and is much a meaning to</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.480" end="01:31:00.750" style="s2">people as possible but that but that I</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.320" end="01:31:03.750" style="s2">think you know I Christians are still</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.750" end="01:31:07.440" style="s2">going to be there we&#39;re still gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.750" end="01:31:09.780" style="s2">around and we&#39;re stupid person there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.440" end="01:31:12.000" style="s2">person here we want you to get to know</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.780" end="01:31:14.820" style="s2">we&#39;ll still be saying that to people and</p>
<p begin="01:31:12.000" end="01:31:16.920" style="s2">so many of those people will get to know</p>
<p begin="01:31:14.820" end="01:31:19.590" style="s2">that person they will have that</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.920" end="01:31:22.680" style="s2">experience of presence and it will be</p>
<p begin="01:31:19.590" end="01:31:29.160" style="s2">transformational for them in ways that</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.680" end="01:31:29.610" style="s2">you would approve of I don&#39;t disagree</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.160" end="01:31:34.050" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="01:31:29.610" end="01:31:37.080" style="s2">I guess my I guess one thing to say back</p>
<p begin="01:31:34.050" end="01:31:40.020" style="s2">is I was not trying to speak what about</p>
<p begin="01:31:37.080" end="01:31:42.900" style="s2">what Christianity was because I think</p>
<p begin="01:31:40.020" end="01:31:45.090" style="s2">it&#39;s fair for me to say that there are</p>
<p begin="01:31:42.900" end="01:31:47.820" style="s2">things that are bona fide religions acts</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.090" end="01:31:50.670" style="s2">your religions world religions in which</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.820" end="01:31:55.290" style="s2">that sense of the presence of a person</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.670" end="01:31:57.780" style="s2">is not felt or valorized within the</p>
<p begin="01:31:55.290" end="01:32:00.840" style="s2">religion and so always trying to speak</p>
<p begin="01:31:57.780" end="01:32:03.240" style="s2">as to what I think as I&#39;m alternately in</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.840" end="01:32:05.130" style="s2">the series I mean I&#39;m trying to be a</p>
<p begin="01:32:03.240" end="01:32:06.840" style="s2">scientist I&#39;m trying to find what&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:32:05.130" end="01:32:09.930" style="s2">are the universal principles of this</p>
<p begin="01:32:06.840" end="01:32:11.640" style="s2">phenomena that doesn&#39;t mean that any</p>
<p begin="01:32:09.930" end="01:32:13.440" style="s2">that that&#39;s not to dismiss everything</p>
<p begin="01:32:11.640" end="01:32:15.480" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been talking to or the point</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.440" end="01:32:18.110" style="s2">the decision point that we became - I -</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.480" end="01:32:21.150" style="s2">I do here I think there&#39;s a way in which</p>
<p begin="01:32:18.110" end="01:32:21.740" style="s2">I mean Christians should keep doing what</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.150" end="01:32:24.900" style="s2">you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.740" end="01:32:27.390" style="s2">but I wanted to understand what I why</p>
<p begin="01:32:24.900" end="01:32:29.670" style="s2">for me if I&#39;m trying to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:32:27.390" end="01:32:34.680" style="s2">religions and not Christianity that</p>
<p begin="01:32:29.670" end="01:32:38.790" style="s2">can&#39;t be a defining feature right yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.680" end="01:32:40.650" style="s2">yeah I I understand that but I just want</p>
<p begin="01:32:38.790" end="01:32:43.410" style="s2">to do I just want to make the point that</p>
<p begin="01:32:40.650" end="01:32:47.730" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a do you think I&#39;ve ever</p>
<p begin="01:32:43.410" end="01:32:52.380" style="s2">disrespected Christianity no no no no</p>
<p begin="01:32:47.730" end="01:32:54.390" style="s2">not at all although I do think maybe in</p>
<p begin="01:32:52.380" end="01:32:55.010" style="s2">this conversation that I saw with you</p>
<p begin="01:32:54.390" end="01:32:58.190" style="s2">today</p>
<p begin="01:32:55.010" end="01:33:07.000" style="s2">a little bit dismissal dismissive of the</p>
<p begin="01:32:58.190" end="01:33:07.000" style="s2">value of vowels but but that might be a</p>
<p begin="01:33:11.530" end="01:33:21.400" style="s2">video with him I thought I thought well</p>
<p begin="01:33:15.019" end="01:33:21.400" style="s2">you had two numbers numeral you know</p>
<p begin="01:33:23.730" end="01:33:28.230" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>

<p begin="01:33:36.170" end="01:33:40.730" style="s2">character and I was listening to the</p>
<p begin="01:33:39.170" end="01:33:42.650" style="s2">conversation I was outside I was</p>
<p begin="01:33:40.730" end="01:33:44.239" style="s2">listening and when you were saying to</p>
<p begin="01:33:42.650" end="01:33:50.539" style="s2">him how much he liked what he did you</p>

<p begin="01:33:52.969" end="01:34:02.000" style="s2">for me yeah I think he&#39;s a valuable</p>
<p begin="01:33:56.869" end="01:34:05.750" style="s2">partner in the project that that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:34:02.000" end="01:34:08.119" style="s2">that you&#39;re attempting and I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="01:34:05.750" end="01:34:10.099" style="s2">ask some more questions when we talk</p>
<p begin="01:34:08.119" end="01:34:15.019" style="s2">again about how you see certain</p>
<p begin="01:34:10.099" end="01:34:16.789" style="s2">practicalities of justified away how you</p>
<p begin="01:34:15.019" end="01:34:20.059" style="s2">would deal with certain practicalities</p>
<p begin="01:34:16.789" end="01:34:21.230" style="s2">in you&#39;re sure and other people have</p>
<p begin="01:34:20.059" end="01:34:23.090" style="s2">been asking me that I&#39;ve done a whole</p>
<p begin="01:34:21.230" end="01:34:25.400" style="s2">bunch of interviews around to sort of</p>
<p begin="01:34:23.090" end="01:34:27.260" style="s2">societal aspects and some of that will</p>
<p begin="01:34:25.400" end="01:34:29.599" style="s2">be available and maybe get a chance to</p>
<p begin="01:34:27.260" end="01:34:31.610" style="s2">listen to some of it I don&#39;t want to be</p>
<p begin="01:34:29.599" end="01:34:32.989" style="s2">presumptuous and then we could circle</p>
<p begin="01:34:31.610" end="01:34:34.820" style="s2">back around to it because I&#39;m very happy</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.989" end="01:34:37.159" style="s2">to talk with you two again I should go</p>
<p begin="01:34:34.820" end="01:34:40.849" style="s2">guys so I&#39;m sort of we&#39;re supposed to</p>
<p begin="01:34:37.159" end="01:34:42.679" style="s2">stop at 8:45 I didn&#39;t want to stop</p>
<p begin="01:34:40.849" end="01:34:44.480" style="s2">because I felt that like Mary and I were</p>
<p begin="01:34:42.679" end="01:34:48.559" style="s2">framed you&#39;re leading to sort of a</p>
<p begin="01:34:44.480" end="01:34:51.079" style="s2">really crucial and so I will acknowledge</p>
<p begin="01:34:48.559" end="01:34:52.880" style="s2">I guess maybe formally and explicitly</p>
<p begin="01:34:51.079" end="01:34:55.400" style="s2">hear that that is the piece of the</p>
<p begin="01:34:52.880" end="01:34:57.349" style="s2">phenomenology that at least with</p>
<p begin="01:34:55.400" end="01:35:01.309" style="s2">reference to Christianity or maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:34:57.349" end="01:35:04.579" style="s2">Abrahamic religions is fair that is not</p>
<p begin="01:35:01.309" end="01:35:06.110" style="s2">is not part of my experience and not for</p>
<p begin="01:35:04.579" end="01:35:06.769" style="s2">lack of people trying to give it to me</p>
<p begin="01:35:06.110" end="01:35:08.160" style="s2">either</p>
