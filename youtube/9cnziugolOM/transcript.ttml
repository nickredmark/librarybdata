<p begin="00:00:03.439" end="00:00:07.359" style="s2">welcome to our board meeting</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.880" end="00:00:07.919" style="s2">this is probably infinity now i think</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.359" end="00:00:09.920" style="s2">numbers</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.919" end="00:00:11.519" style="s2">and uh today we&#39;re on like number three</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.920" end="00:00:13.679" style="s2">of the foundational document though</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.519" end="00:00:15.679" style="s2">where we are talking about our values</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.679" end="00:00:17.199" style="s2">and i did get confused last week because</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.679" end="00:00:18.880" style="s2">i was like i&#39;ll take a quiz and i</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.199" end="00:00:19.520" style="s2">realized it was like oh not our personal</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.880" end="00:00:22.800" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.520" end="00:00:25.119" style="s2">our collective company values</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.800" end="00:00:26.400" style="s2">and so that is yes very different so i</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.119" end="00:00:27.840" style="s2">don&#39;t know if anyone else had a chance</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.400" end="00:00:29.359" style="s2">to sit with the</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.840" end="00:00:31.840" style="s2">values they would like to bring to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.359" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">but i wrote down a couple things</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.840" end="00:00:35.600" style="s2">all of which are a little a little big</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:37.520" style="s2">goodness is one</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.600" end="00:00:39.760" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of like google&#39;s don&#39;t be evil</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.520" end="00:00:45.039" style="s2">like the good thing is number one</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.760" end="00:00:48.079" style="s2">and then other ones follow underneath</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.039" end="00:00:49.440" style="s2">yeah i the only i</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.079" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">i thought about this a little bit but</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.440" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">not as much as i&#39;d hoped to</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:53.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.239" end="00:00:58.960" style="s2">so i i know we want to have some things</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.399" end="00:01:01.359" style="s2">in there like you know</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.960" end="00:01:02.320" style="s2">like omni when it&#39;s really kind of value</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.359" end="00:01:03.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.320" end="00:01:05.680" style="s2">you know everything we do kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.760" end="00:01:09.040" style="s2">benefits everybody but um</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.680" end="00:01:13.600" style="s2">or at least doesn&#39;t hurt everybody</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.040" end="00:01:15.920" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t hurt anybody um</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.600" end="00:01:17.360" style="s2">so but like sovereignty individual</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.920" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">sovereignty although i think we need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.360" end="00:01:21.759" style="s2">define that</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">at some point um because there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.759" end="00:01:24.880" style="s2">several meanings for that</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.600" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">but i didn&#39;t get much further than</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.880" end="00:01:31.200" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">from mutual support maybe yeah</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.240" end="00:01:41.920" style="s2">i think like last week when we went</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.520" style="s2">through what omni win was</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.920" end="00:01:45.520" style="s2">like what that kind of definition was</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.520" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">and who the who the stakeholders were i</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.520" end="00:01:47.920" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.840" style="s2">is us defining omni win which i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.920" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">was very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.840" end="00:01:54.479" style="s2">uh and i also have like goodness in</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:55.360" style="s2">quotations i just have anti-rival risks</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.479" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.360" end="00:01:58.799" style="s2">that is part of the goodness is anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.000" style="s2">that kind of fits within that category</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.799" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">is something that</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.000" end="00:02:03.360" style="s2">just being it is a reward and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:04.719" style="s2">having other people be it as a reward</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.360" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot in there</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.719" end="00:02:09.200" style="s2">right it is the omni-win and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">anti-rival and</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.200" end="00:02:12.720" style="s2">those things and it&#39;s like if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">being that first then why anything else</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.720" end="00:02:16.160" style="s2">anyway but also</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:17.440" style="s2">transparency is one that comes up</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.160" end="00:02:19.840" style="s2">consistently</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.440" end="00:02:23.520" style="s2">uh in all of our projects that there</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.840" end="00:02:27.120" style="s2">needs to be transparency for trust</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.520" end="00:02:28.160" style="s2">and then um innovation that we do need</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.120" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">to grow</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.160" end="00:02:32.640" style="s2">both as individuals hopefully but mainly</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">as a project right like if we</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.640" end="00:02:36.879" style="s2">even if we created the best amazing</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">together tech omni win thing for our</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.879" end="00:02:39.760" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.360" style="s2">if it&#39;s not growing or it&#39;s not inviting</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.760" end="00:02:42.319" style="s2">in new projects which itself would be</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.360" end="00:02:44.319" style="s2">growth</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.319" end="00:02:46.319" style="s2">not growth for growth&#39;s sake in game a</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.319" end="00:02:47.280" style="s2">but if it&#39;s not growing it&#39;s dying right</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.319" end="00:02:50.959" style="s2">i mean that</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.280" end="00:02:53.120" style="s2">in a very nature-based way innovation</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.959" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">um and i think i already said it maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.120" end="00:02:56.480" style="s2">skipped this one that it&#39;s fun but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:58.319" style="s2">an enjoyable thing that we are doing so</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.480" end="00:03:00.000" style="s2">that it is</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.319" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">something we want to keep keep going</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.000" end="00:03:02.400" style="s2">back to</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.959" end="00:03:06.720" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure how to phrase it this part</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.360" end="00:03:09.360" style="s2">but i think there needs to be some</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.720" end="00:03:12.159" style="s2">element of like</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.360" end="00:03:13.040" style="s2">i don&#39;t know effectiveness or like for</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.159" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.040" end="00:03:16.239" style="s2">the mec thing right where like you could</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:17.360" style="s2">tell they had some good values they were</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.239" end="00:03:18.800" style="s2">working towards stuff</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.360" end="00:03:20.400" style="s2">but they weren&#39;t effective they built</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.800" end="00:03:22.400" style="s2">something that people couldn&#39;t afford</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.400" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">and so they just got sold and so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.400" end="00:03:25.840" style="s2">sort of undermines their entire</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.400" end="00:03:32.000" style="s2">purpose um yeah and so something around</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.000" end="00:03:34.400" style="s2">like effectiveness or pragmatism</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.000" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">or you know like actually making</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.400" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">meaningful progress</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:41.169" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.090" end="00:03:41.169" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.599" end="00:03:50.080" style="s2">yeah effectiveness kind of is innovation</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.920" end="00:03:52.480" style="s2">meets</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.080" end="00:03:53.599" style="s2">goodness right because it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.480" end="00:03:55.200" style="s2">we&#39;re if we&#39;re just being</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.599" end="00:03:56.640" style="s2">good but we&#39;re not doing anything that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.200" end="00:03:58.319" style="s2">not helpful it&#39;s not innovative we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.640" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">just being innovative or breaking things</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.319" end="00:04:01.760" style="s2">that&#39;s not great</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.200" end="00:04:02.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like effective is exactly what you</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.760" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">said with mec</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.560" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">like it doesn&#39;t matter if you make the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:07.439" style="s2">most um</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:08.720" style="s2">beautiful company if no one&#39;s gonna shop</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.439" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">there including the membership because</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.720" end="00:04:11.920" style="s2">the prices are too high</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.840" style="s2">that is part of it and in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.920" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">transparency giving people the</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.840" end="00:04:16.560" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:18.000" style="s2">right that we&#39;re not the board of mech</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.560" end="00:04:18.479" style="s2">trying to keep secrets or trying to like</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.000" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">get the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.479" end="00:04:23.919" style="s2">highest price point or the lowest um</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.680" style="s2">whatever that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.919" end="00:04:27.040" style="s2">giving the full picture and then saying</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.680" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">so it&#39;s like are we going to be this</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.040" end="00:04:29.840" style="s2">part are we are we going to be this with</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:31.120" style="s2">the lowest price point are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.840" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">be this with the medium or this with the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.120" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">highest price point right and letting</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:35.199" style="s2">people pick but like</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:37.520" style="s2">pick for where you&#39;re actually going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.199" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">shop not for your</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.520" end="00:04:42.400" style="s2">lofty ideals that you&#39;re never going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.280" style="s2">actually stand behind</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.400" end="00:04:46.720" style="s2">right and like i think it&#39;s it just</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.280" end="00:04:50.000" style="s2">ended up being a hybrid but i think it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.720" end="00:04:51.600" style="s2">is unique in this list so far because if</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:54.880" style="s2">you can have something that&#39;s good and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.600" end="00:04:56.479" style="s2">innovative but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.880" end="00:04:58.000" style="s2">it&#39;s not useful or it&#39;s too expensive</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.479" end="00:05:00.320" style="s2">people won&#39;t actually buy it</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.000" end="00:05:02.880" style="s2">right or what whatever and it also gets</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.320" end="00:05:04.960" style="s2">weird because like</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.880" end="00:05:06.560" style="s2">these are the values of the project</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.960" end="00:05:07.840" style="s2">which is really just a collection of</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.560" end="00:05:09.680" style="s2">other projects kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.840" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">like a way to help those projects move</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.680" end="00:05:14.240" style="s2">forward so some of these may not</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:15.440" style="s2">actually end up being the together tech</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.240" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">values but just like</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.440" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">values that we recommend others have</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.800" end="00:05:22.000" style="s2">yeah and what&#39;s what&#39;s also interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:22.720" style="s2">about this is i find when we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.000" end="00:05:24.880" style="s2">through this</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.720" end="00:05:27.520" style="s2">it&#39;s not like a typical company where</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.880" end="00:05:31.199" style="s2">you can very narrowly</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.520" end="00:05:35.759" style="s2">define what it is the</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.199" end="00:05:39.440" style="s2">the sub purpose the main purpose of this</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.759" end="00:05:41.360" style="s2">organization is just that everyone has a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.440" end="00:05:44.400" style="s2">better world to live in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.360" end="00:05:47.120" style="s2">it so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.400" end="00:05:48.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s very very broad much</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.120" end="00:05:50.840" style="s2">broader than</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.240" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">the simple thing of saying let&#39;s make a</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.840" end="00:05:55.120" style="s2">profit</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:58.240" style="s2">um so so yeah you get into this much</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.120" end="00:06:01.360" style="s2">more complex and and the values are</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.240" end="00:06:02.319" style="s2">are often much broader than you would</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.360" end="00:06:06.400" style="s2">for a normal</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.319" end="00:06:09.280" style="s2">group right i think also because this</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.400" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">project is kind of all about doing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.280" end="00:06:12.560" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of secondhand</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:14.319" style="s2">like in theory right it&#39;s the projects</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.560" end="00:06:15.440" style="s2">like race and score and wikilection and</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.319" end="00:06:17.520" style="s2">solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.440" end="00:06:19.039" style="s2">and hyper logos and all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.520" end="00:06:21.840" style="s2">gonna are gonna make the actual</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.039" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">changes and this is just about trying to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.840" end="00:06:24.720" style="s2">help them</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">it&#39;s just about how can we make those</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.720" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">groups be as you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">have all the resources that they need</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:35.039" style="s2">whether that&#39;s you know time</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:38.000" style="s2">money experience skills etc um</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.039" end="00:06:39.759" style="s2">and like for me and all of this that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.000" end="00:06:41.199" style="s2">one of the things i kept</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.759" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">hitting as a block is like i&#39;d be like</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.199" end="00:06:45.440" style="s2">oh this i&#39;m like oh no that that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:46.000" style="s2">value like for converti or wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.440" end="00:06:48.240" style="s2">and not</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.000" end="00:06:50.960" style="s2">together tech so i kept kind of having</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.240" end="00:06:52.800" style="s2">that battle on is this to do with</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.960" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">my projects or to do with the group</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.800" end="00:06:55.759" style="s2">project of together tech</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:57.520" style="s2">and you know the project projects well</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.759" end="00:06:59.840" style="s2">throw some of those out</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.520" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">was it like you know being able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.840" end="00:07:03.840" style="s2">choose your right politician and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">definitely wikilection or what</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.840" end="00:07:07.599" style="s2">what were some of those examples um for</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:09.360" style="s2">mine a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.599" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">i guess was more on the converting side</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.360" end="00:07:12.880" style="s2">because i think that that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:14.639" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot more of the the bleed over</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.880" end="00:07:18.000" style="s2">and then you know it&#39;s things like</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.639" end="00:07:21.360" style="s2">sort of um presenting</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.000" end="00:07:23.680" style="s2">how the word this like useful</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.360" end="00:07:25.599" style="s2">information to make a decision</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.680" end="00:07:26.720" style="s2">sort of or like you know fighting</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.599" end="00:07:30.560" style="s2">misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.720" end="00:07:30.960" style="s2">um i guess a lot of it centers around</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.560" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.960" end="00:07:34.800" style="s2">those two are fighting this information</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:36.639" style="s2">and then presenting information in a way</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.800" end="00:07:39.199" style="s2">that helps people sort of get a summary</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.639" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">and decide one way or the other</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.199" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">yeah and that that&#39;s um</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.440" end="00:07:46.879" style="s2">you&#39;re right that&#39;s more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.199" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">though that made me think is that do we</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.879" end="00:07:51.840" style="s2">have a value</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">of creating documentation</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.840" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">so people can self learn or</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:07:59.280" style="s2">or is that implying that we don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:01.919" style="s2">value of direct</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.280" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">mentorship or do we value both and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.919" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">maybe we don&#39;t need to say it because</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:06.319" style="s2">really that all just falls under</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:10.800" style="s2">education and training</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.319" end="00:08:12.400" style="s2">right so that&#39;s a way of like</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.800" end="00:08:14.720" style="s2">i mean this is too long to put down but</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.400" end="00:08:16.240" style="s2">like maximizing the content and thought</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.720" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">leadership that we make for multiple</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.240" end="00:08:20.560" style="s2">learning styles</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:21.599" style="s2">or however we want to say that right</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.560" end="00:08:23.599" style="s2">like sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.599" end="00:08:25.120" style="s2">the stuff that is made is meant for</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.599" end="00:08:26.560" style="s2">because right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:28.720" style="s2">game a like if you&#39;re a successful</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.560" end="00:08:29.120" style="s2">gaming entrepreneur you largely fit into</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.720" end="00:08:32.479" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.120" end="00:08:33.760" style="s2">one type of thing like</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.479" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">a lot of them are going to have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.760" end="00:08:37.440" style="s2">similarities but whereas at least i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">noticed the game b personality is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.440" end="00:08:41.919" style="s2">very different like it&#39;s kind of all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:43.919" style="s2">other ones that fall</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.919" end="00:08:45.600" style="s2">to the side in game a have kind of found</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.919" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">a home here and then it&#39;s them trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.600" end="00:08:48.640" style="s2">figure out how to work together</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.760" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">one thing that is a value i have on a</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.880" end="00:08:56.000" style="s2">lot of my projects which i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:08:58.080" style="s2">supporting multiple learning styles</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.000" end="00:08:59.760" style="s2">is talking about but has been so</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.080" end="00:09:01.200" style="s2">co-opted by the left that no one hears</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.760" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">it for what it is diversity</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.200" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">right that like what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">diversity somebody coming to the table</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.160" end="00:09:08.480" style="s2">being different than us</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">is actually really powerful in like in</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.480" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">those learning styles right</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:13.920" style="s2">if we only wanted to bring in visual</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:16.240" style="s2">learners that&#39;s going to hurt us whereas</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.920" end="00:09:18.800" style="s2">if we have that diversity there</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.240" end="00:09:20.720" style="s2">then um different people can contribute</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.800" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">in different ways as long as the group</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.720" end="00:09:24.959" style="s2">can hold that and not require</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.600" end="00:09:26.640" style="s2">everyone has to be this effective</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.959" end="00:09:28.320" style="s2">everyone has to have this level of fun</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.640" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">everyone has to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.320" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">this level of transparency tmi all over</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.200" end="00:09:35.360" style="s2">the place everybody</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:37.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s that&#39;s diversity not</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.360" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">opinion people culture of race</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.680" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting because to me the</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:42.000" style="s2">other part that i think of when i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:44.800" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.000" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">diversity in terms of together tech is</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.800" end="00:09:48.160" style="s2">something that i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:51.120" style="s2">everyone agrees with in the space which</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.160" end="00:09:54.080" style="s2">is kind of like internal competition</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.120" end="00:09:55.839" style="s2">like i really care about misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.080" end="00:09:57.360" style="s2">so i don&#39;t want wiki election and con</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.839" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">variety to be the only projects</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.360" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">i want there to be more reason scores</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">and like uh how there to be 20 projects</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:04.560" style="s2">to deal with misinformation</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">we all sort of you know work together</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.560" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">where necessary but then also say</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.320" end="00:10:10.640" style="s2">well no that&#39;s my you know that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:11.279" style="s2">differentiates khan ferrari from reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.640" end="00:10:12.880" style="s2">score</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.279" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">so let&#39;s keep them different but still</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.880" end="00:10:18.000" style="s2">work together wherever possible</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:20.480" style="s2">so that in the end we&#39;ve got 20</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.000" end="00:10:21.680" style="s2">people in that race yeah and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.480" end="00:10:22.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.680" end="00:10:24.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t know where this fits but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.880" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">very similar to that there&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.399" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">like recent squirt and wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:30.640" style="s2">were both like your babies and came to</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">the table versus something we might</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.640" end="00:10:34.480" style="s2">create together</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:36.079" style="s2">and um whether it&#39;s brought by one</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.480" end="00:10:38.320" style="s2">person or we create it together</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.079" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between saying back</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.320" end="00:10:42.000" style="s2">to the drawing board start again whether</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:45.279" style="s2">it&#39;s in competition coopetition</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.000" end="00:10:47.760" style="s2">or whether it&#39;s an iteration right</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.279" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">maybe comparati like the stuff that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.760" end="00:10:51.680" style="s2">underneath ooh i could use that over</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">here right so there&#39;s that um</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.680" end="00:10:55.440" style="s2">having redundancy is good that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:58.560" style="s2">multiple projects</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.440" end="00:10:59.360" style="s2">and there&#39;s a way to kind of like split</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.560" end="00:11:01.360" style="s2">and merge</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.360" end="00:11:03.279" style="s2">right that there&#39;s like merging the</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.360" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">technology much more difficult</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.279" end="00:11:06.560" style="s2">but maybe that&#39;s 4.0 right like how</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:08.079" style="s2">would we bring the</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.560" end="00:11:10.000" style="s2">election and reason score together right</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.079" end="00:11:11.920" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know i think</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.000" end="00:11:14.000" style="s2">more to that point a lot of these</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.920" end="00:11:16.399" style="s2">projects will end up with some sort</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.000" end="00:11:18.240" style="s2">of a shared data source that i think at</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.399" end="00:11:20.079" style="s2">least to start with we would restrict</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.240" end="00:11:21.600" style="s2">you can only use the shared data source</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.079" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">if you&#39;re a part of this</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.600" end="00:11:24.880" style="s2">ecosystem right like you can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:25.920" style="s2">microsoft or google and come in and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.880" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">start using it</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.920" end="00:11:29.040" style="s2">because odds are aren&#39;t going to have</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:29.360" style="s2">the same kind of apis and stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.040" end="00:11:31.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.360" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">and we may never it may only be open to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.920" end="00:11:35.279" style="s2">people that say you know we operate</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:36.720" style="s2">at least based on some of these values</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.279" end="00:11:39.279" style="s2">and we&#39;re not going to you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.720" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">steal it or you know try to monetize it</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.279" end="00:11:42.240" style="s2">unethical ways</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.079" end="00:11:54.160" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s really good</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.399" end="00:11:56.880" style="s2">brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.160" end="00:11:58.000" style="s2">i think so too that&#39;s pretty we got a</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.880" end="00:11:59.680" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.000" end="00:12:01.920" style="s2">because part of the point of doing</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.680" end="00:12:04.320" style="s2">values is to be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.920" end="00:12:05.440" style="s2">this is our first value if it breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.320" end="00:12:07.120" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.440" end="00:12:09.120" style="s2">great now we go on to the second one</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.120" end="00:12:12.000" style="s2">right and somehow having that hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.120" end="00:12:13.839" style="s2">of values well at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.000" end="00:12:16.320" style="s2">that it&#39;s a living breathing thing right</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.839" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">maybe like we we&#39;ve defined omni-win as</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.320" end="00:12:20.880" style="s2">it being it benefit to everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:21.360" style="s2">it&#39;s it moves everyone forward but it</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.880" end="00:12:23.279" style="s2">might move</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.360" end="00:12:24.720" style="s2">one person stays the same and everyone</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.279" end="00:12:25.360" style="s2">else takes a powerful report right that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.720" end="00:12:27.519" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.360" end="00:12:28.959" style="s2">wiggle room within that but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.519" end="00:12:31.680" style="s2">get to be google and be like</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.959" end="00:12:32.720" style="s2">we don&#39;t do evil and then unless it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.680" end="00:12:35.600" style="s2">for profit</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.720" end="00:12:36.959" style="s2">unless it&#39;s scrap that is our motto</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.600" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">right we&#39;d have to describe that as our</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.959" end="00:12:40.480" style="s2">motto</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">and having i think we did lay it out in</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.480" end="00:12:43.839" style="s2">our mission and vision that omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:45.519" style="s2">kind of is our number one</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.839" end="00:12:48.079" style="s2">and then part of that is breaking that</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.519" end="00:12:49.440" style="s2">down into</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.079" end="00:12:50.959" style="s2">and i don&#39;t even know if we can do it in</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.440" end="00:12:54.320" style="s2">the foundational documents i think it</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.959" end="00:12:56.480" style="s2">actually is coming up against</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.320" end="00:12:59.440" style="s2">the issues as they arise but the more we</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.480" end="00:13:03.519" style="s2">could get it here the better</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.440" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">does anyone want to change any ordering</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.519" end="00:13:07.360" style="s2">because like you said the values i think</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">are helpful to be in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.360" end="00:13:11.279" style="s2">explicit order yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:17.200" style="s2">i mean i guess i&#39;d like to see</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:19.440" style="s2">sustainability higher maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.200" end="00:13:21.519" style="s2">and actually some of these are will will</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.440" end="00:13:23.760" style="s2">probably combine</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.519" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">like you were saying goodness exactly</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.760" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">goodness is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:30.079" style="s2">a larger bucket do we want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:33.040" style="s2">goodness in</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.079" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">or like explicitly called out or what do</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.040" end="00:13:34.800" style="s2">you think jubilee now that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">thought about</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.800" end="00:13:38.959" style="s2">i&#39;m good with it but it was it was just</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:42.000" style="s2">my place holder for things like</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.959" end="00:13:42.880" style="s2">and sustainable and like all of the who</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:44.880" style="s2">would want it to be</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.880" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">less sustainable right like we wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.880" end="00:13:49.040" style="s2">have that goodness</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">baked in and omni wind does get that i</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.040" end="00:13:51.279" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.199" end="00:13:56.959" style="s2">i mean transparency to me is a very high</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:58.480" style="s2">value because i don&#39;t think we get a lot</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.959" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">of the other ones without it</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.480" end="00:14:03.040" style="s2">but it&#39;s also if it hurts omni when we</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">don&#39;t do transparency</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.040" end="00:14:07.120" style="s2">right but other than that we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:09.199" style="s2">transparency same with i&#39;m willing to</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.120" end="00:14:12.480" style="s2">break a lot like</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.199" end="00:14:13.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t need fun 24 7 but if i&#39;m showing</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.480" end="00:14:16.000" style="s2">up consistently and there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.920" end="00:14:17.760" style="s2">drama and there&#39;s a lot of conflict and</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.000" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like zero fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.760" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">i&#39;m not gonna keep coming and i know</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:22.800" style="s2">therefore whatever we&#39;re doing isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.160" style="s2">continually happen not because i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.800" end="00:14:26.079" style="s2">there because everyone&#39;s gonna not be</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.160" end="00:14:28.880" style="s2">there right if it&#39;s not fun</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.079" end="00:14:29.360" style="s2">so those are just my to me effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.880" end="00:14:32.079" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.360" end="00:14:33.440" style="s2">is is one of the top more because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.079" end="00:14:35.600" style="s2">kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.440" end="00:14:37.120" style="s2">gray area where like we talked about you</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.600" end="00:14:39.600" style="s2">know if something is omnivore and the</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.120" end="00:14:41.920" style="s2">goal is to never</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.600" end="00:14:44.079" style="s2">cause harm well what if you&#39;re causing</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.920" end="00:14:45.600" style="s2">less harm than the current alternative</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.079" end="00:14:48.160" style="s2">you&#39;re still causing harm but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.600" end="00:14:50.240" style="s2">lessening it yeah i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.160" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">i&#39;m just wondering whether effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.240" end="00:14:54.800" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:57.120" style="s2">kind of a summary of omni-whim</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.800" end="00:14:58.639" style="s2">and sustainability resistance resilience</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.120" end="00:15:01.519" style="s2">long-term thinking i mean can we</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.639" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">i think effectiveness it&#39;s more the</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.519" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">trade-off between the values</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">in a way right like it&#39;s if if we looked</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:12.560" style="s2">at all of the values we&#39;re saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">it really improves these values it kind</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.560" end="00:15:15.760" style="s2">of hurts this value a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:17.360" style="s2">but much less than we&#39;re improving the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.760" end="00:15:18.720" style="s2">other ones to me that</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.360" end="00:15:20.720" style="s2">that&#39;s okay because it&#39;s moving things</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.720" end="00:15:22.079" style="s2">forward i mean it might depend on what</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.720" end="00:15:24.880" style="s2">these specifics are</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.079" end="00:15:26.160" style="s2">but overall that&#39;s i guess what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.880" end="00:15:28.320" style="s2">trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.160" end="00:15:30.000" style="s2">and maybe it&#39;s not a value maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.320" end="00:15:34.000" style="s2">ends up being a strategy or a tactic</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.000" end="00:15:35.920" style="s2">or something but to me like really</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.000" end="00:15:37.920" style="s2">mec is one of the best examples of sort</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.920" end="00:15:39.920" style="s2">of why that shows or you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.920" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">any group where you you you&#39;re well</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.920" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">intentioned</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.800" style="s2">but you&#39;re so dogmatic that like you</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">actually end up hurting your cause</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.800" end="00:15:48.000" style="s2">because you can&#39;t move forward</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.399" end="00:15:51.920" style="s2">yeah let me just kind of pull</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">effectiveness out</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.920" end="00:15:58.079" style="s2">sure to a whole discussion because</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:16:00.160" style="s2">i think you&#39;re right it&#39;s it it</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.079" end="00:16:02.000" style="s2">has something to do with the values but</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.160" end="00:16:03.360" style="s2">it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.000" end="00:16:05.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like how strict we are with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.360" end="00:16:06.839" style="s2">values not necessarily value itself kind</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.360" end="00:16:09.680" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.839" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">yeah so let&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.680" end="00:16:14.800" style="s2">kind of pull it out maybe discuss that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.560" style="s2">separately</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.800" end="00:16:18.639" style="s2">so for me individual sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.560" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">although i know unders i understand now</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.639" end="00:16:23.519" style="s2">how it is in game b and i think that i</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:25.360" style="s2">embody it quite well</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.519" end="00:16:27.279" style="s2">i always get triggered by it because it</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.360" end="00:16:29.279" style="s2">makes me think that i have to garden and</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.279" end="00:16:29.920" style="s2">i have to do everything on my own and</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.279" end="00:16:31.839" style="s2">part of this</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.920" end="00:16:33.120" style="s2">is that we&#39;re better together yes you</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.839" end="00:16:34.560" style="s2">don&#39;t ever have to pass</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.120" end="00:16:37.360" style="s2">you don&#39;t ever have to give up your</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.560" end="00:16:39.040" style="s2">sovereignty but that doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.360" end="00:16:41.040" style="s2">you&#39;re an island like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.040" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">difference between</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.040" end="00:16:44.079" style="s2">individuals yeah because when i was</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:45.720" style="s2">thinking about this i</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.079" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">also kind of have a value of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.720" end="00:16:49.600" style="s2">responsibility which is even</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">harsher way of saying what you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.600" end="00:16:54.079" style="s2">want but you</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">are even more triggering right um and i</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.079" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">don&#39;t really want that to be</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">a obligation but i want it to be a skill</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:04.959" style="s2">that we have right so i couldn&#39;t figure</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">out how to say that but i never really</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.959" end="00:17:08.079" style="s2">thought of</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:10.799" style="s2">individual sovereignty being triggering</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.079" end="00:17:13.520" style="s2">in that way but so but i understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.799" end="00:17:14.480" style="s2">the concern um and i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.520" end="00:17:16.880" style="s2">technically does</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.480" end="00:17:18.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t omni does omni women include</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:22.000" style="s2">individual sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.319" end="00:17:24.319" style="s2">i mean i think it does yeah i think much</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.000" end="00:17:25.679" style="s2">like also the omni-win values needing to</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.319" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">be played off each other and we have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.679" end="00:17:28.640" style="s2">figure out as we go is this omni one is</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:30.400" style="s2">a little bit effective</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.640" end="00:17:32.559" style="s2">that&#39;s also the case with individual</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.400" end="00:17:34.400" style="s2">sovereignty of like</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.559" end="00:17:36.240" style="s2">are you more sovereign this year than</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.400" end="00:17:37.760" style="s2">you were last year awesome</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.240" end="00:17:39.760" style="s2">not that you know what i mean like</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.760" end="00:17:41.600" style="s2">arbitrary branch because i can be more</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.760" end="00:17:42.960" style="s2">sovereign than i am now i just am never</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:44.559" style="s2">going to be able to live off the land</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.960" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">all by myself</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.559" end="00:17:47.919" style="s2">those are very different i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:49.919" style="s2">sovereignty goes</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.919" end="00:17:51.760" style="s2">up to the win list like i think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.919" end="00:17:55.919" style="s2">one of the wins is if we improve</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.760" end="00:17:58.000" style="s2">the sovereignty of the people involved</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.919" end="00:17:59.200" style="s2">that is um one of the people involved in</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.000" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">the meta community discussion we were</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.200" end="00:18:03.520" style="s2">having on mondays</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:04.880" style="s2">one has that as um felice i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.520" end="00:18:06.400" style="s2">remember the name of the rest of their</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.880" end="00:18:08.559" style="s2">the name of their company they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.400" end="00:18:09.840" style="s2">their group but that&#39;s what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.559" end="00:18:11.039" style="s2">that&#39;s their whole point of their</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.840" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">community is to help people with their</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.039" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">sovereignty like you are as a parent to</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.000" style="s2">help your kid become independent</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:17.360" style="s2">i really like that as as how he explains</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.000" end="00:18:19.120" style="s2">it and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.360" end="00:18:20.799" style="s2">down with that level of sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.120" end="00:18:21.919" style="s2">whenever you are can we get can we</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.799" end="00:18:23.360" style="s2">improve it for you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.919" end="00:18:25.039" style="s2">in a way that works for you what would</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.360" end="00:18:27.039" style="s2">get you more sovereign</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.039" end="00:18:29.440" style="s2">right yeah it&#39;s all kind of freedom</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.039" end="00:18:31.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.440" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">and the right to control your destiny as</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.919" end="00:18:34.720" style="s2">much as possible</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.120" end="00:18:38.880" style="s2">um do we think that the number three is</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.360" end="00:18:40.320" style="s2">also contained in omni one the</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.880" end="00:18:42.480" style="s2">sustainability the resilience</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.320" end="00:18:44.640" style="s2">i was yeah i&#39;m thinking that because we</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.480" end="00:18:48.000" style="s2">i think we do have we have long term</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.640" end="00:18:50.640" style="s2">up here already yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.000" end="00:18:51.360" style="s2">i think we said that like environment is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.640" end="00:18:54.000" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.360" end="00:18:54.880" style="s2">needed for being so that was kind of in</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.000" end="00:18:56.559" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.880" end="00:18:57.919" style="s2">the only yeah the only reason i might</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.559" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">want to separate them out is that</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.919" end="00:19:06.080" style="s2">in omniwin it&#39;s the long-term</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">benefits of the of the individuals</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.080" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">beings when we&#39;re here it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:15.760" style="s2">long-term sustainability of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:18.320" style="s2">um of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.760" end="00:19:19.679" style="s2">organization itself okay so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.320" end="00:19:20.480" style="s2">only reason why i think it might be a</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.679" end="00:19:22.480" style="s2">little bit different</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.480" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">although now i&#39;m thinking i want to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.480" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">sure that we would never</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.960" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">sacrifice any of the other values in</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:33.440" style="s2">order to get</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">sustainability because if if suddenly we</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.440" end="00:19:37.919" style="s2">don&#39;t need this organization</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:40.080" style="s2">we need to shut it down right you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.919" end="00:19:42.080" style="s2">what i&#39;m saying if it does this job</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.080" end="00:19:43.360" style="s2">if we cure you know if the organization</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.080" end="00:19:46.400" style="s2">was for curing</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.360" end="00:19:48.799" style="s2">hunger we shouldn&#39;t keep people starving</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.400" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">so we can keep serving them right</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.799" end="00:19:55.280" style="s2">which some organizations</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:56.799" style="s2">and accidentally are doing that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.280" end="00:19:58.080" style="s2">right they&#39;re not solving the core</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.799" end="00:19:59.520" style="s2">problem because they would be out of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.080" end="00:20:01.360" style="s2">job and i don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.520" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">that intentionally but</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.360" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s kind of weird how when the</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:06.480" style="s2">incentives are that way you accidentally</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:08.960" style="s2">perpetuate what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.480" end="00:20:09.840" style="s2">solving so i don&#39;t know how to write all</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.960" end="00:20:11.200" style="s2">that down</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.840" end="00:20:12.720" style="s2">so there&#39;s something coming up because</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.200" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">when you said say the sustainability i</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.720" end="00:20:14.799" style="s2">was actually thinking you were talking</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:17.600" style="s2">about the planet</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.799" end="00:20:19.440" style="s2">and that that i mean that like us making</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.600" end="00:20:20.000" style="s2">sure our planet is taken care of is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.440" end="00:20:22.080" style="s2">priority</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.000" end="00:20:23.039" style="s2">one and then and there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.080" end="00:20:24.720" style="s2">that right if we don&#39;t have an</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.039" end="00:20:26.880" style="s2">earth to work on until we&#39;re in space</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.720" end="00:20:29.280" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of priority one</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.880" end="00:20:31.360" style="s2">not from earth right but i think that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.280" end="00:20:33.360" style="s2">all fits under omni when</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.360" end="00:20:35.360" style="s2">but i think i think we want to call out</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">the organ we want to think long term</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.360" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">also when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.240" style="s2">unless we just want to blanket please</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.760" style="s2">state that the organization itself is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.240" end="00:20:43.760" style="s2">included in omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.760" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">but it&#39;s not in a way because we will</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.760" end="00:20:46.159" style="s2">shut down the organization if it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:47.600" style="s2">longer needed</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.159" end="00:20:49.679" style="s2">right yeah would mention the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.600" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">organization can harm if it helps</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.679" end="00:20:53.200" style="s2">everyone else</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:55.200" style="s2">yeah the the what i&#39;m trying to say is</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.200" end="00:20:57.200" style="s2">the hierarchy of that sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.200" end="00:20:58.000" style="s2">right that there is that earth the earth</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.200" end="00:20:59.840" style="s2">is number one</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.000" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">right like even though we might make</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.840" end="00:21:02.400" style="s2">individual choices that are not going to</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:04.080" style="s2">benefit the earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.400" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">we need the long term to be like okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.080" end="00:21:08.880" style="s2">long term is this gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">and then it&#39;s weird because we need the</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.880" end="00:21:12.159" style="s2">the together tech in order to have the</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:14.080" style="s2">projects in order to</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.159" end="00:21:16.000" style="s2">help the people but it&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.080" end="00:21:18.159" style="s2">people that is next right it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.000" end="00:21:19.200" style="s2">earth people if we&#39;re not serving the</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.159" end="00:21:21.120" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.200" end="00:21:24.000" style="s2">our projects don&#39;t need the help this</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.120" end="00:21:26.320" style="s2">can shut down and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.000" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t know yeah i mean there&#39;s is</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.320" end="00:21:30.559" style="s2">a slight difference between priority of</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:31.679" style="s2">importance and priority of order of</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.559" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">operations</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.679" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">so the people are technically more</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:35.360" style="s2">important because we did have a second</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:37.200" style="s2">earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.360" end="00:21:38.400" style="s2">we&#39;d be okay if something happened to</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.200" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">one but</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.400" end="00:21:43.039" style="s2">you have to work on fixing the earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">first so that the people can survive</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.039" end="00:21:48.400" style="s2">um yeah</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:50.320" style="s2">i think in my case i don&#39;t think that if</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.400" end="00:21:51.280" style="s2">we had a second earth it&#39;s suddenly okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.320" end="00:21:53.280" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.280" end="00:21:54.799" style="s2">say screw this one because i care about</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.280" end="00:21:56.000" style="s2">animals you&#39;re saying if you had to kill</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.799" end="00:21:58.159" style="s2">half the people</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.000" end="00:21:59.679" style="s2">to save the earth you would choose to</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.159" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">move to the second earth</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.679" end="00:22:03.520" style="s2">the it&#39;s just priority of what&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">important the people are actually more</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.520" end="00:22:06.960" style="s2">important but the earth</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.080" style="s2">maybe have to do what you work on first</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.960" end="00:22:09.440" style="s2">to save the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.080" end="00:22:11.280" style="s2">right but you&#39;re doing it for the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.440" end="00:22:12.480" style="s2">you&#39;re not technically doing it for the</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.280" end="00:22:15.600" style="s2">planet you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.480" end="00:22:17.760" style="s2">for the people right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.600" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">yeah if we say beings i&#39;m comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.760" end="00:22:22.159" style="s2">with that because yes</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:22.799" style="s2">not really people although some people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.159" end="00:22:25.840" style="s2">pets are</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.799" end="00:22:26.720" style="s2">people yeah well it&#39;s and that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.840" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.720" end="00:22:30.400" style="s2">thing right like i think people are more</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:32.880" style="s2">than animals but not like infinitely so</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.400" end="00:22:34.320" style="s2">not like you know let all the animals</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.880" end="00:22:37.840" style="s2">die to save one person</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.320" end="00:22:40.240" style="s2">mosquitoes um i i&#39;m fairly certain</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.840" end="00:22:42.080" style="s2">we could kill all actually the</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.240" end="00:22:43.360" style="s2">mosquitoes that feed on humans</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.080" end="00:22:46.559" style="s2">there are a lot of there are some</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.360" end="00:22:51.200" style="s2">mosquitoes that don&#39;t suck blood of</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.559" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">something anyways so that&#39;s complete</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.200" end="00:22:55.840" style="s2">there is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:01.039" style="s2">is that kind of tied to effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.840" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.039" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">really sort of what like either</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:08.159" style="s2">organization is still going to be around</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:10.159" style="s2">it can&#39;t do its job if it&#39;s not that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.159" end="00:23:12.320" style="s2">kind of the main thing i&#39;m after</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.159" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">when i say effectiveness it&#39;s like is it</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.320" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">effective is it doing it is it still</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">going to be here is it fulfilling its</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">purpose</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">um to me that&#39;s kind of all the same</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.080" end="00:23:27.679" style="s2">yeah and yeah and maybe it really isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.559" end="00:23:29.679" style="s2">a value maybe it&#39;s just a strategy</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.679" end="00:23:31.840" style="s2">um because we don&#39;t really care whether</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.679" end="00:23:33.919" style="s2">the organization exists except for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.840" end="00:23:36.880" style="s2">value the organization is buying but the</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.919" end="00:23:37.360" style="s2">the the organization existing itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.880" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.360" end="00:23:40.799" style="s2">a value it&#39;s the value the organization</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:42.799" style="s2">creates right</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.799" end="00:23:45.120" style="s2">so i think this ordering of values makes</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.799" end="00:23:45.520" style="s2">sense because omniwin is first and so is</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.120" end="00:23:46.960" style="s2">law</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.520" end="00:23:48.799" style="s2">and then it&#39;s organizational</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.960" end="00:23:50.000" style="s2">sustainability so like we do need our</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.799" end="00:23:52.480" style="s2">effectiveness we need to still</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.000" end="00:23:53.679" style="s2">be here until it&#39;s no longer omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.480" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">for us to be here</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.679" end="00:23:57.600" style="s2">transparency helps in that right if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.120" style="s2">gonna hurt the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.600" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">effectiveness or it&#39;s gonna hurt the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.120" end="00:24:02.159" style="s2">omni when we don&#39;t do it otherwise we do</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:04.159" style="s2">do it</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.159" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">and fun being you know like yes we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.159" end="00:24:06.240" style="s2">do all of that and have fun but let&#39;s do</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">fun</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.240" end="00:24:10.799" style="s2">like a lot of fun uh you know like i</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:14.159" style="s2">think that</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.799" end="00:24:15.039" style="s2">i like the top four so far transparency</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.159" end="00:24:18.320" style="s2">also seems like</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.039" end="00:24:19.039" style="s2">another one where if we could somehow</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.320" end="00:24:20.640" style="s2">make game b</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.039" end="00:24:22.320" style="s2">and not do it in a transparent way like</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.640" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it would work</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.320" end="00:24:26.880" style="s2">but i think if you could you know wave a</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.799" end="00:24:28.640" style="s2">magic wand and have this organization go</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.880" end="00:24:32.080" style="s2">with all these resources but</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.640" end="00:24:34.159" style="s2">the magic wand wasn&#39;t transparent</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:35.919" style="s2">like there&#39;s still like it kind of to me</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.159" end="00:24:37.360" style="s2">fits a bit in the same group as</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.919" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">wherever we end up putting effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.360" end="00:24:40.240" style="s2">where it&#39;s sort of like that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:41.760" style="s2">the things that we think that we need to</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.240" end="00:24:42.640" style="s2">do to be able to get there to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.760" end="00:24:44.240" style="s2">stay</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.640" end="00:24:46.080" style="s2">you know have the organization stay and</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.240" end="00:24:48.480" style="s2">exist and be trustworthy</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.080" end="00:24:50.159" style="s2">um but to me i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.480" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">value</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.159" end="00:24:55.200" style="s2">yeah i i think i mean we have more time</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:56.720" style="s2">to talk about this but i think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.200" end="00:24:58.799" style="s2">someone needs to kind of sit down and</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.720" end="00:25:01.919" style="s2">take all this in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.799" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">and kind of figure out a structure that</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.919" end="00:25:07.200" style="s2">works because there isn&#39;t a lot of hard</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:08.240" style="s2">and fast rules about what&#39;s a value and</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.200" end="00:25:10.480" style="s2">what&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.240" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">what&#39;s a mission what&#39;s a vision because</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.480" end="00:25:13.360" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">they tend to overlap some and then we</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.360" end="00:25:17.840" style="s2">have like strategies</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:21.039" style="s2">and where you put things is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.840" end="00:25:23.760" style="s2">can flow a bit um but just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.039" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">thinking of a way to</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.760" end="00:25:29.840" style="s2">organize it coherently</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.320" end="00:25:33.600" style="s2">because i don&#39;t even know if these are</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.600" end="00:25:34.880" style="s2">royal</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.600" end="00:25:37.120" style="s2">values i&#39;m trying to think of there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.880" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">another</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.120" end="00:25:43.039" style="s2">we do we do value these things but</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:44.720" style="s2">you know we value the mission and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.039" end="00:25:46.960" style="s2">vision as well yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.720" end="00:25:48.320" style="s2">and i think a lot of them to your point</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.960" end="00:25:49.440" style="s2">a lot of them end up being a combination</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.320" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">of things that we&#39;ve kind of already</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.440" end="00:25:51.760" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:53.360" style="s2">like diversity is kind of a combination</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.760" end="00:25:54.880" style="s2">of omni-win and effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.360" end="00:25:56.480" style="s2">as we&#39;re saying like we want to be nice</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.880" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">to the people and include them we also</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.480" end="00:25:59.200" style="s2">think that we&#39;re going to end up being</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:01.760" style="s2">better off for it</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.200" end="00:26:03.919" style="s2">yeah so i&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a value</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.760" end="00:26:06.480" style="s2">or again a strategy slash</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.919" end="00:26:07.440" style="s2">kind of a part of well if we&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.480" end="00:26:09.120" style="s2">omni</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.440" end="00:26:10.640" style="s2">by definition that involves everyone so</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.120" end="00:26:12.000" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of diverse but then the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.640" end="00:26:14.960" style="s2">strategy is let&#39;s make sure that we</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.000" end="00:26:17.120" style="s2">include those opinions</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.960" end="00:26:19.840" style="s2">and like let&#39;s be honest some of our</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.120" end="00:26:22.799" style="s2">projects are decidedly not diverse</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.840" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s funny i&#39;d i&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.799" end="00:26:25.760" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:27.600" style="s2">in some businesses and they talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.760" end="00:26:29.120" style="s2">lot of times the values do end up being</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.600" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">these kind of like generic things and</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.120" end="00:26:30.559" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:31.360" style="s2">how you know you&#39;re doing it wrong</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.559" end="00:26:33.039" style="s2">because what you&#39;re supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.360" end="00:26:34.799" style="s2">talking about is what&#39;s a unique value</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.039" end="00:26:37.279" style="s2">to your company not</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.799" end="00:26:39.200" style="s2">just the general values of the people in</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.279" end="00:26:41.360" style="s2">but in this case once again</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.200" end="00:26:42.320" style="s2">we&#39;re it&#39;s a first thing it&#39;s a project</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.360" end="00:26:44.480" style="s2">of projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.320" end="00:26:45.679" style="s2">so it&#39;s going to be more generic and</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.480" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.679" end="00:26:51.840" style="s2">also it exists</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">to support kind of this game b</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.840" end="00:26:55.200" style="s2">philosophy so it&#39;s going to include a</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.840" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.200" end="00:26:58.400" style="s2">that so it&#39;s we&#39;re we&#39;re going to end up</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.840" end="00:27:01.039" style="s2">breaking</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.400" end="00:27:02.559" style="s2">that right i think that&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.039" end="00:27:03.840" style="s2">point so there&#39;s sort of the two sides</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.559" end="00:27:05.360" style="s2">to it there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.840" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">organization itself and like how we</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.360" end="00:27:07.840" style="s2">think that it can sort of best</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.760" style="s2">facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.840" end="00:27:11.679" style="s2">what values it does have to have to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.760" end="00:27:13.440" style="s2">effective and for people to trust it</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.679" end="00:27:15.039" style="s2">but i think it also ends up being used</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.440" end="00:27:18.240" style="s2">as like a checklist for</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.039" end="00:27:20.240" style="s2">should we work with that project</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.240" end="00:27:21.440" style="s2">like if it you know agrees with one of</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.240" end="00:27:23.279" style="s2">the values is that good</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.440" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">if it did you know disagrees with all</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.279" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">the values that you know if shell oil</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:29.360" style="s2">shows up and wants to participate but</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">not change any of the ways it operates</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.360" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">probably not going to</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.840" end="00:27:37.679" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m still trying to figure out if</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.480" end="00:27:40.880" style="s2">transparency it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.679" end="00:27:42.240" style="s2">zone value because it&#39;s so integral to</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.880" end="00:27:45.360" style="s2">everything i&#39;m trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.240" end="00:27:47.039" style="s2">and yet it like would i be okay if i</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.360" end="00:27:48.640" style="s2">woke up tomorrow we were living in game</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.039" end="00:27:49.200" style="s2">b but there was no transparency or it</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.640" end="00:27:51.679" style="s2">was like</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.200" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">just internal information to a</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.679" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">absolutely my absolute favorite people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:27:57.520" style="s2">board like board of directors and i</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:27:59.440" style="s2">still need there to be trans like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.520" end="00:28:00.799" style="s2">still no matter how benevolent that</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.440" end="00:28:02.720" style="s2">group is</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.799" end="00:28:04.240" style="s2">and however much i don&#39;t want to touch</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.720" end="00:28:05.520" style="s2">the data and i don&#39;t want to watch all</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.240" end="00:28:10.080" style="s2">of the board meetings</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.520" end="00:28:12.159" style="s2">i want to be able to and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.080" end="00:28:13.120" style="s2">whether that&#39;s just me right in my own</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.159" end="00:28:15.440" style="s2">crap that i can</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.120" end="00:28:16.880" style="s2">like there&#39;s something about</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.440" end="00:28:19.360" style="s2">transparency that gives us</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.880" end="00:28:21.039" style="s2">everything else but as individuals as</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.360" end="00:28:23.919" style="s2">projects and as meta</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.039" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">that it is and yet sometimes it needs to</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.919" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">not be there</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:28.159" style="s2">when it&#39;s going to hurt the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:30.799" style="s2">organizational sustainability before and</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.159" end="00:28:32.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s you know not hurting omni went</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.799" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">or it is hurting omni-win then it needs</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.240" end="00:28:34.399" style="s2">to not be there but otherwise it has to</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:38.159" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.399" end="00:28:40.080" style="s2">that the that it&#39;s um the default</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.159" end="00:28:41.360" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s so easy to be like oh i</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.080" end="00:28:42.799" style="s2">don&#39;t want to put myself out there so</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.360" end="00:28:46.080" style="s2">yeah let&#39;s just do this closed door</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.799" end="00:28:48.799" style="s2">let&#39;s just do this in this way um</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.080" end="00:28:50.640" style="s2">and then it becomes like parent-child</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.799" end="00:28:54.000" style="s2">relationship right like someone who</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.640" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">is a barrier to that information but</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.000" end="00:28:56.799" style="s2">i&#39;m open to it being part of it because</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:58.880" style="s2">i think i hear what you&#39;re saying it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.799" end="00:29:02.080" style="s2">the same as effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.880" end="00:29:05.120" style="s2">but there&#39;s something about it that it</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.080" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">is bigger than effectiveness</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.120" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">because it&#39;s like whether we fail or</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">whether even if we&#39;re horribly</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:12.399" style="s2">ineffective if we&#39;re transparent the</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.480" end="00:29:13.840" style="s2">next ones can learn</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.399" end="00:29:15.760" style="s2">right yeah i think if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.840" end="00:29:16.559" style="s2">technically a value it&#39;s good to have it</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.760" end="00:29:19.039" style="s2">on there because</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.559" end="00:29:20.399" style="s2">people know that&#39;s an expectation what</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.039" end="00:29:22.720" style="s2">if we want to start a separate list like</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.399" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">for strategies</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.720" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">that there&#39;s like you know focusing on</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:27.840" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:29.360" style="s2">effectiveness that might even be a bit</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.840" end="00:29:31.279" style="s2">too broad for strategies but like</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.360" end="00:29:33.279" style="s2">transparency definitely seems like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.279" end="00:29:34.960" style="s2">strategy we&#39;re like okay that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.279" end="00:29:36.000" style="s2">the things that we could do to help this</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.960" end="00:29:38.720" style="s2">there are things that won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.000" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">transparent but overall one of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.720" end="00:29:42.320" style="s2">goals is to have it be as transparent as</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">possible so that people trust us and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.320" end="00:29:46.880" style="s2">that you know if it fails</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">the next group can pick it up etc</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.880" end="00:29:50.880" style="s2">i mean i&#39;m okay with it going under this</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">new beautiful blue effectiveness one</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.880" end="00:29:54.320" style="s2">that it is part of that right that</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:56.480" style="s2">effectiveness is about strategy</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.320" end="00:29:58.159" style="s2">right right so having transparency</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.480" end="00:29:59.039" style="s2">having profitability or resource</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.159" end="00:30:01.039" style="s2">whatever you want</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.039" end="00:30:02.720" style="s2">we have to be able to be in business to</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.039" end="00:30:03.520" style="s2">stay in business while game a is still</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.720" end="00:30:06.320" style="s2">here</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.520" end="00:30:07.520" style="s2">having that you know having people work</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.320" end="00:30:08.960" style="s2">with their passion but what</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.520" end="00:30:10.080" style="s2">jobs need to get done so how are we</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.960" end="00:30:10.640" style="s2">going to get the jobs done that nobody</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.080" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">wants to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.640" end="00:30:14.000" style="s2">right that effectiveness that</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.320" end="00:30:18.320" style="s2">i can talk tech and game b all day if</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:19.279" style="s2">the stuff won&#39;t get because this goes</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.320" end="00:30:20.640" style="s2">more down</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.279" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">it&#39;s really just saving like the final</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.640" end="00:30:23.600" style="s2">value is just going to be on me</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.760" end="00:30:27.600" style="s2">that&#39;s okay took us three weeks to get</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.640" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">there four weeks</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.600" end="00:30:31.600" style="s2">i&#39;m also thinking we&#39;re kind of at our</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:33.760" style="s2">limit of maybe what we can do ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.600" end="00:30:35.120" style="s2">that the rest of like the currencies and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.760" end="00:30:36.080" style="s2">those kind of things would probably be</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.120" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">beneficial to have</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.080" end="00:30:40.000" style="s2">um raymond here either next week or we</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:42.799" style="s2">could go one more week</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.000" end="00:30:44.480" style="s2">without where we&#39;re kind of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.799" end="00:30:45.840" style="s2">figure out the currencies and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.480" end="00:30:49.039" style="s2">figure out that stuff</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.840" end="00:30:51.520" style="s2">maybe based on um</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.039" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">protocol.love right on their website um</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.520" end="00:30:54.480" style="s2">they break down the currencies and so</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.720" style="s2">possibly doing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.480" end="00:30:57.519" style="s2">how are we feeling do we want raymond</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.720" end="00:30:59.760" style="s2">here or</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.519" end="00:31:01.039" style="s2">like for to be the expert in that not</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.760" end="00:31:03.440" style="s2">just one of one of us</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.039" end="00:31:04.559" style="s2">and to be to be here um holding that</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.440" end="00:31:06.720" style="s2">space for that</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.559" end="00:31:08.080" style="s2">or do we want to give us one more week</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.720" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">and it was still half an hour but</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.080" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">i think we could go really either way</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:16.960" style="s2">maybe just see what his availability is</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">um yeah i think we could go down</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.960" end="00:31:21.120" style="s2">further and then um through that</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:24.080" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.120" end="00:31:24.799" style="s2">we&#39;ll be able to come back and kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.080" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">clean these up</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.799" end="00:31:29.360" style="s2">because i think we know what we want we</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:31.279" style="s2">just don&#39;t know how to say it</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.360" end="00:31:33.840" style="s2">yeah we all seem very much in alignment</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.279" end="00:31:34.320" style="s2">with our confusion on exactly how to say</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.840" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.320" end="00:31:39.120" style="s2">like we&#39;re not disagreeing right right</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">horrible transparency</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.120" end="00:31:42.720" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s just kind of how to</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:44.559" style="s2">phrase it now to express it where who</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.720" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">are aligned in the concepts</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.559" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.919" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">do you have anything to add i think</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.480" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">you&#39;re muted</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.360" end="00:31:57.279" style="s2">you are muted you weren&#39;t before but you</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.039" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">are now ah that&#39;s why i</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.279" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">um i&#39;m making noises</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.080" end="00:32:09.200" style="s2">we&#39;re giving everyone the silent</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.200" end="00:32:15.360" style="s2">treatment for the first</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.200" end="00:32:18.559" style="s2">that&#39;s our highest value that&#39;s only one</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.360" end="00:32:20.720" style="s2">so i uh i thought about values uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.559" end="00:32:22.159" style="s2">and i was thinking in slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.720" end="00:32:25.360" style="s2">way um</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.159" end="00:32:28.480" style="s2">the way being more general uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.360" end="00:32:29.679" style="s2">because i kind of i thought that values</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.480" end="00:32:32.799" style="s2">should be</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.679" end="00:32:35.919" style="s2">um very like</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.799" end="00:32:39.760" style="s2">uh the foundation which</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.919" end="00:32:43.440" style="s2">can be really uh philosophically</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.760" end="00:32:46.000" style="s2">simple and the</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.440" end="00:32:46.640" style="s2">values define the mode in which we</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.000" end="00:32:50.240" style="s2">operate</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.640" end="00:32:54.240" style="s2">and uh very high</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.240" end="00:32:57.519" style="s2">uh level abstract well not abstract but</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.240" end="00:33:01.279" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay um the first value uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.519" end="00:33:05.440" style="s2">that i would have although is</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.279" end="00:33:07.600" style="s2">not easy to explain um</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.440" end="00:33:09.519" style="s2">but i was lucky to have it explained</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.600" end="00:33:12.799" style="s2">long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.519" end="00:33:15.919" style="s2">like a long way so uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.799" end="00:33:16.559" style="s2">the most basic value to me uh that</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.919" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">exists</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.559" end="00:33:22.880" style="s2">and from which everything else uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:26.960" style="s2">comes out of is</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.880" end="00:33:30.240" style="s2">the truth basically uh and i know it may</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.960" end="00:33:32.799" style="s2">sound very uh vague and uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.240" end="00:33:34.960" style="s2">an overloaded term but truth as in</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.799" end="00:33:36.880" style="s2">adherence to reality</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.960" end="00:33:38.000" style="s2">and being in touch with reality is like</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.880" end="00:33:40.880" style="s2">the basis</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.000" end="00:33:42.640" style="s2">because without it uh we don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.880" end="00:33:45.919" style="s2">know what omni win wins what</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.640" end="00:33:48.720" style="s2">fun is what uh support us what uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.919" end="00:33:50.320" style="s2">innovation it needs to be grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.720" end="00:33:53.679" style="s2">reality itself</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.320" end="00:33:54.320" style="s2">despite the fact that uh these days</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.679" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.320" end="00:33:57.519" style="s2">tend to think in terms of opinions and</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:01.279" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.519" end="00:34:04.559" style="s2">reality is dependable on uh individual</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.279" end="00:34:05.679" style="s2">uh like window of perception and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.559" end="00:34:09.040" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.679" end="00:34:12.320" style="s2">uh which is true of course obviously and</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.040" end="00:34:15.599" style="s2">then again everything is void anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.320" end="00:34:18.560" style="s2">uh our state of mind is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.599" end="00:34:20.240" style="s2">something we could talk about ad noise</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.560" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.240" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s a fine subject to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">but still</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">um there is a consensual reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:32.560" style="s2">in which we all live and which we all</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.320" end="00:34:35.839" style="s2">create together</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.560" end="00:34:37.839" style="s2">for me that&#39;s a fact and um</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.839" end="00:34:39.119" style="s2">opinions exist and different points of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.839" end="00:34:42.879" style="s2">view obviously exist</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.119" end="00:34:44.320" style="s2">and uh they all come together to create</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.879" end="00:34:47.520" style="s2">this one reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.320" end="00:34:50.480" style="s2">and this one reality is actually real</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.520" end="00:34:51.359" style="s2">like physically real in some sense and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.480" end="00:34:54.560" style="s2">the sense is</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.359" end="00:34:57.280" style="s2">important enough for me to put truth and</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.560" end="00:34:58.320" style="s2">adherence to reality at the first place</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.280" end="00:35:00.480" style="s2">and from that</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.320" end="00:35:03.280" style="s2">like everything else everything else</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.480" end="00:35:05.860" style="s2">depends actually on reality existing</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.280" end="00:35:07.200" style="s2">so that&#39;s my like um</p>

<p begin="00:35:07.200" end="00:35:15.520" style="s2">yeah and because uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.720" end="00:35:19.200" style="s2">again reality is the like highest um</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.520" end="00:35:22.720" style="s2">it&#39;s not judgmental but it&#39;s the um</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.200" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">adherence to reality is also uh like</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.720" end="00:35:27.680" style="s2">um what gives you um</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.079" end="00:35:34.720" style="s2">it&#39;s the ultimate uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:37.359" style="s2">uh what&#39;s the word um</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.720" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">that&#39;s why we say things like reality</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:45.520" style="s2">if something is uh like far away from</p>

<p begin="00:35:45.520" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">fail and sometimes no one knows why</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:53.200" style="s2">something failed but</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:55.680" style="s2">the reason could be that it was unglued</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.200" end="00:35:57.200" style="s2">disconnected from reality that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.680" end="00:36:00.560" style="s2">expression we use</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.200" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">and yeah it&#39;s just important</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.560" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">and um</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.920" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">and what irritates us if i may say us</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.760" end="00:36:16.960" style="s2">in game a is that is it is so</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">game a is so full of and</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.960" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">advertisement and it seems like uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:28.000" style="s2">yeah the basic truth is so um</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:31.680" style="s2">undervalued these days and it&#39;s just so</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.000" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">boring and so so tedious and</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.680" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">um for me and i just realized that today</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:41.760" style="s2">gaming is like a search for</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:43.599" style="s2">more reality and being more grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.760" end="00:36:45.599" style="s2">what we have</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.599" end="00:36:46.880" style="s2">yeah so i have a lot of thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.599" end="00:36:47.839" style="s2">but i wonder if you want to go ahead and</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.880" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">get</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.839" end="00:36:51.200" style="s2">are there any other values that you want</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:53.920" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.200" end="00:36:56.240" style="s2">suggest that build on that or is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.920" end="00:36:58.720" style="s2">the main thing you want to add</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.240" end="00:36:59.440" style="s2">that was the main thing and then i was</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.720" end="00:37:01.359" style="s2">going to</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.440" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">no i wasn&#39;t going to say anything about</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.359" end="00:37:06.480" style="s2">uh our</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:09.440" style="s2">as species our place on</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.480" end="00:37:10.960" style="s2">the planet and in biosphere but that</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.440" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">would be something i would</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.960" end="00:37:14.960" style="s2">i could talk about for long so yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:18.160" style="s2">let&#39;s leave it</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.960" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">uh i mean i agree that truth is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.160" end="00:37:22.880" style="s2">the core</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:27.599" style="s2">of everything um</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.880" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">and that that kind of um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.599" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">you know the the the more accurate you</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:34.160" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">in your judgment of reality</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.160" end="00:37:38.480" style="s2">the better things will be um</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.040" end="00:37:42.320" style="s2">the more accurate their interpretation</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.800" end="00:37:42.640" style="s2">of reality be the better things would be</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.320" end="00:37:45.599" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.640" end="00:37:48.240" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know if that fits as a value</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.599" end="00:37:50.720" style="s2">of the organization itself</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.240" end="00:37:51.920" style="s2">because i don&#39;t think the organization</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.720" end="00:37:55.200" style="s2">will be</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.920" end="00:37:58.400" style="s2">seeking to clarify</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.200" end="00:38:00.000" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.400" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">i mean that that&#39;s part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.000" end="00:38:03.599" style="s2">score project i think adrian would say</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:07.359" style="s2">that&#39;s part of wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.599" end="00:38:09.520" style="s2">um but i don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.359" end="00:38:11.520" style="s2">this that this project that we would get</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.520" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">in go down to that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.520" end="00:38:18.400" style="s2">depth is my opinion i don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:18.880" style="s2">everyone else thinks well it&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.400" end="00:38:21.920" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.880" end="00:38:23.839" style="s2">with um radica i both am like yes the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.920" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">truth is very important adherence to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.839" end="00:38:31.359" style="s2">reality and at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">that is the biggest existential</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.359" end="00:38:36.000" style="s2">question right like what is true and</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:37.760" style="s2">what does that mean is it collective</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.000" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">truth and then i have to toe the line</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.760" end="00:38:40.880" style="s2">is it is it scientific truth like right</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:43.119" style="s2">now with the</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.880" end="00:38:45.200" style="s2">with the virus the pandemic there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.119" end="00:38:46.720" style="s2">truth to how it functions</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.200" end="00:38:47.839" style="s2">we&#39;ve got no say in it it doesn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.720" end="00:38:49.200" style="s2">about our democracy it doesn&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.839" end="00:38:51.119" style="s2">about anything it&#39;s a virus</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.200" end="00:38:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s just doing what it&#39;s doing and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.119" end="00:38:53.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a truth to how it does right</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.480" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.040" end="00:38:57.440" style="s2">its ingestion period it&#39;s incubation</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">period how many people you infect all of</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.440" end="00:39:00.480" style="s2">that is just is what it is</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">and then there&#39;s like people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.480" end="00:39:04.320" style="s2">interpretation of that and the doctors</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:05.920" style="s2">and like the experts truth and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.320" end="00:39:07.680" style="s2">that can change</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.920" end="00:39:10.079" style="s2">yet the virus isn&#39;t changing the virus</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.680" end="00:39:12.240" style="s2">is also changing but its truth isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.079" end="00:39:13.839" style="s2">right and so that is part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.240" end="00:39:15.760" style="s2">like looking at things like that whereas</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.839" end="00:39:17.520" style="s2">then you have the less truth right where</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.760" end="00:39:19.680" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.520" end="00:39:20.720" style="s2">black lives matter and and all and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.680" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">like if you question</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.720" end="00:39:24.960" style="s2">anything about that you&#39;re the devil</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">right and it&#39;s like that&#39;s not a truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.960" end="00:39:28.400" style="s2">i&#39;m trying to find more truth here</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:30.880" style="s2">more truth and it you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.400" end="00:39:32.720" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s breaking it and so holding it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.880" end="00:39:35.280" style="s2">as just like holding sovereignty or</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.720" end="00:39:37.200" style="s2">something as your number one value</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.280" end="00:39:38.640" style="s2">is powerful and then how do you actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.200" end="00:39:41.040" style="s2">live that out helps you in all the other</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.640" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">values</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.040" end="00:39:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s just a little more concrete than</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:45.839" style="s2">omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.240" end="00:39:47.200" style="s2">likes having sovereign dear truth at</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.839" end="00:39:48.560" style="s2">that level but the fact that there are</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.200" end="00:39:50.000" style="s2">projects that deal with it i think are</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.560" end="00:39:53.440" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.000" end="00:39:54.960" style="s2">but that was my thinking i think truth</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.440" end="00:39:56.560" style="s2">and transparency are sort of you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.960" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">end up being two sides of the same</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.560" end="00:39:59.680" style="s2">thing where if you&#39;re you know but i</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:01.040" style="s2">think part of it is truth is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.680" end="00:40:02.320" style="s2">implied</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.040" end="00:40:03.599" style="s2">where it&#39;s like if we&#39;re saying that</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.320" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">we&#39;re going to do these things well if</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.599" end="00:40:07.599" style="s2">you say that you&#39;re telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.760" style="s2">then i guess two two two two options</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.599" end="00:40:11.680" style="s2">exist that you are telling the the truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.760" end="00:40:13.680" style="s2">that that you&#39;re not telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.680" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">or that you&#39;re lying but then of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.680" end="00:40:15.599" style="s2">you&#39;re going to lie that you&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:17.440" style="s2">the truth because then what&#39;s the point</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.599" end="00:40:20.079" style="s2">of the lie otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.440" end="00:40:20.800" style="s2">um so i think it it is important i think</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.079" end="00:40:24.160" style="s2">it might end up</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.800" end="00:40:26.640" style="s2">sort of being like somehow in the same</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.160" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">grouping as transparency and truth but</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.640" end="00:40:30.400" style="s2">then overall</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:31.520" style="s2">everything that we&#39;re putting here we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.400" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">implying is true</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.520" end="00:40:34.720" style="s2">we&#39;re saying you know that i&#39;m doing is</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:36.240" style="s2">important then we&#39;ll do it and that you</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.720" end="00:40:38.319" style="s2">know like we&#39;re not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.240" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">operating on a profit motive and that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.319" end="00:40:42.160" style="s2">going to be fun and that they will</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">so support each other in theory that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.160" end="00:40:44.800" style="s2">why we&#39;re doing all this because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:46.000" style="s2">saying that this is true and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.800" end="00:40:48.560" style="s2">we&#39;re going to operate</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.000" end="00:40:49.839" style="s2">but if it&#39;s not true personally i</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.560" end="00:40:53.280" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t trust it more just because they</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.839" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">said that truth was a value</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.280" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">if if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.240" end="00:41:03.920" style="s2">and that is also i don&#39;t know i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.079" end="00:41:05.599" style="s2">reminded of daniel schwachtenberger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.920" end="00:41:06.079" style="s2">boron sense making where he does break</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.599" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.079" end="00:41:09.280" style="s2">the truthfulness and all of all of that</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.480" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">information</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.280" end="00:41:16.240" style="s2">and doing it in that way but then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.000" end="00:41:17.599" style="s2">sorry whoever was talking go ahead it is</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.240" end="00:41:21.520" style="s2">this complicated so</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.599" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">there are layers to the true end</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.520" end="00:41:25.520" style="s2">and yeah transparency is a part of it it</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:27.760" style="s2">was just</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.520" end="00:41:28.800" style="s2">it&#39;s something that struck me uh when</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.760" end="00:41:31.760" style="s2">you are talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.800" end="00:41:32.640" style="s2">uh transparency what it is exactly that</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.760" end="00:41:36.319" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.640" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">we so uh we like so much about it</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.319" end="00:41:43.440" style="s2">uh and i just realized it might be</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:46.160" style="s2">um at least partially that transparency</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.440" end="00:41:46.560" style="s2">brings you closer to understanding uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.160" end="00:41:50.079" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.560" end="00:41:50.720" style="s2">like reality behind organization for</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.079" end="00:41:53.440" style="s2">example</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.720" end="00:41:54.240" style="s2">and what really is going on inside and</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.440" end="00:41:56.960" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.240" end="00:41:57.520" style="s2">how people do stuff and yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.960" end="00:42:00.800" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.520" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">so transparency is definitely part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.800" end="00:42:03.839" style="s2">the truth</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.599" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">anything else you wanted to add radicals</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:16.400" style="s2">potential values or for discussion</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:19.680" style="s2">um they&#39;re pretty good</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.400" end="00:42:21.280" style="s2">not really i think that&#39;s that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.680" end="00:42:24.240" style="s2">i think yeah so i think we should</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.280" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">probably sit with these um</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.240" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">things for a while and kind of reconvene</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.240" style="s2">i mean we could talk we have another 15</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:31.040" style="s2">minutes we&#39;ve talked about this or</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.240" end="00:42:33.839" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.040" end="00:42:34.480" style="s2">but i i don&#39;t know anything else to add</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.839" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">but i know i</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.480" end="00:42:38.160" style="s2">i need to do i need to look over this</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:41.520" style="s2">list let it marinate</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.160" end="00:42:43.359" style="s2">in the brain yeah i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.520" end="00:42:44.720" style="s2">there are at least a couple more values</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.359" end="00:42:45.920" style="s2">that we could probably move down to the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.720" end="00:42:48.880" style="s2">effectiveness list</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.920" end="00:42:49.920" style="s2">like the small the small experiments</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.880" end="00:42:51.119" style="s2">iterations</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.920" end="00:42:52.319" style="s2">that seems like something that that</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.119" end="00:42:53.760" style="s2">we&#39;re saying we think that this will</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.319" end="00:42:56.000" style="s2">help but</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.760" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">you know if it doesn&#39;t or we find a</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.000" end="00:42:59.599" style="s2">better way than we would</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:01.280" style="s2">just just you know go forward with</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.599" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">anything that works</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.280" end="00:43:03.599" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.119" end="00:43:08.319" style="s2">shares resources and infrastructure i</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.800" end="00:43:12.079" style="s2">mean i think that&#39;s pretty core i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.319" end="00:43:14.720" style="s2">sure if it&#39;s a value but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.079" end="00:43:15.920" style="s2">yeah yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.720" end="00:43:16.720" style="s2">the brainstorming i don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.920" end="00:43:19.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.720" end="00:43:20.160" style="s2">a lot of these seem like strategies like</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.440" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">things that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.160" end="00:43:24.079" style="s2">we want to use to achieve our values and</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:24.800" style="s2">admissions and things that we think will</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.079" end="00:43:28.000" style="s2">help</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.800" end="00:43:29.520" style="s2">but not necessarily values in themselves</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.000" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">i mean i guess really the point of again</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.520" end="00:43:34.560" style="s2">having the value system is to know</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.880" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">if it&#39;s not doing one we probably</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.560" end="00:43:37.440" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be doing it unless there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:38.960" style="s2">really really good reason</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.440" end="00:43:40.240" style="s2">then going on to number two right and of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.960" end="00:43:41.520" style="s2">course omni when we&#39;ve already broken</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.240" end="00:43:43.359" style="s2">that down last week</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.520" end="00:43:45.599" style="s2">is to have that structure so that even</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.359" end="00:43:46.240" style="s2">if my ego&#39;s involved and my emotions are</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.599" end="00:43:48.400" style="s2">involved</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.240" end="00:43:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s like right but it broke one it has</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.400" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">nothing to do with you</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.240" end="00:43:53.839" style="s2">it&#39;s you know that like okay jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get to create a nominee when mlm</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.839" end="00:43:56.240" style="s2">because mlms are not on the win or</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.240" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">it happens to me right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:04.160" style="s2">the level and fun be number three is</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:05.440" style="s2">like well if it&#39;s helping organizational</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.160" end="00:44:08.319" style="s2">sustainability insomnia</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.440" end="00:44:09.280" style="s2">then then fun needs to happen i&#39;ll force</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.319" end="00:44:11.359" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.280" end="00:44:12.800" style="s2">right but like if we&#39;re omni when and or</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.359" end="00:44:14.640" style="s2">helping the organization</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.800" end="00:44:16.480" style="s2">survive it doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.640" end="00:44:23.280" style="s2">fun it should be if we can make it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.480" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">but yeah i think that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.280" end="00:44:26.560" style="s2">mutual support</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.440" end="00:44:31.680" style="s2">i think that kind of combines with the</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.520" end="00:44:34.480" style="s2">like multiple learning styles</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.680" end="00:44:34.960" style="s2">project competition shared resources</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.480" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">like those</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.960" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">sort of all seem like the same</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.319" end="00:44:42.079" style="s2">thing it also seemed kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:43.520" style="s2">strategy like that one of our strategies</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.079" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">for helping these projects is that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.520" end="00:44:45.920" style="s2">going to work together and give them an</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:47.920" style="s2">ecosystem of you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.920" end="00:44:49.270" style="s2">shared resources and data and whatever</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.920" end="00:44:51.280" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.270" end="00:44:53.359" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.280" end="00:44:54.640" style="s2">to help move that forward so yeah i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.359" end="00:44:57.079" style="s2">wondering if also</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.640" end="00:45:00.880" style="s2">values are things kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.079" end="00:45:04.000" style="s2">expectations for members</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.880" end="00:45:07.440" style="s2">in in the dallas startup ecosystem we</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.000" end="00:45:09.839" style="s2">have a give before you get um</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.440" end="00:45:11.280" style="s2">value so you&#39;re not supposed to come in</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.839" end="00:45:12.480" style="s2">and just start promoting your stuff</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:13.599" style="s2">you&#39;re supposed to come and say how can</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.480" end="00:45:16.839" style="s2">i help first and then</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.599" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">after a while um so i don&#39;t know if if</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.839" end="00:45:19.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.000" end="00:45:22.000" style="s2">that&#39;s an interesting value to think i</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:24.960" style="s2">don&#39;t know if that&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.000" end="00:45:26.720" style="s2">barbarian but or you know forceful</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.960" end="00:45:29.520" style="s2">sounds kind of like a</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.720" end="00:45:30.000" style="s2">strategy but also value at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.520" end="00:45:33.440" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:34.880" style="s2">also thinking like</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.440" end="00:45:36.319" style="s2">i guess you&#39;ll almost always have to</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.880" end="00:45:37.760" style="s2">break it in the beginning it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.319" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">you know don&#39;t speak until you&#39;re spoken</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.760" end="00:45:40.880" style="s2">to well then who starts speaking</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.960" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">well yeah that&#39;s that is that is a</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.720" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:48.079" style="s2">uh although it&#39;s we have four projects</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:49.680" style="s2">that we&#39;re all working on so really it&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.079" end="00:45:50.880" style="s2">be like come help us on one of them</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.680" end="00:45:52.960" style="s2">before we help you</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.880" end="00:45:54.480" style="s2">but i think that&#39;s not really our ethos</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.960" end="00:45:56.160" style="s2">that isn&#39;t really how we</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.480" end="00:45:58.640" style="s2">roll it&#39;s like how can we help you move</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.160" end="00:46:01.359" style="s2">forward we&#39;re already helping each other</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.640" end="00:46:02.000" style="s2">i liked what you um posted bentley in</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.359" end="00:46:04.480" style="s2">the game b</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.000" end="00:46:05.599" style="s2">projects the idea of having a secondary</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.480" end="00:46:07.440" style="s2">project</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.599" end="00:46:08.960" style="s2">um as one that you&#39;re supporting and i</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.440" end="00:46:10.160" style="s2">love that idea one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.960" end="00:46:11.280" style="s2">comes up to me although i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.160" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">high value</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.280" end="00:46:14.960" style="s2">that i hold the diversity is an</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:17.520" style="s2">effectiveness thing</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.960" end="00:46:19.040" style="s2">diversity as a placeholder like we want</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.520" end="00:46:21.520" style="s2">to say we&#39;re diverse</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.040" end="00:46:22.400" style="s2">is all game a and like it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.520" end="00:46:24.640" style="s2">of the malware</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.400" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">whereas the point of our diversity is to</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.640" end="00:46:28.800" style="s2">be more effective</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:30.240" style="s2">right it&#39;s like if we allow for</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.800" end="00:46:31.839" style="s2">different learning styles</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.240" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">different learning styles are going to</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.839" end="00:46:36.000" style="s2">come if we allow for the diversity of</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:38.400" style="s2">the individuals present</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.000" end="00:46:41.680" style="s2">we get what they&#39;re here to give whereas</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.400" end="00:46:43.520" style="s2">if we&#39;re using it as that token</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.680" end="00:46:44.640" style="s2">diversity then it breaks it and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.520" end="00:46:45.680" style="s2">anyway that&#39;s just what&#39;s kind of when i</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.640" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">was reading through the list again is</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.680" end="00:46:48.480" style="s2">whether diversity could be moved to</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:52.079" style="s2">effectiveness but</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.480" end="00:46:54.240" style="s2">i don&#39;t know yeah i i think that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.079" end="00:46:55.760" style="s2">i think that diversity is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.240" end="00:46:57.520" style="s2">combination of</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.760" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">it&#39;s part omni one and part the effect</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.520" end="00:47:00.880" style="s2">of this depends like</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:02.480" style="s2">we&#39;re being diverse to you know sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.880" end="00:47:03.280" style="s2">be nice into to make sure that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.480" end="00:47:06.480" style="s2">including as</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.280" end="00:47:08.400" style="s2">as many you know diverse groups in the</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.480" end="00:47:10.000" style="s2">you know the grouping of everyone which</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.400" end="00:47:12.240" style="s2">should be fairly easy um</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.000" end="00:47:13.520" style="s2">but then there&#39;s also like we think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.240" end="00:47:15.839" style="s2">going to be better for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.520" end="00:47:17.280" style="s2">actual project and projects is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.839" end="00:47:18.800" style="s2">going to get more</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.280" end="00:47:20.559" style="s2">insights and you know things that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.800" end="00:47:22.960" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have learned if it was just</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.559" end="00:47:25.520" style="s2">12 white guys and it&#39;s also very much</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.960" end="00:47:28.000" style="s2">part of like and if it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.520" end="00:47:29.280" style="s2">diversity can go at least in the group</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.000" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">right like if you&#39;re gonna be more</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.280" end="00:47:33.920" style="s2">effective as a group of five white guys</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:35.920" style="s2">having your conversation then for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.920" end="00:47:38.000" style="s2">know what i mean forced visual diversity</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.920" end="00:47:40.000" style="s2">yeah go be a bunch of white guys i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.000" end="00:47:41.680" style="s2">rather be you guys be at that table so i</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.000" end="00:47:43.359" style="s2">can be at this one anyway</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.680" end="00:47:45.520" style="s2">but if it&#39;s hurting effectiveness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.359" end="00:47:47.359" style="s2">not forced in that way and so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.520" end="00:47:50.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.359" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">like that and to me i think that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.240" end="00:47:52.880" style="s2">people you get</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.040" end="00:47:56.640" style="s2">i think it&#39;s absolutely like an</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.559" end="00:47:58.800" style="s2">important thing to try to say like hey</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.640" end="00:48:00.880" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just to show up and word</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.800" end="00:48:03.440" style="s2">vomit your sales pitch and then</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.880" end="00:48:05.040" style="s2">stop contributing but there might be</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.440" end="00:48:06.160" style="s2">some where like a person shows up</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.040" end="00:48:07.920" style="s2">and we&#39;re all really like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.160" end="00:48:09.440" style="s2">really important project i don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.920" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">care if that person contributes i just</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.440" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">want to see that project</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:12.720" style="s2">over</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.599" end="00:48:18.400" style="s2">yeah and in the case it is go bentley i</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.920" end="00:48:20.400" style="s2">was just going to say i think</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.400" end="00:48:22.160" style="s2">there&#39;s naturally some overlap in these</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.400" end="00:48:24.000" style="s2">terms and the way they&#39;re generally used</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:25.920" style="s2">but i think in an exercise like this</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.000" end="00:48:28.160" style="s2">they&#39;re a little bit more specific</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.920" end="00:48:29.760" style="s2">so i think part of our problem is that</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.160" end="00:48:30.800" style="s2">we&#39;re using the more general terms when</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.760" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">we&#39;re thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.800" end="00:48:34.480" style="s2">so i think it might be good to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">look up</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.480" end="00:48:38.559" style="s2">how they do this when they do this for</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:41.599" style="s2">game a businesses</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.559" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">um because i think strategy</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.599" end="00:48:46.720" style="s2">is also supposed to be so those tactics</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:49.040" style="s2">and then their strategy</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.720" end="00:48:50.640" style="s2">i think strategies may even generally be</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.040" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">temporary</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.640" end="00:48:54.319" style="s2">so i think i think some of these things</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:57.200" style="s2">we should probably</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.319" end="00:48:57.839" style="s2">still keep under values especially since</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.200" end="00:48:59.440" style="s2">in some</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.839" end="00:49:01.119" style="s2">when we&#39;re doing like jubilee was saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.440" end="00:49:03.680" style="s2">when we&#39;re choosing</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.119" end="00:49:05.280" style="s2">when they conflict and we need to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.680" end="00:49:08.160" style="s2">the order they have to all be in one</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.280" end="00:49:12.800" style="s2">list so we know the the proper order</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.160" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">um and so that&#39;s why i like</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.800" end="00:49:16.640" style="s2">having transparently mixed transparency</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:18.079" style="s2">mixed in with the other values because</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.640" end="00:49:21.200" style="s2">we want to know</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.079" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">we&#39;re not going to limit</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.200" end="00:49:25.119" style="s2">the alumni when or the organization&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">sustainability</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.119" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">for transparency</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:34.640" style="s2">so it&#39;s good to have them in a lace</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">rather than two separate lists</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.640" end="00:49:36.960" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.440" end="00:49:42.960" style="s2">i think strategies so that the terms i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.400" end="00:49:45.599" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.960" end="00:49:47.200" style="s2">yeah i just may need to get some clarity</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.599" end="00:49:49.440" style="s2">on</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.200" end="00:49:51.520" style="s2">what we&#39;re doing it may also be that</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.440" end="00:49:52.960" style="s2">like there&#39;s a reason that values what</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.520" end="00:49:55.599" style="s2">wasn&#39;t here in that</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.960" end="00:49:57.440" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of meant to be encapsulated by</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">the vision and the mission</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.440" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">but i do like sort of having this as a</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">separate thought experiment</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:05.920" style="s2">um where i think in the end like all of</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:07.440" style="s2">our values should be represented</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.920" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">somewhere in the mission</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.440" end="00:50:11.280" style="s2">and the emissions and vision i would</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:13.040" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.280" end="00:50:14.720" style="s2">um so like both the values actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.040" end="00:50:17.520" style="s2">ended up in this section</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.720" end="00:50:18.880" style="s2">we might just be using as like uh a</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.520" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">checklist to make sure that like is</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.880" end="00:50:22.160" style="s2">there anything that we&#39;re missing</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:23.440" style="s2">in mission and values that like oh we</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.160" end="00:50:25.680" style="s2">listen to value that&#39;s super important</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.440" end="00:50:29.119" style="s2">but we aren&#39;t seeing it</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.680" end="00:50:31.359" style="s2">yeah i think that&#39;s part of it when we</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.119" end="00:50:32.960" style="s2">come up with one of those top values are</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.359" end="00:50:35.040" style="s2">putting them in our mission and vision</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.960" end="00:50:37.520" style="s2">our yeah mission and</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.040" end="00:50:39.440" style="s2">vision yeah vision vision yeah it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.520" end="00:50:40.880" style="s2">that started with v and it hurt my brain</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.440" end="00:50:43.760" style="s2">because it was also values</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.880" end="00:50:45.359" style="s2">um but that like you know what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.760" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">like we get together and have fun on our</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.359" end="00:50:47.520" style="s2">projects while creating omni-win</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:49.440" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.520" end="00:50:50.960" style="s2">is like right because omni win we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.440" end="00:50:52.559" style="s2">broken it down last week but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.960" end="00:50:54.240" style="s2">gonna be we&#39;re constantly coming up with</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:55.520" style="s2">like oh but it hurts this and it helps</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.240" end="00:50:58.160" style="s2">that and that&#39;s i think</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.520" end="00:50:59.520" style="s2">our benefit is that it&#39;s not quite we</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.160" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">get what omni win is</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.520" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">and nothing&#39;s ever going to be omni when</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:06.400" style="s2">omni win especially right now</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">and so it is about dealing in that</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.400" end="00:51:10.720" style="s2">tension and saying oh yep that&#39;s hurting</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:12.880" style="s2">transparency but it&#39;s helping</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.720" end="00:51:14.960" style="s2">equality and it&#39;s helping and and making</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.880" end="00:51:17.040" style="s2">sure that these things</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.960" end="00:51:18.559" style="s2">are happening on a regular basis omni</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.040" end="00:51:19.359" style="s2">when we&#39;ve already broken it down and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.559" end="00:51:21.359" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.359" end="00:51:23.440" style="s2">right people trump animals as much as we</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.359" end="00:51:24.800" style="s2">love animals the planet</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.440" end="00:51:26.160" style="s2">people trumps the planet the planet</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.800" end="00:51:27.119" style="s2">anyway it&#39;s like we can&#39;t live without</p>

<p begin="00:51:29.440" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">if you don&#39;t think that right it&#39;s okay</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:33.359" style="s2">if you actually think the planet&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:34.319" style="s2">important than people you&#39;re still</p>
