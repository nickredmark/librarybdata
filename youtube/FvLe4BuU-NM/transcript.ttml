<p begin="00:08:34.230" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">normally transparent because we almost</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.900" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">always unconsciously framing events the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:49.130" style="s2">meaning and the event are fused together</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.440" end="00:08:58.350" style="s2">but here&#39;s the issue they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.690" end="00:09:02.129" style="s2">identical events are events the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.350" end="00:09:06.860" style="s2">is the co identification process that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.129" end="00:09:09.209" style="s2">taking place in response to the event</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.860" end="00:09:12.540" style="s2">that could be a process of parasitic</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.209" end="00:09:15.449" style="s2">processing that&#39;s not intrinsic to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.540" end="00:09:21.240" style="s2">event at all in fact the meaning isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.449" end="00:09:25.079" style="s2">part of the event at all and this is</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.240" end="00:09:29.250" style="s2">important because if you keep them fused</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.079" end="00:09:36.720" style="s2">you will be confused if the meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.250" end="00:09:40.319" style="s2">the event are fused the only way you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.720" end="00:09:46.529" style="s2">alter the meaning is by altering the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.319" end="00:09:51.029" style="s2">event the problem with that is sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.529" end="00:09:52.860" style="s2">you can but here&#39;s the thing here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.029" end="00:09:55.079" style="s2">thing that the Stoics are doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.860" end="00:09:56.939" style="s2">very much like what the buddha was doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.079" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">with trying to make you realize how</p>

<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:05.430" style="s2">much control as you think you do</p>

<p begin="00:10:37.410" end="00:10:43.889" style="s2">do precisely because if we lose control</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.949" end="00:10:45.899" style="s2">of the event we will of course lose</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.889" end="00:10:48.269" style="s2">control of the meaning because we have</p>

<p begin="00:11:02.730" end="00:11:06.960" style="s2">we&#39;ve already talked about this I</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.650" end="00:11:08.900" style="s2">mentioned Erich Fromm when we talked</p>

<p begin="00:11:08.900" end="00:11:13.260" style="s2">mentioned at that time and we would come</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.100" end="00:11:16.440" style="s2">back to it that Fromm was directly</p>

<p begin="00:13:57.080" end="00:14:06.330" style="s2">realizing this you often act as if you</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.630" end="00:14:08.490" style="s2">have no control over the meaning because</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.330" end="00:14:11.460" style="s2">you&#39;re ignorant and of the processes and</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.490" end="00:14:15.240" style="s2">it&#39;s transparent to you and you focus on</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.460" end="00:14:17.910" style="s2">trying to control the event in which you</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.240" end="00:14:19.460" style="s2">often often have much less control than</p>

<p begin="00:14:19.460" end="00:14:25.820" style="s2">this is what you should do pull the two</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.790" end="00:14:25.820" style="s2">apart</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:33.330" style="s2">the meaning and the event and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.560" end="00:14:35.970" style="s2">recalibrate your sense of control and</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.330" end="00:14:38.840" style="s2">identity because you have actually way</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.970" end="00:14:41.760" style="s2">more control over this then you realize</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.840" end="00:14:45.750" style="s2">or practice and you have way less</p>

<p begin="00:14:45.750" end="00:14:54.180" style="s2">practice that&#39;s why the court of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.310" end="00:14:57.620" style="s2">is knowing what&#39;s in our control versus</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.180" end="00:14:57.620" style="s2">what&#39;s not in our control</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.360" end="00:15:10.589" style="s2">so how do you practice that and how does</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.550" end="00:15:15.690" style="s2">your identity change as you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.589" end="00:15:15.690" style="s2">well the practice is Pro Chiron</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:29.690" style="s2">this means sort of ready to hand it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.140" end="00:15:34.630" style="s2">means remembering but in the sense of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.690" end="00:15:38.360" style="s2">sati like mindfulness it means</p>

<p begin="00:16:22.430" end="00:16:29.030" style="s2">practices you can see this a book where</p>

<p begin="00:24:34.789" end="00:24:42.079" style="s2">see this leads to the Stoics diagnosis</p>

<p begin="00:24:51.889" end="00:24:57.949" style="s2">we&#39;ve lost the meaning of a word because</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.949" end="00:25:03.949" style="s2">something that&#39;s fatal is something that</p>

<p begin="00:25:03.949" end="00:25:10.599" style="s2">of the death is not the root of this</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.099" end="00:25:10.599" style="s2">word the root of this word is fate</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.300" end="00:25:23.330" style="s2">now there&#39;s two meanings to this one is</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.780" end="00:25:25.040" style="s2">some sort of magical things are</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.330" end="00:25:26.180" style="s2">predestined by some supernatural force</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.180" end="00:25:30.140" style="s2">fate I&#39;m talking about the way things</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.980" end="00:25:32.450" style="s2">are just go our fated to happen they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:25:32.450" end="00:25:41.900" style="s2">necessity and here&#39;s the point when we</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.480" end="00:25:43.870" style="s2">fuse these together we become subject to</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.900" end="00:25:47.630" style="s2">the fatality of all things</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.870" end="00:25:50.090" style="s2">everything is fatal in that the meaning</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.630" end="00:25:52.490" style="s2">and the thing are not identical and if</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.090" end="00:25:57.770" style="s2">we forget that we will suffer when they</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.490" end="00:26:01.340" style="s2">come apart now I can explain to you the</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.770" end="00:26:05.540" style="s2">Association why is this associated with</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.340" end="00:26:10.040" style="s2">death because death is where those come</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.540" end="00:26:12.650" style="s2">apart death is where the events of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:24.650" end="00:26:31.660" style="s2">ultimate loss of agency that meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.920" end="00:26:31.660" style="s2">event are not identical</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.800" end="00:26:45.560" style="s2">what&#39;s another practice that the Stoics</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.990" end="00:26:47.540" style="s2">engage in practice they engaged in is</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.560" end="00:26:50.420" style="s2">called the view from the BA the view</p>

<p begin="00:28:31.850" end="00:28:43.450" style="s2">practices that are designed to get you</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.820" end="00:28:48.170" style="s2">to bring into awareness this process of</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.450" end="00:28:49.760" style="s2">meaning making and to give you the</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.990" end="00:29:11.210" style="s2">most therapy is about getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.600" end="00:29:14.570" style="s2">see this perspectival change prospective</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.210" end="00:29:17.330" style="s2">of knowing and then to identify with it</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.570" end="00:29:20.540" style="s2">change their sense of self their sense</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.330" end="00:29:22.940" style="s2">of control so that they move off trying</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.540" end="00:29:25.910" style="s2">to so much change the events that they</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.940" end="00:29:29.570" style="s2">can&#39;t control as much as they does</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.910" end="00:29:34.820" style="s2">deeply desperately want to to</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.570" end="00:29:37.550" style="s2">cognitively reframing the meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.820" end="00:29:40.280" style="s2">and again this isn&#39;t just semantic</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.550" end="00:29:42.140" style="s2">meaning this is the identity your</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.280" end="00:29:49.960" style="s2">participatory meaning your existential</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.140" end="00:29:52.370" style="s2">mode and this takes tremendous practice</p>

<p begin="00:29:52.370" end="00:29:58.720" style="s2">aurelius doing and even more a pictus is</p>

<p begin="00:30:03.890" end="00:30:12.830" style="s2">whole tradition it means trying to do</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.430" end="00:30:14.600" style="s2">with yourself what Socrates had done</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.830" end="00:30:16.940" style="s2">with you you can see this again in</p>

<p begin="00:30:19.670" end="00:30:28.280" style="s2">stop and be Socratic with themselves so</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.900" end="00:30:30.410" style="s2">the person is depressed remember I said</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.280" end="00:30:31.850" style="s2">when intestine is was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.410" end="00:30:33.440" style="s2">conversing with himself he wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.850" end="00:30:35.210" style="s2">talking about the way you ruminate</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.440" end="00:30:37.520" style="s2">because when we ruminate we&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.210" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">things for a head like everything I do</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.520" end="00:30:40.780" style="s2">is a failure</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:52.620" style="s2">the therapist doesn&#39;t try and console</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.260" end="00:30:54.630" style="s2">the person and says like well no go out</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.620" end="00:30:56.760" style="s2">and get more successful he doesn&#39;t give</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.630" end="00:30:59.420" style="s2">the American commercial response well go</p>

<p begin="00:31:44.589" end="00:31:50.529" style="s2">because I&#39;m letting this go by without</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.129" end="00:31:53.469" style="s2">having my own internal Socrates that</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.529" end="00:31:56.619" style="s2">stops me and says oh wow you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.469" end="00:31:58.029" style="s2">such powerful claims you must know and</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.619" end="00:32:00.279" style="s2">understand but you see you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.029" end="00:32:04.059" style="s2">bullshitting yourself because this is</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.279" end="00:32:05.979" style="s2">very salient to you but it&#39;s way beyond</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.059" end="00:32:09.279" style="s2">your understanding because what it&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.919" end="00:32:33.999" style="s2">you know they hate you well they said</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.509" end="00:32:35.589" style="s2">that is that enough for hate you can see</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.999" end="00:32:38.249" style="s2">Socrates here is that what you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.589" end="00:32:41.109" style="s2">hate tell me what you mean by it</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.249" end="00:32:42.700" style="s2">you&#39;ve got all these things salient in</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.109" end="00:32:44.649" style="s2">your mind and you&#39;re running them round</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.700" end="00:32:49.179" style="s2">and round and round but you don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.649" end="00:32:51.820" style="s2">understand the meaning and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.179" end="00:32:54.759" style="s2">bullshitting yourself your motivation</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.820" end="00:32:59.609" style="s2">and your arousal is way ahead of your</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.759" end="00:33:02.469" style="s2">understanding and most importantly</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.609" end="00:33:07.239" style="s2">because of that the meaning and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.469" end="00:33:09.549" style="s2">event are confused together and again</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.239" end="00:33:16.299" style="s2">this is not just in your beliefs this is</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.549" end="00:33:18.399" style="s2">in your very identity by doing all of</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.299" end="00:33:23.339" style="s2">this you&#39;re going to transform your</p>

<p begin="00:33:27.429" end="00:33:31.869" style="s2">absurdity and we&#39;re going to come back</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.109" end="00:33:34.239" style="s2">to absurdity again right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.869" end="00:33:38.889" style="s2">inflicted on you by the fatality of all</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.239" end="00:33:40.869" style="s2">things because if you can discern and</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.889" end="00:33:45.990" style="s2">this is one of the key things of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.869" end="00:33:49.620" style="s2">is discerning not just in thought</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.990" end="00:33:51.690" style="s2">but in perspective and in identity the</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.620" end="00:33:57.960" style="s2">difference between the meaning and the</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.690" end="00:34:00.240" style="s2">events and properly identify by meaning</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.960" end="00:34:07.409" style="s2">properly sensing and calibrating your</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.240" end="00:34:11.909" style="s2">sense of control then you will alter</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.409" end="00:34:13.980" style="s2">your sense of identity how and how could</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.909" end="00:34:16.859" style="s2">this possibly give an answer to the</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.980" end="00:34:22.290" style="s2">mortality of things that the Epicureans</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.859" end="00:34:26.070" style="s2">gave a direct answer to well let&#39;s play</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.290" end="00:34:32.760" style="s2">with that a little bit a kind of a bit a</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.070" end="00:34:39.690" style="s2">bit of a view from above let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.760" end="00:34:42.720" style="s2">gave you a mortality you got it what</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.690" end="00:34:44.970" style="s2">would you do with it well I do all the</p>

<p begin="00:34:54.419" end="00:34:57.839" style="s2">bored then when we do I&#39;d pursue more</p>

<p begin="00:35:24.330" end="00:35:27.450" style="s2">what they think is immortality and they</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.770" end="00:35:30.390" style="s2">practice is one guy he practices golf</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.450" end="00:35:32.520" style="s2">until he&#39;s getting a score of 18 right</p>

<p begin="00:43:12.380" end="00:43:25.330" style="s2">live within a scientific worldview so</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.410" end="00:43:30.530" style="s2">the Hellenistic period comes to an end</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.330" end="00:43:35.840" style="s2">with the advent of a return to a world</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.530" end="00:43:37.610" style="s2">empire which in very many ways right is</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.840" end="00:43:39.710" style="s2">going to be informed by the axial</p>

<p begin="00:43:39.710" end="00:43:45.590" style="s2">represents a return to a pre axial world</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.550" end="00:43:47.540" style="s2">namely a world in which eventually a man</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.590" end="00:43:50.980" style="s2">can be considered a God because He</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.540" end="00:43:54.260" style="s2">willed so much power the Roman emperors</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.980" end="00:43:56.750" style="s2">and power and prosperity are the primary</p>

<p begin="00:43:59.150" end="00:44:03.170" style="s2">philosophies will find home and</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.980" end="00:44:05.810" style="s2">eventually as we noted with Marcus</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.170" end="00:44:10.130" style="s2">Aurelius even the Emperor himself will</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.810" end="00:44:13.550" style="s2">be a proponent and an exemplar of the</p>

<p begin="00:44:13.550" end="00:44:17.450" style="s2">something else is also happening with</p>

<p begin="00:44:25.880" end="00:44:32.570" style="s2">this of course is ancient Israel because</p>

<p begin="00:44:32.570" end="00:44:37.910" style="s2">now been conquered by a sequence of</p>

<p begin="00:44:37.910" end="00:44:49.940" style="s2">the Roman Empire and I want to now speak</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.720" end="00:44:53.060" style="s2">of a religion that emerges at this time</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.940" end="00:44:55.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not an axial religion but it is</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.060" end="00:45:00.650" style="s2">deeply informed by the axial legacy</p>
