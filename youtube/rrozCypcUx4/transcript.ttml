<p begin="00:00:31.050" end="00:00:35.550" style="s2">about complex global systems and you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.780" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">listen to that episode by going to</p>

<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:43.290" style="s2">our topic is neuro hacking or the</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.370" end="00:00:45.140" style="s2">voluntary altering of your own brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.290" end="00:00:47.489" style="s2">function to optimize for performance</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.140" end="00:00:50.640" style="s2">well-being or a number of other factors</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.489" end="00:00:53.070" style="s2">and we recently got our hands on qualia</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.640" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">which is a newer enhancer or a smart</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.070" end="00:00:57.570" style="s2">drug stack from neuro hacker collective</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:00:59.579" style="s2">which Daniel is the co-founder of we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.570" end="00:01:02.699" style="s2">tried a few other smart drugs before</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.579" end="00:01:04.530" style="s2">like modafinil for example but qualia</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.699" end="00:01:06.780" style="s2">seems to be quite different from the</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.530" end="00:01:08.820" style="s2">others for example my experience of</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.780" end="00:01:11.100" style="s2">Madeleine was that it made me just</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.820" end="00:01:13.650" style="s2">dislike people in general although it</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.100" end="00:01:15.390" style="s2">made me extremely focused but qualia</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.650" end="00:01:18.090" style="s2">didn&#39;t have any of those side effects</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.390" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">for me it gave me a sense of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.090" end="00:01:22.619" style="s2">well-being and a general sense of</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">balance as well as focus which was quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.619" end="00:01:27.390" style="s2">interesting the term for this is broad</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">spectrum cognitive enhancement which</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.390" end="00:01:31.770" style="s2">means that it doesn&#39;t just improve one</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:33.960" style="s2">quality of your functioning but multiple</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.770" end="00:01:36.119" style="s2">qualities at the same time qualia</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.960" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">specifically focuses on three areas of</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.119" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">enhancement cognitive psycho affective</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:43.979" style="s2">and physiological cognitive area</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:46.380" style="s2">includes things like intelligence and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.979" end="00:01:48.540" style="s2">creativity psycho effective area</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.380" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">includes increasing confidence willpower</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.540" end="00:01:53.009" style="s2">and empathy and physiological area</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:55.860" style="s2">includes higher levels of energy</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.009" end="00:01:57.360" style="s2">awareness and responsiveness qualia has</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.860" end="00:01:59.579" style="s2">also been designed with an ethical</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.360" end="00:02:02.009" style="s2">mindset instead of depleting or</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.579" end="00:02:04.049" style="s2">overriding your brains natural function</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.009" end="00:02:06.360" style="s2">like some other smart drugs it works to</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.049" end="00:02:09.450" style="s2">support and enhance without creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.360" end="00:02:12.090" style="s2">dependency there are over 40 active</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.450" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">ingredients in qualia and it&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="00:03:50.190" end="00:03:54.270" style="s2">episodes were quite popular but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.050" end="00:03:56.550" style="s2">talked about quite a different set of</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.270" end="00:03:58.560" style="s2">subjects and today we&#39;d like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.550" end="00:03:59.940" style="s2">with you about neuro hacking so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.560" end="00:04:01.920" style="s2">can you give us like a brief</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.940" end="00:04:03.690" style="s2">introduction to what neuro hacking is</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.920" end="00:04:06.030" style="s2">and why we should be doing it if we</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.690" end="00:04:08.700" style="s2">should be doing it yeah so neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.030" end="00:04:10.830" style="s2">is a broad and kind of ambiguous term</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.700" end="00:04:12.959" style="s2">related to bio hacking and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.830" end="00:04:14.430" style="s2">hacking generally we can think of it as</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">the application of any tools or</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.430" end="00:04:19.859" style="s2">technologies or processes to modulate</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:22.160" style="s2">augment upgrade some aspect of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.859" end="00:04:25.740" style="s2">psychological neurological function and</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.160" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">so we could think of ancient neural</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.740" end="00:04:29.670" style="s2">hacking technologies being</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:31.950" style="s2">meditation and sweat lodges and</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.670" end="00:04:33.630" style="s2">psychedelics and dancing around the</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.950" end="00:04:37.620" style="s2">campfire to get into trance-like states</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.630" end="00:04:39.480" style="s2">and etc and obviously with advances in</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.620" end="00:04:43.590" style="s2">neuroscience and neuro technology we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.480" end="00:04:45.450" style="s2">got Q EEG neurofeedback we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.590" end="00:04:47.760" style="s2">transcranial stimulation technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.450" end="00:04:50.250" style="s2">we&#39;ve got much more advanced microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.760" end="00:04:52.860" style="s2">ik genomic you know biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.250" end="00:04:56.880" style="s2">technologies so we can think of neuro</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.860" end="00:04:59.160" style="s2">hacking as how do we optimize the mind</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.880" end="00:05:01.980" style="s2">brain interface towards any positive</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.160" end="00:05:04.410" style="s2">purpose utilizing whatever tools best</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.980" end="00:05:07.080" style="s2">serve that particular purpose I love how</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.410" end="00:05:10.350" style="s2">you say mind brain interface as if there</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.080" end="00:05:11.900" style="s2">are very separate things well the reason</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.350" end="00:05:14.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re saying mind brain interface</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.900" end="00:05:20.010" style="s2">together is because if you want to run</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.940" end="00:05:21.960" style="s2">the analogy of mind stuff as kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.010" end="00:05:23.940" style="s2">like software and brain stuff is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.960" end="00:05:26.190" style="s2">like hardware you realize that the</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.940" end="00:05:28.110" style="s2">distinction the clear distinction in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.190" end="00:05:30.180" style="s2">computers between software and hardware</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.110" end="00:05:33.900" style="s2">we don&#39;t have such a clear distinction</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.180" end="00:05:37.140" style="s2">and the human organism that any change</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.900" end="00:05:38.550" style="s2">in thought has a physical change in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.140" end="00:05:40.380" style="s2">brain that&#39;s happening any physical</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.550" end="00:05:44.040" style="s2">change in the brain has some change in</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.380" end="00:05:47.430" style="s2">thinking emotion experience etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.040" end="00:05:48.360" style="s2">they are dynamically Co inter affecting</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.430" end="00:05:50.790" style="s2">each other all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.360" end="00:05:53.669" style="s2">so I suppose a lot of the thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.790" end="00:05:55.830" style="s2">we&#39;ve done about consciousness has come</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.669" end="00:05:57.480" style="s2">from well it&#39;s come from a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.830" end="00:06:00.090" style="s2">different perspectives but the one that</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.480" end="00:06:01.530" style="s2">we land on quite often is the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.090" end="00:06:04.050" style="s2">perspective from Hinduism and Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.530" end="00:06:06.570" style="s2">which is you are not the mind and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.050" end="00:06:09.570" style="s2">consciousness is not exactly localized</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.570" end="00:06:10.890" style="s2">in physical material in the brain so do</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.570" end="00:06:12.450" style="s2">you have much to say from that</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.890" end="00:06:15.330" style="s2">perspective before we dive deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.450" end="00:06:17.280" style="s2">neuro hacking yeah so we get right into</p>

<p begin="00:06:18.840" end="00:06:24.690" style="s2">neuroscience how does consciousness and</p>

<p begin="00:06:24.690" end="00:06:30.020" style="s2">and physics how do they what are they</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.250" end="00:06:36.930" style="s2">this is the hard problem of neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.220" end="00:06:39.300" style="s2">but before that this was you know the</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.930" end="00:06:40.370" style="s2">kind of hard problem with the mind brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.300" end="00:06:42.260" style="s2">problem where the</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.260" end="00:06:47.060" style="s2">philosophic systems faced is it seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.630" end="00:06:49.940" style="s2">like there is third-person stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.060" end="00:06:53.419" style="s2">that we can all independently measure in</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.940" end="00:06:55.639" style="s2">Sciences the method of knowing the third</p>

<p begin="00:07:04.729" end="00:07:10.790" style="s2">able to you know make predictions etc</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:14.120" style="s2">and third person stuff has weight and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.790" end="00:07:16.690" style="s2">position and charge and length and spin</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.120" end="00:07:19.820" style="s2">and those kinds of properties</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.690" end="00:07:22.669" style="s2">first-person stuff doesn&#39;t have any of</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.820" end="00:07:26.030" style="s2">those right it has emotion and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.669" end="00:07:27.440" style="s2">and longing and impulse and it can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.030" end="00:07:29.960" style="s2">corroborated by anybody else at all</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.440" end="00:07:32.539" style="s2">right like you are having a first-person</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.960" end="00:07:35.030" style="s2">experience as we&#39;re talking and I can</p>

<p begin="00:07:35.030" end="00:07:38.539" style="s2">your experience is like but that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.250" end="00:07:41.050" style="s2">different than actually having the</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.539" end="00:07:45.020" style="s2">first-person access to it that you do so</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.050" end="00:07:46.970" style="s2">there both of these realities exist has</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.020" end="00:07:48.680" style="s2">been acknowledged and there are</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.970" end="00:07:50.690" style="s2">philosophic systems that don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.680" end="00:07:52.880" style="s2">that they&#39;re both real right you have</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.690" end="00:07:54.620" style="s2">what are called idealism systems that</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.880" end="00:07:55.729" style="s2">say consciousness is fundamentally real</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.620" end="00:07:58.280" style="s2">because it&#39;s the only thing we can know</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.729" end="00:07:59.419" style="s2">I can know that I&#39;m having an experience</p>

<p begin="00:08:01.460" end="00:08:04.400" style="s2">through my scientific measurements is</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.960" end="00:08:05.930" style="s2">true because I could just be a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.400" end="00:08:08.780" style="s2">person right this could all be a dream</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.930" end="00:08:11.560" style="s2">it could all be the matrix and it could</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.780" end="00:08:14.240" style="s2">just be you know contours within</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.560" end="00:08:16.550" style="s2">consciousness but I don&#39;t I only have</p>

<p begin="00:08:16.550" end="00:08:23.030" style="s2">access to my experience of stuff not the</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.880" end="00:08:24.770" style="s2">stuff itself and so in those models</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.030" end="00:08:27.320" style="s2">what&#39;s fundamentally reals consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.770" end="00:08:29.150" style="s2">and the rest of universe right</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.320" end="00:08:31.970" style="s2">third-person self is either not real at</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.150" end="00:08:33.909" style="s2">all Maya or it&#39;s an epiphenomena of</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.970" end="00:08:37.789" style="s2">consciousness mind creates reality</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.909" end="00:08:39.620" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the other side and says which</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.789" end="00:08:42.260" style="s2">fundamentally real is physical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.620" end="00:08:44.600" style="s2">material stuff physical stuff happened</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.260" end="00:08:46.430" style="s2">with the Big Bang interactions occur</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.600" end="00:08:47.930" style="s2">that lead to complexity emergent</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.430" end="00:08:50.630" style="s2">properties have enough complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.930" end="00:08:52.400" style="s2">somewhere around biology or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.630" end="00:08:54.020" style="s2">nervous systems consciousness is an</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.400" end="00:08:56.500" style="s2">emergent property but what</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:59.420" style="s2">fundamentally real is physical stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.500" end="00:09:00.290" style="s2">then consciousness is either just not</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.420" end="00:09:02.570" style="s2">real at all</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.290" end="00:09:04.040" style="s2">it&#39;s called radical diminutive ism so</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.570" end="00:09:06.820" style="s2">Dan Dennett and others kind of proposed</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.040" end="00:09:10.010" style="s2">that it&#39;s kind of like an illusion or</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.820" end="00:09:12.470" style="s2">consciousness is real but it&#39;s an</p>

<p begin="00:09:12.470" end="00:09:17.810" style="s2">right radical emergentism so you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.380" end="00:09:20.240" style="s2">different philosophic systems that don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.810" end="00:09:23.240" style="s2">see both of those has fundamentally real</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.240" end="00:09:25.880" style="s2">things or reduce them to the domain that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.240" end="00:09:27.470" style="s2">seems more role to them or they&#39;re stuck</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.880" end="00:09:29.060" style="s2">with all right these both seem real and</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.470" end="00:09:32.030" style="s2">they seem uncommon surrett called</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.060" end="00:09:36.010" style="s2">dualism or attempts to try and reconcile</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.030" end="00:09:39.070" style="s2">them more deeply and so when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.010" end="00:09:41.870" style="s2">living your life when your body is</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.070" end="00:09:43.370" style="s2">touched interacted with sensation</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.870" end="00:09:45.440" style="s2">happens this is physical right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.370" end="00:09:47.360" style="s2">being mediated by via biology and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.440" end="00:09:50.300" style="s2">physics and yet you have a conscious</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.360" end="00:09:52.010" style="s2">experience so it seems like physics can</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.300" end="00:09:54.770" style="s2">affect consciousness there&#39;s a causal</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.010" end="00:09:57.950" style="s2">movement but you also experience</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.770" end="00:10:00.290" style="s2">yourself having some choice and again we</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.950" end="00:10:01.970" style="s2">get deep into not just the topic of</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.290" end="00:10:04.580" style="s2">consciousness with the topic of will and</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.970" end="00:10:06.230" style="s2">volition and if your choice is real and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.580" end="00:10:08.750" style="s2">then affects your hand moving it would</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.230" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">seem that consciousness has some effect</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.750" end="00:10:14.570" style="s2">on physics and there for every branch</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">where you say well what about that and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.570" end="00:10:17.840" style="s2">each of these questions each of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:19.700" style="s2">things I&#39;ve said and the questions that</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.840" end="00:10:21.800" style="s2">come up there is a whole branch of</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.700" end="00:10:23.870" style="s2">philosophy that goes down is there</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.800" end="00:10:25.730" style="s2">really free will or not is it compatible</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.870" end="00:10:29.060" style="s2">with the deterministic universe or not</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.730" end="00:10:30.410" style="s2">is universe deterministic etc but most</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.060" end="00:10:32.840" style="s2">of what we&#39;re gonna talk about today</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.410" end="00:10:37.150" style="s2">does not require these deep existential</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.840" end="00:10:40.640" style="s2">issues being solved to say that we do</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.150" end="00:10:43.610" style="s2">know empirically both first-person and</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.640" end="00:10:45.800" style="s2">third-person the things that we can do</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.610" end="00:10:49.790" style="s2">with our subjective experience so</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.800" end="00:10:51.920" style="s2">mindfulness meditation introspection etc</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.790" end="00:10:53.710" style="s2">can actively affect the brain and affect</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.920" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">the brain in ways that affect the minds</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.710" end="00:10:58.760" style="s2">predispositions and things that we can</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.650" style="s2">do to the body ie changing its</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.760" end="00:11:04.160" style="s2">biochemistry changing its microbiota</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.650" end="00:11:07.130" style="s2">exercising differently change cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.160" end="00:11:07.910" style="s2">and emotional right mental and and the</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.910" end="00:11:13.310" style="s2">of the conscious creature and you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.550" end="00:11:15.860" style="s2">abstract and say well okay so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.310" end="00:11:17.000" style="s2">saying the mind thinking feeling stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.860" end="00:11:18.800" style="s2">is different than the body is</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.000" end="00:11:21.680" style="s2">consciousness different than that as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.800" end="00:11:25.910" style="s2">as the non-dual witness imagem candidate</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.680" end="00:11:28.550" style="s2">in new buddhist philosophy so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.910" end="00:11:30.470" style="s2">there is consciousness as a field effect</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.550" end="00:11:33.080" style="s2">it is then interacting with this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.470" end="00:11:34.700" style="s2">self-organizing system fascinating</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.080" end="00:11:37.250" style="s2">questions and if you wanted to do a show</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.700" end="00:11:39.500" style="s2">where we just dive into them existential</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.250" end="00:11:40.790" style="s2">questions at depth that behaves I think</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.500" end="00:11:44.090" style="s2">that&#39;s the plan for the next one</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.790" end="00:11:46.820" style="s2">actually but yeah you bring up non non</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.090" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">duality and that&#39;s exactly what I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.820" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">going to say just now do you approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:53.000" style="s2">newer hacking from a non-dualistic</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:55.340" style="s2">perspective where it&#39;s both ascending</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.000" end="00:11:58.250" style="s2">and descending in terms that Ken Wilber</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.340" end="00:12:00.520" style="s2">uses yeah so when Ken talks about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.250" end="00:12:02.510" style="s2">ascending pass he&#39;s talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.520" end="00:12:04.430" style="s2">transcendent direction and the</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.510" end="00:12:07.340" style="s2">descending paths the eminent direction</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.430" end="00:12:12.020" style="s2">right so the transcendent spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.340" end="00:12:15.950" style="s2">processes are around in some way having</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.020" end="00:12:22.040" style="s2">consciousness leave body mind etc and go</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.950" end="00:12:23.890" style="s2">into higher states of consciousness etc</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.040" end="00:12:26.480" style="s2">the descending pass around taking</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.890" end="00:12:28.940" style="s2">universal consciousness and embodying it</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.480" end="00:12:31.670" style="s2">more fully and if you just want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.940" end="00:12:34.520" style="s2">about it very simply in terms of just</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.670" end="00:12:36.830" style="s2">having expanded states of awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.520" end="00:12:40.390" style="s2">then being able to integrate those</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.830" end="00:12:43.610" style="s2">expanded states as integrated stages yes</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.390" end="00:12:45.980" style="s2">that&#39;s a valuable way to think about it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.610" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">cool so why don&#39;t we move into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.980" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">actual subject of neuro hacking you</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.170" end="00:12:53.180" style="s2">talked about the different tools that we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">can use what are some of the currently</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.180" end="00:12:56.840" style="s2">available tools for neuro hacking well</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:59.560" style="s2">so there&#39;s a lot of different goals</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.840" end="00:13:03.140" style="s2">right and so if someone&#39;s wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.560" end="00:13:05.330" style="s2">decrease anxiety or brighten their mood</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.140" end="00:13:07.610" style="s2">or increase their cognitive function or</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.330" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">have altered kind of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.610" end="00:13:12.680" style="s2">psychedelic numinous states or improve</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:14.450" style="s2">their sleep quality or each of these</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.680" end="00:13:16.670" style="s2">goals are gonna have different tools</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.450" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">that are more appropriate and then each</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.670" end="00:13:19.610" style="s2">of the goals are going to have different</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:20.970" style="s2">tools that are different depending up on</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.610" end="00:13:23.430" style="s2">the person and what the person</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.970" end="00:13:27.629" style="s2">she has going on they are specific</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.430" end="00:13:29.819" style="s2">biochemistry genomics etc so I&#39;ll speak</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.629" end="00:13:31.949" style="s2">broadly about categories of tools that</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.819" end="00:13:36.509" style="s2">are currently available and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.949" end="00:13:41.670" style="s2">get into applications more so think</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.509" end="00:13:43.139" style="s2">about first affecting the brain and body</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.670" end="00:13:44.189" style="s2">and this is another important</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.139" end="00:13:46.069" style="s2">distinction so we look at the</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.189" end="00:13:48.959" style="s2">intersection between the mind and brain</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.069" end="00:13:50.430" style="s2">but it&#39;s not just mind and brain it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.959" end="00:13:52.649" style="s2">your conscious experience in your body</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.430" end="00:13:54.720" style="s2">as a whole and then we could say well</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.649" end="00:13:56.370" style="s2">it&#39;s actually the mind brain body</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.720" end="00:13:57.689" style="s2">environment complex because the</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.370" end="00:13:59.399" style="s2">environment and the body are</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.689" end="00:14:02.189" style="s2">intersecting each other inexorably in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.399" end="00:14:04.769" style="s2">real time so these are embedded complex</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.189" end="00:14:06.600" style="s2">systems but let&#39;s just talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.769" end="00:14:09.240" style="s2">topic of embodied consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.600" end="00:14:11.370" style="s2">conscious experience that is mediated</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.240" end="00:14:14.670" style="s2">beyond just the nervous system in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.370" end="00:14:17.100" style="s2">physiology you know the first example</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.670" end="00:14:19.139" style="s2">that I think people are getting pretty</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.100" end="00:14:21.689" style="s2">properly aware of is the gut brain axis</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.139" end="00:14:23.579" style="s2">and the gut brain axis is mediated by</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.689" end="00:14:25.199" style="s2">via a number of things you&#39;ve got the</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.579" end="00:14:27.509" style="s2">enteric nervous system which is a whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.199" end="00:14:30.269" style="s2">branch of peripheral nervous system in</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.509" end="00:14:32.699" style="s2">the intestines where inflammation in the</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.269" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">intestines can cause imbalance between</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.699" end="00:14:37.350" style="s2">sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:41.120" style="s2">system can cause more inflammation etc</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.350" end="00:14:45.569" style="s2">but you&#39;ve also got the microbiome</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.120" end="00:14:48.209" style="s2">digesting food and actually many of our</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.569" end="00:14:51.480" style="s2">nutrients are metabolic byproducts of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.209" end="00:14:53.069" style="s2">the microbiota and obviously we evolved</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.480" end="00:14:55.170" style="s2">with our microbiome over so many</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.069" end="00:14:57.149" style="s2">generations before we had chlorinated</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.170" end="00:14:59.879" style="s2">water and antibiotics and refined sugar</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.149" end="00:15:02.189" style="s2">diets and so the human genome doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.879" end="00:15:03.959" style="s2">actually code everything necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.189" end="00:15:06.120" style="s2">make a human the genome encodes a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.959" end="00:15:09.509" style="s2">of stuff but we got a genome and a</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.120" end="00:15:12.149" style="s2">microbiome from our parents and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.509" end="00:15:14.610" style="s2">babies microbiome comes some in utero</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.149" end="00:15:17.250" style="s2">some from the vaginal flora some from</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.610" end="00:15:20.069" style="s2">you know breastfeeding but if we damage</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.250" end="00:15:21.959" style="s2">that a whole bunch of functions</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.069" end="00:15:24.269" style="s2">necessary to make an optimum human can</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.959" end="00:15:25.290" style="s2">be damaged so specifically regarding</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.269" end="00:15:27.300" style="s2">nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.290" end="00:15:31.350" style="s2">some of the main neurotransmitters like</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.300" end="00:15:34.290" style="s2">gaba dopamine serotonin are primarily</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.350" end="00:15:37.379" style="s2">produced via flora in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.290" end="00:15:38.999" style="s2">and so each of those three I just</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.379" end="00:15:40.619" style="s2">mentioned somewhere between 30 to 80</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.999" end="00:15:42.929" style="s2">percent of those neurotransmitters are</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.619" end="00:15:44.669" style="s2">actually produced in the gut and that</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.929" end="00:15:46.769" style="s2">you know moved to the brain if you think</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.669" end="00:15:48.479" style="s2">about losing 30 to 80 percent of your</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.769" end="00:15:51.839" style="s2">serotonin or GABA or dopamine that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.479" end="00:15:54.479" style="s2">that&#39;s you know psychopathology right</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.839" end="00:15:55.350" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a messed up brain so then</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.479" end="00:15:58.529" style="s2">you start looking at well how many</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.350" end="00:16:00.089" style="s2">people are eating food that is feeding</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.529" end="00:16:02.009" style="s2">some microbes more than others and</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.089" end="00:16:04.769" style="s2">changing the gut microbiome or have some</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.009" end="00:16:07.499" style="s2">GI disturbance or and so it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.769" end="00:16:10.109" style="s2">that if we helped the microbiome of</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.499" end="00:16:11.759" style="s2">someone&#39;s gut that&#39;s a neuro hack right</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.109" end="00:16:14.879" style="s2">we can be changing their brain chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.759" end="00:16:18.419" style="s2">the most critical kinds of signaling</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.879" end="00:16:20.970" style="s2">chemicals by changing the bacteria in</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.419" end="00:16:23.429" style="s2">their gut the same is true if we want to</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.970" end="00:16:26.459" style="s2">look at say pain anywhere in the body</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.429" end="00:16:27.689" style="s2">pain can create inflammation that can</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.459" end="00:16:29.069" style="s2">cross the blood-brain barrier and cause</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.689" end="00:16:32.309" style="s2">neural inflammation and creates</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.069" end="00:16:34.139" style="s2">depression and cognitive issues exercise</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.309" end="00:16:37.759" style="s2">certain types of exercise can actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.139" end="00:16:40.139" style="s2">affect genetic transcription and change</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:42.689" style="s2">endogenous biochemical patterns in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.139" end="00:16:45.089" style="s2">brain and so you know we&#39;ll talk about</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.689" end="00:16:47.129" style="s2">technologies to affect the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.089" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">nervous system directly but some of them</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.129" end="00:16:50.009" style="s2">are technologies to affect the</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:52.139" style="s2">environment that the brain and nervous</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.009" end="00:16:56.339" style="s2">system lives in which is first order of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.139" end="00:16:59.759" style="s2">the body right so tools let&#39;s think</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.339" end="00:17:01.259" style="s2">about biochemical tools so first line of</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.759" end="00:17:02.459" style="s2">biochemical tools is things that you can</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.259" end="00:17:05.189" style="s2">put in your mouth right so we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.459" end="00:17:09.439" style="s2">about vitamins and supplements and herbs</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.189" end="00:17:12.029" style="s2">and drugs etc so you&#39;ve got anxiety</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.439" end="00:17:14.519" style="s2">biochemistry things that can decrease</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.029" end="00:17:16.289" style="s2">anxiety you&#39;ve got things that can help</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.519" end="00:17:18.779" style="s2">with sleep you&#39;ve got things that can</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.289" end="00:17:23.159" style="s2">help with cognition all all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.779" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">nootropics and smart drugs and then you</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.159" end="00:17:26.970" style="s2">know you&#39;ve got things that can create</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:28.379" style="s2">experiences that might not be where you</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.970" end="00:17:31.139" style="s2">want to live all the time but are</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.379" end="00:17:33.929" style="s2">meaningful state experiences so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.139" end="00:17:36.299" style="s2">take psychedelics and say are we</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.929" end="00:17:38.789" style="s2">optimizing the physiology by taking a</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.299" end="00:17:40.470" style="s2">psychedelic or are we oughta menteng it</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.789" end="00:17:41.549" style="s2">moving it into a specific range of</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.470" end="00:17:42.899" style="s2">function that we might know how to live</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.549" end="00:17:45.149" style="s2">in all the time but that has very</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.899" end="00:17:48.150" style="s2">meaningful positive effects lastingly if</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.149" end="00:17:50.280" style="s2">done properly so you&#39;ve got you just</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.150" end="00:17:52.050" style="s2">about all the biochemical stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.280" end="00:17:54.690" style="s2">now then you&#39;ve got biochemical stuff</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.050" end="00:17:56.430" style="s2">that could be injected could go</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.690" end="00:17:58.250" style="s2">intranasally there&#39;s a lot of different</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.430" end="00:18:00.810" style="s2">delivery methods for biochemical</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.250" end="00:18:03.150" style="s2">technologies for neural hacking you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.810" end="00:18:04.680" style="s2">got the biological technologies which</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.150" end="00:18:06.630" style="s2">like we were mentioning you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.680" end="00:18:07.800" style="s2">affecting the microbiome of the gut but</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.630" end="00:18:10.470" style="s2">not just a microbiome of the gut</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.800" end="00:18:11.940" style="s2">microbiome of all of the mucosa systems</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.470" end="00:18:13.410" style="s2">the body it&#39;s pretty common for people</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.940" end="00:18:15.300" style="s2">to have infections in their mouth</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.410" end="00:18:17.730" style="s2">subclinical dental infections or</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.300" end="00:18:19.560" style="s2">subclinical nasal infections they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.730" end="00:18:22.470" style="s2">actually releasing bio toxins that</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.560" end="00:18:24.540" style="s2">affect the brain and so they are the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.470" end="00:18:27.210" style="s2">boundary between good and Agreda</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.540" end="00:18:30.590" style="s2">functional medicine and neuro hacking</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.210" end="00:18:33.690" style="s2">right that kind of blurs we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.590" end="00:18:35.760" style="s2">genomic therapies we can think about for</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.690" end="00:18:37.350" style="s2">neuro hacking so you know we&#39;re at the</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.760" end="00:18:40.410" style="s2">edge of starting to think about CRISPR</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.350" end="00:18:41.940" style="s2">and looking at do people with higher IQs</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.410" end="00:18:43.020" style="s2">do people that are happier more</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.940" end="00:18:45.450" style="s2">depressed have different genomic</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.020" end="00:18:48.180" style="s2">patterns and can we actually do gene</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.450" end="00:18:50.940" style="s2">doping splicing etc to affect that and</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.180" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">even before looking at it at a genomic</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.940" end="00:18:56.280" style="s2">level we look at a genetic expression</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:18:57.690" style="s2">level can we turn on or off or modulate</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.280" end="00:19:00.000" style="s2">certain gene expressions and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.690" end="00:19:02.520" style="s2">bunch of things that do that and then to</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.000" end="00:19:04.290" style="s2">the degree that we know someone has say</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.520" end="00:19:06.360" style="s2">a bunch of mutations on their mao</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.290" end="00:19:07.710" style="s2">branches or their comt branches that</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.360" end="00:19:09.930" style="s2">code for certain neurotransmitter</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.659" end="00:20:47.779" style="s2">bunch more but you can give me more</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.350" end="00:20:50.630" style="s2">questions otherwise I&#39;ll keep going so</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.779" end="00:20:52.490" style="s2">you brought up the gut brain is there a</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.630" end="00:20:54.649" style="s2">feedback mechanism that you can train</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.490" end="00:20:56.690" style="s2">yourself to pay attention to so that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.649" end="00:20:59.120" style="s2">have better insight or thinking sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.690" end="00:21:00.380" style="s2">informed by the gut so we could take</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.120" end="00:21:03.289" style="s2">this a couple different ways we could</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.380" end="00:21:05.179" style="s2">say that we might be actually looking at</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.289" end="00:21:07.309" style="s2">the information processing of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.179" end="00:21:09.559" style="s2">enteric nervous system right there is</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.309" end="00:21:12.409" style="s2">this gut brain got nervous system that</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.559" end="00:21:14.059" style="s2">it provides a different kind of input or</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.409" end="00:21:15.380" style="s2">feedback just like there&#39;s a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.059" end="00:21:17.480" style="s2">neurons in the heart and we could talk</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.380" end="00:21:20.210" style="s2">about the heart as an information</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.480" end="00:21:22.880" style="s2">processing system you know or the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.210" end="00:21:24.440" style="s2">neurons in it at least that might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.880" end="00:21:25.580" style="s2">true I don&#39;t think we know enough to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.440" end="00:21:28.549" style="s2">know for sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.580" end="00:21:32.149" style="s2">we can also though just talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.549" end="00:21:35.240" style="s2">benefit of tuning in two different</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.149" end="00:21:38.179" style="s2">perspectives and being able to get</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.240" end="00:21:40.940" style="s2">different information so let me give you</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.179" end="00:21:43.389" style="s2">a totally different example Napoleon</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.940" end="00:21:46.340" style="s2">Hills famous book Think and Grow Rich</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.389" end="00:21:48.169" style="s2">mm-hmm so he said that one of his</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.340" end="00:21:50.330" style="s2">favorite practices that he developed in</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.169" end="00:21:53.570" style="s2">there was he had this council of</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.330" end="00:21:55.639" style="s2">invisible advisors and his invisible</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.570" end="00:21:58.130" style="s2">advisors were he thought about who he</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.639" end="00:21:59.480" style="s2">wanted to become and the qualities that</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.130" end="00:22:01.850" style="s2">mattered most and he thought about</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.480" end="00:22:04.490" style="s2">people that really represented embodying</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.850" end="00:22:06.769" style="s2">that quality well and so maybe he didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.490" end="00:22:08.690" style="s2">want to become Genghis Khan you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.769" end="00:22:10.220" style="s2">holistically but there was some aspect</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.690" end="00:22:13.429" style="s2">of Kurds that he wanted Genghis Khan&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.220" end="00:22:14.530" style="s2">inside for and so he had you know he had</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.429" end="00:22:17.120" style="s2">his list</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.530" end="00:22:19.160" style="s2">Lincoln DaVinci Ford whoever I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.120" end="00:22:21.110" style="s2">remember whose exact list was but he</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.160" end="00:22:23.240" style="s2">studied those people well enough that he</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.110" end="00:22:25.610" style="s2">could have some real sense of their</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.240" end="00:22:27.500" style="s2">personalities and then he would convene</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.610" end="00:22:29.180" style="s2">seeing them all at a council table with</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.500" end="00:22:31.070" style="s2">his eyes closed in a kind of meditative</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.180" end="00:22:32.540" style="s2">state and then he would bring life</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.070" end="00:22:34.460" style="s2">issues to them and ask for their</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.540" end="00:22:36.610" style="s2">feedback and go around and have Lincoln</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.460" end="00:22:38.750" style="s2">talk right then have Napoleon talk and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.610" end="00:22:43.760" style="s2">one of the things that he found was that</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.750" end="00:22:47.750" style="s2">when he was asking for Gandhi&#39;s input he</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.760" end="00:22:52.220" style="s2">got insight that he would have never got</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.750" end="00:22:54.260" style="s2">just journaling his own thoughts and he</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.220" end="00:22:57.650" style="s2">said all right so is it because I am</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.260" end="00:22:59.690" style="s2">channeling Gandhi or is it simply</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.650" end="00:23:01.760" style="s2">because I&#39;m looking at the universe</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.690" end="00:23:05.660" style="s2">through a different lens that I wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.760" end="00:23:07.220" style="s2">normally using my own brain and you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.660" end="00:23:08.630" style="s2">he said it let&#39;s assume that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.220" end="00:23:13.010" style="s2">latter but it really doesn&#39;t matter at</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.630" end="00:23:15.710" style="s2">all the net result is profound valuable</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.010" end="00:23:17.930" style="s2">useful empirically useful insights came</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.710" end="00:23:20.480" style="s2">from looking at the world through those</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.930" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">lenses you can do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.480" end="00:23:25.490" style="s2">parts of your body and it&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:27.200" style="s2">really meaningful part of somatic</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.490" end="00:23:29.120" style="s2">psychology so you can tune in to your</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.200" end="00:23:31.700" style="s2">gut you can tune in to say you want to</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.120" end="00:23:33.770" style="s2">use the chakra system right and you tune</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.700" end="00:23:35.090" style="s2">into your solar plexus or your heart</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.770" end="00:23:37.280" style="s2">chakra your throat chakra</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.090" end="00:23:39.080" style="s2">does it matter if they&#39;re really chakras</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.280" end="00:23:40.790" style="s2">no it doesn&#39;t matter at all does it</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.080" end="00:23:42.860" style="s2">matter if the chakras correlate to nerve</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.790" end="00:23:45.320" style="s2">plexus or the endocrine glands or if</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.860" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">their nonsense is you&#39;re just tuning in</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.320" end="00:23:48.860" style="s2">to this part of your body and saying</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:51.020" style="s2">what does it want to tell me what does</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.860" end="00:23:54.170" style="s2">it think what is it you know want me to</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.020" end="00:23:56.180" style="s2">know and some information comes and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.170" end="00:23:57.740" style="s2">you step back in your normal state of</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.180" end="00:23:59.360" style="s2">consciousness and look at that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.740" end="00:24:02.360" style="s2">might you be able to gain meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.360" end="00:24:03.740" style="s2">insights from it definitely yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.360" end="00:24:05.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a really good way of looking at</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.740" end="00:24:07.100" style="s2">it because some people you know if</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.600" end="00:24:09.080" style="s2">they&#39;re not used to or if they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.100" end="00:24:11.120" style="s2">believe that you know if Shockers exist</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.080" end="00:24:13.190" style="s2">they might just refuse to use the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.120" end="00:24:14.390" style="s2">technique but actually the way you put</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.190" end="00:24:16.250" style="s2">it you can totally just use the</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.390" end="00:24:19.520" style="s2">technique without having any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.250" end="00:24:22.430" style="s2">belief about it hmm does this work yes</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.520" end="00:24:24.800" style="s2">it does does it not work okay well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.430" end="00:24:26.450" style="s2">I can try something else and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.800" end="00:24:27.920" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to just be chakras it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.450" end="00:24:28.190" style="s2">just an example you could just take an</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.920" end="00:24:31.279" style="s2">area</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.190" end="00:24:33.379" style="s2">of your body that&#39;s hurting and tune in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.279" end="00:24:34.700" style="s2">and say what is this heart want me to</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.379" end="00:24:36.049" style="s2">know maybe you don&#39;t get anything but</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.700" end="00:24:37.700" style="s2">then you just kind of feel the pain and</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.049" end="00:24:39.289" style="s2">you or the tension or whatever it is and</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.700" end="00:24:41.840" style="s2">you say alright if this pain could talk</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.289" end="00:24:42.490" style="s2">what would it say and you see what comes</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.840" end="00:24:46.070" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.490" end="00:24:48.889" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting how often that ends up</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.070" end="00:24:50.480" style="s2">being insightful and when we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.889" end="00:24:54.429" style="s2">the mind brain interface or the mind</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.480" end="00:24:59.179" style="s2">body and face there are a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.429" end="00:25:02.000" style="s2">number of places where the top-down</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.179" end="00:25:04.039" style="s2">regulatory system has huge effects on</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.000" end="00:25:07.759" style="s2">all the other systems and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.039" end="00:25:10.850" style="s2">specifically emotions psychology end up</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.759" end="00:25:12.769" style="s2">affecting physiology you think about why</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.850" end="00:25:14.899" style="s2">does a placebo ever make anything better</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.769" end="00:25:18.259" style="s2">for anybody right like it doesn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.899" end="00:25:19.879" style="s2">make sense why a placebo like why isn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:25:26.539" end="00:25:29.600" style="s2">is already healing at its optimal</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.950" end="00:25:31.100" style="s2">capacity and taking the sugar pill isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.600" end="00:25:35.990" style="s2">interesting and it&#39;s not even the belief</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.100" end="00:25:38.840" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting it&#39;s when someone is</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.990" end="00:25:40.580" style="s2">in say someone has a disease state</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.840" end="00:25:43.519" style="s2">they&#39;re anxious about it and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.580" end="00:25:46.159" style="s2">anxious is mediated by cortisol and</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.519" end="00:25:48.830" style="s2">epinephrine and etc and so their</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.159" end="00:25:50.629" style="s2">cortisol is taking the precursor hormone</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:52.370" style="s2">pregnenolone and shunting it into</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.629" end="00:25:54.110" style="s2">cortisol in the adrenals which means</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.370" end="00:25:56.389" style="s2">less of its going to DHEA so the</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.110" end="00:25:59.720" style="s2">cortisol DHEA ratio gets higher well</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.389" end="00:26:02.899" style="s2">that ends up affecting everything from</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.720" end="00:26:05.600" style="s2">genetic transcription to lean muscle</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.899" end="00:26:08.389" style="s2">mass to bone density to so many things</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.600" end="00:26:11.179" style="s2">so then when the person believes they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.389" end="00:26:13.879" style="s2">going to get well and they feel better</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.179" end="00:26:15.710" style="s2">and their stress drops and their</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.879" end="00:26:17.299" style="s2">parasympathetic nervous system can kick</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.710" end="00:26:19.730" style="s2">on they&#39;re sympathetic nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.299" end="00:26:20.870" style="s2">chills out and their cortisol DHEA ratio</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.730" end="00:26:24.529" style="s2">moves in the right direction</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.870" end="00:26:26.090" style="s2">the actual reparative mechanisms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.529" end="00:26:30.259" style="s2">physiology are more available to them</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.090" end="00:26:31.909" style="s2">and so their body is healing as best as</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.259" end="00:26:33.590" style="s2">it can in the stress State and in a non</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.909" end="00:26:36.769" style="s2">stress State that can actually heal</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.590" end="00:26:38.600" style="s2">better right now one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.769" end="00:26:40.789" style="s2">things is it&#39;s placebo is not the only</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.600" end="00:26:42.050" style="s2">thing that can do that you look at work</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.789" end="00:26:45.710" style="s2">like Norman Cousins were</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.050" end="00:26:47.420" style="s2">where he just watched comedy because he</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.710" end="00:26:48.980" style="s2">thought he was dying of cancer and his</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.420" end="00:26:50.270" style="s2">cancer got better not because he</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.980" end="00:26:52.130" style="s2">believed he was gonna get better but</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.270" end="00:26:54.260" style="s2">because he was not stressed out and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.130" end="00:26:56.680" style="s2">was happy for the first time and ended</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.260" end="00:27:00.290" style="s2">up being that stress was meaningful to</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.680" end="00:27:03.380" style="s2">you know the process of pathology that</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.290" end="00:27:04.940" style="s2">was going on for him and so this doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.380" end="00:27:06.320" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s the only thing or that it</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.940" end="00:27:07.970" style="s2">will always be affecting sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.320" end="00:27:09.230" style="s2">placebo just affects how you sense</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.970" end="00:27:11.420" style="s2">something but not the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.230" end="00:27:14.330" style="s2">pathophysiology but it&#39;s a part of it so</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.420" end="00:27:18.020" style="s2">when you tune into pain in the body for</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.330" end="00:27:19.640" style="s2">instance or tension in the body is it</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.020" end="00:27:21.530" style="s2">possible that there is some</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.640" end="00:27:24.380" style="s2">psychological that&#39;s happening there</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.530" end="00:27:27.410" style="s2">where you can gain insights Austin are</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.380" end="00:27:30.260" style="s2">there other ways of affecting cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.410" end="00:27:33.080" style="s2">in your body that are meaningful in the</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.260" end="00:27:36.350" style="s2">long term other than this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.080" end="00:27:41.290" style="s2">observing your body and releasing it</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.350" end="00:27:43.640" style="s2">consciously oh yeah so this is like the</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.290" end="00:27:45.830" style="s2">first place that functional medicine</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.640" end="00:27:47.570" style="s2">doctors and naturopathic doctors talk to</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.830" end="00:27:50.470" style="s2">people which is understanding how the</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.570" end="00:27:52.850" style="s2">HPA axis works and that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.470" end="00:27:55.610" style="s2">dysregulation and the HPA axis usually</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.850" end="00:28:02.000" style="s2">starts at the a at the adrenal side and</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.610" end="00:28:04.970" style="s2">that roughly you can say the sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.000" end="00:28:07.400" style="s2">nervous system innervates the adrenal</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.970" end="00:28:09.650" style="s2">cortex and the primary hormone there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.400" end="00:28:12.190" style="s2">many coming from that processes cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.650" end="00:28:14.870" style="s2">and the parasympathetic nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.190" end="00:28:16.820" style="s2">innervates the adrenal medulla and there</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.870" end="00:28:18.890" style="s2">are again many hormones that are coming</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.820" end="00:28:22.190" style="s2">out but the primary one is DHEA so the</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.890" end="00:28:23.480" style="s2">ratio of cortisol to DHA as hormones in</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.190" end="00:28:25.490" style="s2">the endocrine system in the blood</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.480" end="00:28:27.740" style="s2">representing kind of systemic effects is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.490" end="00:28:30.140" style="s2">roughly equivalent to the sympathetic</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.740" end="00:28:32.810" style="s2">parasympathetic ratio of the system as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.140" end="00:28:35.930" style="s2">whole and you know related to chronic</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.810" end="00:28:38.390" style="s2">stress so in early phases of chronic</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.930" end="00:28:40.430" style="s2">stress cortisol goes up and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.390" end="00:28:43.490" style="s2">precursor the cortisol in the brain and</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.430" end="00:28:45.410" style="s2">ACTH goes up after that&#39;s been the case</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.490" end="00:28:47.390" style="s2">for a little while DHEA starts to go</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.410" end="00:28:49.250" style="s2">down because cortisol and DHEA are both</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.390" end="00:28:51.170" style="s2">made from the same precursor hormone</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.250" end="00:28:52.880" style="s2">called pregnenolone and it&#39;s a rate</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.170" end="00:28:55.879" style="s2">limited hormone there&#39;s a finite amount</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.880" end="00:28:57.649" style="s2">of it after a while if</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.879" end="00:28:59.479" style="s2">someone stays in chronic stress cortisol</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.649" end="00:29:01.969" style="s2">starts to drop too simply because the</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.479" end="00:29:05.299" style="s2">adrenal glands are fatigued and now DHA</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.969" end="00:29:08.389" style="s2">is way lower so you can see people in</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.299" end="00:29:10.940" style="s2">high or low cortisol adrenal stress</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.389" end="00:29:15.739" style="s2">states depending upon how long they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.940" end="00:29:18.619" style="s2">in that pathology but so so you can you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.739" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">can give someone bioidentical hormones</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.619" end="00:29:22.940" style="s2">or things that support hormones to get</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:24.529" style="s2">them in the right range quickly and make</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.940" end="00:29:27.979" style="s2">the person feel better so say you do a</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.529" end="00:29:29.749" style="s2">blood or a salivary hormone lab to look</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.979" end="00:29:31.039" style="s2">at adrenals you can do that but the big</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.749" end="00:29:33.349" style="s2">thing is just going to be dropping the</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.039" end="00:29:36.949" style="s2">stress low and the stress load is</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.349" end="00:29:39.379" style="s2">psychological and physiological so too</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.949" end="00:29:42.649" style="s2">much sugar and an unstable blood sugar</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.379" end="00:29:45.859" style="s2">cycle causes cortisol spiking body reads</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.649" end="00:29:48.349" style="s2">it as stress can continuous starvation</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.859" end="00:29:51.229" style="s2">cycle responses not enough sleep is a</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.349" end="00:29:53.119" style="s2">huge cause of stress both not enough</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.229" end="00:29:56.749" style="s2">exercise or exercising in a way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.119" end="00:29:59.389" style="s2">causing injury so you&#39;ve got and as well</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.749" end="00:30:01.639" style="s2">as toxins and pathogens that cause</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.389" end="00:30:04.309" style="s2">inflammation so all of those can cause</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.639" end="00:30:07.279" style="s2">chronic stress as well as all the</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.309" end="00:30:09.289" style="s2">psychological sources so one of the you</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.279" end="00:30:10.940" style="s2">know you can say that the first good</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.289" end="00:30:13.729" style="s2">part of neuro hacking is just health</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.940" end="00:30:16.339" style="s2">right health and well-being because so</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.729" end="00:30:19.940" style="s2">many people are dealing with brain fog</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.339" end="00:30:21.949" style="s2">or low-level anxiety depression before</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.940" end="00:30:23.690" style="s2">they seek to optimize beyond baseline</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.949" end="00:30:27.529" style="s2">just getting back to baseline is pretty</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.690" end="00:30:30.499" style="s2">great so identifying the things that</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.529" end="00:30:32.899" style="s2">took them below baseline and reversing</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.499" end="00:30:36.129" style="s2">those that shouldn&#39;t be the foundational</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.899" end="00:30:38.569" style="s2">stuff right I think so many people</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.129" end="00:30:41.419" style="s2">neglect that they&#39;re trying to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.569" end="00:30:43.489" style="s2">go to superhuman levels rather than just</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.419" end="00:30:46.449" style="s2">trying to optimize for what&#39;s missing or</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.489" end="00:30:50.089" style="s2">for what&#39;s kind of below normal levels</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.449" end="00:30:52.609" style="s2">so what else is in that spectrum of what</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.089" end="00:30:54.619" style="s2">people often overlook we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.609" end="00:30:57.469" style="s2">cortisol we&#39;ve talked about the gut</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.619" end="00:31:01.099" style="s2">microbiome are there any other important</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.469" end="00:31:02.779" style="s2">components of this equation sure this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.099" end="00:31:04.519" style="s2">not the sexy part this is the like</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.779" end="00:31:06.190" style="s2"> don&#39;t tell us about the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.519" end="00:31:08.659" style="s2">again part but it&#39;s just it&#39;s critical</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.190" end="00:31:09.610" style="s2">and then the sexy part is the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.659" end="00:31:11.290" style="s2">seems like</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.610" end="00:31:13.870" style="s2">chick bullets that make you make you</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.290" end="00:31:15.640" style="s2">have superhero powers so we&#39;ll get more</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.870" end="00:31:18.850" style="s2">into that the end but those parts really</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.640" end="00:31:20.650" style="s2">do there are some really neat exciting</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.850" end="00:31:22.990" style="s2">technologies that can be very powerfully</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.650" end="00:31:25.150" style="s2">augmenting but they really do function</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.990" end="00:31:27.460" style="s2">radically better in a well-tuned system</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.150" end="00:31:30.100" style="s2">in an already dysregulated system</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.460" end="00:31:31.630" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t help to get you</p>

<p begin="00:31:31.630" end="00:31:35.260" style="s2">system but we really want to be</p>

<p begin="00:31:35.260" end="00:31:42.490" style="s2">so first category asleep I say this</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.640" end="00:31:44.530" style="s2">because it ends up affecting more</p>

<p begin="00:31:52.419" end="00:31:58.510" style="s2">most of us to do a poor job with by</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.169" end="00:32:02.140" style="s2">sleep I mean both enough sleep and good</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.510" end="00:32:03.880" style="s2">quality sleep so even you know it&#39;s give</p>

<p begin="00:32:24.460" end="00:32:29.770" style="s2">sure that we&#39;re getting enough Delta</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.679" end="00:32:32.530" style="s2">sleep I would say is a is a huge</p>

<p begin="00:32:37.210" end="00:32:42.040" style="s2">are in place so that environmentally do</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.630" end="00:32:44.710" style="s2">you have a good sleeping environment you</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.040" end="00:32:47.710" style="s2">have a good bed is it dark is it quiet</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.710" end="00:32:51.900" style="s2">good air quality you&#39;re not in a room</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.710" end="00:32:54.400" style="s2">with mold or BOC etc and you don&#39;t have</p>

<p begin="00:32:54.400" end="00:32:59.200" style="s2">throughout the night we could do a whole</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.400" end="00:33:01.900" style="s2">show just on how to make it optimize</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.200" end="00:33:04.570" style="s2">sleeping environment and it&#39;s a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.900" end="00:33:07.630" style="s2">important thing factoring how how big a</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.570" end="00:33:09.010" style="s2">deal it is and then there are definitely</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.630" end="00:33:10.390" style="s2">supplements that people can take that</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.010" end="00:33:11.860" style="s2">will help them sleep better depending</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.390" end="00:33:13.360" style="s2">upon what&#39;s wrong with their sleep but</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.860" end="00:33:15.490" style="s2">if they&#39;re if they&#39;re not saving Locals</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.360" end="00:33:17.230" style="s2">they&#39;re waking up to pee a lot versus</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.490" end="00:33:19.540" style="s2">their snoring right those really need</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.230" end="00:33:21.840" style="s2">addressed in different ways but</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.540" end="00:33:23.140" style="s2">addressing them is really important</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.840" end="00:33:25.030" style="s2">there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.140" end="00:33:27.400" style="s2">the amount of light that you received</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.030" end="00:33:29.650" style="s2">before sleep so many people stay on</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.400" end="00:33:31.900" style="s2">their phone right before they go to bed</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.650" end="00:33:33.760" style="s2">and that can have really terrible</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.900" end="00:33:35.950" style="s2">implications because your brain doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.760" end="00:33:38.980" style="s2">produce enough melatonin yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.950" end="00:33:40.690" style="s2">cortisol and melatonin are in a</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.980" end="00:33:43.240" style="s2">circadian rhythm with each other where</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.690" end="00:33:44.890" style="s2">cortisol is high in the day low at night</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.240" end="00:33:47.470" style="s2">melatonin is low in the day high at</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.890" end="00:33:50.470" style="s2">night and it&#39;s a light stimulated cycle</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.470" end="00:33:51.820" style="s2">and so it&#39;s actually important to get</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.470" end="00:33:53.350" style="s2">enough bright light during the day if</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.820" end="00:33:55.900" style="s2">you don&#39;t and your cortisol doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.350" end="00:33:58.900" style="s2">actually go high then it won&#39;t come low</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.900" end="00:34:01.240" style="s2">enough and give you good sleep at night</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.900" end="00:34:03.970" style="s2">but it is important to avoid bright and</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.240" end="00:34:06.160" style="s2">blue light before bed so you see a lot</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.970" end="00:34:09.159" style="s2">of people wear of blue blocking glasses</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.160" end="00:34:11.409" style="s2">or the Flex app on their computer to</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.159" end="00:34:13.510" style="s2">take it out of the blue range you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.409" end="00:34:16.000" style="s2">things like that in general I would say</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.510" end="00:34:19.899" style="s2">a winddown routine before bed where you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.000" end="00:34:22.030" style="s2">stop taking in stressful things you stop</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.899" end="00:34:23.860" style="s2">blue in the bright light and you start</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.030" end="00:34:26.679" style="s2">preparing body and mind for sleep</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.860" end="00:34:29.380" style="s2">whether it&#39;s through a bath or the right</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.679" end="00:34:33.580" style="s2">kind of reading or stretching super</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.380" end="00:34:35.260" style="s2">useful we&#39;re working on some technology</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.580" end="00:34:37.780" style="s2">some biochemical technologies that</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.260" end="00:34:39.070" style="s2">induce better delta sleep a number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.780" end="00:34:42.820" style="s2">different ones one of the ones that were</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.070" end="00:34:45.490" style="s2">most excited about is a new kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.820" end="00:34:49.840" style="s2">brain inductions called phase-locked</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.490" end="00:34:52.510" style="s2">induction and this was a DARPA funded</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.840" end="00:34:54.909" style="s2">project originally with some people that</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.510" end="00:34:55.600" style="s2">were partnered with out of University of</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.909" end="00:35:00.160" style="s2">Northwestern</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.600" end="00:35:02.710" style="s2">and rather than try to induce Delta</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.160" end="00:35:06.550" style="s2">waves like using binaural beats or</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.710" end="00:35:09.550" style="s2">strobe lights or transcranial stem these</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.550" end="00:35:12.040" style="s2">researchers recognized that the brain</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.550" end="00:35:14.530" style="s2">actually resists having its brain wave</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.040" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">patterns changed externally pretty</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.530" end="00:35:18.940" style="s2">strongly because its own process for</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:20.440" style="s2">regulating the frequency that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.940" end="00:35:22.870" style="s2">which is the opening and closing of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.440" end="00:35:26.230" style="s2">ion gates is very very sensitive it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.870" end="00:35:28.120" style="s2">controlled by many factors and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.230" end="00:35:29.830" style="s2">really only susceptible to induction</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.120" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">when the gates are open and the ion</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.830" end="00:35:35.650" style="s2">channels are open and so they put EEG on</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.880" style="s2">people&#39;s head found out when the people</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.650" end="00:35:38.710" style="s2">went into Delta sleep</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.880" end="00:35:41.380" style="s2">they&#39;re specifically trying to improve</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.710" end="00:35:45.670" style="s2">the efficiency of Delta sleep and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.380" end="00:35:48.130" style="s2">exactly when the gates were open they</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.670" end="00:35:50.920" style="s2">put in a stimulus for the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.130" end="00:35:53.079" style="s2">wave pattern the same frequency that the</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.920" end="00:35:55.150" style="s2">brain was in where it was crest crest</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.079" end="00:35:56.829" style="s2">aligned so they weren&#39;t changing the</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.150" end="00:35:58.839" style="s2">Brayton wave pattern they were just</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.829" end="00:36:00.789" style="s2">adding more of the exact brainwave</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.839" end="00:36:05.319" style="s2">pattern that the brain was in to add</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.789" end="00:36:07.420" style="s2">amplitude which the hypothesis was would</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.319" end="00:36:08.740" style="s2">increase the efficiency of everything</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.420" end="00:36:11.680" style="s2">that was happening because you get more</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.740" end="00:36:14.470" style="s2">net communication per unit time</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.680" end="00:36:16.269" style="s2">happening and this happened and so the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.470" end="00:36:20.230" style="s2">first studies that were done were done</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.269" end="00:36:22.660" style="s2">on memory and they found a 400% increase</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.230" end="00:36:24.940" style="s2">in long-term memory and healthy adults</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.660" end="00:36:28.599" style="s2">after a week of using this technology</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.940" end="00:36:29.950" style="s2">and that&#39;s testing memory but if Delta</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.599" end="00:36:31.539" style="s2">sleep is going up that&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.950" end="00:36:33.640" style="s2">helping anxiety it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.539" end="00:36:35.559" style="s2">decreasing risk for Alzheimer&#39;s and the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.640" end="00:36:38.619" style="s2">effecting oxidation and the inflammation</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.559" end="00:36:41.559" style="s2">so this technology is not far from being</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.619" end="00:36:43.180" style="s2">market ready this is an example of like</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.559" end="00:36:45.700" style="s2">really fun neural hacks that were right</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.180" end="00:36:48.009" style="s2">on the brink out that is so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.700" end="00:36:50.170" style="s2">it sounds like it&#39;s almost tricking the</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.009" end="00:36:52.210" style="s2">brain into thinking that is doing a</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.170" end="00:36:54.549" style="s2">better job at whatever it&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.210" end="00:36:57.009" style="s2">doing than it actually is and I wonder</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.549" end="00:36:59.799" style="s2">if it has a feedback loop where the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.009" end="00:37:01.839" style="s2">brain picks up that oh this is really</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.799" end="00:37:03.579" style="s2">working and and then it knows how it</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.839" end="00:37:05.470" style="s2">arrived there because it was already</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.579" end="00:37:07.509" style="s2">doing that maybe just to a smaller</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.470" end="00:37:09.339" style="s2">degree and then it already knows how to</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.509" end="00:37:13.559" style="s2">do that and it does it better next time</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.339" end="00:37:16.150" style="s2">is that the case so there are some</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.559" end="00:37:17.859" style="s2">therapies where after you do them the</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.150" end="00:37:19.720" style="s2">brain continues to do them on its own</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.859" end="00:37:21.490" style="s2">because it learns how to do them that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.720" end="00:37:25.660" style="s2">kind of the exact opposite of the way we</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.490" end="00:37:27.250" style="s2">usually think of say psychopharmacology</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.660" end="00:37:28.690" style="s2">drugs right which is that they create</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.250" end="00:37:30.130" style="s2">dependence and addiction you get off of</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.690" end="00:37:33.430" style="s2">them and your brain can do that anymore</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.130" end="00:37:36.579" style="s2">because it overrode the natural</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.430" end="00:37:38.650" style="s2">regulatory system this is one of our</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.579" end="00:37:41.410" style="s2">primary design principles is that we</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.650" end="00:37:43.059" style="s2">want to understand what the brain&#39;s own</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.410" end="00:37:44.829" style="s2">regulatory process and the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.059" end="00:37:47.319" style="s2">regulatory process is doing and support</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.829" end="00:37:49.299" style="s2">it rather than override it in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.319" end="00:37:50.470" style="s2">whenever someone stops with that</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.299" end="00:37:53.670" style="s2">particular technology</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.470" end="00:37:56.859" style="s2">gee you have a net neutral - net</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.670" end="00:37:59.770" style="s2">positive lasting effect rather than a</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.859" end="00:38:01.869" style="s2">down-regulation independence I would say</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.770" end="00:38:05.080" style="s2">good neural hacking in general should</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.869" end="00:38:07.000" style="s2">have that as one of its criteria with</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.080" end="00:38:08.859" style="s2">this particular one I don&#39;t think a</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.000" end="00:38:10.150" style="s2">study has been done yet on someone using</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.859" end="00:38:11.950" style="s2">it for a while and then stopping and</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.150" end="00:38:15.280" style="s2">seeing if they continue to get that</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.950" end="00:38:17.590" style="s2">elevation from baseline I wouldn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.280" end="00:38:20.109" style="s2">it as much as it&#39;s trying to trick the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.590" end="00:38:23.500" style="s2">brain as it is supporting it by adding</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.109" end="00:38:25.180" style="s2">energy right like if you&#39;re if there&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.180" end="00:38:30.250" style="s2">person comes along to push it just goes</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.770" end="00:38:31.720" style="s2">better because there is you know more</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.250" end="00:38:35.170" style="s2">force being added to what&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.720" end="00:38:38.440" style="s2">happening and so here the goal was as</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.170" end="00:38:40.000" style="s2">the brain is modulating its frequency</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.440" end="00:38:42.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s at the max amplitude that it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.000" end="00:38:45.460" style="s2">can generate if we can just add energy</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.599" end="00:38:46.930" style="s2">so we&#39;re adding amplitude we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.460" end="00:38:48.609" style="s2">going to increase the efficiency of its</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.930" end="00:38:51.190" style="s2">process there&#39;s something very beautiful</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.609" end="00:38:52.570" style="s2">it does something very Aikido about not</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.190" end="00:38:54.670" style="s2">we know what the brain should be doing</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.570" end="00:38:57.520" style="s2">better and we&#39;re going to try and induce</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.670" end="00:39:00.430" style="s2">this specific frequency of Delta but we</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.520" end="00:39:01.960" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know why it is moving</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.430" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">between the frequencies exactly the way</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.960" end="00:39:06.130" style="s2">that it does but we&#39;re gonna kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:06.940" style="s2">trust it and follow it and just add</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.130" end="00:39:09.460" style="s2">resource</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.940" end="00:39:12.250" style="s2">I think stem cells is another way that</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.460" end="00:39:14.830" style="s2">you can think about that right did you</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.250" end="00:39:17.020" style="s2">think about stem cell therapy we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.830" end="00:39:19.030" style="s2">know how the stem cells differentiate</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.020" end="00:39:20.619" style="s2">into tissues fully and then all the</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.030" end="00:39:22.930" style="s2">metabolic functions of those cells do</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.619" end="00:39:26.440" style="s2">but we&#39;re simply adding resource to the</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.930" end="00:39:29.800" style="s2">system in general I think the approach</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.440" end="00:39:31.990" style="s2">to support the system&#39;s own regulatory</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.800" end="00:39:36.400" style="s2">processes doing what they do better as</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.990" end="00:39:38.740" style="s2">opposed to trying to override them is a</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.400" end="00:39:41.490" style="s2">is a key distinction and how we should</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.740" end="00:39:44.710" style="s2">approach tech interface with the body</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.490" end="00:39:47.290" style="s2">interesting and so when it comes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.710" end="00:39:49.869" style="s2">supplements is this also your approach</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.290" end="00:39:51.820" style="s2">that you&#39;re trying to support what the</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.869" end="00:39:53.770" style="s2">body&#39;s already doing rather than kind of</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.820" end="00:39:56.500" style="s2">installing a new program oh this is how</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.770" end="00:39:59.490" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna do it body okay yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.500" end="00:40:01.330" style="s2">course so you know like with the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.490" end="00:40:02.830" style="s2">supplements that we&#39;ve developed and</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.330" end="00:40:04.300" style="s2">more that we&#39;re in process of developing</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.830" end="00:40:06.640" style="s2">so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.300" end="00:40:09.340" style="s2">take quality as an example it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.640" end="00:40:11.410" style="s2">nootropic product cognitive enhancement</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.340" end="00:40:13.330" style="s2">product that we made because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.410" end="00:40:14.980" style="s2">good example here so some of the</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.330" end="00:40:16.270" style="s2">ingredients are actually just nutrients</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.980" end="00:40:18.610" style="s2">right they&#39;re nutrients that you should</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.270" end="00:40:19.960" style="s2">get in food and if you&#39;re eating a</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.610" end="00:40:22.050" style="s2">healthy diet you&#39;ll be getting more of</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.960" end="00:40:25.780" style="s2">them than not but their nutrients that</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.050" end="00:40:28.960" style="s2">either are very commonly deficient even</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.780" end="00:40:30.250" style="s2">in good diets for a number of reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.960" end="00:40:32.650" style="s2">certain trace minerals that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.250" end="00:40:35.650" style="s2">important for brain function they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.650" end="00:40:38.470" style="s2">just deficient in soil even organic soil</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.650" end="00:40:40.210" style="s2">is still very different than before the</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.470" end="00:40:45.100" style="s2">soil originally went through a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.210" end="00:40:46.420" style="s2">mono cropping and plants can&#39;t make</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.100" end="00:40:47.920" style="s2">minerals right they&#39;re gonna pull up the</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.420" end="00:40:49.840" style="s2">minerals that are in the soil similarly</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.920" end="00:40:51.520" style="s2">if the soil is deficient in microbiota</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.840" end="00:40:55.390" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna affect the plant chemistry if</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.520" end="00:40:56.860" style="s2">the plants been hybridized so if there</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.390" end="00:40:58.390" style="s2">are common deficiencies in certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.860" end="00:41:01.570" style="s2">nutrients that are necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.390" end="00:41:03.610" style="s2">cognitive capacity or sleep or something</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.570" end="00:41:05.590" style="s2">like that making sure that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.610" end="00:41:07.630" style="s2">enough of them that&#39;s just augmenting</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.590" end="00:41:09.730" style="s2">eating and that doesn&#39;t mean that you</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.630" end="00:41:11.890" style="s2">can then eat poorly right so I use the</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.730" end="00:41:14.890" style="s2">word supplement right is that it is to</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.890" end="00:41:17.670" style="s2">supplement to be in addition to because</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.890" end="00:41:19.930" style="s2">what someone takes a few grams of and</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.670" end="00:41:22.000" style="s2">pills compared to what they&#39;re taking</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.930" end="00:41:24.130" style="s2">like pounds up and food there&#39;s no way</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.000" end="00:41:26.500" style="s2">that that&#39;s going to replace the primary</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.130" end="00:41:29.290" style="s2">effect but it can meaningfully add to it</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.500" end="00:41:31.990" style="s2">but also it just like if someone is</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.290" end="00:41:34.630" style="s2">going to be using some function a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.990" end="00:41:35.830" style="s2">more in an evolutionary environment</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.630" end="00:41:37.870" style="s2">would have had them use that function</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.830" end="00:41:40.120" style="s2">right so if Letta cailli someone&#39;s gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.870" end="00:41:42.310" style="s2">be sweating a lot more they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.120" end="00:41:43.660" style="s2">lose electrolytes faster so we give them</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.310" end="00:41:45.580" style="s2">electrolytes and actually makes a</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.660" end="00:41:48.730" style="s2">difference where they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.580" end="00:41:50.200" style="s2">using branched chain amino acids to</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.730" end="00:41:51.850" style="s2">build skeletal muscle more of they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.200" end="00:41:53.830" style="s2">tearing down skeletal muscle so we</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.850" end="00:41:56.140" style="s2">supplement brain shame yes there are</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.830" end="00:41:57.430" style="s2">nutrients that get used faster when</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.140" end="00:41:59.620" style="s2">someone is in certain kinds of cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.430" end="00:42:01.180" style="s2">process so if they want to spend a lot</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.620" end="00:42:02.440" style="s2">of time and peak cognitive process</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.180" end="00:42:04.000" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna burn through those quicker</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.440" end="00:42:06.550" style="s2">so you want to supplement them its brain</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.000" end="00:42:10.240" style="s2">nutrients and that is just the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.550" end="00:42:11.710" style="s2">gonna convert those so say the the amino</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.240" end="00:42:13.570" style="s2">acids that can get converted to</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.710" end="00:42:14.560" style="s2">neurotransmitters the vitamins and</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.570" end="00:42:15.910" style="s2">minerals that are involved in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.560" end="00:42:17.860" style="s2">conversion process the body&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.910" end="00:42:19.300" style="s2">convert them as it needs them but</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.860" end="00:42:22.090" style="s2">not going to have nutrition be a rate</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.300" end="00:42:25.710" style="s2">limiting factor so that&#39;s obviously</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.090" end="00:42:30.670" style="s2">working with endogenous pathway support</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.710" end="00:42:34.720" style="s2">there are other things where say we are</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.670" end="00:42:40.080" style="s2">looking at the acetylcholine pathway has</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.720" end="00:42:43.510" style="s2">a lot to do with memory and learning and</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.080" end="00:42:46.350" style="s2">sensory motor function speed of neuronal</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.510" end="00:42:48.250" style="s2">communication so the body is producing</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.350" end="00:42:50.080" style="s2">acetylcholine it&#39;s moving across</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.250" end="00:42:52.660" style="s2">synapses it&#39;s getting received in the</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.080" end="00:42:55.000" style="s2">postsynaptic receptors we can give</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.660" end="00:42:58.750" style="s2">plants or chemicals that modulate that</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.000" end="00:43:01.840" style="s2">process but that modulate the process in</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.750" end="00:43:03.490" style="s2">a much more holistic way than say</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.840" end="00:43:05.440" style="s2">traditional psychopharmacological</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.490" end="00:43:07.120" style="s2">proaches which is a single drug</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.440" end="00:43:09.340" style="s2">intervention that&#39;s going to affect one</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.120" end="00:43:11.170" style="s2">part right like adderall being a</p>
<p begin="00:43:09.340" end="00:43:13.330" style="s2">presynaptic dopamine agonist and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.170" end="00:43:14.950" style="s2">not necessarily looking at how that</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.330" end="00:43:17.140" style="s2">works within the whole dopamine cycle</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.950" end="00:43:18.790" style="s2">and how dopamine relates to</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.140" end="00:43:21.190" style="s2">norepinephrine and epinephrine and</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.790" end="00:43:22.810" style="s2">serotonin the rest of the whole rest of</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.190" end="00:43:23.710" style="s2">neurotransmission so we want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.810" end="00:43:25.060" style="s2">if we&#39;re gonna affect another</p>
<p begin="00:43:23.710" end="00:43:27.520" style="s2">transmitter we want to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.060" end="00:43:30.610" style="s2">entire cycle of that transmitter we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.520" end="00:43:33.160" style="s2">to look at the cellular processes of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.610" end="00:43:34.480" style="s2">pre and post synaptic neuron and we want</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.160" end="00:43:37.060" style="s2">to look at all the other transmitters</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.480" end="00:43:38.830" style="s2">and signaling chemicals that it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.060" end="00:43:40.600" style="s2">relationship with and make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.830" end="00:43:44.560" style="s2">we&#39;re actually supporting a holistic</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.600" end="00:43:46.330" style="s2">process right and so you&#39;ve got to</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.560" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">factor if you&#39;re wanting to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.330" end="00:43:51.070" style="s2">run more acetylcholine to the system the</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:52.720" style="s2">body&#39;s ability to acetylate the choline</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.070" end="00:43:54.760" style="s2">so that you have enough acetyl group you</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.720" end="00:43:56.410" style="s2">have choline certain source of choline</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.760" end="00:43:57.820" style="s2">can go to the peripheral neuron or to</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.410" end="00:43:59.500" style="s2">the central nervous system so depending</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.820" end="00:44:03.790" style="s2">upon what you want to do you do that</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.500" end="00:44:05.410" style="s2">differently and then there are you know</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.790" end="00:44:07.810" style="s2">rate limiting cofactors like for that</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.410" end="00:44:08.830" style="s2">one it happens to be b5 so you want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.810" end="00:44:09.340" style="s2">make sure that&#39;s not gonna be rate</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.830" end="00:44:12.040" style="s2">limiting</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.340" end="00:44:13.840" style="s2">but then the acetylcholine getting</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.040" end="00:44:15.220" style="s2">across the synapse you have enzymes that</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.840" end="00:44:17.560" style="s2">are breaking it down just like you have</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.220" end="00:44:20.220" style="s2">enzymes that are breaking down dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.560" end="00:44:23.700" style="s2">or serotonin so you know many of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.220" end="00:44:25.690" style="s2">pharmaceutical meds that affect</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.700" end="00:44:27.400" style="s2">transmitter levels are working by</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.690" end="00:44:29.170" style="s2">modulating what&#39;s happening in the</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.400" end="00:44:31.420" style="s2">synaptic cleft right we have taken</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.170" end="00:44:36.130" style="s2">hibbett ER so if some</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.420" end="00:44:38.470" style="s2">has genetically high mao levels or comt</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.130" end="00:44:43.750" style="s2">levels or acetylcholine esterase levels</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.470" end="00:44:45.790" style="s2">then they&#39;re going to be sub functional</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.750" end="00:44:47.470" style="s2">in that area and you can actually be</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.790" end="00:44:50.140" style="s2">able to you know to have a nutria</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.470" end="00:44:52.359" style="s2">genomic override to that and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.140" end="00:44:55.000" style="s2">gonna be producing more acetylcholine</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.359" end="00:44:57.160" style="s2">and you wanted to get across the synapse</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.000" end="00:44:58.839" style="s2">so you&#39;re gonna you know help with</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.160" end="00:44:59.950" style="s2">acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.839" end="00:45:01.720" style="s2">then you actually want to get it up</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.950" end="00:45:04.270" style="s2">taken in the postsynaptic neuron right</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.720" end="00:45:05.349" style="s2">today the NMDA receptors primarily there</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.270" end="00:45:08.589" style="s2">are things that you can use it will</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.349" end="00:45:11.950" style="s2">modulate that receptor if you support</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.589" end="00:45:13.839" style="s2">the entire cycle of how the body is</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.950" end="00:45:15.430" style="s2">actually producing you&#39;ll get a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.839" end="00:45:17.230" style="s2">optimum results and you&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.430" end="00:45:19.329" style="s2">getting the body learning how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.230" end="00:45:21.040" style="s2">and being able to actually have</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.329" end="00:45:23.140" style="s2">plasticity effect right it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:45:21.040" end="00:45:25.990" style="s2">rewire to that state if it does that</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.140" end="00:45:27.460" style="s2">state a significant amount and then when</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.990" end="00:45:31.420" style="s2">someone gets off it they&#39;ll either have</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.460" end="00:45:34.119" style="s2">a little effect or lasting positive</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.420" end="00:45:35.589" style="s2">effects because they have rewired one of</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.119" end="00:45:39.190" style="s2">the bigger ways that you get lasting</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.589" end="00:45:41.319" style="s2">effects is by actually working to change</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.190" end="00:45:43.960" style="s2">brain structure in a positive direction</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.319" end="00:45:46.660" style="s2">so this is things like can we help the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.960" end="00:45:48.790" style="s2">brain develop more new neurons and</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.660" end="00:45:51.069" style="s2">increased gray matter density or in or</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.790" end="00:45:54.579" style="s2">develop more new synapses so it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.069" end="00:45:58.150" style="s2">neurogenesis or synaptogenesis so we get</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.579" end="00:46:00.640" style="s2">more densely interconnected brain</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.150" end="00:46:02.400" style="s2">structures and there do happen to be a</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.640" end="00:46:04.690" style="s2">lot of things that are known about</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.400" end="00:46:07.450" style="s2">specific nutrients and specific</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.690" end="00:46:09.220" style="s2">chemicals that do support the brains</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.450" end="00:46:11.319" style="s2">natural process of neurogenesis</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.220" end="00:46:14.200" style="s2">happening more robustly or the brains</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.319" end="00:46:15.849" style="s2">process of Naruto a killing old</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.200" end="00:46:18.430" style="s2">senescent brain cells that cause</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.849" end="00:46:21.430" style="s2">problems and allowing new ones to you</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.430" end="00:46:22.660" style="s2">know proliferate and so these are these</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.430" end="00:46:26.410" style="s2">are examples of ways you could get</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.660" end="00:46:28.119" style="s2">lasting benefit after you know from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.410" end="00:46:29.859" style="s2">biochemical solution after stopping</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.119" end="00:46:33.160" style="s2">taking the biochemical solution because</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.859" end="00:46:37.180" style="s2">it&#39;s actually seeking to one just tune</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.160" end="00:46:38.950" style="s2">the system better and to rewire to</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.180" end="00:46:41.079" style="s2">enough regulated State and three</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.950" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">actually support the development of new</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.079" end="00:46:45.280" style="s2">structures this is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.839" end="00:46:46.270" style="s2">I wanted to rewind slide</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.280" end="00:46:48.660" style="s2">to where you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.270" end="00:46:51.970" style="s2">neurotransmitters that regulate mood</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.660" end="00:46:55.000" style="s2">because there&#39;s a huge industry of</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.970" end="00:46:57.910" style="s2">selling drugs that regulate mood that</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.000" end="00:47:00.160" style="s2">actually have adverse long-term effects</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.910" end="00:47:02.500" style="s2">if you stop taking them or if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.160" end="00:47:04.270" style="s2">continue taking them they kind of lose</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.500" end="00:47:07.990" style="s2">their effectiveness in a way over time</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.270" end="00:47:11.580" style="s2">and for example I have experience taking</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.990" end="00:47:14.860" style="s2">SSRIs and I had both of those effects</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.580" end="00:47:17.200" style="s2">with withdrawal after coming off of them</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.860" end="00:47:20.080" style="s2">and and decreasing effectiveness over</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.200" end="00:47:21.990" style="s2">time but what you&#39;re talking about is</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.080" end="00:47:25.330" style="s2">that it&#39;s actually possible to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.990" end="00:47:27.340" style="s2">supplements or drugs that have net</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.330" end="00:47:28.930" style="s2">positive effects over time even if you</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.340" end="00:47:30.670" style="s2">stop taking them can you talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.930" end="00:47:33.310" style="s2">a bit specifically when it comes to mood</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.670" end="00:47:39.510" style="s2">regulation yeah so let me say that the</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.310" end="00:47:42.370" style="s2">the ideal way to approach this is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.510" end="00:47:46.150" style="s2">personalized medicine or personalized</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.370" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">well-being approach because so say the</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.150" end="00:47:51.550" style="s2">SSRI did something good for you for a</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:54.010" style="s2">while but then it had side effects and</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.550" end="00:47:55.930" style="s2">it had down regulation and you adapted</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.010" end="00:47:58.900" style="s2">to it did it do some good for you</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.930" end="00:48:00.790" style="s2">because you actually had a dysbiosis</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.900" end="00:48:03.460" style="s2">issue in your gut where you just were</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.790" end="00:48:05.350" style="s2">not producing half of the serotonin that</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.460" end="00:48:07.570" style="s2">you need that&#39;s an important question</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.350" end="00:48:09.880" style="s2">right because if so I wouldn&#39;t even want</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.570" end="00:48:14.020" style="s2">to give you brain supplements I want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.880" end="00:48:16.090" style="s2">fix your gut or was there actually</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.020" end="00:48:20.320" style="s2">something where your diet was deficient</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.090" end="00:48:22.270" style="s2">in tryptophan and so the raw amino acid</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.320" end="00:48:23.410" style="s2">necessary to make serotonin was low and</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.270" end="00:48:29.170" style="s2">we just actually had to address your</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.410" end="00:48:33.460" style="s2">diet right or so there&#39;s so many things</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.170" end="00:48:38.580" style="s2">that can be involved and we can say in</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.460" end="00:48:40.420" style="s2">general if someone takes 5htp which is</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.580" end="00:48:42.610" style="s2">5-hydroxytryptophan hydroxylated</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.420" end="00:48:45.220" style="s2">tryptophan that&#39;s just one conversion</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.610" end="00:48:47.770" style="s2">step away from 5-hydroxytryptamine to</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.220" end="00:48:50.890" style="s2">serotonin and they take the</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.770" end="00:48:55.450" style="s2">phosphorylated version of b6 p5p that it</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.890" end="00:48:58.570" style="s2">converts the h5 HTTP to serotonin that</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.450" end="00:48:59.260" style="s2">they&#39;re much since that&#39;s just the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.570" end="00:49:01.060" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.260" end="00:49:03.040" style="s2">is one step away from serotonin the body</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.060" end="00:49:04.750" style="s2">be working with any ways that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.040" end="00:49:07.210" style="s2">less likely to get dependence and</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.750" end="00:49:09.010" style="s2">down-regulation from just having enough</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.210" end="00:49:16.090" style="s2">of those things than they would from an</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.010" end="00:49:17.590" style="s2">SSRI that&#39;s true and and ideally I would</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.090" end="00:49:19.810" style="s2">find out what&#39;s going on first because</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.590" end="00:49:22.180" style="s2">we also see so many people who they get</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.810" end="00:49:25.150" style="s2">on an SSRI and then they get much worse</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.180" end="00:49:27.130" style="s2">right so many of the shooting cases that</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.150" end="00:49:29.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve seen were after someone was put on</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.130" end="00:49:31.090" style="s2">an SSRI who hadn&#39;t been on it before and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.080" end="00:49:33.730" style="s2">the suicidal homicidal tendencies are</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.090" end="00:49:35.260" style="s2">true because if someone is more dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.730" end="00:49:37.150" style="s2">deficient in their depression and they</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.260" end="00:49:39.790" style="s2">really needed something like wellbutrin</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.150" end="00:49:41.590" style="s2">instead like this is what&#39;s so crazy to</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.790" end="00:49:44.950" style="s2">me is we don&#39;t even do any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.590" end="00:49:46.930" style="s2">testing to see that the neurochemical</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.950" end="00:49:49.570" style="s2">imbalance before we give them chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.930" end="00:49:51.400" style="s2">rather than psychology and then to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.570" end="00:49:52.600" style="s2">degree that there even is a</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.400" end="00:49:54.880" style="s2">neurochemical amounts we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.600" end="00:49:56.680" style="s2">which one or which ones and then to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.880" end="00:49:59.200" style="s2">degree that we even knew which one we</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.680" end="00:50:02.200" style="s2">don&#39;t know why it&#39;s off and the answer</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.200" end="00:50:06.900" style="s2">is just straight to a drug yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.200" end="00:50:11.110" style="s2">just crazy it is and think about this so</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.900" end="00:50:15.010" style="s2">your brain is as complex a system as we</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.110" end="00:50:19.480" style="s2">know of existing in universe right and</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.010" end="00:50:20.890" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the the number of neurons and</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.480" end="00:50:22.270" style="s2">of glial cells and the number of</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.890" end="00:50:25.180" style="s2">synaptic connections and the number</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.270" end="00:50:26.800" style="s2">metabolic processes per individual one</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.180" end="00:50:28.870" style="s2">and the feedback and feed-forward</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.800" end="00:50:32.680" style="s2">processes is just completely</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.870" end="00:50:34.920" style="s2">mind-boggling so when you think about</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.680" end="00:50:37.720" style="s2">something like serotonin right that is a</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.920" end="00:50:41.020" style="s2">it&#39;s a signaling molecule that&#39;s the end</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.720" end="00:50:43.690" style="s2">of many steps of metabolic transform so</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.020" end="00:50:45.640" style="s2">if it&#39;s low how likely is it that other</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.690" end="00:50:47.140" style="s2">things are low or high or dysregulated</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.640" end="00:50:49.060" style="s2">or there&#39;s something else off like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.140" end="00:50:50.500" style="s2">pretty high right when we just go</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.060" end="00:50:52.570" style="s2">straight to let&#39;s get more serotonin</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.500" end="00:50:59.170" style="s2">right let&#39;s keep it from you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.570" end="00:51:02.290" style="s2">reuptake and because we have to you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.170" end="00:51:04.600" style="s2">in the drug the drug industry has to use</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.290" end="00:51:06.340" style="s2">synthetic single molecules to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.600" end="00:51:07.540" style="s2">get them patented which is the only way</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.340" end="00:51:10.960" style="s2">that they could ever make enough money</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.540" end="00:51:12.640" style="s2">to go through FDA trials and that&#39;s FDA</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.960" end="00:51:14.440" style="s2">but every country has you</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.640" end="00:51:16.630" style="s2">some version but I think us probably</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.440" end="00:51:19.840" style="s2">leads the way in some of both the good</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.630" end="00:51:22.470" style="s2">and bad aspects of this what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.840" end="00:51:24.640" style="s2">chance that a single synthetic molecule</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.470" end="00:51:26.260" style="s2">meaning it&#39;s not part of your natural</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.640" end="00:51:28.840" style="s2">landscape at all and it&#39;s just one</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.260" end="00:51:31.120" style="s2">molecule could ever be an adequate</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.840" end="00:51:33.220" style="s2">solution to a complex chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.120" end="00:51:36.460" style="s2">dysregulation in a self-organizing</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.220" end="00:51:39.250" style="s2">system like your brain like it just</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.460" end="00:51:41.080" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even make sense right it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.250" end="00:51:42.670" style="s2">make sense that that could possibly be</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.080" end="00:51:45.700" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s really gonna repair it</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.670" end="00:51:48.010" style="s2">yeah so it&#39;s usually gonna be not one</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.700" end="00:51:50.500" style="s2">molecule that&#39;s off but lots of them and</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.010" end="00:51:52.750" style="s2">so then we have to from maybe lots of</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.500" end="00:51:54.790" style="s2">different processes so how do we</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.750" end="00:51:58.030" style="s2">identify what&#39;s going on and support the</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.790" end="00:52:00.670" style="s2">system&#39;s increasing its own internal</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.030" end="00:52:02.740" style="s2">resilience I mean this same is like when</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.670" end="00:52:03.970" style="s2">you talk about cognitive chemistry this</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.740" end="00:52:06.400" style="s2">cognitive chemistry mediated via</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.970" end="00:52:08.650" style="s2">dopamine or via acetylcholine or</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.400" end="00:52:11.410" style="s2">glutamate or sodium ion channels or</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.650" end="00:52:13.270" style="s2">long-term potentiation or all those</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.410" end="00:52:15.310" style="s2">things right complex interactions and</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.270" end="00:52:16.720" style="s2">lots of those things and so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.310" end="00:52:18.520" style="s2">key things is that when you&#39;re wanting</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.720" end="00:52:20.500" style="s2">to work with a complex system like a</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.520" end="00:52:23.740" style="s2">brain you&#39;ve really got to have a more</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.500" end="00:52:26.500" style="s2">complexity informed approach than single</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.740" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">molecule interventions mm-hmm so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.500" end="00:52:30.940" style="s2">saying we&#39;re mostly involved in this</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:33.910" style="s2">single molecule interventions because</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.940" end="00:52:35.410" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s profitable it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.910" end="00:52:37.630" style="s2">that&#39;s what&#39;s profitable that&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.410" end="00:52:38.890" style="s2">thing that you can because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.630" end="00:52:41.920" style="s2">profitable it&#39;s only thing you can even</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.890" end="00:52:43.300" style="s2">afford to do research on right you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.920" end="00:52:45.220" style="s2">when you hear things like well there are</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.300" end="00:52:45.850" style="s2">not so many good scientific trials done</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.220" end="00:52:48.250" style="s2">on herbs</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.850" end="00:52:50.050" style="s2">who the would pay for them I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.250" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">you&#39;ll see little trials done on herbs</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.050" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">but it costs a billion dollars give or</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:57.010" style="s2">take to take a drug through FDA approval</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:52:59.290" style="s2">well who&#39;s gonna put in a billion</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.010" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">dollars and then when you take the drug</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.290" end="00:53:01.870" style="s2">through you&#39;re not even sure that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:03.400" style="s2">gonna work in the market and then you</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.870" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">have a class-action lawsuit at the end</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.400" end="00:53:06.820" style="s2">like you&#39;ve got to have a twenty billion</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:09.580" style="s2">dollar potential on that for it to make</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.820" end="00:53:11.170" style="s2">any sense to even embark on right so of</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.580" end="00:53:13.750" style="s2">course you&#39;ve got to have a patent on it</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.170" end="00:53:16.930" style="s2">and so if you have something that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.750" end="00:53:18.100" style="s2">patentable and even in the drug space</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.930" end="00:53:19.660" style="s2">there are certain drugs that got</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.100" end="00:53:20.860" style="s2">published about in a way that makes them</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.660" end="00:53:22.210" style="s2">unpatentable and even though they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.860" end="00:53:24.540" style="s2">super promising they just don&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.210" end="00:53:26.020" style="s2">developed because who would develop</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.540" end="00:53:27.670" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.020" end="00:53:29.650" style="s2">if it&#39;s not a synthetic chemical if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.670" end="00:53:32.170" style="s2">already available in nature they</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.650" end="00:53:35.380" style="s2">probably can&#39;t patent it for example in</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.170" end="00:53:38.890" style="s2">my case I&#39;ve been using peganum harmala</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.380" end="00:53:42.160" style="s2">seeds for mood regulation and I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.890" end="00:53:44.110" style="s2">really excellent effects with them much</p>
<p begin="00:53:42.160" end="00:53:47.140" style="s2">much better than I ever had with SSRIs</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.110" end="00:53:49.900" style="s2">also combined with meditation and diet</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.140" end="00:53:51.700" style="s2">adjustments but you know if something</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.900" end="00:53:53.560" style="s2">like that was patented as a mood</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.700" end="00:53:56.470" style="s2">regulation supplement if they probably</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.560" end="00:53:59.860" style="s2">couldn&#39;t patent it well no they they</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.470" end="00:54:01.680" style="s2">definitely can&#39;t patent it but even some</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.860" end="00:54:05.080" style="s2">synthetics can&#39;t get patented because</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.680" end="00:54:06.550" style="s2">you know the information was already</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.080" end="00:54:09.550" style="s2">released and so now it&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.550" end="00:54:12.550" style="s2">Commons or after the patent life on a</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.550" end="00:54:14.080" style="s2">drug expires and so now it&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.550" end="00:54:16.630" style="s2">profitable because the generics are all</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.080" end="00:54:18.520" style="s2">going to be really cheap then we need to</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.630" end="00:54:20.170" style="s2">before a drug company look for a new</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.520" end="00:54:22.300" style="s2">thing in that space even if the new</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.170" end="00:54:23.830" style="s2">things are not better or even shittier</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.300" end="00:54:26.470" style="s2">than the previous thing simply because</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.830" end="00:54:29.440" style="s2">we just can&#39;t make money doing that so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.470" end="00:54:31.600" style="s2">what are the ways around it supplements</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.440" end="00:54:33.460" style="s2">don&#39;t have to go through FDA approval</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.600" end="00:54:35.800" style="s2">think about from pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.460" end="00:54:38.500" style="s2">what it means to invest something like a</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.800" end="00:54:41.110" style="s2">billion dollars of capital before you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.500" end="00:54:43.090" style="s2">made your first dollar back right like</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.110" end="00:54:45.790" style="s2">that&#39;s so far from Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.090" end="00:54:49.000" style="s2">software tech thinking that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.790" end="00:54:52.960" style="s2">money to invest before you know actually</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.000" end="00:54:55.480" style="s2">having any revenue but yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.960" end="00:54:58.510" style="s2">supplements they don&#39;t have to do that</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.480" end="00:55:01.180" style="s2">but they can&#39;t claim that they have any</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.510" end="00:55:02.410" style="s2">medical purpose or heal anything so then</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.180" end="00:55:03.490" style="s2">that becomes the tricky thing if they</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.410" end="00:55:04.960" style="s2">want to claim it they have to go through</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.490" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">FDA process if they&#39;re gonna go through</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.960" end="00:55:09.190" style="s2">FDA process that&#39;s super expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:10.810" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna have to have a profit</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.190" end="00:55:13.330" style="s2">stream to be able to justify it so</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.810" end="00:55:17.080" style="s2">that&#39;s the deal basically to really fix</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.330" end="00:55:18.760" style="s2">that the entire regulatory financial and</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.080" end="00:55:22.630" style="s2">intellectual property structures have to</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.760" end="00:55:26.070" style="s2">be changed and realistically I can say</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.630" end="00:55:28.510" style="s2">for-profit medicine is a broken system</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.070" end="00:55:33.150" style="s2">because when you have a for-profit sick</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.510" end="00:55:35.650" style="s2">care system where people come in ill</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.150" end="00:55:37.720" style="s2">pharmaceuticals or hospitals or</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.650" end="00:55:39.700" style="s2">insurance or anybody you know any money</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.720" end="00:55:41.560" style="s2">that&#39;s going to be made in the</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.700" end="00:55:42.970" style="s2">two trillion dollar complex of health</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.560" end="00:55:45.250" style="s2">care is only made when people are sick</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.970" end="00:55:50.440" style="s2">so prevention would just obsolete that</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.250" end="00:55:52.030" style="s2">entire profit stream right and so then</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.440" end="00:55:56.140" style="s2">you start thinking about patients as</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.030" end="00:55:57.670" style="s2">customers and every MBA first thing they</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.140" end="00:56:01.000" style="s2">learn is how do you maximize the</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.670" end="00:56:02.680" style="s2">lifetime value of a customer and that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.000" end="00:56:05.109" style="s2">should never apply to a patient right</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.680" end="00:56:07.150" style="s2">theory of markets the free market should</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.109" end="00:56:09.520" style="s2">apply to things that one can choose in</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.150" end="00:56:13.089" style="s2">to choose out of you can&#39;t reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.520" end="00:56:16.660" style="s2">choose out of health care and so it</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.089" end="00:56:18.430" style="s2">should not be structured in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.660" end="00:56:20.470" style="s2">for-profit way that it is any more than</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.430" end="00:56:21.940" style="s2">for-profit prisons should be yeah you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.470" end="00:56:25.390" style="s2">optimizing for what you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.940" end="00:56:26.650" style="s2">exactly you know as I was talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.390" end="00:56:28.990" style="s2">group that was working on peace and</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.650" end="00:56:31.750" style="s2">reconciliation the other day and I asked</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.990" end="00:56:35.020" style="s2">them what&#39;s the chance of having the</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.750" end="00:56:36.820" style="s2">world free from war or any militarized</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.020" end="00:56:39.070" style="s2">conflict while having a for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.820" end="00:56:42.550" style="s2">military-industrial complex lastingly</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.070" end="00:56:44.619" style="s2">and they realized that supply and demand</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.550" end="00:56:46.240" style="s2">theory says zero percent chance that</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.619" end="00:56:50.589" style="s2">those two could coexist in during Lee</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.240" end="00:56:52.480" style="s2">right because if there isn&#39;t demand for</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.589" end="00:56:55.060" style="s2">that supply it&#39;ll shut down and stop</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.480" end="00:56:58.060" style="s2">existing will be a for-profit complex or</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.060" end="00:57:03.250" style="s2">it will have to do supply-side economics</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.060" end="00:57:06.359" style="s2">and create demand and so that means that</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.250" end="00:57:11.380" style="s2">you have the largest block of economics</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.359" end="00:57:14.710" style="s2">have its own survival antithetical to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.380" end="00:57:18.609" style="s2">global peace that&#39;s that&#39;s a up</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.710" end="00:57:19.960" style="s2">structure for Humanity and for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.609" end="00:57:21.250" style="s2">prisons are the same and for-profit</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.960" end="00:57:23.020" style="s2">health care is the same when you start</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.250" end="00:57:26.109" style="s2">going through you see how many places</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.020" end="00:57:28.450" style="s2">the financial incentive the game theory</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.109" end="00:57:31.960" style="s2">is exactly opposite to what the</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.450" end="00:57:34.050" style="s2">collective goal should be so like what</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.960" end="00:57:37.420" style="s2">it takes to really fix medicine and</p>

<p begin="00:58:40.480" end="00:58:45.190" style="s2">whole different set of incentives it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.120" end="00:58:47.320" style="s2">different kind of science it&#39;s different</p>

<p begin="00:58:47.320" end="00:58:51.520" style="s2">structures and so yes there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.350" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">things that we want to evolve in</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.520" end="00:58:55.600" style="s2">diagnostic medicine and therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:58.060" style="s2">medicine and AI interpretation and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.600" end="00:59:01.150" style="s2">know but deeper than all that are these</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.060" end="00:59:03.340" style="s2">meta structures that need to evolve so</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.150" end="00:59:06.160" style="s2">going back to the kind of specific</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.340" end="00:59:06.910" style="s2">approaches that you are taking how are</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.160" end="00:59:08.710" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.910" end="00:59:10.120" style="s2">building these meta structures in a</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.710" end="00:59:14.920" style="s2">different way than they currently exist</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.120" end="00:59:16.900" style="s2">yeah so we&#39;re obviously within the</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.920" end="00:59:19.150" style="s2">within the confines of those meta</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.900" end="00:59:21.790" style="s2">structures to begin with so we&#39;re our</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.150" end="00:59:24.210" style="s2">first products are supplements the</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.790" end="00:59:26.680" style="s2">reason why we chose to do supplements is</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.210" end="00:59:27.910" style="s2">to be able to bring things direct to</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.680" end="00:59:29.770" style="s2">consumer that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.910" end="00:59:32.040" style="s2">called rather than to go through FDA</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.770" end="00:59:34.180" style="s2">process and a doctor process and</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.040" end="00:59:36.850" style="s2">specifically since we&#39;re working with</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.180" end="00:59:38.680" style="s2">some synthetics but largely you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.850" end="00:59:40.440" style="s2">synthetics and natural compounds both so</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.680" end="00:59:43.180" style="s2">a lot of unpatentable things and</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.440" end="00:59:44.860" style="s2">combinations of them and you know moving</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.180" end="00:59:47.710" style="s2">towards customizable combinations it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.860" end="00:59:49.000" style="s2">outside of patentability so for all</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.710" end="00:59:52.540" style="s2">those reasons that made sense and</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.000" end="00:59:54.790" style="s2">because we wanted to be able to control</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.540" end="00:59:57.910" style="s2">the integrity of the company we wanted</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.790" end="01:00:00.910" style="s2">to take on very little capital and only</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.910" end="01:00:02.290" style="s2">very values align capital and so we</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.910" end="01:00:04.090" style="s2">wanted to build things that we could</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.290" end="01:00:05.430" style="s2">actually build ourselves first to then</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.090" end="01:00:07.380" style="s2">be able to grow the company and</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.430" end="01:00:09.549" style="s2">continues for like friends</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.380" end="01:00:11.769" style="s2">the first product we brought to market</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.549" end="01:00:15.609" style="s2">quality our cogs on their right just our</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.769" end="01:00:17.619" style="s2">cost of goods is higher than the retail</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.609" end="01:00:20.499" style="s2">costs of most other cognitive enhancers</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.619" end="01:00:22.119" style="s2">on the market and all the investors</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.499" end="01:00:24.009" style="s2">looked at well you got to get the cogs</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.119" end="01:00:26.920" style="s2">down and like there is no way to get it</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.009" end="01:00:29.019" style="s2">down until we get to huge economies of</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.920" end="01:00:31.859" style="s2">scale and vert and owning our own supply</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.019" end="01:00:34.210" style="s2">chain without cutting quality because I</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.859" end="01:00:36.519" style="s2">run a bunch of additional steps of</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.210" end="01:00:38.440" style="s2">testing to make sure that there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.519" end="01:00:40.479" style="s2">know optimized purity and potency and</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.440" end="01:00:43.150" style="s2">that no mycotoxin or whatever got into</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.479" end="01:00:45.400" style="s2">the supply and manufacturing and use</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.150" end="01:00:48.099" style="s2">forms that are more expensive forms of</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.400" end="01:00:49.690" style="s2">all the ingredients and you know amounts</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.099" end="01:00:52.869" style="s2">that are actually meaningful which is</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.690" end="01:00:55.599" style="s2">expensive so part of it is when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.869" end="01:00:57.729" style="s2">working within those structures knowing</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.599" end="01:00:59.499" style="s2">what your mission is very clearly so</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.729" end="01:01:01.269" style="s2">your mission is not delivering returns</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.499" end="01:01:03.009" style="s2">to shareholders first it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.269" end="01:01:04.869" style="s2">delivering meaningful technology to</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.009" end="01:01:06.069" style="s2">enrich people&#39;s lives and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.869" end="01:01:08.710" style="s2">have something that they&#39;ll do that you</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.069" end="01:01:12.430" style="s2">just don&#39;t do it that&#39;s a really key</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.710" end="01:01:16.329" style="s2">first part of it right and then being</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.430" end="01:01:21.130" style="s2">able to grow while maintaining control</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.329" end="01:01:22.299" style="s2">of that mission is a key part of it how</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.130" end="01:01:24.690" style="s2">else we working with those meta</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.299" end="01:01:27.369" style="s2">structures well we open-source our</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.690" end="01:01:29.920" style="s2">information so as far as IP we just</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.369" end="01:01:32.680" style="s2">don&#39;t believe in it so rather than say</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.920" end="01:01:34.809" style="s2">we have a proprietary blend of this</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.680" end="01:01:36.729" style="s2">number of milligrams of things we just</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.809" end="01:01:38.499" style="s2">have the exact number of milligrams of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.729" end="01:01:40.150" style="s2">the exact sources and all the sourcing</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.499" end="01:01:41.319" style="s2">info so if anyone wants to just go buy</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.150" end="01:01:42.880" style="s2">the raw ingredients make it themselves</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.319" end="01:01:44.319" style="s2">they&#39;re welcome to if someone wants to</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.880" end="01:01:46.869" style="s2">try and make a better formula they can</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.319" end="01:01:49.779" style="s2">because we just want to support the</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.869" end="01:01:52.989" style="s2">field advancing for optimized human</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.779" end="01:01:55.140" style="s2">wellbeing as best as possible and so</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.989" end="01:01:59.999" style="s2">that&#39;s we we have a strong open-source</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.140" end="01:02:02.349" style="s2">take on everything IP and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.999" end="01:02:05.200" style="s2">reinvesting our capital in developing</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.349" end="01:02:07.359" style="s2">new technologies and really focusing on</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.200" end="01:02:09.549" style="s2">not where is the highest profit margin</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.359" end="01:02:10.719" style="s2">technology but what are the technologies</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.549" end="01:02:12.279" style="s2">that will really make the biggest</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.719" end="01:02:13.660" style="s2">difference in addressing the things that</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.279" end="01:02:16.329" style="s2">cause most suffering that are the least</p>
