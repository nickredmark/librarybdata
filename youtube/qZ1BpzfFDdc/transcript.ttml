<p begin="00:01:31.679" end="00:01:34.440" style="s2">been a bit of a roller coaster journey</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.910" end="00:01:37.319" style="s2">like I put out the glitch in the matrix</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.440" end="00:01:38.940" style="s2">documentary and then Jordan Pederson got</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.319" end="00:01:40.979" style="s2">in touch to say do you mind if I put it</p>

<p begin="00:01:45.450" end="00:01:52.349" style="s2">and then I found this remix of a glitch</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.470" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">in the matrix before he posted it by the</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.349" end="00:01:56.610" style="s2">way oh well that was I did that a good</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:58.229" style="s2">couple of weeks before and it was</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.610" end="00:02:00.929" style="s2">fantastic I was very excited when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.229" end="00:02:04.470" style="s2">found it I actually stopped what I was</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.929" end="00:02:07.700" style="s2">doing I normally get up have a steak go</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.470" end="00:02:10.470" style="s2">into the studio and I got up and I was a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.700" end="00:02:11.970" style="s2">salting my steak and I that came up in</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.470" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">my YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.970" end="00:02:15.960" style="s2">thank you to the YouTube algorithms I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:17.010" style="s2">get into this in a bit but I put it on</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.960" end="00:02:18.360" style="s2">and then ended up just watching the</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.010" end="00:02:21.180" style="s2">whole thing rather than going straight</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.360" end="00:02:23.280" style="s2">to the studio and it was fantastic and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.180" end="00:02:25.380" style="s2">knew immediately that I wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.280" end="00:02:28.200" style="s2">something with it musically which are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.380" end="00:02:31.130" style="s2">not done before was normally I find sort</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.200" end="00:02:33.300" style="s2">of pieces of audio to tell a whole story</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.130" end="00:02:34.890" style="s2">that I already want to tell or</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.300" end="00:02:37.200" style="s2">what-have-you but you&#39;d basically done</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.890" end="00:02:38.910" style="s2">something that I wanted to do and you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.200" end="00:02:41.070" style="s2">done it perfectly so it was like okay I</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.910" end="00:02:43.320" style="s2">just need to get the right music for</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.070" end="00:02:45.480" style="s2">this and it&#39;ll be a wonderful useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.320" end="00:02:46.950" style="s2">thing yeah because I first saw it and I</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.480" end="00:02:48.420" style="s2">thought oh wow someone&#39;s put a backing</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.950" end="00:02:50.250" style="s2">track to the documentary and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.420" end="00:02:52.320" style="s2">that&#39;s pretty cool but then I watch it I</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.250" end="00:02:54.860" style="s2">was like no there&#39;s some real production</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.320" end="00:03:00.840" style="s2">skill in here</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.860" end="00:03:02.950" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.840" end="00:03:04.900" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s been that&#39;s been the</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.950" end="00:03:07.870" style="s2">reaction all over</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.900" end="00:03:09.400" style="s2">I think that was Peterson&#39;s reaction he</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.870" end="00:03:10.750" style="s2">was instantly like thought this was</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.400" end="00:03:13.780" style="s2">gonna be silly and was mute and then was</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.750" end="00:03:15.160" style="s2">like oh this is actually artful and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.780" end="00:03:17.350" style="s2">were now it&#39;s actually proving useful</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.160" end="00:03:20.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s generally the reaction from</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.350" end="00:03:22.690" style="s2">people came to the memes stayed for the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.460" end="00:03:23.920" style="s2">amazingness or whatever you think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.690" end="00:03:26.830" style="s2">gonna be silly and they did it and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.920" end="00:03:31.470" style="s2">it has silliness about it I suppose but</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.830" end="00:03:33.670" style="s2">it actually works on a on many levels</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.470" end="00:03:35.260" style="s2">silly without the fingers with that is I</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.670" end="00:03:37.390" style="s2">pretty much know almost instantly as</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.260" end="00:03:40.330" style="s2">well what this sort of sonic palette was</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.390" end="00:03:44.380" style="s2">which was this sort of sci-fi dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.330" end="00:03:47.200" style="s2">vapour trap synth thing which is quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.380" end="00:03:51.880" style="s2">specific and then it&#39;s a case if you</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.200" end="00:03:53.310" style="s2">like my themes you know them fix with</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.880" end="00:03:56.680" style="s2">your voice and it fits with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.310" end="00:03:57.940" style="s2">Britishness that comes to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.680" end="00:03:59.530" style="s2">particularly now I&#39;ve been away for</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.940" end="00:04:02.490" style="s2">three and a half years and I came back</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.530" end="00:04:07.180" style="s2">and things are very disturbing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.490" end="00:04:11.019" style="s2">it&#39;s like a kind of a ZZZ BBC drama of</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.180" end="00:04:13.420" style="s2">the future aesthetic has become the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.019" end="00:04:15.280" style="s2">truth this idea we used to have of what</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.420" end="00:04:18.070" style="s2">the future might be like if things went</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.280" end="00:04:20.350" style="s2">a bit wrong but you&#39;re living in America</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.070" end="00:04:22.120" style="s2">so you&#39;ve got your own dystopian fantasy</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.350" end="00:04:24.580" style="s2">to worry about the American dystopian</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.120" end="00:04:28.180" style="s2">fantasy is kind of sort of a Technicolor</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.580" end="00:04:30.700" style="s2">almost Jack Kirby kind of like pop art</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.180" end="00:04:33.940" style="s2">thing and the British one is this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.700" end="00:04:37.000" style="s2">of like grim it&#39;s like the more sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.940" end="00:04:39.130" style="s2">George Orwell I guess oldest Huxley yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.000" end="00:04:41.380" style="s2">Huxley had it completely right but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.130" end="00:04:43.360" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s a lot like the movie of V</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.380" end="00:04:44.890" style="s2">for Vendetta being away for three and a</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.360" end="00:04:47.449" style="s2">half years coming back it looks and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.890" end="00:04:50.040" style="s2">sounds and feels like that</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.449" end="00:04:51.720" style="s2">yeah he has really yeah basically</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.040" end="00:04:54.810" style="s2">basically it&#39;s like him in Grant</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.720" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">Morrison it&#39;s kind of the Orwell and</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.810" end="00:05:00.990" style="s2">Huxley thing you have these two ideas</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:03.210" style="s2">and they&#39;re both kind of right although</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.990" end="00:05:04.650" style="s2">I would say brave new world has thus far</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.210" end="00:05:07.139" style="s2">turned out to be a more accurate</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.650" end="00:05:10.169" style="s2">representation but we don&#39;t get sexy</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.139" end="00:05:13.380" style="s2">drugs we&#39;ve got technology we have two</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.169" end="00:05:16.080" style="s2">we have the the cocaine rush of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.380" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">facebook-like versus actual good drugs</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.080" end="00:05:21.660" style="s2">that was one thing I was disappointed</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:23.370" style="s2">lots of the future has come to pass in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.660" end="00:05:26.400" style="s2">way that I hoped it would but drugs in</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.370" end="00:05:27.630" style="s2">the future of rubbish terribly now</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.400" end="00:05:29.639" style="s2">you&#39;ve just got this little dopamine</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.630" end="00:05:31.620" style="s2">rush of a light and that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.639" end="00:05:33.479" style="s2">how drug nowadays yes there&#39;s a little</p>

<p begin="00:05:44.729" end="00:05:51.479" style="s2">smack government smack is the grip drug</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.229" end="00:05:52.800" style="s2">of choice for the youth of today which</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.479" end="00:05:54.650" style="s2">is a very depressing state of affairs</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.800" end="00:05:58.800" style="s2">you might as well stay indoors like</p>

<p begin="00:06:03.330" end="00:06:13.590" style="s2">beautiful vapor trap which and yes so</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.180" end="00:06:17.159" style="s2">one has to find a musical sort of tone</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.590" end="00:06:20.070" style="s2">an aesthetic and then one has to make it</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.159" end="00:06:21.570" style="s2">work harmoniously and key you scoring</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.070" end="00:06:23.849" style="s2">the thing here but it also has to kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.570" end="00:06:27.570" style="s2">of go on the emotional journey and kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.849" end="00:06:30.750" style="s2">of hit the points and sort of accentuate</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.570" end="00:06:33.270" style="s2">what&#39;s already there a lot of the effect</p>

<p begin="00:07:10.260" end="00:07:15.640" style="s2">even more he&#39;s very easy to work with as</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.390" end="00:07:19.210" style="s2">his voice is an instrument because he</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.640" end="00:07:23.200" style="s2">speaks very deliberately and sonorous ly</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.210" end="00:07:25.300" style="s2">and rhythmically anyway he actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.200" end="00:07:27.340" style="s2">speaks in in a kind of form of rhythmic</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.300" end="00:07:28.750" style="s2">poetry sometimes he is actually rapping</p>

<p begin="00:07:28.750" end="00:07:33.970" style="s2">retiming on him sometimes and you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.060" end="00:07:35.620" style="s2">like bits of a rap song he just does</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.970" end="00:07:37.390" style="s2">that nationally and then other people</p>

<p begin="00:07:41.680" end="00:07:47.970" style="s2">you some of these subjects of your film</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.590" end="00:07:50.380" style="s2">did require a lot of tidying up to get</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.970" end="00:07:52.360" style="s2">the more musical nature of what they</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.380" end="00:07:54.670" style="s2">were doing and some less so communal</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.360" end="00:07:56.440" style="s2">package is very funny I&#39;d wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.670" end="00:08:01.750" style="s2">something with her icon I imagined she&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.440" end="00:08:03.340" style="s2">be like a speed garage oh she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.750" end="00:08:04.690" style="s2">brilliant and I&#39;ve been running I was</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.340" end="00:08:07.720" style="s2">thinking of doing a mini package away of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.690" end="00:08:10.060" style="s2">anyway she talks about aesthetics a lot</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.720" end="00:08:12.310" style="s2">it&#39;s just like perfect for that world I</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.060" end="00:08:15.700" style="s2">don&#39;t how much you know about that but</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.310" end="00:08:18.310" style="s2">aesthetics is aesthetic is a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.700" end="00:08:21.190" style="s2">the vaporwave think it&#39;s almost the core</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.310" end="00:08:22.720" style="s2">of it it&#39;s the aesthetic I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.190" end="00:08:25.240" style="s2">know what vaporwave is I saw that on</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.720" end="00:08:27.880" style="s2">your on your bio you&#39;d like it it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.240" end="00:08:30.970" style="s2">it&#39;s ironic some have pointed out to use</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.880" end="00:08:34.419" style="s2">it well use aspects of it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.970" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">postmodern music and this original idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.419" end="00:08:38.320" style="s2">was a postmodern idea in her a lot of it</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.120" style="s2">was used to sort of its attack</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.320" end="00:08:42.430" style="s2">capitalism or at least make statements</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.120" end="00:08:43.990" style="s2">about capitalism and vacuous Ness of</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.430" end="00:08:47.460" style="s2">modern culture and stuff but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.990" end="00:08:49.960" style="s2">involved so initially it would take a</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.460" end="00:08:53.110" style="s2">bit of music and sort of slow it down</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.960" end="00:08:54.550" style="s2">and loop it forever for like eight</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.110" end="00:08:56.020" style="s2">minutes like a bit of a Diana Ross song</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.550" end="00:08:58.810" style="s2">or something you sort of slow it down</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.020" end="00:09:01.360" style="s2">and then loop it and sort of drag out</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.810" end="00:09:03.130" style="s2">the pathos from the thing and you would</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.360" end="00:09:06.150" style="s2">twin that with visuals and the visuals</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.130" end="00:09:09.010" style="s2">would be like sort of pink and blue and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.150" end="00:09:11.320" style="s2">Evian Wars of bottles a bit of a wind</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.010" end="00:09:14.290" style="s2">95 logo or something call these like</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.320" end="00:09:16.750" style="s2">bits of our culture that kind of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.290" end="00:09:19.329" style="s2">could be interpreted as sort of dead and</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.750" end="00:09:20.860" style="s2">purely caps a list with unsold us but</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.329" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">then that created a whole subculture if</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.860" end="00:09:26.230" style="s2">then it creating brilliant music as</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:28.470" style="s2">these things always do my take on it was</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.230" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">fusing it with a low fire hip-hop and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:34.089" style="s2">some other things I like liked rap and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:39.399" style="s2">contemporary sort of music production</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.089" end="00:09:42.760" style="s2">ideas to create soundscapes of depth and</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.399" end="00:09:45.600" style="s2">length when I first came across it I</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.760" end="00:09:48.910" style="s2">assumed that you were American yes and</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.600" end="00:09:51.639" style="s2">it ironically I didn&#39;t really put this</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.910" end="00:09:53.980" style="s2">into the glitch documentary so much but</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.639" end="00:09:55.740" style="s2">a lot of what I was talking to Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.980" end="00:09:57.610" style="s2">about with synchronicities yes</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.740" end="00:09:59.410" style="s2">synchronicities are like meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.610" end="00:10:02.459" style="s2">coincidences that seems somehow to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.410" end="00:10:07.630" style="s2">related to the structure of being and</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.459" end="00:10:10.810" style="s2">then I saw your remix of the documentary</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.630" end="00:10:12.370" style="s2">and then you happen to be coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.810" end="00:10:14.980" style="s2">UK for the first time for two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.370" end="00:10:16.480" style="s2">after this yes I&#39;ve been here three and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.980" end="00:10:19.449" style="s2">a half years but though Here I am and</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.480" end="00:10:22.779" style="s2">here you are of course these things</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.449" end="00:10:24.730" style="s2">always happen Grant Morrison would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.779" end="00:10:26.500" style="s2">we did say that the first step to</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.730" end="00:10:28.000" style="s2">becoming he&#39;s a chaos magician as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.500" end="00:10:30.459" style="s2">as a writer and the first step to</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.000" end="00:10:32.440" style="s2">becoming a magician is to knows his</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.459" end="00:10:33.760" style="s2">synchronicity you start noticing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.440" end="00:10:35.670" style="s2">and the more you notice them the more</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.760" end="00:10:39.000" style="s2">they occur yeah it&#39;s kind of you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.670" end="00:10:42.699" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of the fabric of being</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.000" end="00:10:44.410" style="s2">Muhammad Malcolm X said when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.699" end="00:10:47.319" style="s2">noticing synchronicities you&#39;re walking</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.410" end="00:10:48.519" style="s2">with Allah was his thing on that so you</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.319" end="00:10:49.810" style="s2">know as it&#39;s always been that way</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.519" end="00:10:51.279" style="s2">whenever I&#39;m doing anything in life</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.810" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">that&#39;s correct and I find I am on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.279" end="00:10:54.069" style="s2">correct path and you know when you&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:56.339" style="s2">the correct path then you know his</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.069" end="00:10:58.510" style="s2">synchronicities all over the place and</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.339" end="00:11:00.490" style="s2">some would say that that&#39;s proof that</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.510" end="00:11:01.959" style="s2">we&#39;re living in a simulation and some</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.490" end="00:11:03.790" style="s2">would say that&#39;s proof of God and</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.959" end="00:11:08.440" style="s2">there&#39;s many people have all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.790" end="00:11:10.449" style="s2">thoughts about this but all the the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.440" end="00:11:14.610" style="s2">observable fact is that when one is</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.449" end="00:11:17.430" style="s2">observing these things like meaning</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.610" end="00:11:20.400" style="s2">becomes ever more apparent and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.430" end="00:11:22.050" style="s2">the worth of what you&#39;re doing becomes</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.400" end="00:11:24.750" style="s2">ever more apparent and then it just</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.050" end="00:11:28.380" style="s2">spawns more stuff interesting that you</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.750" end="00:11:32.040" style="s2">say as well that Peterson has a very</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.380" end="00:11:34.620" style="s2">musical or a very performative aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.040" end="00:11:36.900" style="s2">his speech because that also ties into</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.620" end="00:11:38.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what I really like about his his</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.900" end="00:11:41.700" style="s2">philosophy is that he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.700" end="00:11:43.710" style="s2">performing that performance or aligning</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.700" end="00:11:45.210" style="s2">yourself with the truth and if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.710" end="00:11:48.300" style="s2">aligning yourself with the logos of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.210" end="00:11:50.490" style="s2">creative principle you would expect to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.300" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">be for that to have an effect on your</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.490" end="00:11:55.260" style="s2">actual performance but he feels like a</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:57.900" style="s2">very embodied speaker when he&#39;s on stage</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.260" end="00:11:59.970" style="s2">like he&#39;s fully inhabiting the stories</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.900" end="00:12:03.000" style="s2">that he&#39;s that he&#39;s telling and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.970" end="00:12:04.680" style="s2">that performative aspect of it is seems</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.000" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">to me at least also related to what he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.680" end="00:12:07.530" style="s2">talking about the logo of something</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:09.630" style="s2">incarnated more in your life and</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.530" end="00:12:13.200" style="s2">incarnate and more in your in your being</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.630" end="00:12:14.910" style="s2">yes and watching him become that over</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.200" end="00:12:18.840" style="s2">the years because he was not always as</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.910" end="00:12:21.900" style="s2">as confident and able to just now you</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.840" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">know you freestyles right he&#39;s his whole</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.900" end="00:12:29.280" style="s2">career yes all careers really reminded</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:35.010" style="s2">me of it&#39;s very $0.50 for example got</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.280" end="00:12:37.050" style="s2">big off the back of drama there was</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.010" end="00:12:39.600" style="s2">created drama you know beefs with other</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.050" end="00:12:41.130" style="s2">rappers and being shot 13 times and all</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.600" end="00:12:43.110" style="s2">this stuff which draws people into the</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.130" end="00:12:46.650" style="s2">story but then he had this huge body of</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.110" end="00:12:48.870" style="s2">work and that kept people there Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.650" end="00:12:50.520" style="s2">did this Peterson had these public</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.870" end="00:12:52.740" style="s2">dramas and that brought people to him</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.520" end="00:12:54.600" style="s2">but then when they got to him they there</p>

<p begin="00:13:22.380" end="00:13:25.410" style="s2">entertaining but then he pulls you in</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.670" end="00:13:28.980" style="s2">and then there&#39;s all this meaning and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.410" end="00:13:30.660" style="s2">this huge body of work but he&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.980" end="00:13:33.720" style="s2">new on this lake if you watch him</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.660" end="00:13:35.850" style="s2">like 15 years ago it was a bit awkward</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.720" end="00:13:37.820" style="s2">and sort of he was very charming</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.850" end="00:13:40.980" style="s2">and he knew what he was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.820" end="00:13:43.350" style="s2">but the absolute beast that he</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.980" end="00:13:45.060" style="s2">has become as a performance creature who</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.350" end="00:13:47.490" style="s2">can now just rock up at an amphitheatre</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.060" end="00:13:49.590" style="s2">and just like freestyle the new to our</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.490" end="00:13:51.390" style="s2">lecture off the top of his head and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.590" end="00:13:53.520" style="s2">very into not repeating himself too much</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.390" end="00:13:54.660" style="s2">in his lake you go see a standard</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.520" end="00:13:56.580" style="s2">chameleon you&#39;ll see pretty much the</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.660" end="00:13:58.280" style="s2">same set every week for like a year or</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.580" end="00:14:01.950" style="s2">something he won&#39;t do that</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.280" end="00:14:03.660" style="s2">he&#39;s more like a very good DJ you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.950" end="00:14:04.860" style="s2">he has all these yes like a fistful of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.660" end="00:14:06.390" style="s2">things that you know his works together</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.860" end="00:14:07.470" style="s2">and they&#39;re linked and he can take you</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.390" end="00:14:09.420" style="s2">on these different journeys but</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.470" end="00:14:12.410" style="s2">depending on who&#39;s in the room and where</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.420" end="00:14:14.880" style="s2">he is he will create a new and</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.410" end="00:14:18.540" style="s2">transformative always experience yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.880" end="00:14:20.820" style="s2">and he also describes that as a dialogue</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.540" end="00:14:23.070" style="s2">even if it&#39;s Oh even if he&#39;s the only</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.820" end="00:14:24.690" style="s2">one speaking he&#39;s speaking deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.070" end="00:14:26.970" style="s2">and if you watch some of the lectures in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.690" end="00:14:28.920" style="s2">his classroom you&#39;ll see him pick out</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.970" end="00:14:31.230" style="s2">one person at a time to speak to and</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.920" end="00:14:33.240" style="s2">then he&#39;ll change what he&#39;s saying based</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.230" end="00:14:34.950" style="s2">on their facial reaction as their</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.240" end="00:14:36.060" style="s2">response if he says something that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.950" end="00:14:37.650" style="s2">little bit too much you can see him</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.060" end="00:14:40.110" style="s2">correcting himself in the moment or</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.650" end="00:14:42.690" style="s2">adding a bit more context so it is very</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.110" end="00:14:44.070" style="s2">live yeah I&#39;m a very good DJ and if</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.690" end="00:14:45.390" style="s2">you&#39;re a very good DJ that&#39;s exactly</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.070" end="00:14:47.520" style="s2">what you do you don&#39;t just go in there</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.390" end="00:14:49.080" style="s2">and like play thirty records in a</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.520" end="00:14:51.450" style="s2">sequence that you&#39;ve already preordained</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.080" end="00:14:52.860" style="s2">you go in there and you you have some</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.450" end="00:14:54.300" style="s2">idea of where you want to go and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.860" end="00:14:57.090" style="s2">where you want to end up taking these</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.300" end="00:14:58.380" style="s2">people but it&#39;s all very different</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.090" end="00:15:00.090" style="s2">depending on who&#39;s in the room and who</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.380" end="00:15:01.620" style="s2">walks in at any given point or how they</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.090" end="00:15:03.930" style="s2">react to one thing at any given point</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.620" end="00:15:06.450" style="s2">and all that and yeah he&#39;s become quite</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.930" end="00:15:08.400" style="s2">masterful at that so he&#39;s a great battle</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.450" end="00:15:10.020" style="s2">rapper he&#39;s a great dude yes he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.400" end="00:15:12.090" style="s2">kind of this is yeah he&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.020" end="00:15:14.750" style="s2">perfect contemporary pop star and now</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.090" end="00:15:18.180" style="s2">pop stars are also neutered and boring</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.750" end="00:15:20.610" style="s2">yeah I mean for God if you look at if</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.180" end="00:15:24.020" style="s2">you look at rap now compared to rap in</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.610" end="00:15:26.460" style="s2">the 90s the stuff that biggie was saying</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.020" end="00:15:28.050" style="s2">that he would do to you and your mother</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.460" end="00:15:30.300" style="s2">and all that sort of thing you just</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.050" end="00:15:31.680" style="s2">don&#39;t it doesn&#39;t happen anymore even</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.300" end="00:15:35.040" style="s2">rappers have just become very very</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.680" end="00:15:36.510" style="s2">self-conscious and scared to offend so</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.040" end="00:15:38.340" style="s2">there&#39;s certain things they&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.510" end="00:15:41.040" style="s2">to say in certain groups they&#39;re allowed</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.340" end="00:15:42.690" style="s2">to say things about that they stay away</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.040" end="00:15:44.310" style="s2">from the most part of stuff which is why</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.690" end="00:15:45.690" style="s2">instrumental one of the many reasons</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.310" end="00:15:47.400" style="s2">instrumental hip hop is now the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.690" end="00:15:49.260" style="s2">your honor on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.400" end="00:15:51.260" style="s2">can you talk through the process of</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.260" end="00:15:53.700" style="s2">making say the the 12 rules for life</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.260" end="00:15:55.890" style="s2">piece which I&#39;ve played a few times and</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.700" end="00:15:57.300" style="s2">keep getting more out of it this process</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.890" end="00:15:58.620" style="s2">of making 12 rules for life was</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.300" end="00:16:01.740" style="s2">completely different in the pro that my</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.620" end="00:16:03.660" style="s2">previous process which was tell I wanted</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.740" end="00:16:06.270" style="s2">to put across Peterson&#39;s ideas in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.660" end="00:16:07.860" style="s2">form of sort of arcing stories over a</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.270" end="00:16:09.210" style="s2">low fire music that would take you on an</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.860" end="00:16:12.240" style="s2">emotional journey that was doing a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.210" end="00:16:13.920" style="s2">similar thing so I would find little</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.240" end="00:16:15.180" style="s2">bits of lots of different lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.920" end="00:16:17.160" style="s2">I&#39;d often find him talking about the</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.180" end="00:16:19.500" style="s2">same thing but over the course of 20</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.160" end="00:16:21.900" style="s2">years in different lectures tell that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.500" end="00:16:23.880" style="s2">story from lots of little pieces so what</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.900" end="00:16:24.870" style="s2">was his response because you you said</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.880" end="00:16:26.790" style="s2">you&#39;ve been in touch with him what did</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.870" end="00:16:28.470" style="s2">he what did he make of it yeah he really</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.790" end="00:16:32.790" style="s2">liked he loves it he says it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.470" end="00:16:34.920" style="s2">surreal he asked me to come and perform</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.790" end="00:16:36.570" style="s2">with him at the all few minutes Angelus</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.920" end="00:16:38.100" style="s2">he wanted me to come down and sort of DJ</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.570" end="00:16:40.050" style="s2">and open the thing but unfortunately the</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.100" end="00:16:43.529" style="s2">Orpheum wouldn&#39;t accommodate that as</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.050" end="00:16:45.210" style="s2">such late notice but yeah he had that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.529" end="00:16:47.400" style="s2">show and my whole thing with 12 rules</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.210" end="00:16:48.900" style="s2">was to get it done in time to be around</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.400" end="00:16:50.970" style="s2">the time he put the book out and so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.900" end="00:16:54.210" style="s2">when he played in Los Angeles it will be</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.970" end="00:16:56.730" style="s2">ready and yeah yeah he was very into it</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.210" end="00:16:57.870" style="s2">and I spoke with his wife Tammy and</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.730" end="00:16:59.850" style="s2">afterwards since she said they&#39;re both</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.870" end="00:17:03.480" style="s2">loved it and we&#39;re really kind of amazed</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.850" end="00:17:05.730" style="s2">at how he was actually good and sort of</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.480" end="00:17:07.800" style="s2">ridiculous and he despised the whole</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.730" end="00:17:09.540" style="s2">thing very very very very surreal and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.800" end="00:17:11.670" style="s2">said when he writes me said this is real</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.540" end="00:17:14.550" style="s2">ba he was thinking about using tracks</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.670" end="00:17:18.870" style="s2">from it to like open his lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.550" end="00:17:20.610" style="s2">he&#39;s going on tour later this year it</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.870" end="00:17:22.980" style="s2">must be incredibly bizarre for him I</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.610" end="00:17:27.600" style="s2">mean he&#39;s become sort of the most the</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.980" end="00:17:29.929" style="s2">biggest internet meme of this year yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.600" end="00:17:32.310" style="s2">yeah exactly I must be a very strange</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.929" end="00:17:34.290" style="s2">for decades and decades he&#39;s been doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.310" end="00:17:35.850" style="s2">this very specifically very dedicated</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.290" end="00:17:37.380" style="s2">Lee getting up at the same time every</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.850" end="00:17:40.800" style="s2">day work until the same point of night</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.380" end="00:17:42.420" style="s2">since 1983 I believe it was was at 83 or</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.800" end="00:17:45.590" style="s2">89 there anyway</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.420" end="00:17:48.660" style="s2">on the same subject with the same girls</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.590" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">and technology&#39;s just grown up around</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.660" end="00:17:52.110" style="s2">him and suddenly there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:17:53.250" style="s2">disseminating all this stuff and he&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.110" end="00:17:54.840" style="s2">been very candidly record</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.250" end="00:17:58.500" style="s2">all of his lectures and keeping all that</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.840" end="00:18:02.130" style="s2">and like we were saying so then he has</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.500" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">this vast vast library this vast back</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.130" end="00:18:08.190" style="s2">catalogue so if you would just get an</p>

<p begin="00:18:15.120" end="00:18:19.590" style="s2">very powerful and transformative process</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:21.030" style="s2">for anybody no matter what period of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.590" end="00:18:25.560" style="s2">your life I have a lot of people write</p>

<p begin="00:18:35.190" end="00:18:39.360" style="s2">then he gave him one of my mixes and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.860" end="00:18:41.400" style="s2">then he really got into it through that</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.360" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">and now he&#39;s off smack and he&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.780" end="00:18:52.740" style="s2">but I have a lot of people and I have</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.580" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">like a lot of old bit like a guy 70 year</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.740" end="00:18:56.070" style="s2">old saying you know of this stuff I got</p>

<p begin="00:19:02.100" end="00:19:06.690" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.700" end="00:19:08.220" style="s2">a lot of people are terrified of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:10.410" style="s2">future and a lot of people people think</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.220" end="00:19:13.590" style="s2">that we&#39;re kind of doomed even Petersons</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.410" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">very kind of has very dark outlook but</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.590" end="00:19:19.560" style="s2">also very hopeful one because the end</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:21.060" style="s2">result of this this mass the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.560" end="00:19:22.890" style="s2">types about 10 years ago would always</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.060" end="00:19:25.770" style="s2">all talk about a mass awakening right</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.890" end="00:19:28.260" style="s2">when we all worked out that the people</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.770" end="00:19:29.970" style="s2">behind the news had agendas that the</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.260" end="00:19:31.560" style="s2">people in control didn&#39;t really like us</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.970" end="00:19:33.570" style="s2">that much and talked about this mass</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.560" end="00:19:35.310" style="s2">awakening but there is a mass awakening</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.570" end="00:19:38.790" style="s2">but the real mass awakening is people</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.310" end="00:19:40.860" style="s2">just becoming educated on all the stuff</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.790" end="00:19:42.150" style="s2">that the smartest amongst has worked out</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.860" end="00:19:44.550" style="s2">over the past couple of hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.150" end="00:19:48.360" style="s2">but wasn&#39;t privy to that many people</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.550" end="00:19:49.650" style="s2">yeah the internet D democratized many</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.360" end="00:19:51.360" style="s2">many things and the first thing he did</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.650" end="00:19:53.460" style="s2">was with music and I was there and I saw</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.360" end="00:19:55.440" style="s2">it happen and I saw record labels</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.460" end="00:19:56.940" style="s2">collapsing and I saw my a an our guy</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.440" end="00:19:58.830" style="s2">gets sacked after my first record deal</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.940" end="00:19:59.890" style="s2">almost instantly because the bottom just</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.830" end="00:20:02.170" style="s2">fell out</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.890" end="00:20:03.610" style="s2">then suddenly anyone could make music in</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.170" end="00:20:04.870" style="s2">their own home and anyone could upload</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.610" end="00:20:06.100" style="s2">it and anyone could take it from</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.870" end="00:20:07.480" style="s2">wherever and then that started happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.100" end="00:20:09.490" style="s2">with TV and then it started happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.480" end="00:20:12.040" style="s2">with journalism that&#39;s happening with</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.490" end="00:20:14.040" style="s2">money because of Bitcoin is is happening</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.040" end="00:20:17.410" style="s2">with everything and it&#39;s happened with</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.040" end="00:20:19.060" style="s2">education now anyone can go on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.410" end="00:20:20.500" style="s2">and like learn something that previously</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.060" end="00:20:22.180" style="s2">you had to go to university for years</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.500" end="00:20:23.620" style="s2">and years to learn and you can get right</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.180" end="00:20:25.540" style="s2">to the core of what you want to know and</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.620" end="00:20:26.890" style="s2">you can compare and contrast with some</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.540" end="00:20:28.570" style="s2">other smart people and the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.890" end="00:20:30.910" style="s2">smartest people you can have the best</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.570" end="00:20:34.240" style="s2">teachers in the world right there so</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.910" end="00:20:36.490" style="s2">there&#39;s your awakening you have yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.240" end="00:20:40.510" style="s2">more especially since the intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.490" end="00:20:42.400" style="s2">dart web idea I&#39;m more reassured that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.510" end="00:20:44.170" style="s2">the internet does have this double side</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.400" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">because it&#39;s very giving your take on</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.170" end="00:20:52.990" style="s2">that thing well I work in journalism yes</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:54.670" style="s2">so it&#39;s it&#39;s terrifying to me that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.990" end="00:20:56.680" style="s2">destroying journalism like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.670" end="00:20:58.330" style="s2">destroying it takes time to do good</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.680" end="00:21:01.420" style="s2">journalism it takes time to research it</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.330" end="00:21:03.400" style="s2">takes takes effort and and I also think</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.420" end="00:21:06.160" style="s2">that the filter bubble we&#39;ve created</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.400" end="00:21:09.610" style="s2">tools that reward the lowest aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.160" end="00:21:11.680" style="s2">ourselves and narcissism our need for</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.610" end="00:21:12.700" style="s2">validation our tribalism these are the</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.680" end="00:21:15.520" style="s2">tools that we&#39;ve got from the internet</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.700" end="00:21:17.130" style="s2">with us far and they&#39;ve been very</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.520" end="00:21:20.200" style="s2">deliberately developed to hack our</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.130" end="00:21:23.130" style="s2">dopamine systems to hack our neurology</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.200" end="00:21:27.580" style="s2">for money it&#39;s like a late-stage</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.130" end="00:21:29.290" style="s2">capitalism model for this this new very</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.580" end="00:21:31.930" style="s2">very powerful technology and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.290" end="00:21:34.180" style="s2">been very pessimistic about that for</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.930" end="00:21:36.340" style="s2">quite a while yes and it&#39;s not until</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.180" end="00:21:38.470" style="s2">probably quite recently when I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.340" end="00:21:39.820" style="s2">the emergence of the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.470" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">web which I talked about in The Glitch a</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.820" end="00:21:47.350" style="s2">little bit as a kind of group of of</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:49.720" style="s2">countercultural thinkers who are kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.350" end="00:21:51.760" style="s2">exposing the the way that a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.720" end="00:21:53.770" style="s2">media especially has been engaged in</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.760" end="00:21:55.240" style="s2">groupthink which is why Trump came as</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.770" end="00:21:58.780" style="s2">such a surprise with my bricks it came</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.240" end="00:22:01.480" style="s2">as such a surprise and so it I&#39;m now</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.780" end="00:22:03.490" style="s2">seeing before I really saw the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.480" end="00:22:05.110" style="s2">dystopian nature of well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.490" end="00:22:06.550" style="s2">destroying truth we&#39;re undermining truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.110" end="00:22:11.530" style="s2">were undermining all of our sources of</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.550" end="00:22:13.660" style="s2">truth now I&#39;m starting to see that there</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.530" end="00:22:16.420" style="s2">is a sort of self generated</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.660" end="00:22:17.920" style="s2">best ideas winning aspect that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.420" end="00:22:20.380" style="s2">on at the same time that you&#39;re seeing</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.920" end="00:22:22.990" style="s2">through like the Joe Rogan podcast for</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.380" end="00:22:25.300" style="s2">example and the Dave Rubin show of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.990" end="00:22:28.540" style="s2">guys finding each other the the Ben</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.300" end="00:22:32.350" style="s2">Shapiro&#39;s the Jordan Peterson&#39;s the Eric</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.540" end="00:22:35.050" style="s2">Weinstein&#39;s of this world are starting</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.350" end="00:22:37.150" style="s2">to be self selected by the Internet at</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.050" end="00:22:41.730" style="s2">the same time as you&#39;re having a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.150" end="00:22:44.200" style="s2">things being eroded away and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.730" end="00:22:45.460" style="s2">giving me a little bit of hope</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.200" end="00:22:48.010" style="s2">I still think things are gonna get</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.460" end="00:22:49.300" style="s2">really rocky before because what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.010" end="00:22:50.950" style="s2">seeing is the destruction of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.300" end="00:22:53.110" style="s2">structures all the structures everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.950" end="00:22:54.310" style="s2">are being undermined by the force of</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.110" end="00:22:56.140" style="s2">technologies anything there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.310" end="00:22:57.460" style="s2">middleman is what it is so the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.140" end="00:22:59.710" style="s2">universities with middlemen for</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.460" end="00:23:01.690" style="s2">knowledge and then and what they do</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.710" end="00:23:05.140" style="s2">what&#39;s happened - who said was it anyway</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.690" end="00:23:07.510" style="s2">as this happens everyone pivots to enter</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.140" end="00:23:10.360" style="s2">sort of being entertainment or gossip so</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.510" end="00:23:11.740" style="s2">news used to just you know give you news</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.360" end="00:23:14.350" style="s2">and then you can get news from all over</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:16.150" style="s2">the place any random guy on Twitter so</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.350" end="00:23:17.710" style="s2">news becomes a sort of entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.150" end="00:23:19.740" style="s2">thing and it&#39;s got a slant and it&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.710" end="00:23:22.000" style="s2">a gossipy angle and that&#39;s what it does</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.740" end="00:23:23.860" style="s2">education has done the same thing they</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.000" end="00:23:25.720" style="s2">all do that so you&#39;re not seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.860" end="00:23:28.090" style="s2">destruction of the whole thing you seen</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.720" end="00:23:30.550" style="s2">the destruction of the middleman or like</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.090" end="00:23:33.700" style="s2">you know but the actual knowledge itself</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.550" end="00:23:36.570" style="s2">isn&#39;t being destroyed and the access to</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.700" end="00:23:40.150" style="s2">the knowledge is actually increasing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.570" end="00:23:42.070" style="s2">while there&#39;s the initial you know which</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.150" end="00:23:44.860" style="s2">is there was the meme that was put about</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.070" end="00:23:47.350" style="s2">out by the media that was scared the</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.860" end="00:23:48.640" style="s2">fake news me right well you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.350" end="00:23:50.620" style="s2">all these guys because they&#39;re not us</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.640" end="00:23:52.330" style="s2">but that backfired on them because then</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.620" end="00:23:55.140" style="s2">you can see a million examples of where</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.330" end="00:23:59.350" style="s2">they have themselves deliberately</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.140" end="00:24:01.330" style="s2">misinformed or you know been insincere</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.350" end="00:24:02.650" style="s2">or whatever for deliberate reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.330" end="00:24:04.780" style="s2">they kind of destroyed themselves it was</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.650" end="00:24:06.730" style="s2">like the final blow was dealt by</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.780" end="00:24:08.350" style="s2">themselves with that and then people</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.730" end="00:24:09.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t as stupid as they&#39;ve been made</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.350" end="00:24:11.380" style="s2">out to be which also makes a little</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.880" end="00:24:14.290" style="s2">sense it&#39;s like the death spiral of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.380" end="00:24:17.350" style="s2">media because they&#39;re kind of audiences</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.290" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">of declining is itself now part of the</p>

<p begin="00:26:20.860" end="00:26:26.200" style="s2">of sort of elite core liberal core in</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.130" end="00:26:27.610" style="s2">London who hate the rest of the country</p>

<p begin="00:26:38.600" end="00:26:43.970" style="s2">hate more than them is the really rich</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.460" end="00:26:45.770" style="s2">and that was the case hundreds of years</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.970" end="00:26:48.530" style="s2">ago and it&#39;s still the case the frame</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.770" end="00:26:50.240" style="s2">that I look at things through is similar</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.530" end="00:26:53.090" style="s2">to Peterson is sort of Jungian lens and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.240" end="00:26:54.410" style="s2">the idea of the shadow and the shadow is</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.090" end="00:26:57.500" style="s2">that of all the parts of yourself that</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.410" end="00:26:59.810" style="s2">you repress and deny and what it feels</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.500" end="00:27:02.750" style="s2">like to me is that this democratization</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.810" end="00:27:05.660" style="s2">of everything is allowing all of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.750" end="00:27:07.790" style="s2">shadow aspects of our culture to come to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.660" end="00:27:09.710" style="s2">the surface and so the process we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.790" end="00:27:11.390" style="s2">going through and this is so clear with</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.710" end="00:27:12.710" style="s2">Trump it&#39;s like Trump you couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.390" end="00:27:16.220" style="s2">design America&#39;s IDI</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.710" end="00:27:19.190" style="s2">more more better than than Trump it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.220" end="00:27:20.960" style="s2">like it&#39;s everything that America wanted</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.190" end="00:27:25.040" style="s2">to deny about itself that the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.960" end="00:27:26.900" style="s2">narcissism the the worship of wealth for</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.040" end="00:27:28.760" style="s2">its own sake I mean all of these aspects</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.900" end="00:27:31.310" style="s2">of America that we know a part of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.760" end="00:27:32.480" style="s2">American character but Americans don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.310" end="00:27:33.980" style="s2">really want to admit they&#39;re part of a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.480" end="00:27:35.630" style="s2">more liberal Americans don&#39;t admit a</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.980" end="00:27:37.390" style="s2">part of the American character so I say</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.630" end="00:27:40.700" style="s2">on so many levels we have these figures</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.390" end="00:27:42.950" style="s2">emerging as the aid or the shadow of</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.700" end="00:27:45.260" style="s2">these different and our our task is to</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.950" end="00:27:48.140" style="s2">integrate them and so it&#39;s just kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.260" end="00:27:51.290" style="s2">say okay so what is what does Trump say</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.140" end="00:27:53.000" style="s2">about me yeah or what does yeah or all</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.290" end="00:27:56.240" style="s2">of these figures all of it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.000" end="00:27:58.130" style="s2">part of myself is is Trump representing</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.240" end="00:27:59.870" style="s2">for example but this is this is why it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.130" end="00:28:01.280" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s it&#39;s a sort of the deep do</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.870" end="00:28:03.560" style="s2">I think Peterson so interesting as well</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.280" end="00:28:05.060" style="s2">that we need a deep mythological</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.560" end="00:28:08.510" style="s2">structure to make sense of all this</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.060" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">archetypes and the idea of yeah this</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.510" end="00:28:13.190" style="s2">sort of young who seems to have gone</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:15.580" style="s2">deeper into the human sold and just</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.190" end="00:28:18.740" style="s2">about anyone in the 20th century is like</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.580" end="00:28:21.020" style="s2">probably the key guide that we need now</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.740" end="00:28:22.610" style="s2">to kind of get through the next 10 years</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.020" end="00:28:24.320" style="s2">or so yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.610" end="00:28:27.290" style="s2">maybe maybe less just things that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.320" end="00:28:28.730" style="s2">happening remarkably speedily like</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.290" end="00:28:30.670" style="s2">seriously you think like we went five</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.730" end="00:28:33.350" style="s2">years it&#39;s like a different world</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.670" end="00:28:35.870" style="s2">different world it&#39;s like if you look at</p>

<p begin="00:31:01.360" end="00:31:05.440" style="s2">gonna go goth and lo it did and now all</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.909" end="00:31:07.179" style="s2">the drugs people are taking it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.440" end="00:31:09.490" style="s2">like speedy cokie type drugs and</p>

<p begin="00:31:17.770" end="00:31:22.570" style="s2">it&#39;s happening across the whole West so</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.679" end="00:31:25.510" style="s2">it&#39;s like it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a catalyst or a</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.570" end="00:31:26.950" style="s2">magnifier this is the technology this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.510" end="00:31:29.049" style="s2">partly us looking through the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.950" end="00:31:31.330" style="s2">wrong end of the telescope and and one</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.049" end="00:31:33.429" style="s2">of the things the news media does is we</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.330" end="00:31:35.289" style="s2">look back it&#39;s like a fractal pattern</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.429" end="00:31:37.059" style="s2">and the fractal pattern is just getting</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.289" end="00:31:39.970" style="s2">bigger and bigger and bigger because we</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.059" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">look back at say the late 60s and we</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.970" end="00:31:43.899" style="s2">think oh wow it was tie-dye it was acid</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:46.120" style="s2">it was everyone was doing it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.899" end="00:31:48.309" style="s2">no no the fact that we know about it</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.120" end="00:31:50.140" style="s2">means it wasn&#39;t everyone doing it the</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.309" end="00:31:55.929" style="s2">news media will will focus on what is</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.140" end="00:31:59.260" style="s2">unusual so maybe like 1/10 of 1% if that</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.929" end="00:32:01.000" style="s2">are doing this this culture whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.260" end="00:32:02.590" style="s2">is and we look back at kind of the acid</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.000" end="00:32:06.159" style="s2">period of the goth period or the Punk</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.590" end="00:32:08.169" style="s2">period and we assume these were eroding</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.159" end="00:32:09.820" style="s2">meaning everyone was doing it no these</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.169" end="00:32:12.159" style="s2">were aro defining but because they were</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.820" end="00:32:13.809" style="s2">unusual it was a small group of outliers</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.159" end="00:32:15.399" style="s2">every time but every time the pen you</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.809" end="00:32:16.929" style="s2">think of it like a pendulum I think of</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.399" end="00:32:19.270" style="s2">it like a lump hammer on a rope</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.929" end="00:32:21.130" style="s2">right and it&#39;s swinging back and forward</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.270" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">and every time it smashes the wall a bit</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.130" end="00:32:24.940" style="s2">bigger and every time there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.980" style="s2">people like hanging on to the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.940" end="00:32:29.409" style="s2">it&#39;s and it does this like every 7 years</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.980" end="00:32:32.770" style="s2">you can look back at history and it does</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.409" end="00:32:34.690" style="s2">it but now it&#39;s vast and now</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.770" end="00:32:36.549" style="s2">it&#39;s like a nuke and every time</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.690" end="00:32:38.409" style="s2">it smashes on either side it like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.549" end="00:32:40.779" style="s2">like a new truck so it&#39;s gonna we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.409" end="00:32:42.460" style="s2">gonna go full-blown psychedelic again in</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.779" end="00:32:44.289" style="s2">a couple eight three years or something</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.460" end="00:32:46.480" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna come out of the dark</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.289" end="00:32:49.690" style="s2">nihilistic lunacy thing we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.480" end="00:32:51.850" style="s2">be integrating our shadows in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.690" end="00:32:53.799" style="s2">ridiculous Technicolor thing on mass</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.850" end="00:32:56.350" style="s2">because we&#39;re all now completely</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.799" end="00:32:58.110" style="s2">connected we&#39;re all completely sort of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.350" end="00:33:00.130" style="s2">digitally fused in some fashion</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.110" end="00:33:02.890" style="s2">and everyone&#39;s kind of used to it by</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.130" end="00:33:05.059" style="s2">this point so that&#39;s when you have real</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.890" end="00:33:07.009" style="s2">radical societal change and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.059" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">when it&#39;s I would say likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.009" end="00:33:12.049" style="s2">incredibly positive hmm he positive or</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:13.519" style="s2">negative about the future yeah are very</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.049" end="00:33:16.190" style="s2">positive this is the best time to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.519" end="00:33:16.820" style="s2">alive in recorded human history for</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.190" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.820" end="00:33:22.779" style="s2">more people drinking clean water more</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:25.759" style="s2">people with access to information</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.779" end="00:33:27.169" style="s2">children not dying immediately like</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.759" end="00:33:28.940" style="s2">women able to wander around outside</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.169" end="00:33:30.590" style="s2">without like rocks being thrown at them</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.940" end="00:33:32.720" style="s2">without being fully clothed like</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.590" end="00:33:36.529" style="s2">whatever it is any aspects you could</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">think of is massively better now than it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.529" end="00:33:41.059" style="s2">was even like 10 20 years ago you know</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:42.710" style="s2">is it&#39;s an incredible time to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.059" end="00:33:44.690" style="s2">alive those really saying we all have</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.710" end="00:33:46.070" style="s2">these little machines with us that you</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.690" end="00:33:47.749" style="s2">can look at the negative aspects if</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.070" end="00:33:51.049" style="s2">there is fine but the potential positive</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.749" end="00:33:54.289" style="s2">aspects of them is bonkers but</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.049" end="00:33:57.529" style="s2">it&#39;s also I mean I agree and I also</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.289" end="00:33:59.240" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s true that like Eric</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.529" end="00:34:03.980" style="s2">Weinstein sorry Bret Weinstein said</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.240" end="00:34:05.090" style="s2">about the the evolutionary tools that</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.980" end="00:34:08.629" style="s2">are brought us to where we are are</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.090" end="00:34:11.030" style="s2">likely to end in a catastrophe unless we</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.629" end="00:34:14.359" style="s2">evolve beyond them and I think George</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.030" end="00:34:17.179" style="s2">Michaud in the green wall I yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.359" end="00:34:18.859" style="s2">us I hope so I hope so</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.179" end="00:34:20.270" style="s2">when you look at sort of politics or you</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.859" end="00:34:22.339" style="s2">look at kind of what&#39;s playing out on</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.270" end="00:34:24.530" style="s2">the on the the more structural level</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.339" end="00:34:26.869" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s easy to make a case for that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.530" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">that we&#39;re not as long as I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.869" end="00:34:30.349" style="s2">alive we&#39;ve been like this close to</p>

<p begin="00:34:32.210" end="00:34:36.470" style="s2">that&#39;s all you&#39;re looking at then we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.770" end="00:34:37.849" style="s2">been doomed for our entire lives and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.470" end="00:34:40.819" style="s2">that&#39;s just always the case there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.849" end="00:34:42.770" style="s2">always like some tin-pot dictator or</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.819" end="00:34:43.760" style="s2">whatever who&#39;s gonna drop a bomb or</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.770" end="00:34:44.929" style="s2">something you know whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.760" end="00:34:46.490" style="s2">that&#39;s always gonna happen everyone in</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.929" end="00:34:48.319" style="s2">the 80s was terrified of nuclear winter</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.490" end="00:34:49.970" style="s2">and I read where the wind blows like</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.319" end="00:34:51.980" style="s2">everybody else did as a small child and</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.970" end="00:34:53.300" style="s2">was like for whatever that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.980" end="00:34:54.230" style="s2">been going on there&#39;s literally always</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.300" end="00:34:55.520" style="s2">been the case throughout and the</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.230" end="00:34:57.020" style="s2">entirety of human history there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.520" end="00:34:58.849" style="s2">been some barbarians at the gates or</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.020" end="00:35:00.710" style="s2">some like Drake calamity or some great</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.849" end="00:35:01.970" style="s2">flood or whatever the it is but</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.710" end="00:35:03.920" style="s2">what we have now that we didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.970" end="00:35:05.270" style="s2">before was all of this that we&#39;ve just</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.920" end="00:35:07.940" style="s2">been talking about we have all of this</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.270" end="00:35:10.040" style="s2">being available to not just a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.940" end="00:35:12.230" style="s2">minority of the population but to the</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.040" end="00:35:13.819" style="s2">actual majority of our Western</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.230" end="00:35:15.260" style="s2">populations and now increasingly the</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.819" end="00:35:17.930" style="s2">rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.260" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">they every major continent and</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.930" end="00:35:23.080" style="s2">the results of this I think can only be</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:25.700" style="s2">brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.080" end="00:35:27.020" style="s2">so I think yeah I&#39;m very excited about</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.700" end="00:35:28.940" style="s2">the future and I think you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.020" end="00:35:30.590" style="s2">gonna see some wonderful wonderful</p>

<p begin="00:35:37.250" end="00:35:40.850" style="s2">you first started listening to Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.930" end="00:35:42.050" style="s2">Peterson I think the same thing that</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.850" end="00:35:45.410" style="s2">resonates for most people which is</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.050" end="00:35:49.280" style="s2">meaning and purpose meaning and purpose</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.410" end="00:35:51.950" style="s2">and glory of discipline the that whole</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.280" end="00:35:58.490" style="s2">thing if we&#39;ve been fed this just</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.950" end="00:36:00.740" style="s2"> just vast diet of Rights forever</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.490" end="00:36:01.910" style="s2">and the whole personal responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.740" end="00:36:03.350" style="s2">and it&#39;s always been a big thing of mine</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.910" end="00:36:04.460" style="s2">my whole first album was about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.350" end="00:36:07.490" style="s2">individual and the right of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.460" end="00:36:10.250" style="s2">individuals and the necessity in the</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.490" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">individual to change the world and be</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.250" end="00:36:16.580" style="s2">allowed to be them which sampled the</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.830" style="s2">prisoner a lot and stuff and then the</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.580" end="00:36:20.660" style="s2">second one was kind of more inward and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.830" end="00:36:21.860" style="s2">about like all of us all together and</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.660" end="00:36:23.990" style="s2">the importance of that and then you kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.860" end="00:36:26.120" style="s2">of come through that and it&#39;s back to</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.990" end="00:36:28.430" style="s2">the individual and like personal</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.120" end="00:36:29.480" style="s2">responsibility is the thing only what is</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.430" end="00:36:31.070" style="s2">that I used to say I used to wonder</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.480" end="00:36:34.370" style="s2">around things myself only you can save</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.070" end="00:36:36.410" style="s2">mankind because only you can only one</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.370" end="00:36:37.730" style="s2">person taking responsibility for their</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.410" end="00:36:38.630" style="s2">life and everything around them and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.730" end="00:36:40.070" style="s2">their family and stuff can actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.630" end="00:36:42.050" style="s2">change the world you can&#39;t change the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.070" end="00:36:46.100" style="s2">world it&#39;s sharing a big shouty mob it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.050" end="00:36:47.750" style="s2">just it&#39;s just too messy and that is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.100" end="00:36:52.250" style="s2">one and it&#39;s just wonderful to see</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.750" end="00:36:54.140" style="s2">someone communicating the importance and</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.250" end="00:36:55.010" style="s2">the this sort of like transcendental</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.140" end="00:36:57.620" style="s2">majesty</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.010" end="00:36:59.630" style="s2">of personal responsibility to a mass of</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.620" end="00:37:02.240" style="s2">people all at once just at the point</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.630" end="00:37:04.430" style="s2">when we needed it most which is which</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.240" end="00:37:06.230" style="s2">again goes back to the nature of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.430" end="00:37:07.670" style="s2">internet I think that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.230" end="00:37:10.040" style="s2">amazing about Peterson is that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.670" end="00:37:12.290" style="s2">genuinely sort of crowd-sourced in terms</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.040" end="00:37:15.710" style="s2">of his response that he&#39;s got from from</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.290" end="00:37:17.030" style="s2">people he and I what I&#39;d love to ask him</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.710" end="00:37:20.300" style="s2">about this because I have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.030" end="00:37:22.430" style="s2">he also is quite least quite spooked by</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.300" end="00:37:24.710" style="s2">that because the fact that he&#39;s rocketed</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.430" end="00:37:26.660" style="s2">to fame so quickly shows how needed that</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.710" end="00:37:28.089" style="s2">message is yeah let&#39;s say he cries every</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.660" end="00:37:29.589" style="s2">time he talks about it</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.089" end="00:37:31.239" style="s2">every time you talk it he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.589" end="00:37:33.729" style="s2">that aspect he just starts crying all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.239" end="00:37:36.249" style="s2">us immediately because this whole you</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.729" end="00:37:38.709" style="s2">know he has a son and a daughter I have</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.249" end="00:37:42.489" style="s2">a son this whole like the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.709" end="00:37:44.199" style="s2">they&#39;re this is foul poison they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.489" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">trying to put on half of the human</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.199" end="00:37:52.749" style="s2">population it could it have been</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:54.819" style="s2">completely ruinous and the Overton</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.749" end="00:37:56.979" style="s2">Window was so far in one direction and</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.819" end="00:37:59.709" style="s2">he&#39;s almost single-handedly moved the</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.979" end="00:38:01.089" style="s2">Overton Window like Alma like back over</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.709" end="00:38:02.380" style="s2">here and if we keep going along this</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.089" end="00:38:03.160" style="s2">course and now all these other people</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.380" end="00:38:05.259" style="s2">are being listened to</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.160" end="00:38:08.140" style="s2">like the Overton Window can we move back</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.259" end="00:38:09.849" style="s2">to a point where we&#39;re certainly not in</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.140" end="00:38:12.489" style="s2">danger of like actually completely</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.849" end="00:38:15.609" style="s2">destroying half the population in an</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.489" end="00:38:16.869" style="s2">irreversible fashion and then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.609" end="00:38:18.160" style="s2">completely and then we can get</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.869" end="00:38:19.660" style="s2">back to the thing where we all work</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:21.910" style="s2">together then we respect our differences</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.660" end="00:38:25.019" style="s2">it&#39;s male in female and we like work in</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.910" end="00:38:27.039" style="s2">glorious unity to further the human</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.019" end="00:38:29.049" style="s2">experiment and go into the stars would</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.039" end="00:38:31.209" style="s2">be like wonderful creatures out in the</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.049" end="00:38:32.799" style="s2">universe and I&#39;ll be cool and awesome</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.209" end="00:38:34.839" style="s2">and wonderful we would literally got to</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.799" end="00:38:37.119" style="s2">the point where it was like right you go</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.839" end="00:38:39.009" style="s2">like have the viewer evil scum and</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.119" end="00:38:41.739" style="s2">should be treated accordingly and should</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.009" end="00:38:42.969" style="s2">be ashamed for existing you and</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.739" end="00:38:44.739" style="s2">like people are starting to think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.969" end="00:38:46.599" style="s2">there&#39;s people like thinking that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.739" end="00:38:48.519" style="s2">true but I think we&#39;ve been saved from</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.599" end="00:38:49.569" style="s2">that precipice and I think Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.519" end="00:38:52.929" style="s2">actually will go down in history as</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.569" end="00:38:54.759" style="s2">being instrumental in that well that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.929" end="00:38:56.380" style="s2">something even just from the the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.759" end="00:38:58.449" style="s2">work that we&#39;ve done so far it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.380" end="00:39:01.299" style="s2">interesting that there are a lot of guys</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.449" end="00:39:04.119" style="s2">from my generation and maybe lower</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.299" end="00:39:05.410" style="s2">younger than me who yeah you get that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.119" end="00:39:07.660" style="s2">sense of kind of internalized shame</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.410" end="00:39:09.910" style="s2">around themselves as men yeah which is</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.660" end="00:39:12.130" style="s2">really kind of dark it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.910" end="00:39:15.099" style="s2">yeah isn&#39;t very unhelpful or nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.130" end="00:39:17.650" style="s2">comes from shame I mean nothing good and</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.099" end="00:39:19.390" style="s2">nothing good comes from like I&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.650" end="00:39:20.859" style="s2">say this is people who didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.390" end="00:39:22.630" style="s2">anything being made to feel bad for</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.859" end="00:39:25.119" style="s2">something that some other people did no</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.630" end="00:39:27.130" style="s2">no it was it&#39;s not like the Harrod sorry</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.119" end="00:39:31.449" style="s2">the Weinsteins are in a kind of inner</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.130" end="00:39:33.600" style="s2">interment in a majority it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.449" end="00:39:36.750" style="s2">bizarre what got you into the hole</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.600" end="00:39:38.250" style="s2">man&#39;s work thing I&#39;ve been doing various</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.750" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">sort of personal growth work for quite a</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.250" end="00:39:44.300" style="s2">long time right I experimented with</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:47.460" style="s2">psychedelics quite a lot University and</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.300" end="00:39:49.050" style="s2">then when I went into my first sort of</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.460" end="00:39:51.090" style="s2">personal growth workshops what I found</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.050" end="00:39:53.700" style="s2">open up was a very similar space like</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.090" end="00:39:55.920" style="s2">the space of freedom and reprogramming</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.700" end="00:39:58.350" style="s2">myself and kind of really examining my</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.920" end="00:39:59.850" style="s2">beliefs and challenging myself and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.350" end="00:40:03.000" style="s2">of this sort of sense of flow and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.850" end="00:40:04.470" style="s2">freedom would come in yeah we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.000" end="00:40:05.580" style="s2">started teaching men&#39;s work at that</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.470" end="00:40:07.770" style="s2">point I&#39;ve been leading a men&#39;s group</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.580" end="00:40:09.960" style="s2">and then we started doing a we did a</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.770" end="00:40:11.970" style="s2">weekend a day long workshop and we</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.960" end="00:40:13.290" style="s2">started doing weekends and it was then</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.970" end="00:40:14.940" style="s2">at the time of the Trump collection I</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.290" end="00:40:18.930" style="s2">was like wow these gender dynamics are</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.940" end="00:40:20.100" style="s2">playing out on the the wider stage and</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.930" end="00:40:21.720" style="s2">when I started kind of learning more</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.100" end="00:40:23.430" style="s2">about you and the idea of the anamur in</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.720" end="00:40:25.080" style="s2">the Animus and it&#39;s like wow this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.430" end="00:40:28.500" style="s2">like this is almost like the secret key</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.080" end="00:40:31.170" style="s2">to everything that&#39;s going on and I</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.500" end="00:40:33.420" style="s2">really feel that men&#39;s work at the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.170" end="00:40:34.740" style="s2">moment is almost counter cultural oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.420" end="00:40:35.940" style="s2">that was yeah that&#39;s my other point</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.740" end="00:40:37.620" style="s2">about the other thing I think is</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.940" end="00:40:40.440" style="s2">interesting is that like this stuff is</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.620" end="00:40:43.170" style="s2">is the new counterculture it really</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.440" end="00:40:45.360" style="s2">really is it is in no way like edgy or</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.170" end="00:40:47.640" style="s2">rebellious to be doing anything any of</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.360" end="00:40:50.370" style="s2">that social justice type stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.640" end="00:40:52.770" style="s2">the mainstream it&#39;s now rebellious to</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.370" end="00:40:55.770" style="s2">clean up your flippin room</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.770" end="00:40:58.980" style="s2">it is countercultural to have your</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.770" end="00:41:01.740" style="s2">in order to choose a partner and stay</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.980" end="00:41:03.450" style="s2">with them to work through things and not</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.740" end="00:41:06.810" style="s2">just run off at the first sign of danger</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.450" end="00:41:08.790" style="s2">it&#39;s countercultural to to say anything</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.810" end="00:41:11.310" style="s2">about any kind of men&#39;s issue is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.790" end="00:41:12.990" style="s2">radical its met which is a bizarre</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.310" end="00:41:15.030" style="s2">bloody thing this is half the population</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.990" end="00:41:16.800" style="s2">you&#39;d think if they&#39;re if they are so</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.030" end="00:41:19.770" style="s2">bad you&#39;d want them to be sorted and in</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.800" end="00:41:21.930" style="s2">a decent shape surely that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.770" end="00:41:24.780" style="s2">like all this stuff that you&#39;re doing is</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.930" end="00:41:27.180" style="s2">like punk rock this is the the punk</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.780" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">stuff now this is the counterculture now</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.180" end="00:41:32.040" style="s2">you can&#39;t win the culture war and then</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:33.840" style="s2">and then also be like counterculture so</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.040" end="00:41:35.910" style="s2">the left is in this you know odd</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.840" end="00:41:38.310" style="s2">position now of kind of thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.910" end="00:41:40.740" style="s2">themselves is cool you look at YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.310" end="00:41:42.250" style="s2">and stuff all the all the cool young</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.560" end="00:42:11.200" style="s2">left has replaced genuine openness with</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.710" end="00:42:12.460" style="s2">an ideology of openness yeah and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.200" end="00:42:14.380" style="s2">really I thought that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.460" end="00:42:17.140" style="s2">powerful way of looking at it yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.380" end="00:42:19.540" style="s2">it&#39;s a dogmatic version of openness that</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.140" end="00:42:22.870" style="s2">is no longer open to many things I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.540" end="00:42:24.510" style="s2">the idea of certain things are now not</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.870" end="00:42:26.350" style="s2">allowed in that world be for example</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.510" end="00:42:27.940" style="s2">intrinsic differences between men and</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.350" end="00:42:29.500" style="s2">women it was a summer saying yesterday</p>

<p begin="00:42:34.570" end="00:42:38.290" style="s2">attacked his work the most often and now</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.100" end="00:42:40.000" style="s2">it&#39;s the now it&#39;s the far left and this</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.290" end="00:42:41.350" style="s2">is really what&#39;s happened you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.000" end="00:42:43.720" style="s2">think most of used to consider ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.350" end="00:42:45.460" style="s2">very left and I was a Billy Bragg fan</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.720" end="00:42:47.800" style="s2">and all this sort of stuff and the</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.460" end="00:42:50.860" style="s2">people who used to attack the things I</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.800" end="00:42:52.300" style="s2">liked used to be sort of fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.860" end="00:42:54.850" style="s2">Christian types and now they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:42:52.300" end="00:42:56.380" style="s2">people who I thought were like me and</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.850" end="00:42:58.030" style="s2">now they&#39;re the people saying you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.380" end="00:42:59.980" style="s2">say this and you have to say that and</p>
<p begin="00:42:58.030" end="00:43:01.300" style="s2">you can&#39;t enjoy this and women need to</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.980" end="00:43:05.470" style="s2">wear more clothes and all this crazy</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.300" end="00:43:07.960" style="s2"> it&#39;s mental what I got most</p>
<p begin="00:43:05.470" end="00:43:10.440" style="s2">from Peterson is that listening to him</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.960" end="00:43:14.020" style="s2">mapped onto everything that I followed</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.440" end="00:43:15.700" style="s2">already knew in a way like a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.020" end="00:43:17.470" style="s2">in my journey I think has been very</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.700" end="00:43:18.670" style="s2">different from I even calling it a</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.470" end="00:43:20.230" style="s2">journey kind of suggest I&#39;m currently</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.670" end="00:43:22.480" style="s2">slightly more personal development kind</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.230" end="00:43:24.490" style="s2">of perspective but definitely over the</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.480" end="00:43:25.960" style="s2">last 10 years well over the last 10</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.490" end="00:43:29.290" style="s2">years as like as I&#39;ve done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:43:25.960" end="00:43:32.470" style="s2">personal growth work when I listen to</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.290" end="00:43:34.390" style="s2">Peterson I realized that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.470" end="00:43:35.950" style="s2">doing was incarnated the low-cost more</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.390" end="00:43:40.030" style="s2">in my own life that&#39;s what I was doing</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.950" end="00:43:41.530" style="s2">more and more by and that allows then I</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.030" end="00:43:43.900" style="s2">kind of realize that&#39;s what that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.530" end="00:43:45.490" style="s2">it&#39;s about is kind of the learning to</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.900" end="00:43:49.120" style="s2">learning your truth and then speaking</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.490" end="00:43:50.290" style="s2">your truth much more clearly and then a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.120" end="00:43:52.440" style="s2">lot of the shadow work that I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.290" end="00:43:55.410" style="s2">sort of Jungian shadow work is then</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.440" end="00:43:57.460" style="s2">really integrating that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.410" end="00:43:58.599" style="s2">integrating those sort of divorce parts</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.460" end="00:44:00.730" style="s2">of yourself it&#39;s like within the men&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.599" end="00:44:02.589" style="s2">work the idea is yeah you&#39;ve got this</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.730" end="00:44:05.200" style="s2">kind of you&#39;ve got a you&#39;ve got an inner</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.589" end="00:44:07.630" style="s2">killer I mean we we have to I mean Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.200" end="00:44:09.010" style="s2">we we are maybe kind of a monster yeah</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.630" end="00:44:11.589" style="s2">make yourself a monster or at least</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.010" end="00:44:13.660" style="s2">extend you have that monstrous aspect to</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.589" end="00:44:15.940" style="s2">you and get it working for you rather</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.660" end="00:44:17.140" style="s2">was against you it has used in the world</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.940" end="00:44:19.329" style="s2">yeah because if you&#39;re suppressing your</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.140" end="00:44:20.710" style="s2">anger the world is going to trigger you</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.329" end="00:44:22.390" style="s2">in some way where that anger is going to</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.710" end="00:44:24.480" style="s2">come out and then you&#39;re then you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.390" end="00:44:28.570" style="s2">danger to yourself and others because</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.480" end="00:44:30.190" style="s2">control of it and it&#39;s like this is this</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.570" end="00:44:32.260" style="s2">is really countercultural stuff as well</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.190" end="00:44:33.730" style="s2">it&#39;s like not the idea at the moment is</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.260" end="00:44:35.619" style="s2">that men must suppress this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.730" end="00:44:37.089" style="s2">aspect of themselves it&#39;s like red blood</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.619" end="00:44:39.099" style="s2">yeah terribly Oh</p>

<p begin="00:47:30.390" end="00:47:34.080" style="s2">that type of stuff he&#39;s very practical</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.040" end="00:47:35.910" style="s2">man so you taking these sometimes nice</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.080" end="00:47:39.930" style="s2">e&#39;terica ideas but grandi living in a</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.910" end="00:47:42.359" style="s2">very except you&#39;re a male kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.930" end="00:47:46.050" style="s2">accessory practical fashion very</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.359" end="00:47:47.880" style="s2">practical you know and women have had</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.050" end="00:47:48.750" style="s2">things for quite a while than ways to</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.880" end="00:47:50.010" style="s2">get in touch with their sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.750" end="00:47:51.869" style="s2">spiritual side and all that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.010" end="00:47:54.980" style="s2">stuff and like you yoga and all these</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.869" end="00:47:57.510" style="s2">things and mindfulness and stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.980" end="00:47:59.310" style="s2">there&#39;s a practical there&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.510" end="00:48:03.030" style="s2">practicalities of Peterson&#39;s approach</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.310" end="00:48:04.710" style="s2">which takes quite deep concepts and puts</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.030" end="00:48:09.180" style="s2">them in a way that can be useful and I</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.710" end="00:48:11.609" style="s2">think kind of taking that and the prep</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.180" end="00:48:13.260" style="s2">actually people doing it in real life</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.609" end="00:48:14.609" style="s2">and bringing people together so they</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.260" end="00:48:16.140" style="s2">know that it&#39;s not really because if</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.609" end="00:48:17.819" style="s2">when you&#39;re looking at things on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.140" end="00:48:19.109" style="s2">you can be talking to a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.819" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">comments-section you could still feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.109" end="00:48:22.890" style="s2">alone so bringing this stuff into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:25.529" style="s2">world when I saw Pearson at the Orpheum</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.890" end="00:48:27.479" style="s2">in Los Angeles it was a day Ruben came</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.529" end="00:48:28.890" style="s2">in and introduced him and I&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.479" end="00:48:30.239" style="s2">seeing all these people that have just</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.890" end="00:48:32.009" style="s2">seen on the internet they&#39;re all in a</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.239" end="00:48:33.749" style="s2">room and it&#39;s that like 15 thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.009" end="00:48:38.009" style="s2">people in that room everyone&#39;s like they</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.749" end="00:48:40.680" style="s2">thought I think that that doing more of</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.009" end="00:48:43.199" style="s2">that and then turning back into Internet</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.680" end="00:48:45.569" style="s2">stuff so turning that into shows and</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.199" end="00:48:48.180" style="s2">turning that into vlogs or what have you</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.569" end="00:48:49.949" style="s2">do it could be really really useful and</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.180" end="00:48:51.599" style="s2">kick things up to the next level because</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.949" end="00:48:53.009" style="s2">I think this intellectual dark web thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.599" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">is just really really very much the</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.009" end="00:48:58.380" style="s2">first stage of a much much much much</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:59.849" style="s2">bigger thing is just just it&#39;s just the</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.380" end="00:49:02.400" style="s2">very beginning it&#39;s just scratching the</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.849" end="00:49:05.489" style="s2">surface of the potentiality of using</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.400" end="00:49:07.109" style="s2">this medium and kind of like forsaking</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.489" end="00:49:08.930" style="s2">that which has gone before which he just</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.109" end="00:49:11.430" style="s2">assumed was the way things had to be</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.930" end="00:49:13.559" style="s2">what I love about Peterson is he</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.430" end="00:49:15.299" style="s2">introduced this idea of okay how does it</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.559" end="00:49:17.489" style="s2">feel in your body when you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.299" end="00:49:20.549" style="s2">these words exactly like this idea of</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.489" end="00:49:22.349" style="s2">you you know if you really if you really</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.549" end="00:49:24.440" style="s2">sent into how your your body&#39;s feeling</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.349" end="00:49:27.719" style="s2">when you say certain things or when you</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.440" end="00:49:29.699" style="s2">yeah that there is a deeper alignment</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.719" end="00:49:31.049" style="s2">because otherwise it just becomes a sort</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.699" end="00:49:32.609" style="s2">of intellectual game again it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.049" end="00:49:34.529" style="s2">practical for an average person who</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.609" end="00:49:37.440" style="s2">hasn&#39;t spent like 30 years like reading</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.529" end="00:49:39.209" style="s2">young yeah like he&#39;s been getting</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.440" end="00:49:41.910" style="s2">for that like you know people some</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.209" end="00:49:43.709" style="s2">people say oh he&#39;s like a idiot like a</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.910" end="00:49:46.559" style="s2">thick person smart person or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.709" end="00:49:49.289" style="s2">you as if that was a bad thing like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.559" end="00:49:50.729" style="s2">bad to take like big ideas and translate</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.289" end="00:49:52.259" style="s2">them in a way that a person who hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.729" end="00:49:54.869" style="s2">been to university for thirty years can</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.259" end="00:49:56.549" style="s2">understand that&#39;s what we need that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.869" end="00:49:58.949" style="s2">actually what society increased the</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.549" end="00:50:01.349" style="s2">priesthood complaining about him exactly</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.949" end="00:50:03.269" style="s2">this is Lady Sacrament yeah how dare you</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.349" end="00:50:05.729" style="s2">God is not for these them it&#39;s for us</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.269" end="00:50:07.890" style="s2">only we can speak with God and only we</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.729" end="00:50:09.449" style="s2">can commune with the divine and then let</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.890" end="00:50:10.650" style="s2">the problem this is this is this</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.449" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">classism and this is why it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.650" end="00:50:15.630" style="s2">interesting seeing it playing in the UK</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:17.069" style="s2">which is a very class based society it</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.630" end="00:50:17.729" style="s2">really is that any intellectual classes</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.069" end="00:50:21.479" style="s2">a minute</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.729" end="00:50:23.279" style="s2">have you seen anyone else on YouTube or</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.479" end="00:50:25.739" style="s2">online doing anything similar to what</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.279" end="00:50:29.519" style="s2">we&#39;ve done in terms of like you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.739" end="00:50:31.079" style="s2">you&#39;ve kind of created these epic mixers</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.519" end="00:50:32.579" style="s2">of Peterson staff I&#39;ve kind of made a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.079" end="00:50:34.979" style="s2">couple of documentaries about his own</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.579" end="00:50:36.689" style="s2">but they will they&#39;re already started</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.979" end="00:50:43.019" style="s2">yes I speak is it a coincidence that</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.689" end="00:50:48.719" style="s2">they&#39;re both from the UK yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.019" end="00:50:50.130" style="s2">there&#39;s a point I wonder but it is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.719" end="00:50:50.939" style="s2">about to be a lot bigger and it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.130" end="00:50:55.549" style="s2">to be normal</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.939" end="00:50:59.569" style="s2">yeah but this is kind of a new thing and</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.549" end="00:51:01.469" style="s2">it was necessary you just do think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.569" end="00:51:02.579" style="s2">necessary right see when you going off</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.469" end="00:51:04.519" style="s2">instincts and you&#39;re seeing all the</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.579" end="00:51:08.399" style="s2">synchronicity isn&#39;t start for anything I</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.519" end="00:51:09.659" style="s2">filled a hole because lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.399" end="00:51:11.219" style="s2">just wanted this thing I have so many</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.659" end="00:51:13.559" style="s2">people in like I had the idea but I</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.219" end="00:51:15.299" style="s2">didn&#39;t do it I really was hoping someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.559" end="00:51:17.969" style="s2">had done this people be literally like</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.299" end="00:51:20.189" style="s2">googling like lo-fi piece and see if it</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.969" end="00:51:23.759" style="s2">exists and glow it doesn&#39;t same thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.189" end="00:51:25.559" style="s2">you&#39;re doing so you know let&#39;s do lots</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.759" end="00:51:26.999" style="s2">lots more of it and lots of other people</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.559" end="00:51:30.359" style="s2">will start doing it but I think you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.999" end="00:51:33.959" style="s2">got a real potentiality for creating</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.359" end="00:51:35.909" style="s2">something quite vast and important but</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.959" end="00:51:38.729" style="s2">you just have to work you have to do a</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.909" end="00:51:41.339" style="s2">lot you have to feed the algorithms yeah</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.729" end="00:51:45.689" style="s2">YouTube requires content three times a</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.339" end="00:51:47.009" style="s2">week at least over ten minutes and we if</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.689" end="00:51:48.779" style="s2">you start doing that you&#39;ll see your</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.009" end="00:51:51.839" style="s2">numbers going up pretty fast and this is</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.779" end="00:51:54.389" style="s2">what I&#39;ve been seeing like I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.839" end="00:51:57.869" style="s2">on like 150 subscribers a day on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.389" end="00:52:01.099" style="s2">at the moment just like every day and</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.869" end="00:52:03.239" style="s2">doing like sort of 20,000 views a day</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.099" end="00:52:05.279" style="s2">and the graphs are all like</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.239" end="00:52:07.589" style="s2">resume like that but it&#39;s like as I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.279" end="00:52:09.299" style="s2">started implementing like quite a rigid</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.589" end="00:52:11.849" style="s2">sort of content schedule and stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.299" end="00:52:13.049" style="s2">see it really rocketing any more Peters</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.849" end="00:52:15.479" style="s2">and stuff coming up oh yeah yeah of</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.049" end="00:52:16.919" style="s2">course thing with Peterson I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.479" end="00:52:19.169" style="s2">saying this to it to his wife it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.919" end="00:52:21.049" style="s2">when you&#39;re making music and writing and</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.169" end="00:52:23.609" style="s2">stuff oftentimes you quote the Great&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.049" end="00:52:25.499" style="s2">and you know you quote a hunter</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.609" end="00:52:28.769" style="s2">assumption or you quote young or</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.499" end="00:52:30.509" style="s2">whatever but they&#39;re all dead you know</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.769" end="00:52:31.979" style="s2">knew they didn&#39;t they were audio if</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.509" end="00:52:33.809" style="s2">there are audio recordings of them</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.979" end="00:52:35.519" style="s2">they&#39;re not very good and there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.809" end="00:52:38.779" style="s2">that many of them and here we have</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.519" end="00:52:40.819" style="s2">Peterson like spit</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.779" end="00:52:42.769" style="s2"> napalm on a daily basis like</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.819" end="00:52:44.599" style="s2">dropping laying in hours of audio every</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.769" end="00:52:46.549" style="s2">day it&#39;s all brilliant and all</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.599" end="00:52:48.499" style="s2">incredibly quotable and it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.549" end="00:52:50.599" style="s2">incredibly sonorous musical and</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.499" end="00:52:52.640" style="s2">beautiful and important necessary right</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.599" end="00:52:54.679" style="s2">now if I did nothing else in my life</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.640" end="00:52:57.099" style="s2">even if I didn&#39;t even eat I could just</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.679" end="00:53:00.019" style="s2">sit there making Petersons music forever</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.099" end="00:53:02.929" style="s2">because there&#39;s so much material so I</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.019" end="00:53:04.969" style="s2">will continue to make Peters and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.929" end="00:53:08.659" style="s2">and they all continue to be useful when</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.969" end="00:53:10.669" style="s2">there&#39;s also many many other things to</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.659" end="00:53:12.919" style="s2">draw into music and make useful in that</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.669" end="00:53:15.829" style="s2">fashion it&#39;s basically it appears to be</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.919" end="00:53:18.109" style="s2">a new genre or at least a new way of</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.829" end="00:53:19.759" style="s2">sort of communicating ideas and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.109" end="00:53:22.609" style="s2">and I&#39;ve always done it I&#39;ve always made</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.759" end="00:53:23.809" style="s2">mixtapes that brought in people talking</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.609" end="00:53:25.429" style="s2">and bringing in ideas and made it</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.809" end="00:53:27.679" style="s2">musical we&#39;re just like now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.429" end="00:53:30.640" style="s2">real big appetite for it and thanks to</p>
