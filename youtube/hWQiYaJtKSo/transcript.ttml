<p begin="00:00:16.720" end="00:00:21.279" style="s2">so i had uh had some really good</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.320" end="00:00:24.400" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.279" end="00:00:28.160" style="s2">from the last video that i did</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.400" end="00:00:28.480" style="s2">around listening listening to the logos</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.160" end="00:00:31.199" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.480" end="00:00:34.640" style="s2">it was basically on my last to summarize</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.199" end="00:00:34.640" style="s2">the last video i talked about how</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.320" end="00:00:40.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t listen to the logos</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.120" end="00:00:47.440" style="s2">we hear it we respond to it</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.239" end="00:00:50.719" style="s2">on some level we probably</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.440" end="00:00:55.039" style="s2">we probably live in its measure</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.719" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">and it in its products its results but</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.039" end="00:01:01.440" style="s2">we don&#39;t necessarily have a listening</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:05.519" style="s2">for the whole the non-contingent</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.440" end="00:01:13.119" style="s2">wholeness of the logos right</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.519" end="00:01:16.479" style="s2">and the more that that happens we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.119" end="00:01:18.880" style="s2">well the more than that happens the more</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.479" end="00:01:20.560" style="s2">our lives become a pure kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.880" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">contingency</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.560" end="00:01:26.960" style="s2">right it&#39;s like i&#39;m doing something as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:30.000" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.960" end="00:01:32.159" style="s2">to produce an outcome or an effect which</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.000" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">will become the next</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.159" end="00:01:40.000" style="s2">means or thing that i need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:41.360" style="s2">produce an outcome and an effect</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.000" end="00:01:43.119" style="s2">and there&#39;s a way in which we can kind</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.360" end="00:01:45.200" style="s2">of like like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.119" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">we can basically our whole lives can</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.200" end="00:01:48.799" style="s2">become a pure contingency</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.840" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.799" end="00:01:57.920" style="s2">so let&#39;s not do that</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.079" end="00:02:06.240" style="s2">easier said than done because</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.320" end="00:02:09.039" style="s2">we don&#39;t hear that</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.240" end="00:02:09.599" style="s2">we&#39;re not listening and because we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.039" end="00:02:12.879" style="s2">lost</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.599" end="00:02:14.800" style="s2">sight right of</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.879" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">that we&#39;re listening that we have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.800" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">listening</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:23.040" style="s2">i think we end up just only hearing the</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.200" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">products</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.040" end="00:02:28.400" style="s2">of the logos and not the living dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.599" end="00:02:32.879" style="s2">the principle of principles right</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.000" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.879" end="00:02:39.040" style="s2">like being in its non-contingency right</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">it&#39;s luminosity it&#39;s suchness it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.040" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">moreness</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:45.280" style="s2">so one of the questions there were two</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:48.080" style="s2">questions one was um</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.280" end="00:02:49.680" style="s2">that somebody asked was they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.080" end="00:02:53.360" style="s2">great let&#39;s listen</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.680" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">greed we don&#39;t listen but challenge how</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.360" end="00:03:00.480" style="s2">do you encourage somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:03:02.080" style="s2">to listen who</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.480" end="00:03:03.920" style="s2">is it doesn&#39;t hear that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.080" end="00:03:05.680" style="s2">listening therefore doesn&#39;t even know to</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.920" end="00:03:08.720" style="s2">ask the question on how to listen</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:09.840" style="s2">basically is what i heard and the other</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.720" end="00:03:13.280" style="s2">one was</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.840" end="00:03:15.200" style="s2">um where do you listen from</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.280" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">that was another person i just saw it in</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.200" end="00:03:19.360" style="s2">my maybe there was more to it but i</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:20.080" style="s2">that i only just saw it on my walk over</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.360" end="00:03:21.440" style="s2">here so</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.080" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">i just wanted to respond to both of</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.440" end="00:03:23.680" style="s2">those</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:27.840" style="s2">so i think what we can i i really like</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.879" end="00:03:31.680" style="s2">those questions</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.840" end="00:03:35.120" style="s2">um it&#39;s having me think</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.680" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">about it so hear my thoughts about that</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.120" end="00:03:39.200" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:43.360" style="s2">it&#39;s interesting because in regards</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.200" end="00:03:47.280" style="s2">to how do we encourage someone</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.360" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">to listen</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.280" end="00:03:50.640" style="s2">to that they&#39;re not listening</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:59.120" style="s2">because listening really isn&#39;t possible</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.000" end="00:04:00.879" style="s2">until we can hear that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.120" end="00:04:02.640" style="s2">listening and the moment we</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.879" end="00:04:04.159" style="s2">it&#39;s revealed to us we&#39;re not listening</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.640" end="00:04:05.840" style="s2">is probably the first time</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.159" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">perhaps in our lives that we actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.840" end="00:04:08.159" style="s2">listen</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.400" end="00:04:13.439" style="s2">so how do we do that right</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.080" end="00:04:16.159" style="s2">well it&#39;s interesting to when you think</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.439" end="00:04:16.159" style="s2">about it right</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.400" end="00:04:19.519" style="s2">if we ask ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.600" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">when i deeply listen to somebody</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:28.080" style="s2">they&#39;re speaking and they&#39;re telling me</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.240" end="00:04:32.240" style="s2">about their lives or they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.080" end="00:04:35.840" style="s2">telling me what they think and</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.240" end="00:04:37.440" style="s2">they&#39;re revealing to what whatever depth</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.840" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">they&#39;re revealing about whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.440" end="00:04:42.720" style="s2">that they think or feel or</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">experiencing when i listen what am i</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.720" end="00:04:45.520" style="s2">actually hearing</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.240" end="00:04:49.440" style="s2">what am i listening to</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.000" end="00:04:53.759" style="s2">well i have i would have to say that if</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.320" end="00:04:57.280" style="s2">we say that listening</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.759" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">right if if listening is what all</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.280" end="00:05:01.600" style="s2">speech is in a response to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.840" end="00:05:08.560" style="s2">we&#39;d have to say that speaking</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.720" end="00:05:10.479" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t make any sense until there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.560" end="00:05:12.000" style="s2">a listening</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.479" end="00:05:13.759" style="s2">there must have been something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.000" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">called forth something</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.759" end="00:05:16.960" style="s2">something like speech</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.560" end="00:05:24.160" style="s2">so when we listen to another speech and</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.120" end="00:05:27.840" style="s2">we really listen to it</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.160" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">i think what we hear and what they can</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.440" style="s2">maybe</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">hear us hearing is what they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.440" end="00:05:34.160" style="s2">response to</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.400" end="00:05:39.919" style="s2">i think that&#39;s what happens a lot when</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.160" end="00:05:43.120" style="s2">somebody says they feel deeply</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.919" end="00:05:46.240" style="s2">seen or deeply godly</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.120" end="00:05:49.600" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s not so much that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.240" end="00:05:52.160" style="s2">i feel like you heard or saw the</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.600" end="00:05:55.039" style="s2">attributes of myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.160" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">or that that you even heard what i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.039" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">to myself</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:04.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s more like you heard</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:06.160" style="s2">the world in which i&#39;m already always</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.400" end="00:06:08.720" style="s2">responding to</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.160" end="00:06:09.520" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a way i hear it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.720" end="00:06:12.080" style="s2">thus</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.520" end="00:06:14.160" style="s2">my speaking is a response to it so when</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.080" end="00:06:14.880" style="s2">i hear you and i get you and i deeply</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.160" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">listen to you</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.880" end="00:06:22.560" style="s2">on some level i am</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">in my response i&#39;m actually revealing</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.560" end="00:06:25.360" style="s2">you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:31.680" style="s2">and i think so in a strange way i guess</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:35.520" style="s2">maybe the answer to that question is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.680" end="00:06:38.880" style="s2">to how do we encourage someone to hear</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.520" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">that they&#39;re not listening i think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.880" end="00:06:42.240" style="s2">to deeply listen to them</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.639" end="00:06:51.440" style="s2">and now to the question and this and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:53.520" style="s2">sure they&#39;ll end up being related</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.440" end="00:06:54.800" style="s2">oftentimes i you know when i start a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.520" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">sentence</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.800" end="00:07:01.360" style="s2">i think i know what i&#39;m going to say and</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">by the end like i&#39;ll start the sentence</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.360" end="00:07:04.800" style="s2">by the end of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">i&#39;ll realize i have no idea what i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.800" end="00:07:09.520" style="s2">trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:11.759" style="s2">so we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s the case or not</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.520" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">in this way</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.759" end="00:07:16.319" style="s2">so where do i hear from or where is</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">listening happen</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.319" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.919" end="00:07:27.769" style="s2">it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.240" end="00:07:27.769" style="s2">[Music]</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">in some sense right it&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.240" end="00:07:37.759" style="s2">similar question of</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.000" style="s2">you know when if i ask myself right what</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.759" end="00:07:42.880" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.000" end="00:07:45.759" style="s2">what will it take to really attend to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.880" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">the world in front of me especially if</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.759" end="00:07:49.599" style="s2">the world in front of me calls</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">forth a quality of attention i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.599" end="00:07:54.720" style="s2">currently have</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">yet i feel called in</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.720" end="00:08:02.319" style="s2">to pay attention or to listen</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">or to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.319" end="00:08:06.560" style="s2">but yet i don&#39;t have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:10.960" style="s2">understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.560" end="00:08:14.879" style="s2">yet so how do i</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.960" end="00:08:17.199" style="s2">how do i become worthy</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.879" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">of the kind of understanding for which i</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.199" end="00:08:21.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have yet to be able to understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.120" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">well if that wasn&#39;t possible on some</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.120" end="00:08:27.520" style="s2">level i don&#39;t think we would understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.960" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.520" end="00:08:34.320" style="s2">right so i think really the question is</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.960" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">right where does the listening happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.320" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">from i think the listening</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">happens from something like the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">in a in the future</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.240" end="00:08:50.720" style="s2">you could say</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.160" end="00:08:55.839" style="s2">the future you could say</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:09:01.839" style="s2">seizes my attention seizes my hearing</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.440" end="00:09:12.720" style="s2">and so i comport myself</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:15.360" style="s2">to it yet i realize that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.720" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">i&#39;m not somebody worthy of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.360" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:24.240" style="s2">however in attuning to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:24.720" style="s2">as it reveals itself it folds back i</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.240" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.720" end="00:09:30.000" style="s2">and attunes me to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:31.279" style="s2">and there&#39;s a mutual disclosure that</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.000" end="00:09:33.600" style="s2">happens at the</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.279" end="00:09:34.839" style="s2">at the edge or the horizon of our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.600" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">intelligibility</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.839" end="00:09:37.839" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">i think we could say that the where</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.120" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">from which listening comes from i</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.519" style="s2">believe</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:52.080" style="s2">it&#39;s in the world right and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.519" end="00:09:56.000" style="s2">precisely</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.080" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">in the world in which calls to my</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.000" end="00:10:03.120" style="s2">the horizon or what&#39;s beyond the horizon</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:04.240" style="s2">which gives the ground is the ground</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.120" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">upon which i step</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.240" end="00:10:07.920" style="s2">forward realizing that</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.000" end="00:10:11.120" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what i&#39;m looking at yet i</p>

<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:23.120" style="s2">in that mutual self-disclosure</p>
