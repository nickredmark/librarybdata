<p begin="00:00:00.380" end="00:00:01.380" style="s2">Hello.</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.500" end="00:00:05.720" style="s2"> This is an invitation to Dutch citizens and leaders alike.</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.840" end="00:00:09.900" style="s2"> I am coming to the Netherlands next week for two reasons;</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.900" end="00:00:13.980" style="s2"> Except the fact that I love the Netherlands and am always looking for an excuse to visit.</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:18.940" style="s2"> First on January 17 from 10 in the morning to 5.30 in the evening</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.140" end="00:00:23.640" style="s2"> I will speak to leaders from corporate members and other organizations in Amsterdam</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.840" end="00:00:26.800" style="s2"> in a session called Foresight on the Future</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.040" end="00:00:30.380" style="s2"> at the Warehouse by Wicked Grounds, in Amsterdam.</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.860" end="00:00:34.260" style="s2"> Details of the session can be found in the description of this video,</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.380" end="00:00:37.460" style="s2"> there you can also find information about tickets, which are still available.</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.820" end="00:00:43.380" style="s2"> I will start that day with a lecture on the psychology of motivation and emotion</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.380" end="00:00:50.400" style="s2"> in which I want to go deep into both the symbolic aspect all the way to the level of neuroscience</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.740" end="00:00:56.000" style="s2"> how it is that vision and motivation and the regulation of emotions are so deeply entwined.</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.320" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2"> What is meant by that</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.620" end="00:01:02.980" style="s2"> the vision we establish for ourselves defines the framework in which one functions in the world,</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.200" end="00:01:06.280" style="s2"> perceive the world around us and react emotionally to the world.</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.280" end="00:01:12.760" style="s2"> I want to help everyone who comes to the session understand what that means</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.780" end="00:01:16.860" style="s2"> in the most modern and current psychological way possible.</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.960" end="00:01:20.760" style="s2"> So that&#39;s why I&#39;ll be talking about that for about 90 minutes, maybe a little longer.</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.900" end="00:01:26.000" style="s2"> After that, participants will have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:29.720" style="s2"> complete, or at least start with, the Future Authoring Program,</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.760" end="00:01:33.080" style="s2"> which is an online program that I developed with my colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.100" end="00:01:37.380" style="s2"> which allows people to thoroughly conceptualize their lives,</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.380" end="00:01:38.800" style="s2"> 3 to 5 years ahead,</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.820" end="00:01:41.480" style="s2"> and thus make a so-called plan</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.740" end="00:01:44.800" style="s2"> to maximize quality of life.</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.160" end="00:01:50.180" style="s2"> You start the &#39;Future Authoring Program&#39;, which is publicly available at selfauthoring.com,</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.180" end="00:01:55.980" style="s2"> you start the program by looking closely at the most important aspects of your life;</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:01:58.680" style="s2"> family, friends, intimate relationships;</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.040" end="00:02:01.600" style="s2"> ambitions for the future from an economic perspective;</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.720" end="00:02:03.680" style="s2"> spending time outside of work;</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.700" end="00:02:08.020" style="s2"> and the regulation and control of drug and alcohol use,</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.120" end="00:02:11.140" style="s2"> and visualize yourself 3-5 years in the future</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.180" end="00:02:14.140" style="s2"> if you lived the life that would be the most optimal for you.</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.140" end="00:02:16.280" style="s2"> The most meaningful and productive life.</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.915" end="00:02:20.805" style="s2"> Then you will be asked to think carefully about those dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.805" end="00:02:24.640" style="s2"> to decide how to specifically optimize those facets.</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.660" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2"> And then write 15 minutes about what your life could be like</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.300" end="00:02:32.760" style="s2"> in 3 to 5 years, if you would take care of yourself as much as someone you love.</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.780" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2"> Then write 20 minutes about what your life would look like if all your bad habits,</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:42.740" style="s2"> your shortcomings and character flaws would prevail and push you into the ground.</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.860" end="00:02:51.420" style="s2"> Then you write a detailed plan of action to achieve your goals and achieve your vision.</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.760" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2"> That includes writing about why it would be good for you to</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:02:59.180" style="s2"> to take steps</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.100" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2"> in this adventure, so to speak.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.660" end="00:03:05.540" style="s2"> But also why it is good for your family and wider society,</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.680" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2"> thus fully articulating a plan.</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.140" end="00:03:10.660" style="s2"> That will take up most of the first day.</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.660" end="00:03:13.900" style="s2"> Details of the event can be found in the description of the video</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.280" end="00:03:21.240" style="s2"> as well as an all-day timetable and information on tickets, if any, that are still available.</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.320" end="00:03:29.520" style="s2"> The second event on January 19 was organized by a Dutch organization: Nederlandse Leeuw.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:36.240" style="s2"> With this event they hope to start a national discussion about Dutch and European identity,</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.320" end="00:03:38.180" style="s2"> and about immigration policy.</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.180" end="00:03:45.620" style="s2"> I am starting this event which includes 2000 people including a few well known speakers from different backgrounds,</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.660" end="00:03:50.260" style="s2"> with a 45-minute discussion about the psychology behind identity</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.340" end="00:03:54.020" style="s2"> and specifically focuses on Europe.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.020" end="00:03:57.240" style="s2"> Broadly speaking, where do we stand in Europe?</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.360" end="00:03:58.820" style="s2"> How did we end up here?</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.020" end="00:04:01.260" style="s2"> What have we done right or wrong?</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.260" end="00:04:06.700" style="s2"> Where are we going and why? And how must each of us behave to get there?</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.760" end="00:04:12.640" style="s2"> How should each of us behave in order for our stable and productive society</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.640" end="00:04:15.780" style="s2"> also remains stable and productive and ...</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.860" end="00:04:21.740" style="s2"> we do not fall prey to the temptations of radicalization, both left and right.</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.820" end="00:04:25.840" style="s2"> I hope to start a process in which deep thought is given during the discussion</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.840" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2"> Organizers hope that this will result in a list of about 25 recommendations</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:35.620" style="s2"> for the future of Dutch and, more broadly, also European and Western society as a whole.</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.700" end="00:04:42.760" style="s2"> There are still tickets available so the information will also be found in the description.</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.840" end="00:04:49.420" style="s2"> Thank you very much, hope to see you there if you are interested.</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.480" end="00:04:53.020" style="s2"> And that&#39;s actually all I wanted to say about it.</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.020" end="00:04:55.020" style="s2"> Bye!</p>
