<p begin="00:27:33.619" end="00:27:40.489" style="s2">life but what we can make a difference</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.379" end="00:27:43.460" style="s2">is the depth to which we live it and</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.489" end="00:27:46.429" style="s2">that the kind of gnosis and love and</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.460" end="00:27:51.739" style="s2">understanding but when you&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.429" end="00:27:55.879" style="s2">hunger for uniqueness and specialness</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.739" end="00:27:58.220" style="s2">and oh what if here I can treasure this</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.879" end="00:28:07.960" style="s2">I can put this on the shelf so all can</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.220" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">see or the other the other BS is content</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.960" end="00:28:15.350" style="s2">just content</p>

<p begin="00:28:15.350" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">this is a subtler form of Gnosticism and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.899" end="00:28:24.399" style="s2">really just okay it&#39;s all just wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.509" end="00:28:32.899" style="s2">so you see I&#39;m trying to exemplify I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.190" end="00:28:35.239" style="s2">not claiming I&#39;m free from this in fact</p>

<p begin="00:28:35.239" end="00:28:37.970" style="s2">think of activating that I&#39;m trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.799" end="00:28:41.450" style="s2">share them with you</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.970" end="00:28:45.739" style="s2">that&#39;s the BS that can come up in</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.450" end="00:28:48.999" style="s2">meditation anything any site that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.739" end="00:28:50.690" style="s2">siren song it&#39;s calling you away right</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.999" end="00:28:53.450" style="s2">it&#39;s calling you away from</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.730" end="00:29:03.019" style="s2">to what is ultimate beyond you and</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.220" end="00:29:04.279" style="s2">within you that&#39;s the BS so I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.019" end="00:29:08.450" style="s2">answered your question Trina it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.279" end="00:29:10.940" style="s2">really important question how is the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.450" end="00:29:12.409" style="s2">setting out of the items facilitating</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.940" end="00:29:17.659" style="s2">the lecture Davina can you get more</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.409" end="00:29:25.639" style="s2">detail on that oh this is this is from</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.659" end="00:29:28.730" style="s2">Thea I pick items that are reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.639" end="00:29:31.759" style="s2">the wisdom house which I am committed at</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.730" end="00:29:34.330" style="s2">least broadly this is the frog which is</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.759" end="00:29:36.909" style="s2">neoplatonism because the fraud starts we</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.330" end="00:29:38.850" style="s2">it starts with one world and it goes</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.909" end="00:29:41.230" style="s2">through a process of transformation that</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.850" end="00:29:43.750" style="s2">conforms it to another world so they can</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.230" end="00:29:47.309" style="s2">live in another way and be in another</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.750" end="00:29:51.700" style="s2">way so that&#39;s the Frog and that the rock</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.309" end="00:29:53.470" style="s2">right there rock it suave it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.700" end="00:29:57.490" style="s2">perfectly symmetrical although it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.470" end="00:30:01.029" style="s2">very beautiful as black and so for me</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.490" end="00:30:04.019" style="s2">this represents sort of Taoism and</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.029" end="00:30:06.850" style="s2">Buddhism that come together in Zen so</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.019" end="00:30:09.700" style="s2">part of Kennedy&#39;s around is remembering</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.850" end="00:30:11.380" style="s2">to remind yourselves of the positive</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.700" end="00:30:13.899" style="s2">you&#39;re committed to and then when I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.380" end="00:30:17.169" style="s2">setting them down on either side of me</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.899" end="00:30:19.510" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to set and by literally so in</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.169" end="00:30:21.519" style="s2">when we embody an act all of our</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.510" end="00:30:22.570" style="s2">cognitive actions are actually just</p>
<p begin="00:30:21.519" end="00:30:24.309" style="s2">acceptations</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.570" end="00:30:27.250" style="s2">of our sensory motor actions when I</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.309" end="00:30:30.940" style="s2">literally sat there surround me that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.250" end="00:30:34.360" style="s2">that&#39;s an enacted image symbolic of me</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.940" end="00:30:37.059" style="s2">setting myself intending to be in this</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.360" end="00:30:40.450" style="s2">course and to surround myself by these</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.059" end="00:30:42.580" style="s2">pathways and that that reminds me so</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.450" end="00:30:45.850" style="s2">that when I&#39;m reading I&#39;m not just</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.580" end="00:30:48.610" style="s2">trying to consume and have propositions</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.850" end="00:30:51.039" style="s2">I&#39;m opening myself up to how something</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.610" end="00:30:52.690" style="s2">will speak to me how the text will speak</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.039" end="00:30:54.850" style="s2">to each other how they&#39;ll speak to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.690" end="00:30:57.730" style="s2">aspects of my psyche that I&#39;m not aware</p>

<p begin="00:30:57.730" end="00:31:06.399" style="s2">logos will come and so it helps me to</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.320" end="00:31:07.750" style="s2">set my intention the specific act of</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.399" end="00:31:09.909" style="s2">setting my intention here for the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.750" end="00:31:12.940" style="s2">reading but setting it with them within</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.909" end="00:31:16.600" style="s2">the broader setting of my commitment to</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.940" end="00:31:20.590" style="s2">my overall paths by which I hope and</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.600" end="00:31:25.720" style="s2">aspire to cultivate more wisdom and</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.590" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">virtue so I hope that was helpful one</p>
