<p begin="00:19:35.480" end="00:19:44.680" style="s2">Taoism because the the tiger represents</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.280" end="00:19:49.400" style="s2">there&#39;s optimal relationship between</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.680" end="00:19:53.650" style="s2">flexibility and force awareness but the</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.400" end="00:19:57.110" style="s2">ability to be still and silent and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.650" end="00:19:59.720" style="s2">Tiger eyes means exactly that that your</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.110" end="00:20:01.970" style="s2">eyes are moving and within it so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.720" end="00:20:03.710" style="s2">not a sort of dull contentedness and</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.970" end="00:20:07.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not a hard fixation on anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.710" end="00:20:09.250" style="s2">it&#39;s very much a flowing soft vigilance</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.040" end="00:20:13.420" style="s2">that&#39;s especially when we&#39;re doing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.250" end="00:20:17.570" style="s2">the yin-yang exercise it flows out and</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.730" end="00:20:25.400" style="s2">flows in and witness towards the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.680" end="00:20:28.160" style="s2">grounding in the center for the ah so</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.400" end="00:20:30.140" style="s2">you&#39;re you you want your vision your</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.160" end="00:20:33.860" style="s2">eyes to be open and you want to have</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.140" end="00:20:35.960" style="s2">flowing flexible but there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.860" end="00:20:38.930" style="s2">there&#39;s force in the sense of like where</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.960" end="00:20:41.090" style="s2">the tiger has that graceful aliveness</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.930" end="00:20:43.880" style="s2">that light from a Tiger Tiger burning</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.090" end="00:20:46.090" style="s2">bright in the forests of the night right</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.880" end="00:20:51.309" style="s2">so you want that</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.090" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">of vision and the idea is and that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.309" end="00:20:56.710" style="s2">we use the term the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:20:59.830" style="s2">perceptual vision if you properly</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.710" end="00:21:02.110" style="s2">practice it in this imaginal fashion not</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.830" end="00:21:04.870" style="s2">imaginary imaginal function actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.110" end="00:21:07.990" style="s2">trains vision in the sense of virtue and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.870" end="00:21:09.610" style="s2">the mental psychological virtuous sense</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.990" end="00:21:12.330" style="s2">of vision like when the bible says</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.610" end="00:21:16.539" style="s2">without a vision the people perish right</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.330" end="00:21:17.200" style="s2">so you that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing your</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.539" end="00:21:20.590" style="s2">training</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.200" end="00:21:23.590" style="s2">Tiger eyes perceptual vision so that you</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.590" end="00:21:26.710" style="s2">actually afford the training of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.590" end="00:21:30.880" style="s2">virtue of vision so I hope that answers</p>

<p begin="00:23:09.340" end="00:23:13.929" style="s2">that&#39;s helpful to you to also not very</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.740" end="00:23:16.360" style="s2">good at visualization so finding the box</p>

<p begin="00:23:18.370" end="00:23:23.230" style="s2">so when you say visualization not does</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.100" end="00:23:24.210" style="s2">that also mean that I know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.230" end="00:23:27.610" style="s2">about five percent of the population</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.210" end="00:23:30.010" style="s2">that it does not really have sort of</p>

<p begin="00:23:33.040" end="00:23:38.350" style="s2">people and so I understand the challenge</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.030" end="00:23:40.570" style="s2">now there&#39;s quite a bit of variation so</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.350" end="00:23:43.210" style="s2">I and I don&#39;t know you so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.570" end="00:23:44.380" style="s2">questions I would ask is right when you</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.210" end="00:23:46.929" style="s2">don&#39;t have the boss cars between a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.380" end="00:23:47.380" style="s2">thought but the is just excellent</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.929" end="00:23:49.450" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.380" end="00:23:50.919" style="s2">do you have noises do your voices can</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.450" end="00:23:53.080" style="s2">you listen for the silence between the</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.919" end="00:23:55.600" style="s2">voices so if it&#39;s if you&#39;ve got good</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.080" end="00:23:57.280" style="s2">auditory imagery rather the visual</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.600" end="00:23:58.750" style="s2">imagery can you shift the metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.280" end="00:24:01.480" style="s2">instead of looking for the space</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.750" end="00:24:03.490" style="s2">listening for the silence or if that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.480" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work feel for the stillness your</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.490" end="00:24:07.660" style="s2">mind is moving you have some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:10.210" style="s2">your mind moving can you get the can you</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.660" end="00:24:12.190" style="s2">also become aware of feeling when your</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.210" end="00:24:17.710" style="s2">mind is still even when your mind is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.190" end="00:24:19.120" style="s2">still taupey kohonen how do I make sure</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.710" end="00:24:23.010" style="s2">I&#39;m not taking spiritual development</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:28.270" style="s2">into having mode inflating yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.010" end="00:24:36.760" style="s2">that&#39;s really good question and the the</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.270" end="00:24:38.350" style="s2">way to ask this is how if asked this</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.760" end="00:24:39.880" style="s2">question really really deeply and what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.350" end="00:24:43.150" style="s2">mean by that is don&#39;t ask it just of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.880" end="00:24:45.460" style="s2">or in the practice because every</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.150" end="00:24:47.710" style="s2">practice has its dangers and its risks</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.460" end="00:24:49.450" style="s2">that&#39;s why I was taught I believe and</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.710" end="00:24:52.299" style="s2">why I&#39;m teaching you an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.450" end="00:24:54.970" style="s2">practices and one of the things and even</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.299" end="00:24:58.090" style="s2">this ecology has to be set into a more</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.970" end="00:25:02.140" style="s2">encompassing ecology of practices and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.090" end="00:25:04.360" style="s2">that&#39;s so that oh how is this</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.140" end="00:25:06.590" style="s2">translating into your life</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.360" end="00:25:09.529" style="s2">I wasn&#39;t translating into other product</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.590" end="00:25:11.900" style="s2">is that you do I recommend having a</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.529" end="00:25:13.600" style="s2">regular self-examination practice drawn</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.900" end="00:25:16.250" style="s2">from stoicism at the end of everyday</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.600" end="00:25:18.470" style="s2">writing in a journal try to reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.250" end="00:25:22.190" style="s2">my moments of mindfulness moments of</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.470" end="00:25:23.809" style="s2">wisdom moments we missed those</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.190" end="00:25:26.419" style="s2">opportunities moments where you fell</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.809" end="00:25:28.909" style="s2">prey to self-deception moments where you</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.419" end="00:25:29.990" style="s2">realize upon reflection you realized</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.909" end="00:25:33.320" style="s2">that you&#39;re a very sort of self</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.990" end="00:25:36.529" style="s2">referential self-centered rather than</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.320" end="00:25:38.899" style="s2">reality centered overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.529" end="00:25:42.559" style="s2">self-centeredness does not mean self the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.899" end="00:25:46.190" style="s2">self abasement it&#39;s it&#39;s but that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.559" end="00:25:48.440" style="s2">the the the middle path is neither self</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.190" end="00:25:50.480" style="s2">abasement in asceticism nor self</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.440" end="00:25:52.460" style="s2">centeredness in self indulgent the</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.480" end="00:25:55.159" style="s2">middle path is to be reality centric</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.460" end="00:25:56.990" style="s2">rather than self centric and so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.159" end="00:25:58.340" style="s2">thinking oh well the alternative to self</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.990" end="00:26:00.830" style="s2">centeredness is i&#39;m going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.340" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2">doormat that&#39;s still locked within the</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.830" end="00:26:09.460" style="s2">that whole way of thinking and so ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.000" end="00:26:13.250" style="s2">yourself when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.460" end="00:26:15.830" style="s2">reminded of your practice throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.250" end="00:26:20.000" style="s2">day and in your uncle&#39;s with each other</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.830" end="00:26:23.720" style="s2">what what comes up for you are you</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.000" end="00:26:25.940" style="s2">remembering it as something that is in</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.720" end="00:26:28.940" style="s2">any way self aggrandizing that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.940" end="00:26:33.940" style="s2">feeling narcissism that is making you</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.940" end="00:26:36.770" style="s2">want to feel special or unique right or</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.940" end="00:26:39.620" style="s2">or perhaps the other that when your</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.770" end="00:26:41.630" style="s2">spiritual comes up it&#39;s it reflects you</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.620" end="00:26:46.850" style="s2">know that the way you dislike yourself</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.630" end="00:26:48.320" style="s2">or hate yourself or are you noting that</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.850" end="00:26:50.149" style="s2">because of your spiritual practice</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.320" end="00:26:52.730" style="s2">you&#39;re getting more of those moments</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.149" end="00:26:54.679" style="s2">when where you&#39;re zeroing in on what&#39;s</p>
