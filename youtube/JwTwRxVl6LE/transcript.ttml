<p begin="00:00:03.780" end="00:00:10.950" style="s2">on together tech project radians we get</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:13.080" style="s2">together and concentrate on one</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.950" end="00:00:14.820" style="s2">particular project this one being our</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.080" end="00:00:18.150" style="s2">project so that&#39;s a little a little</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.820" end="00:00:19.710" style="s2">different but we have the project holder</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.150" end="00:00:22.650" style="s2">give us the aspirations that they would</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.710" end="00:00:24.150" style="s2">most like to get out of the hour and</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.650" end="00:00:26.430" style="s2">then we brainstorm to the best of our</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:28.920" style="s2">ability how to fulfill those aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.430" end="00:00:30.720" style="s2">and then it&#39;s on the project holder to</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.920" end="00:00:31.859" style="s2">actually follow through with them it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.720" end="00:00:33.149" style="s2">little different it all is gonna play</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.859" end="00:00:35.820" style="s2">the project hold or even though we all</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.149" end="00:00:38.340" style="s2">are into the meta project so if you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.820" end="00:00:40.200" style="s2">explain a bit what together tech is what</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.340" end="00:00:42.360" style="s2">the meta project of projects is and then</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.200" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">what the aspirations are for today and</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.360" end="00:00:47.039" style="s2">then maybe then I can add some if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.890" end="00:00:49.070" style="s2">want sure sounds good and unlike other</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.039" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">sessions if I miss something in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.070" end="00:00:53.899" style="s2">description feel free to chime in</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:57.420" style="s2">because that&#39;s actually an option here</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.899" end="00:00:59.910" style="s2">so together Tech is commonly called game</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.420" end="00:01:02.460" style="s2">B projects in Facebook and on YouTube it</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.910" end="00:01:04.110" style="s2">is called together tech we have also</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.460" end="00:01:05.369" style="s2">called that the meta project if you hear</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.110" end="00:01:09.479" style="s2">us talking about that in other videos</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.369" end="00:01:12.299" style="s2">and we call it the meta project because</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.479" end="00:01:14.220" style="s2">it&#39;s a project about projects so for</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.299" end="00:01:15.840" style="s2">example I&#39;ve got wiki election Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.220" end="00:01:18.210" style="s2">has recent score I think Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.840" end="00:01:20.939" style="s2">considers idea cafe sort of your year</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.210" end="00:01:24.500" style="s2">project right solution Aires at the</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.939" end="00:01:26.909" style="s2">moment but idea and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.500" end="00:01:28.439" style="s2">while there&#39;s unique parts to each</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.909" end="00:01:30.360" style="s2">project there&#39;s also a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.439" end="00:01:31.650" style="s2">commonality especially when you get into</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.360" end="00:01:34.140" style="s2">apps that have a lot of sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.650" end="00:01:35.520" style="s2">similar approach like wiki election and</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.140" end="00:01:38.100" style="s2">recent score where it&#39;s kind of defense</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.520" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">making and trying to figure stuff out</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.100" end="00:01:42.479" style="s2">and there&#39;s elements that will need to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:44.670" style="s2">be shared across projects things like</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.479" end="00:01:45.810" style="s2">trust that was a big example for me</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.670" end="00:01:47.430" style="s2">where it&#39;s trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.810" end="00:01:50.070" style="s2">does trust mean to the public and how</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.430" end="00:01:52.200" style="s2">does an organization sort of garner</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.070" end="00:01:55.520" style="s2">trust and keep it not did damage each</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.200" end="00:01:58.140" style="s2">application and any research around that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.520" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">can be usable by anyone else who would</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.140" end="00:02:02.790" style="s2">with a project and then as well all of a</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">sort of more boring stuff that I think</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.790" end="00:02:06.540" style="s2">project owners don&#39;t typically get too</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:08.069" style="s2">excited about working on like C</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.540" end="00:02:10.560" style="s2">marketing parts and be running the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.069" end="00:02:12.900" style="s2">coffee and all that the same sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.560" end="00:02:13.660" style="s2">thing that again not all project owners</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.900" end="00:02:15.670" style="s2">will have and</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.660" end="00:02:19.360" style="s2">ones that don&#39;t have how can we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.670" end="00:02:21.280" style="s2">help supplement each other skills and</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.360" end="00:02:23.800" style="s2">how you know as a group how can we say</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.280" end="00:02:25.360" style="s2">oh I figured out how to solve a certain</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.800" end="00:02:27.220" style="s2">problem that I think all of these these</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.360" end="00:02:30.460" style="s2">projects or at least all you know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.220" end="00:02:32.650" style="s2">of them will end up habit that will end</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.460" end="00:02:34.360" style="s2">up being a lot of different things and</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.650" end="00:02:36.760" style="s2">that&#39;s part of what we&#39;ll get into here</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.360" end="00:02:37.900" style="s2">is maybe did there I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll end</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.760" end="00:02:38.590" style="s2">up being some things that were like that</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.900" end="00:02:42.730" style="s2">sounds great</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.590" end="00:02:45.340" style="s2">probably not the MVP so the aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.730" end="00:02:48.070" style="s2">since that&#39;s I guess where I I&#39;m headed</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.340" end="00:02:50.710" style="s2">is to figure out what the MVP or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.070" end="00:02:53.170" style="s2">Minimum Viable Product is for together</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.710" end="00:02:54.580" style="s2">text so if like as a text solution as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.170" end="00:02:57.460" style="s2">app online let&#39;s say you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.580" end="00:02:59.830" style="s2">together text calm what does that look</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.460" end="00:03:01.450" style="s2">like what is it actually offering people</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.830" end="00:03:02.920" style="s2">who have projects and what is it</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.450" end="00:03:05.590" style="s2">offering people who don&#39;t have projects</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.920" end="00:03:08.350" style="s2">but are you know interested in helping</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.590" end="00:03:10.510" style="s2">with existing projects and anything else</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.350" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">that is necessary in that kind of an</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.510" end="00:03:19.240" style="s2">ecosystem is that I did nothing wrong</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:22.090" style="s2">is that yeah it&#39;s a good aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.240" end="00:03:23.740" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for the MVP and so I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.090" end="00:03:25.690" style="s2">can&#39;t forget back to that aspiration</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.740" end="00:03:28.660" style="s2">when I&#39;m like coming up with my</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.690" end="00:03:30.790" style="s2">billion-dollar ideas and people what and</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.660" end="00:03:32.590" style="s2">the nice thing about the V MVP and this</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.790" end="00:03:35.220" style="s2">conversation because they always end up</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.590" end="00:03:38.140" style="s2">with that okay that&#39;s great but not MVP</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.220" end="00:03:40.150" style="s2">is of course a we&#39;re recording it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.140" end="00:03:41.530" style="s2">it&#39;s easy to go back but it&#39;s meant as</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.150" end="00:03:43.120" style="s2">you can also sort of build up the</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.530" end="00:03:44.560" style="s2">roadmap you can say oh that&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.120" end="00:03:45.489" style="s2">awesome feature I you know that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:47.620" style="s2">didn&#39;t think of it until now</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.489" end="00:03:50.470" style="s2">probably not MVP but we definitely want</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.620" end="00:03:53.590" style="s2">it and just I guess a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.470" end="00:03:56.920" style="s2">context this is coming about because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.590" end="00:03:59.320" style="s2">in the process of writing up the specs</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.920" end="00:04:02.910" style="s2">for wiki election to get sort of MVP</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.320" end="00:04:09.520" style="s2">coded during the they covet 19 lock down</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.910" end="00:04:11.650" style="s2">and I figured like my review of sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.520" end="00:04:13.120" style="s2">day 2 apps of what would he election at</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.650" end="00:04:15.010" style="s2">least the MVP might look like and</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.120" end="00:04:17.310" style="s2">together tech there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.010" end="00:04:20.140" style="s2">similarities and they&#39;re sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.310" end="00:04:22.479" style="s2">not with how the actual end databases</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.140" end="00:04:23.979" style="s2">design but all of your basic stuff right</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.479" end="00:04:26.870" style="s2">and luck registering a user and</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.979" end="00:04:28.910" style="s2">displaying information on a page and sir</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.870" end="00:04:32.030" style="s2">so the goal is I sort of won&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.910" end="00:04:34.130" style="s2">create like an earliest an early version</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.030" end="00:04:37.490" style="s2">of something like that that is neither</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.130" end="00:04:38.930" style="s2">together tech or were collections I sort</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.490" end="00:04:41.060" style="s2">of get an idea for how much it costs and</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.930" end="00:04:42.470" style="s2">then build it out to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.060" end="00:04:45.110" style="s2">it&#39;s got all the features that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.470" end="00:04:46.520" style="s2">shared between wiki elections and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.110" end="00:04:49.310" style="s2">together tech and then I would split it</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.520" end="00:04:50.540" style="s2">off and say here&#39;s the wiki election</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.310" end="00:04:53.419" style="s2">version and actually building up that</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.540" end="00:04:54.590" style="s2">that database and then also use that</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.419" end="00:04:57.800" style="s2">code split to now start building</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.590" end="00:04:58.580" style="s2">together tech so that&#39;s sort of where</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.800" end="00:05:01.970" style="s2">this came from</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.580" end="00:05:04.340" style="s2">is we&#39;ll be building the first part just</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.970" end="00:05:05.570" style="s2">as a part of what wiki election and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.340" end="00:05:07.430" style="s2">sort of copying and pasting that and</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.570" end="00:05:10.430" style="s2">starting a project for together tech</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.430" end="00:05:16.430" style="s2">based on what that project is at that</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.430" end="00:05:20.060" style="s2">point in time if that makes sense but my</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.430" end="00:05:22.820" style="s2">mic was needed um I would like to just</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.060" end="00:05:24.590" style="s2">mention that we right now have been</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.820" end="00:05:28.479" style="s2">trying our minimal Viable Product which</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.590" end="00:05:30.889" style="s2">is the Facebook group itself and it is</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.479" end="00:05:33.380" style="s2">not working as well as I would have</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.889" end="00:05:35.780" style="s2">liked as far as people participating</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.380" end="00:05:37.490" style="s2">putting up their videos commenting</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.780" end="00:05:40.490" style="s2">offering suggestions coming to the</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.490" end="00:05:43.310" style="s2">solution reasons coming to the idea cafe</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.490" end="00:05:44.389" style="s2">is on our projects and I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.310" end="00:05:47.599" style="s2">we want to spend any time brainstorming</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.389" end="00:05:49.639" style="s2">how to improve that or you only want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.599" end="00:05:52.450" style="s2">spend time looking at like creating our</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.639" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">own tech and what that would look like I</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.450" end="00:05:59.090" style="s2">guess what I would suggest is that we we</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:05:59.720" style="s2">talk about what go back kind of first</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.090" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">principles</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.720" end="00:06:06.500" style="s2">what do we need in our projects and how</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:08.599" style="s2">do we want to go about doing that rather</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.500" end="00:06:11.690" style="s2">than I think there&#39;s a temptation to</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.599" end="00:06:16.099" style="s2">think about what we think the community</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.690" end="00:06:19.400" style="s2">needs so I like right hear from you guys</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.099" end="00:06:21.740" style="s2">with which I&#39;ll need your projects yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.400" end="00:06:23.539" style="s2">I think the three of us will be able to</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:25.699" style="s2">give a pretty good insight in what</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.539" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">people who have projects might want out</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.699" end="00:06:30.020" style="s2">of something like together tech the part</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">that we don&#39;t have that we&#39;ll take a</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.020" end="00:06:34.669" style="s2">stab at is live the only ones here he is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:36.380" style="s2">what someone who doesn&#39;t have a project</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.669" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">but might want to help with the project</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.380" end="00:06:40.139" style="s2">what we feel that they might want that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:41.599" style="s2">sort of our two main group</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.139" end="00:06:44.580" style="s2">so that would be using an app like this</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.599" end="00:06:46.919" style="s2">and then I guess dat</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.580" end="00:06:48.210" style="s2">theoretically on that same vein help</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.919" end="00:06:49.919" style="s2">project owners to help each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.210" end="00:06:52.229" style="s2">which kind of end up becoming Disney the</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.919" end="00:06:53.969" style="s2">same thing of somebody helping where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.229" end="00:06:58.259" style="s2">project that&#39;s not theirs whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.969" end="00:07:00.569" style="s2">I think we can actually because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.259" end="00:07:02.969" style="s2">both project holders for our own project</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.569" end="00:07:05.699" style="s2">but we&#39;re also potential participants at</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.969" end="00:07:07.860" style="s2">each other&#39;s projects as we know and so</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.699" end="00:07:09.749" style="s2">can you like take and put on the hats</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.860" end="00:07:11.129" style="s2">right like what would what would get if</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.749" end="00:07:12.599" style="s2">I&#39;m asking a question about solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.129" end="00:07:13.319" style="s2">raising what would get you to do what</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.599" end="00:07:15.360" style="s2">I&#39;m asking</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.319" end="00:07:17.279" style="s2">versus you know for first together</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.360" end="00:07:19.620" style="s2">attack because for solution raising I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.279" end="00:07:21.240" style="s2">have the same like problem as our</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.620" end="00:07:22.469" style="s2">Facebook group it&#39;s only a Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.240" end="00:07:24.900" style="s2">group at the moment and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.469" end="00:07:26.669" style="s2">scheduling calls there&#39;s a spreadsheet</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.900" end="00:07:28.590" style="s2">but no one&#39;s filling it out so that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.669" end="00:07:31.289" style="s2">get seven people on a call but I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.590" end="00:07:32.759" style="s2">there&#39;s one person on and how to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.289" end="00:07:35.430" style="s2">actually deal with that without people</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.759" end="00:07:38.520" style="s2">coming at participating in the why</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.430" end="00:07:40.409" style="s2">aren&#39;t you participating right and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.520" end="00:07:44.219" style="s2">what would get you to participate what</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.409" end="00:07:46.169" style="s2">would give you the most value and so my</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.219" end="00:07:47.639" style="s2">issue with solution raising is basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.169" end="00:07:50.669" style="s2">our issue with together attack of leg</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.639" end="00:07:53.750" style="s2">this could this is only as powerful as</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.669" end="00:07:53.750" style="s2">the people who show up and participate</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.960" end="00:07:58.139" style="s2">yeah and then figure it out the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.339" end="00:08:03.050" style="s2">piece from there and then having people</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.139" end="00:08:07.589" style="s2">the individuals feeling like they have</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.050" end="00:08:09.569" style="s2">quote like that their voice matters that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.589" end="00:08:11.159" style="s2">their ideas matter that like this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.569" end="00:08:13.919" style="s2">space this isn&#39;t about it being just</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.159" end="00:08:15.270" style="s2">mine it is about you can create your own</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.919" end="00:08:17.250" style="s2">solution raise it it doesn&#39;t have to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.270" end="00:08:18.539" style="s2">on my schedule what would get you to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.250" end="00:08:20.639" style="s2">participate in the ones I have right</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.539" end="00:08:22.229" style="s2">like what is creating the communication</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.639" end="00:08:24.500" style="s2">that isn&#39;t hierarchical down it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.229" end="00:08:28.979" style="s2">I&#39;m in charge and I&#39;m running everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.500" end="00:08:32.219" style="s2">it&#39;s how how do you offer your solutions</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.979" end="00:08:34.289" style="s2">in a way that we can all yes and right</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.219" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">and and the ones that absolutely won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.289" end="00:08:37.880" style="s2">work maybe not know</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.860" end="00:08:45.490" style="s2">okay I think on the note you you have</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.230" end="00:08:47.920" style="s2">mentioned something about like should we</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.490" end="00:08:49.180" style="s2">talk about the Facebook group I&#39;m trying</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.920" end="00:08:51.610" style="s2">to do it in Facebook and sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.180" end="00:08:55.510" style="s2">issues with that and I think that is I</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.610" end="00:08:58.390" style="s2">like when we touch on that because I</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.510" end="00:09:00.010" style="s2">agree that we should that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.390" end="00:09:03.010" style="s2">becomes a what does face will give us</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.010" end="00:09:05.230" style="s2">and we know where where can we find an</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.010" end="00:09:06.760" style="s2">MVP feature in there and then also what</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.230" end="00:09:08.770" style="s2">is it not doing that maybe we can say</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.760" end="00:09:12.150" style="s2">from the get-go we want to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.770" end="00:09:14.710" style="s2">that it does this and that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.150" end="00:09:16.270" style="s2">benefits of MVP is it&#39;s now a completely</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.710" end="00:09:19.660" style="s2">separate thing that we can have our</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.270" end="00:09:20.650" style="s2">control over trying to figure out you</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.660" end="00:09:22.540" style="s2">know how do we actually get people</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.650" end="00:09:24.010" style="s2">involved how do we make sure that if we</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.540" end="00:09:26.050" style="s2">put a message if somebody does something</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.010" end="00:09:27.190" style="s2">that the appropriate people are informed</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.050" end="00:09:29.110" style="s2">because that&#39;s part of the issue of</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.190" end="00:09:32.380" style="s2">Facebook is just the torrent of</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.110" end="00:09:33.280" style="s2">information that comes at you and of</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.380" end="00:09:36.040" style="s2">course they just don&#39;t show you</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.280" end="00:09:38.980" style="s2">everything unless somebody wants to pay</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.040" end="00:09:41.710" style="s2">to post that that&#39;s kind of intentional</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.980" end="00:09:43.570" style="s2">on that part so so there are two things</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.710" end="00:09:45.130" style="s2">I think we can be doing further together</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.570" end="00:09:46.900" style="s2">tech Facebook and I can take these for</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.130" end="00:09:48.850" style="s2">solution racing one of which is just</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.900" end="00:09:50.890" style="s2">like we&#39;ve said many times talking about</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.850" end="00:09:52.900" style="s2">the algorithm and like comment and talk</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.890" end="00:09:56.860" style="s2">like things that you want here&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.900" end="00:09:58.860" style="s2">help it grow right but also in the game</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.860" end="00:10:01.600" style="s2">be admin because we have our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.860" end="00:10:03.790" style="s2">Indiamen group for having conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.600" end="00:10:05.710" style="s2">but there&#39;s only 11 of us so it never is</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.790" end="00:10:07.540" style="s2">gonna reach the algorithm having an</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.710" end="00:10:08.890" style="s2">actually explicit if this group is</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.540" end="00:10:10.690" style="s2">important to you and you want to see</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.890" end="00:10:13.150" style="s2">these things over whatever else is in</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.690" end="00:10:15.370" style="s2">your newsfeed turn on notifications to</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.150" end="00:10:17.440" style="s2">all right and so that will that will</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.370" end="00:10:19.600" style="s2">bring it up for the importance of you if</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.440" end="00:10:21.460" style="s2">it is important to you and then also for</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.600" end="00:10:23.260" style="s2">that post in particular through the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.460" end="00:10:25.690" style="s2">comments and stuff so everyone sees this</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.260" end="00:10:29.080" style="s2">so they know to do it maybe even just</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.690" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">saying now this project is it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.080" end="00:10:32.530" style="s2">important to me I actually more want to</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:35.050" style="s2">see my high school friends updates right</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.530" end="00:10:36.490" style="s2">or like what is just having the comments</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.050" end="00:10:38.890" style="s2">and the conversation having the likes</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.490" end="00:10:43.450" style="s2">and then also just explaining how to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.890" end="00:10:44.950" style="s2">turn on the notifications right yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.450" end="00:10:48.040" style="s2">think that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.950" end="00:10:49.480" style="s2">I think that&#39;s yeah that&#39;s definitely a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.040" end="00:10:52.690" style="s2">good thing to make sure that we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.480" end="00:10:53.889" style="s2">taking as full advantage of you know I</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.690" end="00:10:57.189" style="s2">guess what I call like the proto</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.889" end="00:10:58.359" style="s2">type as we can so if it&#39;s doing things</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.189" end="00:11:00.040" style="s2">like hey let&#39;s actually turn on the</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.359" end="00:11:02.470" style="s2">notifications so that we can get more</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.040" end="00:11:04.269" style="s2">people actually showing up to sessions</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.470" end="00:11:09.069" style="s2">and seeing the posts I think that makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.269" end="00:11:11.829" style="s2">all of it sense and then sorry the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.069" end="00:11:13.569" style="s2">thing also I&#39;ve been doing is like when</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.829" end="00:11:16.569" style="s2">I post the one with the stream large</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.569" end="00:11:18.699" style="s2">yard link I go back in and edit it to</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.569" end="00:11:20.199" style="s2">put the actual link and that or I delete</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.699" end="00:11:21.639" style="s2">it if i birdied on that twice so that</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.199" end="00:11:22.869" style="s2">it&#39;s not a bunch of stuff in our</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.639" end="00:11:24.839" style="s2">newsfeed that you don&#39;t need because</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.869" end="00:11:27.369" style="s2">it&#39;s outdated and then whatever the most</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.839" end="00:11:28.869" style="s2">precedent like this one I made the</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.369" end="00:11:30.309" style="s2">announcement for today so that if</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.869" end="00:11:32.350" style="s2">someone&#39;s on that page that&#39;s gonna be</p>

<p begin="00:11:37.779" end="00:11:41.169" style="s2">their project possibly painted and then</p>

<p begin="00:12:07.509" end="00:12:09.999" style="s2">where there was like they posted that</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.499" end="00:12:14.549" style="s2">five years ago and I&#39;m just now seeing</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.999" end="00:12:17.259" style="s2">that yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.549" end="00:12:19.779" style="s2">and then I cuz I&#39;m not a tech person</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.259" end="00:12:21.489" style="s2">Facebook is where I&#39;m like I can maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.779" end="00:12:24.100" style="s2">run a Facebook group and we&#39;re figuring</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.489" end="00:12:27.009" style="s2">out the problems troubleshooting for</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.100" end="00:12:30.459" style="s2">that but for the actual if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.009" end="00:12:32.679" style="s2">concentrating on the coding of an MVP I</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.459" end="00:12:35.139" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily know what you need to</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.679" end="00:12:36.519" style="s2">be able to do that because like why is</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.139" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">it how is it different than the Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.519" end="00:12:40.119" style="s2">group as far as what do you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:42.970" style="s2">you create your own algorithm or no</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.119" end="00:12:44.829" style="s2">algorithm right yes so a big part of it</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.970" end="00:12:47.110" style="s2">is just trying to figure out like I</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.829" end="00:12:48.429" style="s2">guess you would start with what problems</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.110" end="00:12:50.859" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to solve which we sort of</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.429" end="00:12:53.589" style="s2">started with and then you you your next</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.859" end="00:12:55.569" style="s2">layer down kind of becomes the almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.589" end="00:12:58.569" style="s2">how you&#39;d figured that you&#39;re solving</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.569" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">them or like particular features that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.569" end="00:13:03.549" style="s2">you think might solve it right so an</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.160" end="00:13:05.619" style="s2">example might be how are we going to go</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.549" end="00:13:07.810" style="s2">into to notify people if you&#39;re a member</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.619" end="00:13:10.060" style="s2">and you&#39;re somebody who says</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.810" end="00:13:11.170" style="s2">I&#39;m interested in reading score and book</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.060" end="00:13:13.209" style="s2">election which I think will end up</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.170" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">having to be a feature of some way to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.209" end="00:13:17.920" style="s2">you know indicate and interest in a</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.439" style="s2">project if that project has something</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.920" end="00:13:21.699" style="s2">going on how do we want to notify people</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.439" end="00:13:24.490" style="s2">look is that just an email is that a</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.699" end="00:13:26.769" style="s2">text message we give people the ability</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.490" end="00:13:31.480" style="s2">right like what is the MVP I was at MVP</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.769" end="00:13:33.279" style="s2">is probably just email and you can</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.480" end="00:13:35.499" style="s2">technically kind of fake a text message</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.279" end="00:13:36.970" style="s2">through through email as well but then</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.499" end="00:13:39.759" style="s2">it becomes what saw what we need and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.970" end="00:13:42.100" style="s2">what is the MVP versus where do we maybe</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.759" end="00:13:45.040" style="s2">want to end up like it&#39;s pretty easy to</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.100" end="00:13:46.569" style="s2">see if we have a full-fledged app that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.040" end="00:13:48.430" style="s2">where okay maybe it also becomes it have</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.569" end="00:13:49.540" style="s2">on the phone and then it starts to come</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.430" end="00:13:52.120" style="s2">up with notifications on the phone</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.540" end="00:13:56.220" style="s2">that&#39;s something that probably not MVP</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.120" end="00:13:59.470" style="s2">but we&#39;d probably hate to end up there</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.220" end="00:14:02.889" style="s2">yeah I think that notification of what</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.470" end="00:14:05.079" style="s2">is going on actually is MVP is like</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.889" end="00:14:06.550" style="s2">because the Facebook group is the I mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.079" end="00:14:08.230" style="s2">but it&#39;s like how do we get people to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.550" end="00:14:09.339" style="s2">know if we&#39;re not messaging everybody if</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.230" end="00:14:11.819" style="s2">we&#39;re not doing things within Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.339" end="00:14:14.769" style="s2">and it&#39;s email and text message and</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.819" end="00:14:16.779" style="s2">people to opt-in to say yes when I have</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.769" end="00:14:17.889" style="s2">things in this category I want to know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.779" end="00:14:19.209" style="s2">whether right maybe you only wanna know</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.889" end="00:14:23.220" style="s2">about the things in education or in</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.209" end="00:14:25.629" style="s2">recent sense-making right like maybe and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.220" end="00:14:28.269" style="s2">figure you know out that piece of it</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.629" end="00:14:29.829" style="s2">like what how do we get that permission</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.269" end="00:14:32.230" style="s2">from people and how do we get their text</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.829" end="00:14:34.089" style="s2">message and then if we have their text</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.230" end="00:14:36.009" style="s2">message and you know how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.089" end="00:14:38.920" style="s2">send out those notifications because</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.009" end="00:14:42.100" style="s2">that&#39;s not my strong suit right yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.920" end="00:14:43.870" style="s2">the the how to do of we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.100" end="00:14:46.569" style="s2">worry about that yet like aside from the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.870" end="00:14:48.279" style="s2">let&#39;s do it for email because the other</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.569" end="00:14:50.379" style="s2">ways are a bit you know too difficult</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.279" end="00:14:53.079" style="s2">what&#39;s even that it&#39;s not necessarily a</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.379" end="00:14:54.639" style="s2">part of the actual MVP design that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.079" end="00:14:59.459" style="s2">just be guessing what we&#39;ll end up</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.639" end="00:15:01.689" style="s2">having to do alright so some form of</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.459" end="00:15:04.059" style="s2">notification and a way for members to</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.689" end="00:15:05.920" style="s2">like choose what they&#39;re notified on I</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.059" end="00:15:09.249" style="s2">think does that make sense as sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.920" end="00:15:10.720" style="s2">baseline we&#39;ve it has to have that or</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.249" end="00:15:11.860" style="s2">why are we even doing this if you have</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.720" end="00:15:16.350" style="s2">to go checking every day to see what</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.860" end="00:15:20.210" style="s2">what&#39;s new that&#39;s not very good yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.350" end="00:15:21.760" style="s2">that is the need that this fulfilling is</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.210" end="00:15:26.930" style="s2">in our projects we want more</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.760" end="00:15:30.470" style="s2">participation what&#39;s the core need that</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.930" end="00:15:33.200" style="s2">I mean in my mind the cordoning is to</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.470" end="00:15:35.839" style="s2">sort of help get projects off the ground</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.200" end="00:15:40.640" style="s2">and help them get the help they need</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.839" end="00:15:42.740" style="s2">yeah you know so it&#39;s like which might</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.640" end="00:15:45.410" style="s2">be a good place to start because these</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.740" end="00:15:47.810" style="s2">notifications are more for the like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.410" end="00:15:49.850" style="s2">helpers I guess you might call them as</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.810" end="00:15:52.550" style="s2">opposed to like the project owners and</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.850" end="00:15:54.800" style="s2">so like for a project owner what did</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.550" end="00:15:57.200" style="s2">they need what&#39;s sort of the bare</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.800" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">minimum for example to explain your</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.200" end="00:16:01.850" style="s2">project there&#39;s gonna have to be some</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:03.800" style="s2">sort of a profile to say you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.850" end="00:16:05.959" style="s2">what reason score is are you interested</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.800" end="00:16:08.839" style="s2">you&#39;ll have to give some sort of an</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.959" end="00:16:10.430" style="s2">intro it&#39;s just I guess I don&#39;t I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.839" end="00:16:11.839" style="s2">think we have a really good phrasing and</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.430" end="00:16:14.690" style="s2">I think we&#39;re jumping down the design</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.839" end="00:16:16.430" style="s2">path when we&#39;re not sure I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.690" end="00:16:22.700" style="s2">clear understanding that that&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.430" end="00:16:23.690" style="s2">pressing need what&#39;s I mean so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.700" end="00:16:25.459" style="s2">what we&#39;ve talked about in the past</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.690" end="00:16:28.010" style="s2">that&#39;s how we kind of envisioned this</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.459" end="00:16:31.010" style="s2">product but the work I think we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.010" end="00:16:35.540" style="s2">it out of order so what&#39;s the main thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.010" end="00:16:38.650" style="s2">that our individual projects need that</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.540" end="00:16:41.540" style="s2">were that we want to fulfill if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.650" end="00:16:43.459" style="s2">getting other participants then then</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.540" end="00:16:46.250" style="s2">fine let&#39;s talk about notifications but</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.459" end="00:16:47.510" style="s2">if we all need marketing then maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.250" end="00:16:49.040" style="s2">could take a marketing course together</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.510" end="00:16:51.200" style="s2">and we could post that on gave me</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.040" end="00:16:54.740" style="s2">projects and do that as a group of</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.200" end="00:16:56.300" style="s2">through Facebook I mean I don&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.740" end="00:16:58.490" style="s2">clear understanding of what we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.300" end="00:16:59.900" style="s2">to solve we&#39;re still talking solutions</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.490" end="00:17:03.650" style="s2">but we don&#39;t have the problem outline</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.900" end="00:17:06.110" style="s2">right so I I guess the main problem that</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.650" end="00:17:08.030" style="s2">I struggle with in projects is just what</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.110" end="00:17:09.829" style="s2">I call that skill gap right so like I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.030" end="00:17:10.550" style="s2">got certain skills when it comes like</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.829" end="00:17:14.089" style="s2">I&#39;ve got a history</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.550" end="00:17:15.410" style="s2">in product management so that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.089" end="00:17:17.720" style="s2">theory means I&#39;ve got a certain skill</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.410" end="00:17:19.610" style="s2">set but for example I&#39;m not a developer</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.720" end="00:17:22.040" style="s2">so anything to do with so you know like</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.610" end="00:17:23.540" style="s2">the the specs they had a written will</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.040" end="00:17:26.059" style="s2">end up having to be did you know good</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.540" end="00:17:28.580" style="s2">good done over with an actual developer</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.059" end="00:17:31.160" style="s2">and then built out and an tested I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.580" end="00:17:34.070" style="s2">also you know not good at marketing so</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.160" end="00:17:37.550" style="s2">if somebody&#39;s good at at marketing</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.070" end="00:17:39.860" style="s2">and while I&#39;m open to doing things like</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.550" end="00:17:42.530" style="s2">taking courses I also don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.860" end="00:17:44.600" style="s2">everyone will want to sort of have every</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.530" end="00:17:47.630" style="s2">skillset necessary and so it&#39;s to be</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.600" end="00:17:49.490" style="s2">able to sort of I guess list the things</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.630" end="00:17:52.130" style="s2">that I would need help with or that my</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.490" end="00:17:53.780" style="s2">project would you help with and then the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.130" end="00:17:56.180" style="s2">end goal is to have a list of people who</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.780" end="00:17:58.100" style="s2">want to help with projects might have an</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.180" end="00:18:01.280" style="s2">idea of oh I want help with projects and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.100" end="00:18:02.960" style="s2">I&#39;m good at marketing so I&#39;m gonna tell</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.280" end="00:18:04.580" style="s2">the system what I&#39;m interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.960" end="00:18:06.500" style="s2">then I&#39;m good at marketing events it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.580" end="00:18:08.570" style="s2">oh you said that you like you know since</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.500" end="00:18:09.680" style="s2">making and marketing here&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.570" end="00:18:13.130" style="s2">sense-making projects that need</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.680" end="00:18:15.310" style="s2">marketing help so would it be fair to</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.130" end="00:18:21.320" style="s2">say that your biggest need right now is</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.310" end="00:18:23.050" style="s2">volunteers cific skillsets yeah now I</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.320" end="00:18:26.360" style="s2">will say that&#39;s sort of the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.050" end="00:18:29.030" style="s2">thing that I like that I need help with</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.360" end="00:18:32.030" style="s2">that also I think this can reasonably</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.030" end="00:18:33.590" style="s2">solve in the near future like an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.030" end="00:18:37.070" style="s2">thing that a lot of projects need is</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.590" end="00:18:39.050" style="s2">money where you know the end goal of</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.070" end="00:18:41.930" style="s2">this might end up being something like a</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.050" end="00:18:43.970" style="s2">patreon for projects like this a couple</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.930" end="00:18:46.010" style="s2">of people have talked about that we&#39;ve I</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.970" end="00:18:51.620" style="s2">think at least one project it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.010" end="00:18:53.560" style="s2">talking about maybe starting that but in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.620" end="00:18:56.990" style="s2">my mind that you know if you had</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.560" end="00:18:58.880" style="s2">something like I think most of us are</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.990" end="00:19:01.160" style="s2">thinking of together tech as we have</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.880" end="00:19:03.260" style="s2">some different ideas as to like what</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.160" end="00:19:05.630" style="s2">features might end up being there but</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.260" end="00:19:07.940" style="s2">the end idea of helping projects sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.630" end="00:19:09.560" style="s2">tell the need that&#39;s everything from</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.940" end="00:19:11.180" style="s2">just building your audience of people</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.560" end="00:19:12.860" style="s2">who want to know what you&#39;re up to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.180" end="00:19:14.450" style="s2">to building you know an army of</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.860" end="00:19:17.240" style="s2">volunteers who can actually help the</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.450" end="00:19:19.400" style="s2">build it grate it to having audience and</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.240" end="00:19:21.590" style="s2">volunteers or whatever group it is</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.400" end="00:19:24.670" style="s2">actually starting to contribute either a</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.590" end="00:19:28.790" style="s2">one-time or a monthly payment much of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.670" end="00:19:30.650" style="s2">patreon and again that that last thing I</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.790" end="00:19:34.910" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you&#39;d want to try to</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.650" end="00:19:39.320" style="s2">tackle yet so so so add riyals biggest</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.910" end="00:19:41.240" style="s2">need is fun tears with specific skill</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.320" end="00:19:44.180" style="s2">sets so but Jubilee I think yours is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.240" end="00:19:47.570" style="s2">different right yeah mine&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.180" end="00:19:47.910" style="s2">participation so any volunteer who wants</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.570" end="00:19:50.280" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.910" end="00:19:55.500" style="s2">part of an online video conversation and</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.280" end="00:19:57.660" style="s2">then if they&#39;re higher than that like</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.500" end="00:19:58.890" style="s2">not sorry also I would love to record</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.660" end="00:20:02.210" style="s2">them and put them on lines people are</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.890" end="00:20:05.190" style="s2">more willing to do that and but just</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.210" end="00:20:06.660" style="s2">participation and people knowing when</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.190" end="00:20:09.000" style="s2">there is something they can participate</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.660" end="00:20:10.410" style="s2">in and especially if that can be so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.000" end="00:20:12.390" style="s2">guess it&#39;s not marketing it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.410" end="00:20:13.980" style="s2">they can know when something that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.390" end="00:20:16.530" style="s2">route like it then their time schedule</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.980" end="00:20:17.550" style="s2">and it&#39;s within their area of interest</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.530" end="00:20:19.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.550" end="00:20:21.030" style="s2">what does does that work for them those</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.320" end="00:20:22.890" style="s2">people who would participate in any</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.030" end="00:20:24.930" style="s2">solution raising as long as it&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.890" end="00:20:27.210" style="s2">schedule there&#39;s other people who will</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.930" end="00:20:30.780" style="s2">make the time in their schedule for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.210" end="00:20:34.830" style="s2">specific topic and it figuring that</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.780" end="00:20:36.060" style="s2">piece out but I kind of think that what</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.830" end="00:20:40.500" style="s2">we&#39;re doing right now which is a project</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.060" end="00:20:43.740" style="s2">raising on together tech what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.500" end="00:20:46.200" style="s2">do is offer a solution raising on</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.740" end="00:20:47.400" style="s2">projects is like what do we currently do</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.200" end="00:20:49.170" style="s2">when you have an idea to get into the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.400" end="00:20:50.610" style="s2">world what would our deal look like and</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.170" end="00:20:51.600" style="s2">then what is something we can do at ten</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.610" end="00:20:52.980" style="s2">thousand people in hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.600" end="00:20:54.630" style="s2">dollars but that&#39;s not what we need to</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.980" end="00:20:56.040" style="s2">determine this period but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.630" end="00:20:59.490" style="s2">putting it out there that that is what</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.040" end="00:21:01.290" style="s2">I&#39;m sparking is like doesn&#39;t matter if</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.490" end="00:21:02.850" style="s2">you have a project or not if you did how</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.290" end="00:21:07.490" style="s2">would you get into the world and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.850" end="00:21:13.230" style="s2">it&#39;s creating a solution raising on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.490" end="00:21:16.530" style="s2">okay how the human I think for me I just</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.230" end="00:21:18.300" style="s2">need time so if I was gonna need</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.530" end="00:21:22.260" style="s2">anything right at the moment it would be</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.300" end="00:21:24.180" style="s2">another developer to do code reviews and</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.260" end="00:21:26.550" style="s2">pair programming with on the topic and</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.180" end="00:21:29.610" style="s2">kind of review things or speed up with</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.550" end="00:21:31.950" style="s2">some of the simpler stuff that&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.610" end="00:21:33.840" style="s2">core logic of the system which you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.950" end="00:21:37.290" style="s2">everyone can use more software</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.840" end="00:21:40.370" style="s2">developers these days so I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.290" end="00:21:48.300" style="s2">hold back after that then it will be a</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.370" end="00:21:51.240" style="s2">community organizer would be ideal so I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.300" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">guess it does come down to people which</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.240" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">of course you can either get through</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:58.700" style="s2">volunteers or through funding</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.180" end="00:22:07.040" style="s2">so yeah I mean those so I mean those are</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.150" end="00:22:08.990" style="s2">the things we keep talking about but I</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.040" end="00:22:13.370" style="s2">think it&#39;s good to know specifically</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.990" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">like jubblies need is a little different</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.370" end="00:22:19.220" style="s2">from ours because we need specifics it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:21.380" style="s2">what I think one leads to the other like</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.220" end="00:22:23.390" style="s2">I think you don&#39;t get a volunteer with</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.380" end="00:22:24.710" style="s2">felt building an audience first because</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.390" end="00:22:26.600" style="s2">I don&#39;t think people are going to like</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.710" end="00:22:29.240" style="s2">just show off and be like I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.600" end="00:22:30.830" style="s2">work for polar reason score unless they</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.240" end="00:22:33.140" style="s2">know of reason score is they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.830" end="00:22:34.580" style="s2">following it for a while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.140" end="00:22:37.490" style="s2">interested and they say oh they need</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.580" end="00:22:39.110" style="s2">quarters I&#39;m a coder right or like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.490" end="00:22:41.150" style="s2">you&#39;re if you&#39;re following be projects</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.110" end="00:22:42.530" style="s2">and just sort of Lucy bingo what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.150" end="00:22:44.150" style="s2">on over there well they want people to</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.530" end="00:22:47.060" style="s2">go on camera to talk to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.150" end="00:22:49.340" style="s2">education that sounds cool well I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.060" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">you can build a broad audience then try</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.340" end="00:22:54.890" style="s2">and pull people out of it but I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:58.580" style="s2">there are also ways to specifically seek</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.890" end="00:23:02.090" style="s2">out people of a certain type and</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.580" end="00:23:04.360" style="s2">focusing your efforts on those people</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.090" end="00:23:06.890" style="s2">right yeah I think that&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.360" end="00:23:09.230" style="s2">broad marketing versus like guerilla</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.890" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">marketing where it&#39;s the end goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.230" end="00:23:12.890" style="s2">get people on board and whether it&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:14.540" style="s2">know you just put an ad on Facebook or</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.890" end="00:23:16.580" style="s2">you went to like a local game B group</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.540" end="00:23:18.560" style="s2">and got people to sign up at the end of</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.580" end="00:23:21.740" style="s2">the day especially you know for the</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.560" end="00:23:23.900" style="s2">first 200 users for the MVP it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.740" end="00:23:25.310" style="s2">probably mostly going to be that v1 on</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.900" end="00:23:27.050" style="s2">one it&#39;s going to be going up to</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.310" end="00:23:29.540" style="s2">Facebook groups you know on and YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.050" end="00:23:33.620" style="s2">videos and leaving comments and inviting</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.540" end="00:23:38.990" style="s2">people and both you know the project</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.620" end="00:23:41.750" style="s2">owners and the B volunteers and I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.990" end="00:23:43.460" style="s2">yeah I think I was I wasn&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.750" end="00:23:44.420" style="s2">thinking was MVP but now that I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.460" end="00:23:47.270" style="s2">both of you talk about sounds like it</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.420" end="00:23:49.100" style="s2">definitely is is the ability to say what</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.270" end="00:23:51.590" style="s2">you&#39;re interested in like things like</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.100" end="00:23:55.130" style="s2">sense making and then on projects say</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.590" end="00:23:56.810" style="s2">like to categorize them so Beth as an</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.130" end="00:23:58.940" style="s2">audience member you can just say I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.810" end="00:24:01.040" style="s2">interested you know in this area I than</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.940" end="00:24:02.570" style="s2">any new projects that come on we can</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.040" end="00:24:04.310" style="s2">also say oh by the way you said you were</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.570" end="00:24:05.960" style="s2">excited in sense-making and we have two</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.310" end="00:24:08.300" style="s2">new sensor making projects if you want</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.960" end="00:24:12.390" style="s2">to check those out so that&#39;s sort of one</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.300" end="00:24:13.800" style="s2">level of notification that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.390" end="00:24:15.240" style="s2">civically project-based like it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.800" end="00:24:17.730" style="s2">like saying hey recent score has a a new</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.240" end="00:24:20.480" style="s2">video that you should just check out but</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.730" end="00:24:23.430" style="s2">kind of like what one of the earliest</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.480" end="00:24:26.070" style="s2">almost most important parts of it is</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.430" end="00:24:28.200" style="s2">just the sort of match people up saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.070" end="00:24:30.390" style="s2">you said that you were you know a</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.200" end="00:24:32.990" style="s2">volunteer you&#39;ve got these skills which</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.390" end="00:24:35.730" style="s2">that part might even be sort of like I</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.990" end="00:24:38.070" style="s2">think it&#39;s MVP but not like earliest</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.730" end="00:24:39.990" style="s2">earliest version where at first it would</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.070" end="00:24:42.840" style="s2">just be here you know I want to sign up</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.990" end="00:24:44.790" style="s2">as either a member for a project person</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.840" end="00:24:47.310" style="s2">but the project says what categories did</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.790" end="00:24:49.590" style="s2">they fit into and then the the volunteer</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.310" end="00:24:51.720" style="s2">says what categories are interested in</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.590" end="00:24:53.790" style="s2">and then it sort to build a list to say</p>

<p begin="00:26:12.240" end="00:26:16.470" style="s2">four hours look over this code right you</p>

<p begin="00:26:18.210" end="00:26:21.420" style="s2">then right it&#39;s gonna have the skills</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.040" end="00:26:23.460" style="s2">and have that and the more we&#39;re able to</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.420" end="00:26:25.590" style="s2">build that face and not piss them off</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.460" end="00:26:26.040" style="s2">right not send them everything every</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.590" end="00:26:28.290" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.040" end="00:26:29.970" style="s2">but we were trying to focus it and</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.290" end="00:26:32.250" style="s2">listening to that feedback as well of</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.970" end="00:26:34.620" style="s2">whoops what you sent you too many in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.250" end="00:26:36.780" style="s2">last last while right like how do we</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.620" end="00:26:41.550" style="s2">build that base for all of our projects</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.780" end="00:26:44.880" style="s2">and hone it in a way where we&#39;re sending</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.550" end="00:26:47.730" style="s2">the right requests and information to</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.880" end="00:26:48.990" style="s2">the right people right so one option for</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.730" end="00:26:52.430" style="s2">that might be to use something like</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.990" end="00:26:56.490" style="s2">MailChimp which has a fairly large free</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.430" end="00:26:59.400" style="s2">level and then you can you can ask</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.490" end="00:27:03.690" style="s2">questions when they sign up and then</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.400" end="00:27:05.940" style="s2">send out emails based upon their answers</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.690" end="00:27:09.120" style="s2">and I think they have a multiple choice</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.940" end="00:27:12.060" style="s2">or checkboxes or something in there yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.120" end="00:27:15.860" style="s2">so that&#39;s one option there might be</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.060" end="00:27:15.860" style="s2">competitors that would do the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.550" end="00:27:19.920" style="s2">this is where it would be great if there</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.510" end="00:27:21.960" style="s2">was more than three of us participating</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.920" end="00:27:23.670" style="s2">with our projects right some we&#39;d know</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.960" end="00:27:26.460" style="s2">more of what people need and more of</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.670" end="00:27:29.190" style="s2">what but in creating it in a way where</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.460" end="00:27:31.050" style="s2">any of us can Twitter to tweet it or put</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.190" end="00:27:34.800" style="s2">it on Facebook where we&#39;re building the</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.050" end="00:27:36.450" style="s2">audience we&#39;re building that group of</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.800" end="00:27:37.890" style="s2">people right it doesn&#39;t matter whether</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.450" end="00:27:39.960" style="s2">they&#39;re my high school friend or your</p>

<p begin="00:29:31.640" end="00:29:35.789" style="s2">having them opt into that to say here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.710" end="00:29:37.710" style="s2">what I actually want to know about</p>

<p begin="00:29:42.240" end="00:29:46.140" style="s2">the more we can get that information</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:49.260" style="s2">from them in a survey the more we can</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.140" end="00:29:51.630" style="s2">hone how do we how do we all use that</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.260" end="00:29:55.470" style="s2">pool and have people opt in so that all</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.630" end="00:29:58.429" style="s2">of the project all the projects in game</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.470" end="00:30:00.750" style="s2">be projects and together tech can</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.429" end="00:30:03.059" style="s2">benefit from that pool of people without</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.750" end="00:30:06.570" style="s2">pissing off that pool with people right</p>

<p begin="00:30:38.610" end="00:30:46.500" style="s2">want that project to have except the</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.020" end="00:30:49.110" style="s2">Jubilees point of directing people to</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.500" end="00:30:51.870" style="s2">the central together tech to get more</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.110" end="00:30:53.600" style="s2">info on all the all the projects</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.870" end="00:30:59.910" style="s2">it might be good to have those be</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.600" end="00:31:03.330" style="s2">separate email lists or what you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.910" end="00:31:04.920" style="s2">whatever the thing is I guess it depends</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.330" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">on whether we&#39;re doing an MVP with</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.920" end="00:31:09.900" style="s2">existing tariffs or creating our own</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:11.790" style="s2">tech yeah the the current goal is to be</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.900" end="00:31:14.070" style="s2">creating our own tech because it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.790" end="00:31:15.809" style="s2">well not going to be hiring a coder and</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.070" end="00:31:18.600" style="s2">then you know no I think the current</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.809" end="00:31:20.190" style="s2">goal is to get the need filled and I</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.600" end="00:31:21.390" style="s2">don&#39;t think you know if we could do it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.190" end="00:31:23.670" style="s2">with MailChimp why not deal with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.390" end="00:31:26.730" style="s2">MailChimp for free yeah if it can meet</p>

<p begin="00:31:51.030" end="00:31:55.890" style="s2">emails a month right I just like think</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.240" end="00:31:57.240" style="s2">that you have to have a lot more on top</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.890" end="00:32:03.720" style="s2">of that in order to actually drive</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.240" end="00:32:05.250" style="s2">people to to to personally yeah yep but</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.720" end="00:32:07.020" style="s2">we can also so what we could do in</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.250" end="00:32:09.179" style="s2">MailChimp to make it at MVP is to have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.020" end="00:32:11.520" style="s2">newsletter and have it be something that</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.179" end="00:32:13.620" style="s2">is both powerful for the projects that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.520" end="00:32:15.390" style="s2">they want to update so having something</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.620" end="00:32:17.880" style="s2">that has a regular what&#39;s their word</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.390" end="00:32:19.710" style="s2">template where it&#39;s like here&#39;s here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.880" end="00:32:22.260" style="s2">all the projects they&#39;re involved right</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.710" end="00:32:23.429" style="s2">click here to like go and get your</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.260" end="00:32:25.290" style="s2">update if that&#39;s something of interest</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.429" end="00:32:27.179" style="s2">and here&#39;s a new product here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.290" end="00:32:28.530" style="s2">new projects and have them categorized</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.179" end="00:32:29.880" style="s2">so that your guyses is under sense</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.530" end="00:32:32.160" style="s2">making the nice ones render and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.880" end="00:32:33.720" style="s2">also potentially I don&#39;t know there to</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.160" end="00:32:35.550" style="s2">be a weekly or monthly newsletter cuz</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.720" end="00:32:37.530" style="s2">things happen really rapidly but like</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.550" end="00:32:39.990" style="s2">here&#39;s what&#39;s going on in here&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.530" end="00:32:41.640" style="s2">calendar of events going on in the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.990" end="00:32:42.990" style="s2">month right of like if you want</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.640" end="00:32:44.460" style="s2">participate reasons for here&#39;s what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.990" end="00:32:47.280" style="s2">going on in wiki lectures what&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.460" end="00:32:48.570" style="s2">on and but it&#39;s one newsletter right so</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.280" end="00:32:52.710" style="s2">it&#39;s going to go out without that</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.570" end="00:32:54.600" style="s2">codified but but the newsletter itself</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.710" end="00:32:56.580" style="s2">is generated in a way that breaks it</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.600" end="00:32:57.809" style="s2">down to your interest right you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.580" end="00:32:59.160" style="s2">going to care about the non education</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.809" end="00:33:01.860" style="s2">ones right or if you&#39;re only into</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.160" end="00:33:05.580" style="s2">education but just see that and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.860" end="00:33:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s also generating people signing up</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.580" end="00:33:08.910" style="s2">the newsletter people with projects can</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.440" end="00:33:10.530" style="s2">send out that newsletter to their people</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.910" end="00:33:13.850" style="s2">to bring them on to the newsletter and</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.530" end="00:33:18.270" style="s2">it&#39;s building that pool of people I</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.850" end="00:33:20.450" style="s2">guess I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see what the value</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.270" end="00:33:24.000" style="s2">of having a high regular repeating</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.450" end="00:33:27.000" style="s2">newsletter the goal is that we can we</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.000" end="00:33:28.830" style="s2">can send people sub place so we could</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.000" end="00:33:30.750" style="s2">say hey if you&#39;re interested in helping</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.830" end="00:33:33.270" style="s2">out projects and you have any of these</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.750" end="00:33:37.050" style="s2">skill sets or any of these interests go</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.270" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">to this link and fill it in and we will</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.050" end="00:33:43.680" style="s2">you will get an email when something</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:47.480" style="s2">happens I think that&#39;s good as far as a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.680" end="00:33:53.370" style="s2">Minimum Viable Product project and our</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.480" end="00:33:55.920" style="s2">that I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.370" end="00:33:57.660" style="s2">that I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see why we&#39;d add</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.920" end="00:34:00.960" style="s2">the extra complexity of having a regular</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.660" end="00:34:04.170" style="s2">newsletter no I was just like it kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.960" end="00:34:07.260" style="s2">fulfills the need for for just MailChimp</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.170" end="00:34:08.880" style="s2">to have that next layer of like here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.260" end="00:34:09.900" style="s2">like having it in sections where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.880" end="00:34:11.130" style="s2">like if you want to follow your favorite</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.900" end="00:34:12.240" style="s2">project here&#39;s all the projects they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.130" end="00:34:13.350" style="s2">involved maybe that&#39;s at the very end</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.240" end="00:34:16.080" style="s2">because it is the thing that would be</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.350" end="00:34:18.330" style="s2">generating constantly but also like here</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.080" end="00:34:19.290" style="s2">if you&#39;re a coder here it&#39;s what we need</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.330" end="00:34:21.810" style="s2">right here&#39;s where we need volunteers</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.290" end="00:34:24.360" style="s2">here&#39;s where we need skillset and so it</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.810" end="00:34:25.920" style="s2">would go out to people who but the more</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.360" end="00:34:27.720" style="s2">we can hone that so that it&#39;s not one</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.920" end="00:34:29.850" style="s2">newsletter that goes out to everyone the</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.720" end="00:34:31.650" style="s2">same the ideas that we don&#39;t have a pool</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.850" end="00:34:33.870" style="s2">of people yet so great to create that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.650" end="00:34:35.880" style="s2">pool of people it&#39;s a more generalized</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.870" end="00:34:37.460" style="s2">newsletter that is like look at all</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.880" end="00:34:41.520" style="s2">these projects and how they&#39;re involved</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.460" end="00:34:43.320" style="s2">I&#39;ll say I agree with Bentley in that to</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.520" end="00:34:46.770" style="s2">me newsletters don&#39;t make sense</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.320" end="00:34:48.900" style="s2">simply because each email sucks like</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.770" end="00:34:50.700" style="s2">people open up maybe 1% of emails that</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.900" end="00:34:52.470" style="s2">they receive even if you sign up and</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.700" end="00:34:54.720" style="s2">want to see it very likely gets lost</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.470" end="00:34:57.330" style="s2">amongst the witch even like to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.720" end="00:34:58.830" style="s2">email notifications for it that&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.330" end="00:35:00.150" style="s2">like an hoping that there&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.830" end="00:35:03.600" style="s2">a couple of them and you have a higher</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.150" end="00:35:06.540" style="s2">chance to to see one I think that</p>
<p begin="00:35:03.600" end="00:35:10.230" style="s2">becomes like a small sliver and then we</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.540" end="00:35:12.330" style="s2">talk about ways to improve it and well I</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.230" end="00:35:14.280" style="s2">think that if we can do this with a</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.330" end="00:35:17.190" style="s2">collection of tools that&#39;s a good start</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.280" end="00:35:18.360" style="s2">starting point personally my like the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.190" end="00:35:19.290" style="s2">goal here is to actually come up with</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.360" end="00:35:20.760" style="s2">the Minimum Viable</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.290" end="00:35:23.520" style="s2">product with something that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.760" end="00:35:25.530" style="s2">built and it&#39;s not pretty it&#39;s not you</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.520" end="00:35:27.510" style="s2">know it probably doesn&#39;t even have 5% of</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.530" end="00:35:29.240" style="s2">the features it will end up with but but</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.510" end="00:35:32.070" style="s2">it&#39;s just saying like what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.240" end="00:35:34.290" style="s2">interesting and easy enough that we</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.070" end="00:35:36.900" style="s2">could possibly do this you know like</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.290" end="00:35:38.340" style="s2">drop the the specs and my eventual goal</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.900" end="00:35:41.880" style="s2">is to pay out-of-pocket for actually a</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.340" end="00:35:44.280" style="s2">coder to come in and and code this what</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.880" end="00:35:46.110" style="s2">is that code adapt look look like and</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.280" end="00:35:50.460" style="s2">then for things like it might just be</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.110" end="00:35:52.500" style="s2">you know using an API to talk to to a to</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.460" end="00:35:56.280" style="s2">MailChimp or someone so we don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.500" end="00:35:58.740" style="s2">reinvent the email wheel that&#39;s fine but</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">so i guess my thing is well what does</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.740" end="00:36:02.520" style="s2">that product have to look like so that</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.230" style="s2">we like we as product owners would</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.520" end="00:36:05.880" style="s2">actually want to sign up and we as</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.230" end="00:36:07.770" style="s2">people who are interested helping other</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.880" end="00:36:09.840" style="s2">projects that that part appeal stuff to</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.770" end="00:36:11.850" style="s2">us as well is if we only have one i</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.840" end="00:36:13.410" style="s2">guess technically we could just start</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.850" end="00:36:16.170" style="s2">out with projects and almost sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.410" end="00:36:17.670" style="s2">make it like a project directory we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.170" end="00:36:19.560" style="s2">not sure why projects would come on</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.670" end="00:36:22.500" style="s2">board if there isn&#39;t that flipside of oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.560" end="00:36:25.580" style="s2">and by the way the end goal of its is</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.500" end="00:36:28.320" style="s2">that you get help with your project i</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.580" end="00:36:30.600" style="s2">think if we have people that are</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.320" end="00:36:32.700" style="s2">interested projects and we&#39;re telling</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.600" end="00:36:34.620" style="s2">people projects will come on board I</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.700" end="00:36:36.000" style="s2">don&#39;t think finding the projects is is</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.620" end="00:36:41.910" style="s2">the challenging bet I think the hard</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.000" end="00:36:43.800" style="s2">part&#39;s finding the volunteers and I you</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.910" end="00:36:45.330" style="s2">you were kind of saying that email sucks</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.800" end="00:36:47.820" style="s2">but I think all the solutions we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.330" end="00:36:49.830" style="s2">discussing or email so I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.820" end="00:36:53.130" style="s2">you&#39;re proposing how&#39;s that I&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.830" end="00:36:54.690" style="s2">email becomes one prong as it right so</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.130" end="00:36:57.180" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying don&#39;t do email I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.690" end="00:36:59.760" style="s2">saying don&#39;t put a lot of work into</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.180" end="00:37:01.290" style="s2">making email work as a system knowing</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.760" end="00:37:03.390" style="s2">that like I&#39;ve signed up for newsletters</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.290" end="00:37:05.340" style="s2">and then you know open them once or</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.390" end="00:37:07.410" style="s2">twice and then just lost interest for a</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.340" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">while and now I see that same news that</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.410" end="00:37:11.940" style="s2">are hopping up that I might open well</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:12.930" style="s2">you know once a month now do you wanna</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.940" end="00:37:14.670" style="s2">thinking of is that daily e-newsletter</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.930" end="00:37:16.860" style="s2">which we were talking about but still</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.670" end="00:37:18.660" style="s2">well yeah but if you&#39;re if you&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.860" end="00:37:20.430" style="s2">getting an email when something new</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.660" end="00:37:23.190" style="s2">happens and it&#39;s not a recurring thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.430" end="00:37:26.340" style="s2">which has other risks then you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.190" end="00:37:28.380" style="s2">likely to open it up I think unless you</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.340" end="00:37:31.620" style="s2">I think it depends on the person right</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.380" end="00:37:33.210" style="s2">like just if you email too often you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.620" end="00:37:37.080" style="s2">likely to get unsubscribed for</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.210" end="00:37:39.120" style="s2">sure if you like well they&#39;ll forget</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.080" end="00:37:41.040" style="s2">about that they signed up for the emails</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.120" end="00:37:43.910" style="s2">the yeah yeah I mean they do talk about</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.040" end="00:37:47.220" style="s2">keeping email lists warm and stuff but</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.910" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">you know that there&#39;s a risk both ways</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.220" end="00:37:51.720" style="s2">that this sort of thing but if our goal</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:55.050" style="s2">is to just is just to have a</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.720" end="00:37:57.390" style="s2">notification system that we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.050" end="00:37:59.520" style="s2">a place the word we could have a list of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.390" end="00:38:06.530" style="s2">people that have interests and their</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.520" end="00:38:06.530" style="s2">skills that then we can notify them when</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.830" end="00:38:12.810" style="s2">either new projects come about or you</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.710" end="00:38:17.040" style="s2">know a project significantly changes or</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.810" end="00:38:18.690" style="s2">has a new need then then I think we can</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.040" end="00:38:21.210" style="s2">we can do that but that&#39;s different from</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.690" end="00:38:23.010" style="s2">having a project directory yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.210" end="00:38:26.610" style="s2">different feature so the thing that I do</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.010" end="00:38:28.410" style="s2">like about that is like the way that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.610" end="00:38:30.510" style="s2">am planning and I think for wiki</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.410" end="00:38:33.210" style="s2">election there&#39;s no around this for</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.510" end="00:38:34.530" style="s2">together tech it might be possible is I</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.210" end="00:38:37.290" style="s2">really don&#39;t want to get people another</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.530" end="00:38:40.010" style="s2">freaking login like that part to me is</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.290" end="00:38:42.150" style="s2">like I just really if people have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.010" end="00:38:45.810" style="s2">remember another login or another</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.150" end="00:38:47.520" style="s2">password that&#39;s just another barrier to</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.810" end="00:38:49.260" style="s2">entry that is something I do like about</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.520" end="00:38:51.990" style="s2">that system about like just using</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.260" end="00:38:53.580" style="s2">MailChimp in a survey is as long as you</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.990" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">know you can just say here&#39;s my email I</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.580" end="00:38:59.070" style="s2">mean it says great what do you want us</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:39:02.070" style="s2">to sign up for it&#39;s very low low</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.070" end="00:39:04.050" style="s2">friction as far as getting people to</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.070" end="00:39:07.590" style="s2">sign up and manage their I do like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.050" end="00:39:09.330" style="s2">about it we not use the Facebook and</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.590" end="00:39:14.670" style="s2">Google logins I know they&#39;re not ideal</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.330" end="00:39:18.120" style="s2">for when Facebook when we know that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.670" end="00:39:19.560" style="s2">that&#39;s to me quite considering I try to</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.120" end="00:39:21.810" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to create a like technology</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.560" end="00:39:22.890" style="s2">cooperative but it competes the ball why</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.810" end="00:39:24.930" style="s2">are you trying to use them like that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.890" end="00:39:26.490" style="s2">where the people are and that&#39;s I&#39;m with</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.930" end="00:39:28.740" style="s2">discord is they don&#39;t have that and so</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.490" end="00:39:30.750" style="s2">it&#39;s a new login every time that</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.740" end="00:39:33.060" style="s2">somebody sends you a link to do to do it</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.750" end="00:39:34.770" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t really realize</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.060" end="00:39:36.150" style="s2">that I&#39;m going to I&#39;m the same person</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.770" end="00:39:38.370" style="s2">that you know what excited for the</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.150" end="00:39:41.880" style="s2">cooperative&#39;s as game be as this you</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.370" end="00:39:44.490" style="s2">know and so for that but I feel like</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.880" end="00:39:45.960" style="s2">creating an MVP that&#39;s out that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.490" end="00:39:47.730" style="s2">just an email list like that</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.960" end="00:39:49.109" style="s2">that is doable and we could you know</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.730" end="00:39:50.580" style="s2">generate something else but if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.109" end="00:39:53.609" style="s2">actually coding something outside of</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.580" end="00:39:55.470" style="s2">Facebook and Google and those is we</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.609" end="00:39:57.390" style="s2">don&#39;t have the people and so creating</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.470" end="00:39:59.400" style="s2">something is expensive and</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.390" end="00:40:00.960" style="s2">time-consuming when we don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.400" end="00:40:03.180" style="s2">people to say here&#39;s what I want out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.960" end="00:40:05.099" style="s2">it and here&#39;s what what what this is</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.180" end="00:40:07.349" style="s2">which we might be able to generate more</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.099" end="00:40:08.900" style="s2">of that by doing or at least solutions</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.349" end="00:40:11.280" style="s2">that are generative through a project</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.900" end="00:40:13.230" style="s2">raising on it</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.280" end="00:40:15.450" style="s2">but all of it is gonna come down to how</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.230" end="00:40:17.970" style="s2">do we actually get 10,000 people right</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.450" end="00:40:20.430" style="s2">like how do we our a thousand or 100 any</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.970" end="00:40:23.070" style="s2">a number right like how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.430" end="00:40:24.330" style="s2">keep create something that people want</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.070" end="00:40:25.980" style="s2">to come to because I don&#39;t really want</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.330" end="00:40:29.580" style="s2">to sign up for another email list right</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.980" end="00:40:31.830" style="s2">I&#39;m not like oh now that is wait whereas</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.580" end="00:40:33.300" style="s2">something like a patreon that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.830" end="00:40:35.310" style="s2">designed around projects where I can be</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.300" end="00:40:36.750" style="s2">like people can request things of me and</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.310" end="00:40:41.160" style="s2">I can do surveys and things that are</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.750" end="00:40:42.990" style="s2">that sounds much more fun but yeah then</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.160" end="00:40:44.670" style="s2">it&#39;s not MVP right like then it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.990" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">okay well and so that&#39;s where to me the</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.670" end="00:40:48.869" style="s2">10,000 and people and $100,000 is to me</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:51.180" style="s2">where I&#39;m focusing my energy because</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.869" end="00:40:52.109" style="s2">it&#39;s like once and that&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.180" end="00:40:53.160" style="s2">excited about cuz that&#39;s sort of been</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.109" end="00:40:54.869" style="s2">sitting with this week is looking</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.160" end="00:40:57.030" style="s2">through the solution raising so I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.869" end="00:40:59.040" style="s2">now that we have several of them I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.030" end="00:41:02.400" style="s2">to do one more on labor and then I want</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.040" end="00:41:04.380" style="s2">to do one on solution raising and but</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.400" end="00:41:06.330" style="s2">it&#39;s and then which means how do we</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.380" end="00:41:08.070" style="s2">actually get 10,000 people right and how</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.330" end="00:41:11.670" style="s2">do we work with 10,000 people and how do</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.070" end="00:41:13.920" style="s2">we do that so I think that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.670" end="00:41:15.960" style="s2">interesting part is and this is where</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.920" end="00:41:18.210" style="s2">building MVPs is always interesting</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.960" end="00:41:20.670" style="s2">because there&#39;s not like it&#39;s such a</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.210" end="00:41:23.970" style="s2">nebulous term for a lot of people I</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.670" end="00:41:26.700" style="s2">think the M in the V or in you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.970" end="00:41:27.839" style="s2">stark contrast with each other where you</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.700" end="00:41:30.660" style="s2">want to make it as minimal as possible</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.839" end="00:41:32.580" style="s2">but it has to be viable so if people if</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.660" end="00:41:34.260" style="s2">you have a tool but nobody will use it</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.580" end="00:41:36.599" style="s2">it&#39;s not viable they&#39;re like great you</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.260" end="00:41:39.540" style="s2">have an app it sucks thanks for building</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.599" end="00:41:41.520" style="s2">that that they help no one but if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.540" end="00:41:43.200" style="s2">build it over the top and you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.520" end="00:41:44.940" style="s2">great that&#39;s too much and the feature</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.200" end="00:41:48.150" style="s2">don&#39;t make sense you didn&#39;t get feedback</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.940" end="00:41:52.520" style="s2">or earlier enough so what does it look</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.150" end="00:41:55.710" style="s2">like like for us to actually say and you</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.520" end="00:41:56.940" style="s2">it any of these projects are going to</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.710" end="00:41:59.520" style="s2">have that really weird uncomfortable</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.940" end="00:42:01.440" style="s2">time where</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.520" end="00:42:03.660" style="s2">if you build something you&#39;re not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.440" end="00:42:05.970" style="s2">start up with users even if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.660" end="00:42:07.470" style="s2">email list and then you know you have a</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.970" end="00:42:09.090" style="s2">thousand people and you build an app and</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.470" end="00:42:11.160" style="s2">say oh hey everyone we just built an app</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.090" end="00:42:13.590" style="s2">go and sign up a lot of them probably</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.160" end="00:42:15.630" style="s2">won&#39;t a part you guys they didn&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.590" end="00:42:18.870" style="s2">the email or they just you know don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.630" end="00:42:20.970" style="s2">want to create another login whatever</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.870" end="00:42:22.800" style="s2">that reason is there&#39;s gonna be that</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.970" end="00:42:26.130" style="s2">process for you again and have to get</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.800" end="00:42:28.820" style="s2">people to now sign up on the app so if</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.130" end="00:42:31.440" style="s2">we have a sort of a stepping stone of</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.820" end="00:42:33.570" style="s2">like using a survey to build a list of</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.440" end="00:42:36.060" style="s2">people who hears your interest and</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.570" end="00:42:37.530" style="s2">here&#39;s your year your skill set if we</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.060" end="00:42:39.510" style="s2">can find a way to make that viable I</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.530" end="00:42:41.400" style="s2">like it because it&#39;s it&#39;s fast that we</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.510" end="00:42:43.920" style="s2">can do that now without having to code</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.400" end="00:42:45.870" style="s2">something but I think for the actual</p>

<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:29.130" style="s2">like actually being able to find then I</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.539" end="00:49:31.199" style="s2">can find all of the times we&#39;ve talked</p>

<p begin="00:49:31.199" end="00:49:34.769" style="s2">it I want to follow trust like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.670" end="00:49:37.949" style="s2">so many ways to categorize this it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.769" end="00:49:39.449" style="s2">like the data pool that as a user I can</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.949" end="00:49:40.829" style="s2">I can get more access to you and then</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.449" end="00:49:42.749" style="s2">all the things we can we can build off</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.829" end="00:49:44.219" style="s2">of that but isn&#39;t and it is a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.749" end="00:49:47.489" style="s2">minimal Viable Product right where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.219" end="00:49:48.869" style="s2">like just a profile and like it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.489" end="00:49:50.699" style="s2">start with all of that it&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.869" end="00:49:53.219" style="s2">person and project and here&#39;s all the</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.699" end="00:49:54.449" style="s2">places where I have been wet and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.219" end="00:49:55.319" style="s2">sort of like a squat to store the</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.449" end="00:49:57.029" style="s2">content where they&#39;re saying they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.319" end="00:49:58.529" style="s2">talking about that project these three</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.029" end="00:49:59.999" style="s2">people but it&#39;s just like here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.529" end="00:50:01.979" style="s2">content here&#39;s who&#39;s involved there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.999" end="00:50:04.049" style="s2">found that back-end to it but the front</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.979" end="00:50:06.269" style="s2">end is just your tracking projects your</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.049" end="00:50:07.709" style="s2">tracking people and then like how they</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.269" end="00:50:12.630" style="s2">interrelate and the content that gets</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.709" end="00:50:14.219" style="s2">created I guess the the risk I see what</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.630" end="00:50:16.699" style="s2">that is now it&#39;s another channel I have</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.219" end="00:50:19.589" style="s2">to maintain because I&#39;m not going to</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.699" end="00:50:22.499" style="s2">have that as my barrier because I think</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.589" end="00:50:31.319" style="s2">having everyone&#39;s content sourced out of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.499" end="00:50:33.239" style="s2">a single place is risky so died and you</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.319" end="00:50:35.519" style="s2">know I&#39;d like the idea of having a place</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.239" end="00:50:39.479" style="s2">where we can build off each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.519" end="00:50:41.819" style="s2">audiences but I didn&#39;t see how having a</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.479" end="00:50:45.180" style="s2">place for us to store content does that</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.819" end="00:50:47.910" style="s2">those are two separate things and that</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.180" end="00:50:51.299" style="s2">they&#39;re not directly what is an actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.910" end="00:50:53.070" style="s2">it might not be MVP I think we want it</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.299" end="00:50:55.680" style="s2">at some point but I agree it&#39;s not net</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.070" end="00:50:58.200" style="s2">Sara Lee MVP it&#39;s not you know we</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.680" end="00:51:00.690" style="s2">couldn&#39;t hear it but it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.200" end="00:51:03.960" style="s2">which I you know I think it took us a</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.690" end="00:51:07.110" style="s2">while to to get here but it&#39;s good what</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.960" end="00:51:08.700" style="s2">is that so if we&#39;re saying that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.110" end="00:51:10.710" style="s2">like they&#39;re following a person and</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.700" end="00:51:14.250" style="s2">their content or that maybe that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.710" end="00:51:16.910" style="s2">MVP I think it&#39;s cool but yeah maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.250" end="00:51:20.100" style="s2">so MVP guaranteed you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.910" end="00:51:22.650" style="s2">project page or what else is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.100" end="00:51:24.510" style="s2">it really is just hard to be Facebook ad</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.650" end="00:51:25.830" style="s2">that point it just like when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.510" end="00:51:27.480" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing to do you would just</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.830" end="00:51:29.130" style="s2">sign up for a profile I have nothing to</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.480" end="00:51:30.960" style="s2">do so I think it&#39;s there&#39;s members</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.130" end="00:51:34.590" style="s2">there&#39;s projects you can follow a</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.960" end="00:51:36.210" style="s2">project there&#39;s I think there was</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.590" end="00:51:37.830" style="s2">something I think you had said Bentley</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.210" end="00:51:40.200" style="s2">where you&#39;re sort of like getting around</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.830" end="00:51:43.800" style="s2">to you know you can post it on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.200" end="00:51:46.170" style="s2">and and you would need some way to say</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.800" end="00:51:48.120" style="s2">like here&#39;s a public facing side so I</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.170" end="00:51:49.620" style="s2">can put a link on Twitter and on these</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.120" end="00:51:53.450" style="s2">other channels you say hey go check out</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.620" end="00:51:57.750" style="s2">this did this video or blog post or</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.450" end="00:52:02.100" style="s2">whatever now that sort of leads back in</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.750" end="00:52:05.160" style="s2">that is that part the minimum viable if</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.100" end="00:52:06.960" style="s2">we just have a project page of people</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.160" end="00:52:10.290" style="s2">following a project but there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.960" end="00:52:16.170" style="s2">capacity for like the project to provide</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.290" end="00:52:17.910" style="s2">updates is that useful well okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.170" end="00:52:20.910" style="s2">let&#39;s take even a step for the back so</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.910" end="00:52:22.770" style="s2">like we we figured out that it&#39;d be nice</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.910" end="00:52:25.290" style="s2">to be notified when something happens</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.770" end="00:52:27.690" style="s2">within your interest area and in a skill</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.290" end="00:52:29.550" style="s2">set that you have and then now we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.690" end="00:52:33.420" style="s2">saying we would like to have a place</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.550" end="00:52:37.530" style="s2">that when someone first goes there they</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.420" end="00:52:40.080" style="s2">can kind of see a live result of that</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.530" end="00:52:42.600" style="s2">same search like what&#39;s happened in the</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.080" end="00:52:44.100" style="s2">past without the notification ROI the</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.600" end="00:52:45.570" style="s2">main thing right yeah so you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.100" end="00:52:47.160" style="s2">and say here&#39;s what I&#39;m here&#39;s what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.570" end="00:52:50.190" style="s2">interested in and here&#39;s my skill set</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.160" end="00:52:53.120" style="s2">what&#39;s what in the past has happened and</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.190" end="00:52:55.830" style="s2">and so a MailChimp solution wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.120" end="00:52:59.340" style="s2">solve that I can&#39;t think of any way</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.830" end="00:53:01.770" style="s2">using the existing technology and then I</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.340" end="00:53:03.540" style="s2">think you&#39;d be like here&#39;s the last five</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.770" end="00:53:05.880" style="s2">who knew there&#39;s we&#39;ve sent out in case</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.540" end="00:53:06.890" style="s2">you&#39;re interested well it no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.880" end="00:53:09.810" style="s2">here&#39;s the last</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.890" end="00:53:12.360" style="s2">it would be here&#39;s the last or the</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.810" end="00:53:17.130" style="s2">complete history of everything that</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.360" end="00:53:22.470" style="s2">matches what you selected right all</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.130" end="00:53:24.870" style="s2">right okay so yes that&#39;s a feature we</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.470" end="00:53:26.940" style="s2">don&#39;t have oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.870" end="00:53:28.560" style="s2">that history and that&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.940" end="00:53:30.000" style="s2">just because of how this is being built</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.560" end="00:53:31.710" style="s2">will end up being able to do that part</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.000" end="00:53:35.280" style="s2">of it I mean if we can&#39;t then the whole</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.710" end="00:53:37.980" style="s2">thing sunk anyway that&#39;s a one of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.280" end="00:53:40.770" style="s2">main things I&#39;m interested to think what</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.980" end="00:53:43.080" style="s2">you think either from a project side or</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.770" end="00:53:45.480" style="s2">like a volunteer side that relationship</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.080" end="00:53:46.830" style="s2">between person and project not the</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.480" end="00:53:50.040" style="s2">project owner just either somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.830" end="00:53:52.980" style="s2">interested in or what the volunteer what</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.040" end="00:53:54.720" style="s2">sort of the smallest thing that we can</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.980" end="00:53:57.240" style="s2">do that would actually be interesting is</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.720" end="00:54:00.540" style="s2">that I think it is important to realize</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.240" end="00:54:02.340" style="s2">we are reading the wheel we&#39;re just sort</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.540" end="00:54:04.230" style="s2">of adding one or two extra spokes to put</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.340" end="00:54:06.900" style="s2">it you know it&#39;s a special spin on it</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.230" end="00:54:09.450" style="s2">but effectively yeah this is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.900" end="00:54:12.720" style="s2">like trying to reinvent Facebook /</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.450" end="00:54:16.740" style="s2">patreon / some of that stuff really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.720" end="00:54:18.170" style="s2">very patreon asked at its core there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.740" end="00:54:21.090" style="s2">just a bunch of extra stuff on top</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.170" end="00:54:22.260" style="s2">that&#39;s important and to start out with</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.090" end="00:54:24.930" style="s2">there won&#39;t be a payment thing because</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.260" end="00:54:26.550" style="s2">that really complicates it but in my</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.930" end="00:54:28.110" style="s2">mind we&#39;re building towards that point</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.550" end="00:54:30.120" style="s2">like that sort of one of the end points</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.110" end="00:54:32.070" style="s2">is having a be that ecosystem that</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.120" end="00:54:34.080" style="s2">patreon asked but we&#39;re instead of being</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.070" end="00:54:36.630" style="s2">like a creator of like entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.080" end="00:54:38.460" style="s2">which typically in my experience is what</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.630" end="00:54:40.260" style="s2">patreon is for this is specifically</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.460" end="00:54:41.850" style="s2">around like game D projects so what is</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.260" end="00:54:44.610" style="s2">that need</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.850" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">I mean I&#39;d my I guess my philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.610" end="00:54:49.680" style="s2">ongoing or be that we identified the</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:51.690" style="s2">most important need and try and solve</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.680" end="00:54:55.260" style="s2">that need rather than having this target</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.690" end="00:54:57.650" style="s2">go cuz I think our target is I&#39;d kind of</p>
<p begin="00:54:55.260" end="00:55:02.820" style="s2">disagree with that we&#39;re creating</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.650" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">patreon for projects what would you guys</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.820" end="00:55:07.110" style="s2">think I would rather not have that</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:09.150" style="s2">destination so we can find it on our</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.110" end="00:55:12.440" style="s2">path there so I&#39;d rather go agile rather</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.150" end="00:55:16.200" style="s2">than waterfall I guess this was like a</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.440" end="00:55:19.350" style="s2">job the project has an purpose a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.200" end="00:55:20.310" style="s2">not a feature set your listing a feature</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.350" end="00:55:24.120" style="s2">set not</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.310" end="00:55:26.580" style="s2">true but even have a road map and road</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.120" end="00:55:30.390" style="s2">maps do contain that like we&#39;ll try to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.580" end="00:55:33.330" style="s2">do these road maps are very very very</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.390" end="00:55:35.370" style="s2">loose the looser the better the less of</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.330" end="00:55:37.080" style="s2">a road map the better a road map is just</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.370" end="00:55:39.690" style="s2">because businesses need it not because</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.080" end="00:55:41.550" style="s2">that gel needs it so at anytime that</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.690" end="00:55:46.580" style="s2">we&#39;re saying oh we&#39;re heading towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.550" end="00:55:50.040" style="s2">this goal that is something that I am</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.580" end="00:55:52.380" style="s2">cautious about and want to bump against</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.040" end="00:55:54.540" style="s2">is that we need to say what&#39;s our next</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.380" end="00:55:56.100" style="s2">Eisley we only have like four minutes</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.540" end="00:55:59.700" style="s2">but like what is it pursued a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.100" end="00:56:02.670" style="s2">and a goal well no I was sitting the</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.700" end="00:56:05.940" style="s2">difference between a purpose and a I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.670" end="00:56:10.770" style="s2">go and a feature right we&#39;re listing</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.940" end="00:56:12.000" style="s2">actual features our purpose is to sort</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.770" end="00:56:15.750" style="s2">of help projects and help drive that</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.000" end="00:56:17.460" style="s2">forward morning I think what we actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:15.750" end="00:56:18.690" style="s2">wants just like the ten thousand a</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.460" end="00:56:22.770" style="s2">hundred thousand is what I want for</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.690" end="00:56:25.020" style="s2">solution raising is and we want at least</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.770" end="00:56:27.270" style="s2">a dozen people who have projects that</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.020" end="00:56:29.280" style="s2">are similar and not similar who can come</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.270" end="00:56:30.900" style="s2">together and say what do we want in our</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.280" end="00:56:32.400" style="s2">version of patreon or whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.900" end="00:56:34.140" style="s2">looks like right like how do we find</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.400" end="00:56:35.910" style="s2">people and have these same conversations</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.140" end="00:56:37.650" style="s2">that are generative but like that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.910" end="00:56:40.470" style="s2">actually our MVP is we need to be able</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.650" end="00:56:42.090" style="s2">to have a what does that look like and</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.470" end="00:56:43.500" style="s2">right now it looks like our ice live on</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.090" end="00:56:45.060" style="s2">video but maybe it does it any people</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.500" end="00:56:47.370" style="s2">really aren&#39;t comfortable that so doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.060" end="00:56:49.890" style="s2">the Facebook page and saying bump this</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.370" end="00:56:51.480" style="s2">up give us make this your number one</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.890" end="00:56:54.690" style="s2">notification of that it&#39;s right if that</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.480" end="00:56:56.820" style="s2">resonates with you and then also what</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.690" end="00:56:58.740" style="s2">does getting together weekly look like</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.820" end="00:57:00.360" style="s2">right like does it look like an hour on</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.740" end="00:57:02.910" style="s2">Saturday mornings what would that</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.360" end="00:57:04.320" style="s2">generate like what is it going on zoom</p>
<p begin="00:57:02.910" end="00:57:06.060" style="s2">and then breaking off into groups that</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.320" end="00:57:09.300" style="s2">are appropriate to yours like what do</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.060" end="00:57:11.790" style="s2">you want in an MVP but then also having</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.300" end="00:57:13.140" style="s2">just that discussion like just eat how</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.790" end="00:57:14.580" style="s2">do we bring people to one of those</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.140" end="00:57:16.170" style="s2">conversations so we can be a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.580" end="00:57:18.620" style="s2">people having that conversation most</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.170" end="00:57:18.620" style="s2">projects</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.730" end="00:57:23.950" style="s2">so doodle pool on times for the first</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.099" end="00:57:25.780" style="s2">conversation I don&#39;t know I agree with</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.950" end="00:57:27.880" style="s2">all that I did want to point out that</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.780" end="00:57:29.200" style="s2">that&#39;s in the last several minutes is</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.880" end="00:57:33.460" style="s2">completely different from what we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.200" end="00:57:35.859" style="s2">discussed for the last hour but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.460" end="00:57:37.690" style="s2">good the reset I mean maybe the main</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.859" end="00:57:39.730" style="s2">thing is we need more than three people</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.690" end="00:57:44.589" style="s2">before we jump down building anything</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.730" end="00:57:47.020" style="s2">but yeah I think we do and we yet we</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.589" end="00:57:48.490" style="s2">have 50 people in projects and I</p>
<p begin="00:57:47.020" end="00:57:51.880" style="s2">guarantee you there are at least a dozen</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.490" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">projects in that if not 20 or 30 and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.880" end="00:57:55.119" style="s2">finding a time for 12 of those to meet</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:57.400" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be that difficult especially</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.119" end="00:57:59.470" style="s2">right now we&#39;re on lockdown right like</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.400" end="00:58:00.970" style="s2">maybe you couldn&#39;t make Tuesday morning</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.470" end="00:58:02.890" style="s2">at 10 a.m. but right now you can put off</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.970" end="00:58:04.660" style="s2">whatever you&#39;re doing online for that</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.890" end="00:58:06.220" style="s2">time and actually meet extend your</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.660" end="00:58:09.910" style="s2">workday longer right like there&#39;s people</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.220" end="00:58:11.410" style="s2">have more ability to do those type of</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.910" end="00:58:13.750" style="s2">things right now so if we put our two</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.410" end="00:58:16.089" style="s2">doodle pull for when would you actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.750" end="00:58:19.740" style="s2">come and be part of a zoom conversation</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.089" end="00:58:22.270" style="s2">that is recorded but not live and</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.740" end="00:58:24.790" style="s2">generate what are the top what is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.270" end="00:58:26.770" style="s2">the thing that&#39;s stopping your project</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.790" end="00:58:28.780" style="s2">what would an MVP look like what would</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.770" end="00:58:30.490" style="s2">and we can maybe hash out a little more</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.780" end="00:58:31.900" style="s2">of what that looks like for us right</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.490" end="00:58:33.220" style="s2">what does that medium look like what</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.900" end="00:58:35.500" style="s2">kind of questions do we want to answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.220" end="00:58:36.970" style="s2">so that we have that purpose what is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.500" end="00:58:40.599" style="s2">purpose and then how do we actually</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.970" end="00:58:52.630" style="s2">create an MVP for or that I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.599" end="00:58:55.180" style="s2">perfect alright okay how does that</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.630" end="00:58:57.069" style="s2">resonate with you a draw I was gonna</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.180" end="00:58:58.270" style="s2">space down for the last that&#39;s alright</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.069" end="00:59:00.010" style="s2">that&#39;s that I can&#39;t even get free</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.270" end="00:59:03.190" style="s2">iterated Audrey watch it but you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.010" end="00:59:04.420" style="s2">I can real pretty conversation with more</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.190" end="00:59:06.250" style="s2">than the three of us and how do we</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.420" end="00:59:08.079" style="s2">actually do that because we keep trying</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.250" end="00:59:10.420" style="s2">it keeps not happening but I like</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.079" end="00:59:11.950" style="s2">listener what a step back what have we</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.420" end="00:59:14.200" style="s2">do the same thing with more people</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.950" end="00:59:16.599" style="s2">yeah I&#39;ll probably abandon the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.200" end="00:59:19.150" style="s2">doing like trying to reuse the same code</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.599" end="00:59:21.160" style="s2">stream that was kind of a part of it was</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.150" end="00:59:24.970" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of similarities between</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.160" end="00:59:28.329" style="s2">the two projects at least like at the</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.970" end="00:59:29.319" style="s2">base level but if it&#39;s not there yet if</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.329" end="00:59:32.010" style="s2">we don&#39;t think that we&#39;re doing that</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.319" end="00:59:33.240" style="s2">then that&#39;s fine we can you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.010" end="00:59:35.820" style="s2">cross that bridge when we come to it</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.240" end="00:59:37.320" style="s2">yeah I think what I would do is I&#39;ll put</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.820" end="00:59:40.650" style="s2">our two doodle poll with several times</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.320" end="00:59:42.630" style="s2">on it for our group you can also do I</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.650" end="00:59:45.030" style="s2">think what I said about the algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.630" end="00:59:47.070" style="s2">like changing your notification so this</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.030" end="00:59:49.110" style="s2">one&#39;s up there because we&#39;re we need to</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.070" end="00:59:53.850" style="s2">move fast on projects and we need you to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.110" end="00:59:54.900" style="s2">see them and then it&#39;ll pull for a time</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.850" end="00:59:56.250" style="s2">then we can put that out to the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.900" end="00:59:57.570" style="s2">game be community and even on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.250" end="00:59:58.950" style="s2">and stuff as well right you have a</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.570" end="01:00:02.970" style="s2">project you want to move forward that</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.950" end="01:00:05.190" style="s2">maybe not it&#39;s this criteria routes the</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.970" end="01:00:07.710" style="s2">world then really in any way come be</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.190" end="01:00:09.300" style="s2">part of having a conversation on how we</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.710" end="01:00:10.980" style="s2">generate those projects yeah and also</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.300" end="01:00:14.550" style="s2">ask them if they&#39;re if they&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.980" end="01:00:17.910" style="s2">to participate why or what what could we</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.550" end="01:00:19.680" style="s2">do to have them participate yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.910" end="01:00:21.540" style="s2">just a scheduling thing or is it because</p>
