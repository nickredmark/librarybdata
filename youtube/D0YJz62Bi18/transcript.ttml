<p begin="00:00:09.040" end="00:00:12.719" style="s2">welcome to the dark horse podcast live</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.679" end="00:00:15.360" style="s2">stream the</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.719" end="00:00:17.119" style="s2">41st if i am not mistaken is that</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.360" end="00:00:18.240" style="s2">correct you are not mistaken i am not</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.119" end="00:00:21.359" style="s2">mistaken that&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.240" end="00:00:24.880" style="s2">that&#39;s an excellent way to start</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.359" end="00:00:28.000" style="s2">um so let me say a friend of ours</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.880" end="00:00:31.519" style="s2">approached me recently and</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.000" end="00:00:34.399" style="s2">gently said words to the effect</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.519" end="00:00:35.120" style="s2">of even if we manage to save the</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.399" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">republic</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.120" end="00:00:38.960" style="s2">if it comes at the cost of your sanity</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:41.200" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t worth it and</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.960" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">i must say on the one hand i understand</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.200" end="00:00:44.960" style="s2">this meaning and i appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:46.079" style="s2">what is being said to me that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.960" end="00:00:49.120" style="s2">the current event</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.079" end="00:00:51.199" style="s2">situation and our political predicament</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.120" end="00:00:52.960" style="s2">is driving me a bit crazy on the other</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.199" end="00:00:53.840" style="s2">hand i would say my sanity would be a</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.960" end="00:00:57.039" style="s2">very small</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.840" end="00:00:58.879" style="s2">price to pay to save the republic and in</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.039" end="00:00:59.600" style="s2">any case i would like to split the</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.879" end="00:01:01.280" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.600" end="00:01:03.039" style="s2">and recognize that saving the republic</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.280" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">is very important but that</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.039" end="00:01:07.200" style="s2">it is um probably incumbent on me to</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:10.400" style="s2">figure out how</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.200" end="00:01:12.960" style="s2">not to go insane in the process</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.400" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">i think that&#39;s fair uh one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.960" end="00:01:17.040" style="s2">that we&#39;ve been doing in service of that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:20.000" style="s2">is spending some time on the water</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.040" end="00:01:21.680" style="s2">when kayaking we&#39;ve just begun to try</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.000" end="00:01:23.360" style="s2">stand-up paddle boarding and we were</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.680" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">hoping to spend today</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.360" end="00:01:27.119" style="s2">not talking about current events um</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:29.040" style="s2">talking about some</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.119" end="00:01:30.400" style="s2">some other things having to do you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.040" end="00:01:32.240" style="s2">related to</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.400" end="00:01:33.840" style="s2">what is going on in the world of course</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.240" end="00:01:36.479" style="s2">but not directly</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.840" end="00:01:38.079" style="s2">unfortunately some things emerged uh</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.479" end="00:01:41.040" style="s2">that we feel that we must</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.079" end="00:01:43.200" style="s2">begin begin with so we do hope in one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.040" end="00:01:44.640" style="s2">the upcoming episodes to devote</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.200" end="00:01:46.079" style="s2">most or all of an episode to talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.640" end="00:01:47.280" style="s2">about schools we&#39;ve been hearing from a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.079" end="00:01:49.520" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.280" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">with either children in schools or who</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.520" end="00:01:54.159" style="s2">are teachers or staff at schools</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:55.680" style="s2">and we&#39;re not gonna do any of that today</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.159" end="00:01:57.280" style="s2">but we are gonna spend some time talking</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.680" end="00:01:59.200" style="s2">about what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.280" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">on the streets what&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.200" end="00:02:04.079" style="s2">oregon and then</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:07.600" style="s2">also get a little bit to um some some</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.079" end="00:02:08.160" style="s2">ways that people might uh be dealing</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.600" end="00:02:10.959" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.160" end="00:02:11.840" style="s2">depression and other mental health uh</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.959" end="00:02:13.360" style="s2">issues that are</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.840" end="00:02:14.720" style="s2">probably coming up for just about</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.360" end="00:02:15.599" style="s2">everyone at this point and we&#39;re going</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.720" end="00:02:18.480" style="s2">to finish with</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.599" end="00:02:18.879" style="s2">a follow-on to a question that we got</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.480" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">asked</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.879" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">in last episode about about movies that</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.400" style="s2">we enjoy just to give</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:28.080" style="s2">people maybe some some things to go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.400" end="00:02:30.080" style="s2">that have nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.080" end="00:02:31.440" style="s2">uh the current moment that will allow</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.080" end="00:02:35.200" style="s2">for some</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.440" end="00:02:37.760" style="s2">smart um but other entertainment</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.200" end="00:02:38.720" style="s2">well i think this is a great plan for</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.760" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">this episode</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.720" end="00:02:43.040" style="s2">for future episodes in order to um</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.400" style="s2">depart further from current events</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.040" end="00:02:46.640" style="s2">actually i think this is really more of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.400" end="00:02:48.000" style="s2">a partnership with our audience that if</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.640" end="00:02:50.080" style="s2">they could do something</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.000" end="00:02:51.519" style="s2">to halt the progress of current events</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.080" end="00:02:54.640" style="s2">then we would be able to</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.519" end="00:02:55.120" style="s2">focus on other matters and phase failing</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.640" end="00:02:57.920" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.120" end="00:02:59.040" style="s2">um i think if they just didn&#39;t tweet</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.920" end="00:03:00.319" style="s2">about it and they could get everybody</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:01.440" style="s2">else not to if we don&#39;t know that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.319" end="00:03:03.760" style="s2">current events are happening</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.440" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">we won&#39;t be talking about them so uh</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.760" end="00:03:07.040" style="s2">yeah i actually don&#39;t get my news</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">primarily from the tweets but uh it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.040" end="00:03:09.200" style="s2">gonna have it&#39;s gonna take more than</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:11.440" style="s2">just not tweeting</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.200" end="00:03:12.480" style="s2">yeah yeah it is that was a joke not a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.440" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">great one but</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.480" end="00:03:15.519" style="s2">um nonetheless in any case yes we will</p>

<p begin="00:03:15.519" end="00:03:19.840" style="s2">attempting to intersperse as much other</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.599" end="00:03:22.560" style="s2">kinds of content as we can</p>

<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">uh on how to rethink and modify this</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.560" end="00:08:46.560" style="s2">thing and just simply going through that</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:49.680" style="s2">exercises</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.560" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">is uh valuable from the point of view of</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.680" end="00:08:52.560" style="s2">understanding what the deep meaning is</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.720" style="s2">here because really in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.560" end="00:08:55.920" style="s2">you know is it a poem is it a lesson in</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.720" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">game theory</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.920" end="00:09:00.800" style="s2">um is it uh a description of a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">historical process you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.800" end="00:09:04.640" style="s2">all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:06.080" style="s2">um as you know those other things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.640" end="00:09:06.560" style="s2">you mentioned a description of game</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.080" end="00:09:09.200" style="s2">theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.560" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">historical um historical process</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.200" end="00:09:12.880" style="s2">description of historical process</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:15.040" style="s2">many certainly those things aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.880" end="00:09:17.200" style="s2">required in great poetry but many of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.040" end="00:09:18.880" style="s2">great poems do exactly that this is what</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.200" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">this is what the power of poetry is this</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.880" end="00:09:24.000" style="s2">is what the power of music is</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:27.440" style="s2">at least music with lyrics that</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.000" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">that they do they sneak in without</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.440" end="00:09:32.800" style="s2">pretending not to</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:35.040" style="s2">important and universal truths without</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.800" end="00:09:36.160" style="s2">inherently being pointing to anyone in</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.040" end="00:09:38.959" style="s2">particular and so they can</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.160" end="00:09:40.800" style="s2">they can allow lessons to come into</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.959" end="00:09:43.600" style="s2">people&#39;s brains to percolate there</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.800" end="00:09:45.279" style="s2">without those people ever having to face</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.600" end="00:09:46.000" style="s2">perhaps their own hypocrisy their own</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.279" end="00:09:47.760" style="s2">cowardice</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.000" end="00:09:49.200" style="s2">their own failure to act in the past</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.760" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">such that they might change the behavior</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.200" end="00:09:53.360" style="s2">going forward</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:55.200" style="s2">so i think they do one other thing which</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.360" end="00:09:56.240" style="s2">i think is familiar to you and me from a</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.200" end="00:09:58.480" style="s2">teaching environment</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.240" end="00:09:59.360" style="s2">they being good poems good poems and i</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.480" end="00:10:01.200" style="s2">must say i</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.360" end="00:10:03.760" style="s2">you know you mentioned music&#39;s music</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.200" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">with lyrics and i really think</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.760" end="00:10:10.160" style="s2">poetry is music</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:12.800" style="s2">devoi devoid of melody that really the</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.160" end="00:10:14.800" style="s2">idea is that the form is identical to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.800" end="00:10:17.200" style="s2">really powerful song</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.800" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">and the idea is that some some lyrics</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.200" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">are so powerful that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">actually need melody to float them and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:24.560" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:26.399" style="s2">great music great lyrical music has both</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.560" end="00:10:27.920" style="s2">characteristics it doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.399" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">you could read the lyrics and they would</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.920" end="00:10:32.000" style="s2">be meaningful um</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:32.560" style="s2">but they&#39;re augmented by the melody but</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.000" end="00:10:34.399" style="s2">anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.560" end="00:10:35.760" style="s2">at another time we should have we should</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.399" end="00:10:36.959" style="s2">have more of this conversation it would</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.760" end="00:10:38.000" style="s2">be terrific if we had it with your</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.959" end="00:10:40.880" style="s2">brother as well</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.000" end="00:10:41.839" style="s2">because you and i have almost almost</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.880" end="00:10:44.160" style="s2">inverse</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.839" end="00:10:45.120" style="s2">responses to what the deepest part of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.160" end="00:10:47.680" style="s2">music are</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.120" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">i think because of in my case because of</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.680" end="00:10:50.160" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:52.560" style="s2">my sort of origin story with music where</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.160" end="00:10:54.399" style="s2">i i played so much classical music</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.560" end="00:10:55.839" style="s2">from a young age that it was what i was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.399" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">immersed in and i never</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.839" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">i didn&#39;t even hear music with lyrics</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">until i was an early teenager such that</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.560" style="s2">um the lyrical part of music seems like</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:06.880" style="s2">a totally separate thing to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.560" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">yeah it is a conversation worth having</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.880" end="00:11:10.800" style="s2">and you know i</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:12.640" style="s2">i do find what happened to you uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.800" end="00:11:14.560" style="s2">both beautiful and tragic because you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.640" end="00:11:16.800" style="s2">did pick up some a really powerful thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.560" end="00:11:19.519" style="s2">that i wish i had which is the ability</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.800" end="00:11:20.160" style="s2">um to to play an instrument but it cost</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.519" end="00:11:23.519" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.160" end="00:11:26.560" style="s2">in in terms of access to all</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.519" end="00:11:27.600" style="s2">that is so amazing in in lyrical music</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.560" end="00:11:30.640" style="s2">and of course you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.600" end="00:11:31.440" style="s2">you&#39;re arriving there late but um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.640" end="00:11:34.480" style="s2">what i wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.440" end="00:11:37.839" style="s2">say here about the um</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.480" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">the poetry is that the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.839" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">the thing about poetry is a if you write</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:42.880" style="s2">poetry you</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:44.320" style="s2">find that you discover things about the</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.880" end="00:11:45.600" style="s2">subject matter that you&#39;re writing about</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.320" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.600" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">because you are forced to think in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:51.200" style="s2">neighborhood it basically forces you to</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:53.519" style="s2">search what</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.200" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">we evolutionists might call the adjacent</p>

<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.639" style="s2">because linguistically if the right word</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.440" end="00:12:00.560" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have the right number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.639" end="00:12:01.839" style="s2">syllables in it or it doesn&#39;t rhyme</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.560" end="00:12:03.200" style="s2">then you&#39;re forced to think about</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.839" end="00:12:03.760" style="s2">synonyms and then you&#39;re forced to go</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.200" end="00:12:04.880" style="s2">one step</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.760" end="00:12:06.720" style="s2">out and then you&#39;re forced you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.880" end="00:12:08.000" style="s2">actually twitter has this aspect to it</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.720" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">also it forces you</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.000" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">to think uh carefully enough to phrase</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">something well</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">you know in 280 characters or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">it is constraint is almost</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:19.360" style="s2">always a useful way to find your</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">creative or analytical outlet</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.360" end="00:12:23.200" style="s2">which is why i said in the greg ellis</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">podcast that i wasn&#39;t a fan</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.200" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">of free verse but of course it really</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:27.920" style="s2">depends on the free verse you can buy</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:29.760" style="s2">your constraint</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.920" end="00:12:31.519" style="s2">somewhere other than meter and rhyme and</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.760" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">then it works just as well but a totally</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.519" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">free verse that expects nothing of the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:36.160" style="s2">author</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:39.440" style="s2">is also not very informative but in any</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.160" end="00:12:41.839" style="s2">case the thing about the um</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.440" end="00:12:42.800" style="s2">the poem as you called it that you read</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.839" end="00:12:44.880" style="s2">it first</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.800" end="00:12:46.720" style="s2">you know first they came for the</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.880" end="00:12:48.959" style="s2">socialists</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.720" end="00:12:49.839" style="s2">um the important thing is that it does</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.959" end="00:12:52.800" style="s2">not state</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.839" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">its meaning you infer its meaning by</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.800" end="00:12:55.200" style="s2">being led through a series of things</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:56.560" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.200" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">you don&#39;t even know what the thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.560" end="00:13:00.320" style="s2">about until the end the thing is about</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:02.079" style="s2">at this point we do and so i mean this</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.320" end="00:13:05.200" style="s2">is part of the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.079" end="00:13:06.800" style="s2">the value of new versions</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.200" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">of this sort of thing all the time so</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.800" end="00:13:10.639" style="s2">that people can continue to be surprised</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:12.720" style="s2">to find that they&#39;ve been led somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.639" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">right and so you know in this case</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.720" end="00:13:16.240" style="s2">at the end it&#39;s very frightening because</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.320" style="s2">to the extent that</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.240" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">they came from me you know what they</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.320" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">come from me is</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:24.639" style="s2">right that&#39;s death and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.399" style="s2">there is no one to stand between you and</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.639" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">it is frightening and the fact that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.399" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">don&#39;t understand that you lost your</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:30.959" style="s2">opportunity</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:32.800" style="s2">to be defended at the point that you</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.959" end="00:13:34.639" style="s2">failed to defend it&#39;s such an obvious</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.800" end="00:13:36.399" style="s2">point at one level and then</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.639" end="00:13:38.160" style="s2">we see the game theory fail again and</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.399" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">again and again for you know exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.160" end="00:13:42.639" style="s2">reasons that barry</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.120" end="00:13:43.760" style="s2">is asking us if we have insight into</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.639" end="00:13:45.920" style="s2">but i wanted to go back to something</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.760" end="00:13:48.800" style="s2">about the video yes you said</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.920" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">that they were asked to raise a fist in</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.800" end="00:13:53.040" style="s2">solidarity</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:54.480" style="s2">i am i am inferring that from comments</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.040" end="00:13:55.680" style="s2">and such i don&#39;t think i don&#39;t think i</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.480" end="00:13:57.680" style="s2">heard that in the videos</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.680" end="00:13:59.519" style="s2">i think it is exactly the inference you</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.680" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">are supposed to take and the thing is it</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.519" end="00:14:04.399" style="s2">is simultaneously true</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.360" end="00:14:05.519" style="s2">and a lie right solidarity with what it</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.399" end="00:14:07.360" style="s2">is true that that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.519" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">presumably what they were asked to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.360" end="00:14:12.000" style="s2">but is that actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:13.680" style="s2">are those words actually reflective of</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.000" end="00:14:15.199" style="s2">what the gesture would mean</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.680" end="00:14:18.160" style="s2">is is that is that the way in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.199" end="00:14:20.639" style="s2">a lie it&#39;s a lie in exactly the same way</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.160" end="00:14:21.279" style="s2">that asking people to kneel right we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.639" end="00:14:23.120" style="s2">seen many</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.279" end="00:14:25.360" style="s2">in the early parts of the protests and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.120" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">riots we saw officials being asked</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.360" end="00:14:30.959" style="s2">to kneel with the protesters kneeling is</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:32.880" style="s2">you know did you kneel you know is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.959" end="00:14:33.279" style="s2">kneeling as in the game of thrones you</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.880" end="00:14:34.959" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.279" end="00:14:36.720" style="s2">showing failty to something is this</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.959" end="00:14:38.560" style="s2">kneeling in solidarity it&#39;s totally</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.720" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">ambiguous and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.560" end="00:14:45.279" style="s2">it is a physical mountain bailey where</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:47.760" style="s2">the gesture has both characteristics</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.279" end="00:14:49.680" style="s2">now if i raise a hand a physical</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.760" end="00:14:51.279" style="s2">motivation it&#39;s a physical mountain bail</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.680" end="00:14:53.440" style="s2">if i raise a fist</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.279" end="00:14:54.959" style="s2">right like this in solidarity with black</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.440" end="00:14:58.720" style="s2">lives matter</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.959" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">have i announced that i believe</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.720" end="00:15:02.480" style="s2">that black lives are undervalued and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:05.040" style="s2">that we have to do something about it or</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.480" end="00:15:06.560" style="s2">have i just embraced black power which</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.040" end="00:15:07.600" style="s2">is of course traditionally what that</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.560" end="00:15:10.639" style="s2">fist is</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.600" end="00:15:11.040" style="s2">now i&#39;m not even against the idea that a</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.639" end="00:15:13.199" style="s2">fist</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.040" end="00:15:14.480" style="s2">raised for black power is inherently an</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.199" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">offensive thing</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.480" end="00:15:21.199" style="s2">i get it but the idea that you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:24.160" style="s2">accost people and force them</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.199" end="00:15:25.680" style="s2">to make a gesture that very plausibly</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.160" end="00:15:28.480" style="s2">means that they are in favor</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.680" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">of a black power movement right with no</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.480" end="00:15:31.839" style="s2">discussion</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:34.240" style="s2">that this is and i guess i would say we</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.839" end="00:15:36.959" style="s2">could we can it&#39;s even easier than that</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.240" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t care what it is that a mob shows</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.959" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">up at a restaurant asking me to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.920" style="s2">i don&#39;t you know if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a if if</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">it&#39;s demanding that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.920" end="00:15:48.240" style="s2">i show support for a movement that i</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.360" end="00:15:51.440" style="s2">myself found it right</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.240" end="00:15:55.360" style="s2">why is it that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.440" end="00:15:58.560" style="s2">should feel responsible to or forced to</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.360" end="00:16:00.480" style="s2">do that thing no matter how firmly they</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.560" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">are convinced that they are actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.480" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">in favor of that thing and so i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:04.800" style="s2">these really are two separate questions</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:06.240" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.800" end="00:16:08.560" style="s2">this thing that they&#39;re asking you to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.240" end="00:16:09.920" style="s2">is not what it seems and it&#39;s obscuring</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.560" end="00:16:11.600" style="s2">a whole lot of other things and actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.920" end="00:16:13.519" style="s2">you can tell that by the fact of how</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.600" end="00:16:16.800" style="s2">they&#39;re behaving right here right now</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.519" end="00:16:18.160" style="s2">yeah um but also even if you&#39;re sure</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.800" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">that the thing that you were being asked</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.160" end="00:16:21.360" style="s2">to show support for is something that</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:23.920" style="s2">you support</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:25.920" style="s2">you should always be free to show or not</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.920" end="00:16:28.000" style="s2">show support for that thing on your own</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.920" end="00:16:29.040" style="s2">terms under your own conditions on your</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.000" end="00:16:32.079" style="s2">own time</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.040" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">and and so we have these few</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.079" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">restaurant goers resisting even while</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:39.199" style="s2">everyone around them is sort of looking</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:42.639" style="s2">a little bit shamed and doing this thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.199" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">and how will</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.639" end="00:16:47.839" style="s2">how will the people who resisted versus</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:48.880" style="s2">the guy sitting next to them who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.839" end="00:16:50.959" style="s2">resist</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.880" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">feel how did they feel that night how</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.959" end="00:16:53.040" style="s2">did they feel afterwards the people who</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:55.199" style="s2">resisted</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.040" end="00:16:57.120" style="s2">were probably shaken yeah still scared</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.199" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">worried could they be doxxed could they</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.120" end="00:17:01.040" style="s2">be found</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:01.839" style="s2">but they knew that they had resisted the</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.040" end="00:17:03.600" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.839" end="00:17:05.520" style="s2">that demanded of them something that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.600" end="00:17:09.600" style="s2">not okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.520" end="00:17:12.240" style="s2">and the guy who avoided the mob for now</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.600" end="00:17:13.199" style="s2">how what does he do does he sleep does</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.240" end="00:17:17.839" style="s2">he sleep well</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.199" end="00:17:21.039" style="s2">i don&#39;t think so there&#39;s he and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.839" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">off camera and this is we we have to</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.039" end="00:17:26.400" style="s2">we have to go yes yes so um</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:28.079" style="s2">i agree with your formulation and i</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.400" end="00:17:31.280" style="s2">think it&#39;s exactly right if</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.079" end="00:17:34.720" style="s2">if a group of well-intentioned people</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.280" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">confronted us at a cafe surrounded by</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.720" end="00:17:37.200" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">maybe they came to us and they said you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.200" end="00:17:42.559" style="s2">know so do you support unity 2020</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:43.360" style="s2">we&#39;d say of course and then they start</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.559" end="00:17:45.919" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.360" end="00:17:47.760" style="s2">you know forcing other people to embrace</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:50.000" style="s2">it in the cafe suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.760" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">i&#39;m not even on board with the support</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.000" end="00:17:52.480" style="s2">part the point is i don&#39;t support it if</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:55.600" style="s2">it&#39;s forced</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.480" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">in any way and</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.600" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s get to the i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:02.640" style="s2">it&#39;s really in part the issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:05.840" style="s2">that barry is asking us to comment on</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:06.960" style="s2">which is what happened the people on</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.840" end="00:18:08.640" style="s2">camera those who</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.960" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">put up their fists and those who</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.640" end="00:18:14.799" style="s2">resisted that&#39;s one category and we</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:16.480" style="s2">because of our evolutionary processing</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.799" end="00:18:18.240" style="s2">focus on that because they are the</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.480" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">people in the narrative but this</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.240" end="00:18:22.000" style="s2">narrative</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:24.480" style="s2">is really not even about them right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.000" end="00:18:27.200" style="s2">person who sees that video which is</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.480" end="00:18:28.080" style="s2">who knows hundreds of thousands of times</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.200" end="00:18:30.400" style="s2">as many people</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.080" end="00:18:32.799" style="s2">as were actually present maybe millions</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.400" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">depending upon how far those videos go</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.799" end="00:18:39.919" style="s2">that&#39;s the target and i will point out</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">this is the exact analog</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.919" end="00:18:46.960" style="s2">of the evergreen situation right the</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:49.760" style="s2">protesters flooded in cameras out</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.960" end="00:18:51.120" style="s2">right the idea is whatever you do is</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.760" end="00:18:55.360" style="s2">about to be broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.120" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">who do you want to be right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.360" end="00:18:59.440" style="s2">let&#39;s compare these two on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:01.039" style="s2">you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.440" end="00:19:02.640" style="s2">the people who raised their fist did</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.039" end="00:19:04.080" style="s2">what they were told irrespective of what</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.640" end="00:19:06.799" style="s2">they actually felt</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.080" end="00:19:08.240" style="s2">right they paid one price maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.799" end="00:19:09.840" style="s2">weren&#39;t comfortable being told to raise</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.240" end="00:19:11.600" style="s2">their fist and they felt weak for doing</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.840" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">so on the other hand there&#39;s no focus on</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.600" end="00:19:14.640" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:16.080" style="s2">right they are unlikely to show up</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.640" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.080" end="00:19:20.880" style="s2">um on the other hand they may walk away</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:22.240" style="s2">sorry i know you&#39;re going somewhere but</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.880" end="00:19:24.080" style="s2">they may walk away</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.240" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">actually and some of them may walk away</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.080" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">feeling better about the movement</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:28.880" style="s2">because they have now shown support and</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:30.880" style="s2">it will be harder for them to walk away</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.880" end="00:19:32.240" style="s2">and some of them and unfortunately i</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.880" end="00:19:33.840" style="s2">think it will be a minority</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.240" end="00:19:35.360" style="s2">will walk away feeling worse about the</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.840" end="00:19:37.679" style="s2">movement now questioning it in a way</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.360" end="00:19:40.400" style="s2">that they perhaps had not done before</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.679" end="00:19:40.880" style="s2">and wonder if it can do that to people</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.400" end="00:19:43.120" style="s2">who</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.880" end="00:19:44.000" style="s2">had nothing to with whom they had no</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.120" end="00:19:47.360" style="s2">beef</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:49.440" style="s2">um what else might it do and they might</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.360" end="00:19:51.039" style="s2">uh they might actually begin to question</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.440" end="00:19:52.000" style="s2">the movement i suspect though that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.039" end="00:19:54.799" style="s2">be a minority of</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.000" end="00:19:56.080" style="s2">those who without thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.799" end="00:19:56.720" style="s2">without ever imagining that they would</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.080" end="00:19:58.799" style="s2">resist</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.720" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">didn&#39;t resist and did raise a fist and</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.799" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">support well i will say again</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:04.000" style="s2">evergreen teaches us everything we need</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:06.240" style="s2">to know there was a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.000" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">faculty colleague of ours somebody who</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.240" end="00:20:10.640" style="s2">at one point would have called</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">a friend who was cornered during</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:14.880" style="s2">the protests at evergreen and was</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:18.400" style="s2">frightened by it and wrote about it</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.880" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">and then flipped sides because she was</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.400" end="00:20:21.280" style="s2">offered</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:22.320" style="s2">power in exchange for embracing the</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.280" end="00:20:24.480" style="s2">thing which is of course</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.320" end="00:20:26.320" style="s2">the underlying dynamic here but oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.480" end="00:20:29.440" style="s2">all right if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.320" end="00:20:32.840" style="s2">if we go back to this these cafes</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.440" end="00:20:34.720" style="s2">right if you don&#39;t raise a fist in that</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.840" end="00:20:37.840" style="s2">circumstance then you are</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.720" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">very likely you have reason to expect</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.840" end="00:20:42.000" style="s2">that video of you not raising a fist is</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:45.200" style="s2">going to be broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.000" end="00:20:49.760" style="s2">so whether or not you are doxxed</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.200" end="00:20:52.240" style="s2">is in some sense not it because the</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.760" end="00:20:54.320" style="s2">the price to be paid for raising a fist</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.240" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">is probably a price between you and who</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.320" end="00:20:57.120" style="s2">you were sitting with because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:20:58.799" style="s2">you know that&#39;s the person you have to</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.120" end="00:21:00.799" style="s2">look in the eye after the thing</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.799" end="00:21:02.640" style="s2">the person who didn&#39;t raise a fist</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.799" end="00:21:04.000" style="s2">whatever their reason for not doing so</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.640" end="00:21:05.520" style="s2">may have been and it may have been as</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.000" end="00:21:06.960" style="s2">good as the one you spell out</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.520" end="00:21:08.799" style="s2">maybe the point is hey you&#39;re not going</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.960" end="00:21:10.640" style="s2">to tell me when i raise a fist and when</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.799" end="00:21:12.320" style="s2">i don&#39;t i will decide that this is in no</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.640" end="00:21:14.640" style="s2">way a statement about your movement</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.320" end="00:21:16.320" style="s2">right this is a statement about you not</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.640" end="00:21:18.000" style="s2">being able to tell me what i do</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.320" end="00:21:19.840" style="s2">right it&#39;s a statement about us being</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.000" end="00:21:23.200" style="s2">equals right it&#39;s a statement</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.840" end="00:21:24.640" style="s2">about uh maybe i&#39;m an ally but i&#39;m an</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.200" end="00:21:26.559" style="s2">ally by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.640" end="00:21:28.400" style="s2">the real meaning of that term which is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.559" end="00:21:29.280" style="s2">pure relationship not a subordinate</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.400" end="00:21:31.440" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.280" end="00:21:33.120" style="s2">and so in this case solidarity which</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.440" end="00:21:36.240" style="s2">sounds like a pure relationship</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.120" end="00:21:36.880" style="s2">is actually subordination but in any</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.240" end="00:21:38.720" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.880" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">think about the asymmetry of the game</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.720" end="00:21:41.600" style="s2">theory you&#39;re one of the anonymous</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:43.600" style="s2">people who raised their hands</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.600" end="00:21:45.200" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t get very far maybe nobody</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.600" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">even spots that you were present</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.200" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">okay right you&#39;re the person who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.520" end="00:21:51.600" style="s2">raise your hand</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.799" style="s2">suddenly you&#39;re raised you&#39;re suddenly</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.600" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">famous for this</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.799" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">right in some sense right you are</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:21:59.039" style="s2">not now on the minds of all of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.280" style="s2">people who think it&#39;s cool to go to</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.039" end="00:22:03.360" style="s2">cafes and force people to raise a fist</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.280" end="00:22:04.720" style="s2">right you&#39;re you&#39;re on their feet as one</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.360" end="00:22:06.640" style="s2">of the resistors</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.720" end="00:22:08.799" style="s2">and you&#39;re also broadcast everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.640" end="00:22:10.080" style="s2">else and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.799" end="00:22:12.240" style="s2">this is the answer to your question</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.080" end="00:22:13.039" style="s2">barry is that the game theory plays out</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.240" end="00:22:17.200" style="s2">in the mind</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.039" end="00:22:19.919" style="s2">in that moment with the what do i do</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.200" end="00:22:21.520" style="s2">to reduce the cost of this thing maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.919" end="00:22:23.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want to empower</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.520" end="00:22:24.640" style="s2">this movement i don&#39;t want to become its</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.280" end="00:22:26.960" style="s2">iconic resistor</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.640" end="00:22:28.080" style="s2">i don&#39;t want this to dominate my life</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.960" end="00:22:30.720" style="s2">going forward</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.080" end="00:22:32.559" style="s2">the point is the bargain is you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.720" end="00:22:33.840" style="s2">whatever minimizes the chance that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.559" end="00:22:35.039" style="s2">camera lands on you</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.840" end="00:22:36.799" style="s2">but you&#39;re answering the inverse</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.039" end="00:22:38.240" style="s2">question that she asked well she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.799" end="00:22:40.080" style="s2">asking what makes particular people</p>

<p begin="00:22:40.080" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">are you are explaining</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.600" end="00:22:45.440" style="s2">and this also warrants explanation it</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:47.039" style="s2">warrants both the question being asked</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.440" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">and it being answered</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:52.159" style="s2">people and i&#39;ve seen numbers in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:55.360" style="s2">range of like 98 99</p>

<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">really what we need is to provide people</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.520" end="00:23:06.559" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:07.919" style="s2">sort of a litany of you might have these</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.559" end="00:23:09.679" style="s2">characteristics in which case you might</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.919" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">be more likely to resist</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.679" end="00:23:12.960" style="s2">such demands should a mob come for you</p>

<p begin="00:23:12.960" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">what is it that you can be thinking of</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.799" end="00:23:19.200" style="s2">in the moment that will allow you to</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">have the courage in the moment to resist</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.200" end="00:23:22.880" style="s2">all right but this is where this gets so</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:24.960" style="s2">complicated i agree with you that the</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.880" end="00:23:26.720" style="s2">question i answered is the inverse of</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.960" end="00:23:28.880" style="s2">the question she asked but it also</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.720" end="00:23:30.480" style="s2">i think contains the indicator of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.880" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">question of the answer to the question</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.480" end="00:23:34.400" style="s2">she did</p>

<p begin="00:23:39.760" end="00:23:43.760" style="s2">the thing that people need to understand</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.320" end="00:23:44.960" style="s2">and i keep saying it and i think people</p>

<p begin="00:23:48.000" end="00:23:53.279" style="s2">why did i do what i did confronted with</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.039" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">students armed with cameras portraying</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.279" end="00:23:57.120" style="s2">me as a racist</p>

<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.240" style="s2">publicly so that they would go away and</p>

<p begin="00:24:02.240" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">there was never a choice it never</p>

<p begin="00:24:09.039" end="00:24:13.120" style="s2">that was an option on the table still</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.440" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">doesn&#39;t i still</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.120" end="00:24:16.799" style="s2">i know formally it&#39;s an option on the</p>

<p begin="00:24:16.799" end="00:24:20.159" style="s2">register it as one because something</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.960" end="00:24:28.559" style="s2">right it&#39;s like a keyboard without an</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.559" end="00:24:31.600" style="s2">right there may be some keystroke you</p>

<p begin="00:24:32.080" end="00:24:36.159" style="s2">but help everyone else out here like how</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:39.360" style="s2">how do other people without that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.159" end="00:24:40.000" style="s2">very particular and you know perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.360" end="00:24:42.880" style="s2">unique</p>

<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:53.200" style="s2">do the rest of us not only dismiss that</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:53.520" style="s2">as an option in the moment but really</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.200" end="00:24:56.240" style="s2">just</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.520" end="00:24:57.279" style="s2">relegate it to the netherworld so i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.240" end="00:25:01.039" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.279" end="00:25:03.919" style="s2">ruling it out what i&#39;m saying is</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.039" end="00:25:04.559" style="s2">the thing that you&#39;re looking for is the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.919" end="00:25:06.320" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.559" end="00:25:08.720" style="s2">whatever it was that developmentally</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.320" end="00:25:11.200" style="s2">produced and it&#39;s not it&#39;s not just me</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.720" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">it&#39;s lots of people but it&#39;s rare i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.200" end="00:25:14.720" style="s2">never heard anyone else describe</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:16.159" style="s2">exactly what you&#39;re saying because you</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.720" end="00:25:16.880" style="s2">know there are there are there are many</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.159" end="00:25:18.480" style="s2">of us who</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.880" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">will stand up to these things but the</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.480" end="00:25:23.279" style="s2">way that you describe this</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:25.760" style="s2">is so absolute and that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.279" end="00:25:26.320" style="s2">absolute like actually you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.760" end="00:25:27.919" style="s2">worry</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.320" end="00:25:31.120" style="s2">in the moment about what choice you will</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.919" end="00:25:33.760" style="s2">make because actually there is no choice</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.120" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">uh is a kind of framing that might be</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">useful for some people who might</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:40.159" style="s2">otherwise find themselves unsure</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:41.039" style="s2">how it is that they should need to act</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.159" end="00:25:44.559" style="s2">in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.039" end="00:25:48.080" style="s2">so there is development</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.559" end="00:25:49.360" style="s2">and then there are hacks that substitute</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.080" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">for development and</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.360" end="00:25:52.559" style="s2">i think the question that people are</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:53.679" style="s2">really asking and i do get asked this a</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.559" end="00:25:55.200" style="s2">fair amount</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.679" end="00:25:57.600" style="s2">i think the thing that people they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.200" end="00:25:58.159" style="s2">know when i was teaching i always used</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.600" end="00:26:00.000" style="s2">to say</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.159" end="00:26:01.120" style="s2">to students please answer the question i</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.000" end="00:26:02.240" style="s2">should have asked you rather than the</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.120" end="00:26:03.679" style="s2">one i did ask you</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.240" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">because very often students will answer</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.679" end="00:26:06.559" style="s2">the question you did ask when the right</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:08.480" style="s2">question is right next door and you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.559" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">discover it a week later and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.480" end="00:26:12.400" style="s2">i&#39;m going to answer the question that</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">people should ask which is how do i</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.400" end="00:26:18.480" style="s2">bootstrap the developmental</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.159" style="s2">structure to get there because i know my</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.480" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">logical mind knows that that&#39;s who i</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.159" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">want to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:24.240" style="s2">how do i override the amygdala in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:27.520" style="s2">moment</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.240" end="00:26:29.600" style="s2">and do the right thing right and i would</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.520" end="00:26:32.640" style="s2">argue that this is actually</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.600" end="00:26:34.240" style="s2">a this is something i i don&#39;t know how</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.640" end="00:26:35.200" style="s2">they do it in the military but the</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.240" end="00:26:38.480" style="s2">military</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.200" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">manages to take people and reschedule</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.480" end="00:26:41.760" style="s2">their system of incentives so that they</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.960" style="s2">are capable</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.760" end="00:26:46.799" style="s2">of effectively being ordered to engage</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.960" end="00:26:48.159" style="s2">in heroism or something like this</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.799" end="00:26:50.080" style="s2">and i&#39;m not arguing that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.159" end="00:26:51.600" style="s2">right structure here but my point is</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.080" end="00:26:53.279" style="s2">unfortunately there&#39;s also a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.600" end="00:26:55.440" style="s2">degree of depersonalization</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.279" end="00:26:57.039" style="s2">and yeah and such that is not what we</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.440" end="00:26:58.000" style="s2">would be i would want to be seen as</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.039" end="00:26:59.279" style="s2">advocates that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.000" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">it&#39;s why it&#39;s not the right answer in</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.279" end="00:27:02.640" style="s2">this case but what it is is a proof of</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">concept</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.640" end="00:27:06.080" style="s2">that there is an answer to this question</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.480" end="00:27:07.520" style="s2">that can be systematized now i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.080" end="00:27:08.480" style="s2">arguing for a systemic answer and in</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.520" end="00:27:10.240" style="s2">fact the poem</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.480" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">that you read about first they came from</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.240" end="00:27:14.480" style="s2">the socialists</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:15.600" style="s2">yeah first they came for the socialists</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.480" end="00:27:19.279" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.600" end="00:27:21.200" style="s2">uh a it is a</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.279" end="00:27:23.440" style="s2">hack to the extent that you have that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.200" end="00:27:25.120" style="s2">thing resident in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.440" end="00:27:27.520" style="s2">some part of you actually knows that</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.120" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">thing so the question is does that</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.520" end="00:27:32.080" style="s2">thing arise in your mind at the point</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:33.520" style="s2">that they you know come for you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.080" end="00:27:35.440" style="s2">so i mean that is that is one of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.520" end="00:27:38.000" style="s2">things that poetry is for right</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.440" end="00:27:39.760" style="s2">that because because it&#39;s in verse it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:41.440" style="s2">easier to call up it&#39;s easier to have</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.760" end="00:27:44.000" style="s2">remembered in the first place and it</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.440" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">is more likely to come up into your mind</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.000" end="00:27:48.159" style="s2">at the point that a mob shows up</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:49.039" style="s2">right and the other thing is an analog</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.159" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">i&#39;ve argued</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.039" end="00:27:53.120" style="s2">in a couple places i think it did an</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">early video on um</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.120" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">wisdom and i argued something that then</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:58.080" style="s2">after i released my video i</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:27:59.679" style="s2">it turns out a lot of people have made</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.080" end="00:28:01.520" style="s2">an argument similar to this in various</p>

<p begin="00:28:01.520" end="00:28:05.919" style="s2">that wisdom is either very tightly</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.720" end="00:28:09.440" style="s2">related with</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.919" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">or synonymous with delayed gratification</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.440" end="00:28:15.919" style="s2">that the idea is we are all as children</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:16.320" style="s2">uh unable to regulate our desire to have</p>

<p begin="00:28:18.320" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">that in order to have the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.919" end="00:28:23.440" style="s2">really want</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">you have to be able to forego some</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.440" end="00:28:26.159" style="s2">superficial substitute for it in the</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:27.840" style="s2">short term</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.159" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">am i i think i think the marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.840" end="00:28:32.880" style="s2">test somehow got uh</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:33.760" style="s2">got revealed as not being what it was</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.880" end="00:28:37.279" style="s2">claiming to be</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.760" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">but um but it still looms large for me</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.279" end="00:28:41.039" style="s2">as an example of this god it&#39;s so noisy</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:44.080" style="s2">out there today um</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.039" end="00:28:46.000" style="s2">so yes whether or not the marshmallow</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.080" end="00:28:47.120" style="s2">test is or is not valid like the</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.000" end="00:28:50.000" style="s2">stanford prison</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.120" end="00:28:50.799" style="s2">experiment may or may not be valid it</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.000" end="00:28:51.840" style="s2">resonates</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.799" end="00:28:53.600" style="s2">because we all know that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.840" end="00:28:55.360" style="s2">something to this and we all watch</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.600" end="00:28:56.960" style="s2">children unable to regulate their desire</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.360" end="00:28:58.080" style="s2">for that thing and foregoing something</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.960" end="00:29:00.880" style="s2">much better and so</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.080" end="00:29:02.799" style="s2">the adults we respect are almost always</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.880" end="00:29:06.559" style="s2">people who have figured out</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.799" end="00:29:08.320" style="s2">how to put off some</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.559" end="00:29:10.240" style="s2">instant gratification for a delayed</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.320" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">gratification and the farther you can</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.240" end="00:29:14.240" style="s2">delay that gratification</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:15.679" style="s2">the more powerful this process is and</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.240" end="00:29:19.200" style="s2">frankly the thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.679" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">really hard to grasp is that our</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.200" end="00:29:26.399" style="s2">society has caused us</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">to become very deeply focused on</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.399" end="00:29:29.760" style="s2">self as individual and this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:32.960" style="s2">understandable</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.760" end="00:29:35.600" style="s2">but as important as self is</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.960" end="00:29:36.960" style="s2">self is also part of something right how</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.600" end="00:29:39.279" style="s2">important is yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.960" end="00:29:40.240" style="s2">if the things that you do to keep</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.279" end="00:29:42.480" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.240" end="00:29:44.080" style="s2">you know we&#39;re watching uh people of</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.480" end="00:29:45.840" style="s2">means fleeing</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.080" end="00:29:47.360" style="s2">major cities even as they are</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.840" end="00:29:48.480" style="s2">politically paralyzed from doing</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.360" end="00:29:50.320" style="s2">anything interesting</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.640" style="s2">right they&#39;re saving themselves and they</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.320" end="00:29:54.880" style="s2">are not taking any risk on behalf</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.640" end="00:29:56.080" style="s2">of the larger entity on which we all</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.880" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">depend</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.080" end="00:30:00.000" style="s2">that is going to result sooner or later</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:02.080" style="s2">in that</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.000" end="00:30:03.440" style="s2">entity failing and we are actually you</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.080" end="00:30:06.640" style="s2">know when you&#39;re watching americans</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.440" end="00:30:09.520" style="s2">confronting other americans in cafes and</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.640" end="00:30:10.320" style="s2">portraying them as uh racist or</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.520" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.320" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">uh defective for not being willing to</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:16.720" style="s2">comply with an order</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:18.640" style="s2">um you&#39;re watching the failure of of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.720" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">u.s and so the point is</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.640" end="00:30:25.360" style="s2">registering the value of that which</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:26.000" style="s2">is lost if you act in the moment in the</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.360" end="00:30:28.000" style="s2">way</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.000" end="00:30:29.200" style="s2">that you are being incentivized to act</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.000" end="00:30:32.240" style="s2">is the key</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.200" end="00:30:34.000" style="s2">can you do no no i i gotta i got to push</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.240" end="00:30:35.600" style="s2">back against it&#39;s far too analytical</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.000" end="00:30:37.679" style="s2">like there&#39;s no way that it works at</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.600" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">that level in part because</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.679" end="00:30:41.279" style="s2">um you know what you&#39;re saying is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:42.480" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.279" end="00:30:43.919" style="s2">people are thinking too much about</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.480" end="00:30:45.600" style="s2">themselves and not enough about</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.919" end="00:30:46.000" style="s2">something bigger and i would argue it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.600" end="00:30:48.159" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.000" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">exactly the opposite that people that</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.159" end="00:30:51.200" style="s2">this you know what</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:53.120" style="s2">what is it that some people have that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.200" end="00:30:55.360" style="s2">allows them to stand up to a mob</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.120" end="00:30:56.480" style="s2">well um having this character trait of</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.360" end="00:30:57.679" style="s2">being ash negative</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.480" end="00:30:58.960" style="s2">which is something that your brother has</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.679" end="00:30:59.679" style="s2">talked about and we have talked about</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.960" end="00:31:03.120" style="s2">before right</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.679" end="00:31:04.960" style="s2">like of of not conforming to</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.120" end="00:31:06.480" style="s2">expectations of the people around you</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.960" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">when they are patently</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.480" end="00:31:10.480" style="s2">lying right so that&#39;s what the the ash</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">experiment from the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.480" end="00:31:14.159" style="s2">50s revealed and later repeats there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">been</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.159" end="00:31:17.360" style="s2">hundreds i think of replications of that</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:19.039" style="s2">and that was originally just</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.360" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">male undergraduates and it&#39;s been done</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.039" end="00:31:23.519" style="s2">now in you know across a number of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:25.200" style="s2">of people and one of the things we find</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.519" end="00:31:25.919" style="s2">for instance is that women are more</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.200" end="00:31:28.960" style="s2">likely</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.919" end="00:31:30.080" style="s2">to fall prey to the ash confort the</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.960" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">conformity</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.080" end="00:31:35.600" style="s2">of of peer pressure basically uh even</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:37.360" style="s2">when these peers who are new to them</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.600" end="00:31:38.720" style="s2">and they will probably never see again</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.360" end="00:31:40.159" style="s2">and they are patently telling a</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.720" end="00:31:41.039" style="s2">falsehood about what it is they see</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.159" end="00:31:43.279" style="s2">before them</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.039" end="00:31:44.480" style="s2">women are more likely than men to to</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.279" end="00:31:47.279" style="s2">conform</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.480" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">and uh that doesn&#39;t mean that all women</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.279" end="00:31:51.919" style="s2">can form and no men can form</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">nor does it mean uh that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.919" end="00:31:55.279" style="s2">change yourself but sort of recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:57.519" style="s2">conformity to</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.279" end="00:31:59.039" style="s2">peer pressure to social pressure as</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.519" end="00:32:01.200" style="s2">something that you are engaging in in</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.039" end="00:32:03.600" style="s2">the moment when the mob is there</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.200" end="00:32:04.320" style="s2">and saying you know what no who am i you</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.600" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">know who who</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.320" end="00:32:07.519" style="s2">am i when i go back and try to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:11.519" style="s2">tonight</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.519" end="00:32:15.120" style="s2">and report out to my spouse or my god or</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.519" end="00:32:18.960" style="s2">my children or my friends whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.120" end="00:32:21.760" style="s2">will i be proud to look them in the eye</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.960" end="00:32:23.200" style="s2">and say this is what i did or will i</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.760" end="00:32:25.039" style="s2">look at the ground the way the guy</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.200" end="00:32:26.399" style="s2">sitting next to the resistors is with</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.039" end="00:32:27.600" style="s2">his fist in the air</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.399" end="00:32:29.919" style="s2">knowing that he does not want to look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.600" end="00:32:31.200" style="s2">the camera but i don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.919" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">i understand everything you just said</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.200" end="00:32:33.679" style="s2">and of course i resonate with it what i</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.640" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">don&#39;t understand is where the</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.679" end="00:32:36.720" style="s2">disagreement is because i feel like</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.720" end="00:32:40.840" style="s2">i think in the moment it&#39;s it&#39;s so easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:44.240" style="s2">it&#39;s too easy</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.840" end="00:32:46.559" style="s2">to be be in that room i mean</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.240" end="00:32:47.840" style="s2">so this is this is maybe maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.559" end="00:32:50.960" style="s2">framing</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.840" end="00:32:52.960" style="s2">is as you have said many times elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.960" end="00:32:54.480" style="s2">uh the room is not the room right the</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.960" end="00:32:56.720" style="s2">room is in fact the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.480" end="00:32:58.559" style="s2">the internet where this thing is getting</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.720" end="00:33:01.120" style="s2">going to get get played out</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.559" end="00:33:02.399" style="s2">but in the moment in the room our</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.120" end="00:33:05.200" style="s2">understandable</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.399" end="00:33:07.200" style="s2">millions of years of human and in</p>

<p begin="00:33:07.200" end="00:33:10.799" style="s2">cause us to look around and try to fit</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:13.440" style="s2">to some degree</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.799" end="00:33:14.720" style="s2">especially if some are threatening</p>

<p begin="00:33:14.720" end="00:33:17.760" style="s2">how do you just get out of this</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.840" end="00:33:20.240" style="s2">situation right now</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.760" end="00:33:21.360" style="s2">you are asking for people to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.240" end="00:33:24.799" style="s2">maybe a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.360" end="00:33:28.159" style="s2">us a a bigger</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.799" end="00:33:31.279" style="s2">group that will be better served um by</p>
<p begin="00:33:28.159" end="00:33:34.720" style="s2">resistance but that requires staying</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.279" end="00:33:38.159" style="s2">in the group think and and</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.720" end="00:33:40.640" style="s2">and sort of moving through the emotion</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:41.200" style="s2">into a purely analytical purely abstract</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.640" end="00:33:43.679" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.200" end="00:33:45.120" style="s2">that also doesn&#39;t refer back to who you</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.679" end="00:33:47.120" style="s2">are at your core identity</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.120" end="00:33:49.120" style="s2">and i think you know i think that those</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.120" end="00:33:51.360" style="s2">two sort of extremes</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.120" end="00:33:52.640" style="s2">of who you are as an individual and who</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.360" end="00:33:53.600" style="s2">you are proud to be and who you want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:52.640" end="00:33:56.960" style="s2">aspire to be</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.600" end="00:33:59.360" style="s2">and how successful are you being</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.960" end="00:34:00.399" style="s2">at becoming that best of all possible</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.360" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">use</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.399" end="00:34:06.559" style="s2">and how is it that society can</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:08.079" style="s2">be best for all people that those are</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.559" end="00:34:11.359" style="s2">the two</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.079" end="00:34:12.639" style="s2">things that that we would we would try</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.359" end="00:34:15.440" style="s2">to maximize</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.639" end="00:34:16.879" style="s2">and that intermediate social group is</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.440" end="00:34:17.599" style="s2">the one that is most likely to get you</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.879" end="00:34:20.879" style="s2">to behave</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.599" end="00:34:24.000" style="s2">badly and i just i think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:25.760" style="s2">in the moment referring back to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.000" end="00:34:27.119" style="s2">and your individual self and and whether</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.760" end="00:34:29.119" style="s2">or not you&#39;re going to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.119" end="00:34:30.399" style="s2">live with yourself is going to be much</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.119" end="00:34:33.200" style="s2">more likely to succeed</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.399" end="00:34:34.000" style="s2">than imagining the the greater</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.200" end="00:34:35.679" style="s2">abstraction</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.000" end="00:34:37.280" style="s2">okay now i know why we&#39;re disagreeing</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.679" end="00:34:41.359" style="s2">okay um</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.280" end="00:34:45.280" style="s2">let&#39;s imagine three states there&#39;s self</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.359" end="00:34:48.320" style="s2">which is local in space and time to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.280" end="00:34:50.800" style="s2">there&#39;s future self which is local to me</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.320" end="00:34:51.440" style="s2">but not in time that is to say how am i</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.800" end="00:34:53.040" style="s2">going to feel</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.440" end="00:34:54.079" style="s2">an hour after this interaction how am i</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.040" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">going to feel a year after this</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.079" end="00:34:57.599" style="s2">interaction</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:59.200" style="s2">and then there&#39;s self but bigger that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.599" end="00:35:00.560" style="s2">to say i&#39;m part of something that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.200" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">actually dependent on</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.560" end="00:35:05.680" style="s2">and ultimately if that thing fails the</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:08.240" style="s2">cost to me is absolute</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.680" end="00:35:09.680" style="s2">right i think all of i think all these</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:12.880" style="s2">things are the same</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.680" end="00:35:16.560" style="s2">they result in the same alteration of</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.880" end="00:35:20.480" style="s2">um of the thought process</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.560" end="00:35:22.880" style="s2">in the moment and um i would just</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.480" end="00:35:24.320" style="s2">point out and let&#39;s take the evergreen</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.880" end="00:35:26.079" style="s2">situation because it was simple and</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.320" end="00:35:29.119" style="s2">because we know the context of it</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.079" end="00:35:30.960" style="s2">right i didn&#39;t have a choice i wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.119" end="00:35:32.800" style="s2">have had a choice if i had been alone</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.960" end="00:35:34.320" style="s2">but i was also there in front of my</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.800" end="00:35:36.400" style="s2">students right</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.320" end="00:35:38.400" style="s2">for me to have a choice in that moment</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.400" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">would have left me</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.400" end="00:35:43.599" style="s2">uh completely hypocritical with respect</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.839" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">to everything i had represented to them</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.599" end="00:35:48.720" style="s2">as true that doubly made it no choice</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.880" end="00:35:52.000" style="s2">you had already publicly defined</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.960" end="00:35:55.040" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.000" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">as who you were on the inside and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.040" end="00:36:00.079" style="s2">therefore to to to cave to the mob would</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:01.680" style="s2">have been a public act of hypocrisy</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.079" end="00:36:02.720" style="s2">which won&#39;t be true for most people and</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.680" end="00:36:04.400" style="s2">so maybe one of the things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.720" end="00:36:06.720" style="s2">arguing is</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.400" end="00:36:09.119" style="s2">in advance of any such mob coming for</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.720" end="00:36:10.560" style="s2">you begin to make public in small ways</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.119" end="00:36:12.880" style="s2">who you know yourself to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.560" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">so that you have to answer to the self</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.880" end="00:36:14.960" style="s2">that you&#39;ve already established yourself</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:18.160" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.960" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">i believe this is exactly correct and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.160" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">the reason people don&#39;t do it in general</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">is that they will begin to lose friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:26.880" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">yes this goes we are hearing from many</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.880" end="00:36:29.440" style="s2">of them</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:31.280" style="s2">this goes to something you and i have</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.440" end="00:36:31.920" style="s2">said on multiple occasions which is that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.280" end="00:36:33.599" style="s2">one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.920" end="00:36:35.280" style="s2">that was crystal clear about the</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.599" end="00:36:38.000" style="s2">evergreen situation</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:38.960" style="s2">was that it revealed everybody&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.000" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">character</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.960" end="00:36:42.560" style="s2">now the fact is the people that i might</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:45.200" style="s2">have thought were our friends</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.560" end="00:36:46.240" style="s2">who turned on us i would rather not have</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.200" end="00:36:48.880" style="s2">had them as</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.240" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">acquaintances in the run-up to the thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.880" end="00:36:51.920" style="s2">because what they were</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.680" style="s2">was unreliable and what you need is</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.920" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">friends who are reliable so better to</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.680" end="00:36:56.640" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s better to know as early as possible</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.640" end="00:37:00.400" style="s2">and so to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:02.079" style="s2">that you see so sad but it&#39;s better to</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.400" end="00:37:05.040" style="s2">know um</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.079" end="00:37:07.040" style="s2">the only thing i find sad about it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.040" end="00:37:10.240" style="s2">their failure of character</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.040" end="00:37:12.720" style="s2">right the fact that though that weakness</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.240" end="00:37:13.839" style="s2">is so widespread is sad i don&#39;t find it</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.720" end="00:37:15.520" style="s2">personally sad i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.839" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">i mourn the narrative that i thought was</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.520" end="00:37:17.680" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.839" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">i i agree and i&#39;m stunned by some of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.720" end="00:37:23.839" style="s2">things we saw</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:25.920" style="s2">but i would say the other side of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.839" end="00:37:27.440" style="s2">is not well you&#39;re going to lose friends</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.920" end="00:37:29.119" style="s2">it&#39;s you&#39;re going to discover who you</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.440" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">can trust who you could</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.119" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">find yourself in a foxhole with and be</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">glad that they were the ones</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">there and so faculty almost universally</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">disappointed us they didn&#39;t all turn on</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:39.440" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">right many of the people that we were</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.440" end="00:37:43.520" style="s2">friends with were</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:45.040" style="s2">silent which is frustrating or privately</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.520" end="00:37:45.680" style="s2">supported or privately supported but</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.040" end="00:37:47.520" style="s2">they did not</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.680" end="00:37:49.440" style="s2">attack us there were attacks from a</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.520" end="00:37:51.760" style="s2">number of different people</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.440" end="00:37:53.760" style="s2">but the number of people especially on</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:56.960" style="s2">the student side who shined</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.760" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">right was more than compensation for all</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.960" end="00:38:00.960" style="s2">of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:02.240" style="s2">were weak and so i think i think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.960" end="00:38:04.880" style="s2">right that the way</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.240" end="00:38:05.680" style="s2">the hack that is useful is to explore</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.880" end="00:38:08.320" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.680" end="00:38:09.839" style="s2">ahead of time such that the structure</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.320" end="00:38:12.560" style="s2">that is there at the point that you are</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.839" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">confronted with that camera</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.560" end="00:38:16.000" style="s2">knows why you did what you did</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:20.560" style="s2">so two other things i think we should</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.160" end="00:38:22.400" style="s2">say is one</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.560" end="00:38:24.400" style="s2">i don&#39;t see any reason to imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.400" end="00:38:27.280" style="s2">the people who didn&#39;t raise their fist</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.400" end="00:38:30.320" style="s2">had the slightest bit of racism to them</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.280" end="00:38:33.119" style="s2">but even if they did the point is</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.320" end="00:38:33.680" style="s2">this is not how we interact with each</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.119" end="00:38:35.440" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.680" end="00:38:36.960" style="s2">right it is one thing to disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.440" end="00:38:40.240" style="s2">people it is another thing</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.960" end="00:38:42.480" style="s2">to weaponize stigma</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.240" end="00:38:44.240" style="s2">in order to control them that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.480" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">completely unacceptable</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.240" end="00:38:47.599" style="s2">it is uh obviously a threat that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:49.839" style="s2">leveled</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.599" end="00:38:51.200" style="s2">in public and we all have an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.839" end="00:38:54.800" style="s2">obligation</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.200" end="00:38:57.680" style="s2">to resist uh its being</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.800" end="00:38:59.359" style="s2">wielded right no good will come of this</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.680" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">and it certainly will not be good for</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.359" end="00:39:02.880" style="s2">black lives</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">or any any other group of americans</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.880" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:08.000" style="s2">you said you had two things was that</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">both no i&#39;m</p>

<p begin="00:46:01.520" end="00:46:05.680" style="s2">absolutely 100 percent going to force</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.079" end="00:46:08.160" style="s2">the reinvention of the one</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.680" end="00:46:10.319" style="s2">drop rule right right lots of people</p>

<p begin="00:46:13.680" end="00:46:16.960" style="s2">no workable definition that isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.920" end="00:46:19.520" style="s2">to evolve</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.960" end="00:46:21.599" style="s2">involve effectively some claim let the</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.520" end="00:46:24.720" style="s2">games begin yeah let the games begin</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.599" end="00:46:26.839" style="s2">so so let&#39;s just briefly</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.720" end="00:46:28.079" style="s2">uh go back over the other four</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.839" end="00:46:31.760" style="s2">categories uh</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.079" end="00:46:35.200" style="s2">that this 200 million dollars that</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.760" end="00:46:35.839" style="s2">the um boy i don&#39;t have it on screen</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.200" end="00:46:38.319" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.839" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">um 200 million dollars that the oregon</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.319" end="00:46:42.079" style="s2">legislature i guess decided to put</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.319" end="00:46:44.319" style="s2">towards specific communities and sectors</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.079" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">of the economy cultural institutions</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.319" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">which presumably means things like</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:50.800" style="s2">museums and zoos and theater</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:53.440" style="s2">organizations you know live live art</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.800" end="00:46:54.880" style="s2">and such emergency relief checks for</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.440" end="00:46:56.240" style="s2">those waiting on unemployment benefits</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.880" end="00:46:58.319" style="s2">to be paid which</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.240" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">for those not in oregon uh oregon</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.319" end="00:47:01.760" style="s2">famously has done a terrible job of</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:02.800" style="s2">getting unemployment money to people in</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.760" end="00:47:04.960" style="s2">a timely fashion</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.800" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">so this is a fix for a failure that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.960" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">within the state of oregon itself</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:10.400" style="s2">and i presume that there are some other</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:11.280" style="s2">states that are doing really badly but</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.400" end="00:47:12.800" style="s2">you know we have friends</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.280" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">on the vancouver side of the border</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.800" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">that&#39;s vancouver washington</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:18.720" style="s2">and friends in portland oregon um both</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:21.599" style="s2">of whom have been trying to get benefits</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.720" end="00:47:24.319" style="s2">in on the washington side it&#39;s been easy</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.599" end="00:47:25.680" style="s2">and on the oregon side it&#39;s not uh</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.319" end="00:47:27.760" style="s2">30 million uh it doesn&#39;t matter the</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.680" end="00:47:30.480" style="s2">amounts cultural institutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.760" end="00:47:32.240" style="s2">um basically emergency relief checks for</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.480" end="00:47:34.160" style="s2">people who are eligible for unemployment</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.240" end="00:47:34.960" style="s2">but the state system is failing them so</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.160" end="00:47:36.880" style="s2">far</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.960" end="00:47:39.599" style="s2">paying workers who need to quarantine</p>
<p begin="00:47:36.880" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">obviously and grants to small businesses</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.599" end="00:47:43.440" style="s2">okay all of those i can totally get</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:46.559" style="s2">behind all of those groups</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.440" end="00:47:49.680" style="s2">and then let&#39;s see what this um</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.559" end="00:47:50.640" style="s2">oregon cares fund does only for black</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.680" end="00:47:52.960" style="s2">families and business</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.640" end="00:47:55.040" style="s2">owners who are experiencing housing and</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.960" end="00:47:55.920" style="s2">security emergency needs or a loss in</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.040" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">revenue</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.920" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">due to covet 19 pandemic okay let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:03.920" style="s2">instead</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:07.280" style="s2">of making this a racially biased</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.920" end="00:48:09.200" style="s2">set of of grants put more money to</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.280" end="00:48:11.680" style="s2">grants to small businesses</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.200" end="00:48:13.040" style="s2">and put the rest of that money that that</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.680" end="00:48:14.720" style="s2">62 million</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.040" end="00:48:16.559" style="s2">towards helping with housing and</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.720" end="00:48:19.119" style="s2">security and emergency needs for</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.559" end="00:48:19.599" style="s2">all oregonians who need it and who apply</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.119" end="00:48:22.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.599" end="00:48:24.559" style="s2">yes that will mean that some less money</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.640" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">goes to black oregonians but it is</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.559" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">distributed across the board</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:34.000" style="s2">uh maybe i&#39;m done i know</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:36.880" style="s2">this makes me so so angry yeah and</p>

<p begin="00:48:36.880" end="00:48:42.240" style="s2">is this is uh coming from the same</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.800" end="00:48:45.119" style="s2">administration that has coddled</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.240" end="00:48:46.480" style="s2">these rioters which is now apparently</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.119" end="00:48:48.640" style="s2">resulting</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.480" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">predictably enough in businesses fleeing</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.640" end="00:48:51.119" style="s2">from downtown i mean what else are they</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:53.200" style="s2">going to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.119" end="00:48:55.440" style="s2">businesses who are on the cusp of</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.200" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">failing anyway because of lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.440" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">we were just beginning to open up here</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:48:59.520" style="s2">in portland which we know better than</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:01.839" style="s2">the rest of the state</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.520" end="00:49:03.839" style="s2">just beginning to open up the protests</p>

<p begin="00:49:15.280" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">um evidence emerged in the last week</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.559" end="00:49:24.640" style="s2">of protesters hurling</p>

<p begin="00:49:24.960" end="00:49:28.480" style="s2">this is incredible right it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.480" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">at least at the rule of thumb the people</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:35.760" style="s2">who are</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:39.040" style="s2">hurling bodily fluids and</p>

<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:44.960" style="s2">of where that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:47.119" style="s2">the case i would say it&#39;s quadruply the</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.960" end="00:49:50.000" style="s2">case in the midst of a pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.119" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">yeah right so at some level we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.000" end="00:49:53.119" style="s2">anarchists</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:55.760" style="s2">who existed in portland before the</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.119" end="00:50:00.000" style="s2">george floyd protests were regularly</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.760" end="00:50:03.839" style="s2">uh engaging in uh protests in the street</p>

<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:15.200" style="s2">and yet that that manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.079" end="00:50:15.920" style="s2">is resulting in large numbers of funds</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.200" end="00:50:18.559" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.920" end="00:50:19.839" style="s2">redirected and it&#39;s just it&#39;s appalling</p>

<p begin="00:50:31.839" end="00:50:38.640" style="s2">not um but the entire</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.000" end="00:50:39.200" style="s2">country and i suspect the world is</p>

<p begin="00:50:39.200" end="00:50:43.440" style="s2">a mental health crisis at this point</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.280" end="00:50:44.800" style="s2">from a combination of lockdowns that</p>

<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:52.480" style="s2">in combination now with the protests and</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.880" end="00:50:54.079" style="s2">the riots that for many people is</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.480" end="00:50:55.920" style="s2">something they only see on screens have</p>

<p begin="00:52:33.200" end="00:52:38.240" style="s2">2008. it&#39;s a review of research</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.319" end="00:52:39.680" style="s2">um that was registered with the fda so</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.240" end="00:52:41.119" style="s2">not research done by the fda or</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.680" end="00:52:42.240" style="s2">inherently funded by the fda but it was</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.119" end="00:52:45.119" style="s2">just registered with</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.240" end="00:52:46.800" style="s2">federal drug um and the food and drug</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.160" end="00:52:56.000" style="s2">um molecules that are understood</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.359" end="00:52:57.680" style="s2">uh to um sometimes work against</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.000" end="00:52:58.800" style="s2">depression you know selective serotonin</p>

<p begin="00:52:58.800" end="00:53:05.040" style="s2">like prozac being probably one of them</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.240" end="00:53:06.319" style="s2">across over 12 000 patients across many</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.040" end="00:53:08.400" style="s2">many different research studies it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:53:08.400" end="00:53:11.680" style="s2">they found this group of researchers</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.400" end="00:53:14.400" style="s2">that 31</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.680" end="00:53:15.920" style="s2">of the research is not published even</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.400" end="00:53:17.839" style="s2">though it was registered with the fda</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.920" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">and furthermore the research that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.839" end="00:53:20.720" style="s2">published</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:22.160" style="s2">is significantly more likely to show a</p>

<p begin="00:53:22.160" end="00:53:26.079" style="s2">meaning that the drug in question was</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.319" end="00:53:28.240" style="s2">not effective in treating depression</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.079" end="00:53:29.599" style="s2">than the published research so this is</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.240" end="00:53:31.520" style="s2">misleading and could</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.599" end="00:53:33.280" style="s2">easily lead to over-prescription of a</p>

<p begin="00:53:36.240" end="00:53:40.839" style="s2">to the results i&#39;m going to try to see</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.760" end="00:53:43.760" style="s2">if i can see it on my screen here</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:47.599" style="s2">um oh that&#39;s unfortunate</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">uh here we go uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.599" end="00:53:54.800" style="s2">so they say</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:56.160" style="s2">um when we</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.800" end="00:53:58.319" style="s2">look according to the published</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.160" end="00:54:00.480" style="s2">literature it appeared that 94</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.319" end="00:54:01.760" style="s2">of the trials conducted were positive</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.480" end="00:54:04.319" style="s2">which means</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.760" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">uh if you look just at the the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.319" end="00:54:09.680" style="s2">scientific literature</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:10.640" style="s2">uh 94 of trials on these 12</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.680" end="00:54:13.040" style="s2">antidepressant</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.640" end="00:54:14.000" style="s2">agents appeared to to be effective in</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.040" end="00:54:16.880" style="s2">treating</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.000" end="00:54:17.680" style="s2">uh depression but when you look at all</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.880" end="00:54:19.599" style="s2">of the studies</p>
<p begin="00:54:17.680" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">uh that were registered with the fda</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.599" end="00:54:21.200" style="s2">including the ones that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:23.200" style="s2">published</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.200" end="00:54:25.520" style="s2">actually you find that only 51 of them</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.200" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">are positive so i bring this up</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.520" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">just to suggest once again that</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:32.160" style="s2">maybe drugs aren&#39;t your best you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.480" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">pharmaceuticals are not your best friend</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.160" end="00:54:36.160" style="s2">for treating</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:37.280" style="s2">depression and saying well we found</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.160" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">you know there&#39;s evidence in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.280" end="00:54:41.359" style="s2">scientific literature that things are</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:44.400" style="s2">effective well that does not reveal</p>
<p begin="00:54:41.359" end="00:54:46.400" style="s2">the likely bias in um</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.400" end="00:54:47.520" style="s2">in publication in fact the conclusions</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.400" end="00:54:50.880" style="s2">here are</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.520" end="00:54:51.680" style="s2">are careful they say we can&#39;t tell from</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.880" end="00:54:54.799" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.680" end="00:54:57.440" style="s2">if this is a result the bias results</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.799" end="00:54:58.960" style="s2">from a failure to submit manuscripts</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.440" end="00:55:01.359" style="s2">from decisions by journal editors and</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.960" end="00:55:02.640" style="s2">reviewers not to publish or both so</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.359" end="00:55:04.000" style="s2">they&#39;re not saying anything about where</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.640" end="00:55:05.040" style="s2">the bias may be coming from but just</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.000" end="00:55:07.839" style="s2">that there is a clear</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.040" end="00:55:08.480" style="s2">bias that the published literature makes</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.839" end="00:55:11.520" style="s2">it look</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.480" end="00:55:13.119" style="s2">like uh these these drugs to</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.520" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">treat depression are far more effective</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.119" end="00:55:18.799" style="s2">than they are so</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:21.040" style="s2">if if drugs are not the best thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.799" end="00:55:22.000" style="s2">to be dealing with what is likely to be</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.040" end="00:55:25.200" style="s2">a creeping</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.000" end="00:55:26.640" style="s2">mental health uh tragedy across many</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.200" end="00:55:28.640" style="s2">populations at this point</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.640" end="00:55:30.640" style="s2">what might be so we&#39;ve got two you want</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.640" end="00:55:32.400" style="s2">to say something first oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:34.240" style="s2">so many things that need to be said in</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.400" end="00:55:37.520" style="s2">in response to this okay okay one</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.240" end="00:55:38.000" style="s2">that&#39;s 2008 right that is long before</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.520" end="00:55:40.079" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.000" end="00:55:41.440" style="s2">the so-called replication crisis that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.079" end="00:55:45.280" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.440" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">two 50 of the papers if you take the</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.280" end="00:55:47.599" style="s2">aggregate of the positive and negative</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:51.040" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.599" end="00:55:54.000" style="s2">were not positive okay</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.040" end="00:55:55.920" style="s2">that&#39;s after a perverse incentive</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.000" end="00:55:56.240" style="s2">because there&#39;s a perverse incentive to</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:58.960" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.240" end="00:56:00.799" style="s2">work that will come out with a positive</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.960" end="00:56:03.359" style="s2">and therefore publishable result</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.799" end="00:56:05.119" style="s2">so we can&#39;t test there&#39;s always there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.359" end="00:56:05.839" style="s2">already selection on these drugs and on</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.119" end="00:56:08.480" style="s2">this research</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.839" end="00:56:10.880" style="s2">right yeah we have a gargantuan</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.480" end="00:56:12.240" style="s2">apparatus with tremendous financial</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.880" end="00:56:14.559" style="s2">resources that has an</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.240" end="00:56:17.119" style="s2">interest in having results published</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.559" end="00:56:18.000" style="s2">that justify releasing these drugs into</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.119" end="00:56:20.240" style="s2">the market</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.000" end="00:56:22.160" style="s2">it has captured the agency that is</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.240" end="00:56:24.160" style="s2">supposed to regulate their safety</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.160" end="00:56:25.760" style="s2">even after this fifty percent of this</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.160" end="00:56:26.880" style="s2">well so just like the fda is not</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.760" end="00:56:28.559" style="s2">implicated here the only</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">the only thing the fda is doing here is</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.559" end="00:56:32.480" style="s2">that the researchers doing</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:34.000" style="s2">this review paper went and just looked</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.480" end="00:56:34.400" style="s2">at the papers that were registered with</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.000" end="00:56:36.000" style="s2">the fda</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.400" end="00:56:37.359" style="s2">right i got that but what i&#39;m saying i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.000" end="00:56:39.839" style="s2">sure they&#39;re implicated more broadly</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.359" end="00:56:42.400" style="s2">every step of this process is biased</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.839" end="00:56:44.000" style="s2">in the same direction yes right yes</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.400" end="00:56:45.040" style="s2">every step of the process is biased in</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.000" end="00:56:46.880" style="s2">the same direction</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.040" end="00:56:48.480" style="s2">and there&#39;s still enough evidence to</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.880" end="00:56:51.359" style="s2">find that only 50</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.480" end="00:56:52.640" style="s2">of the results are positive right now at</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.359" end="00:56:55.200" style="s2">the same time</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.640" end="00:56:57.040" style="s2">this is you you know so all right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.200" end="00:56:58.960" style="s2">very ambiguous that these drugs</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.040" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">are a good thing if only half the</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.960" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">studies say that they work at all</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.160" style="s2">right that leaves out two really</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:07.280" style="s2">important factors</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.160" end="00:57:09.280" style="s2">one is does the fact that a drug has a</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.280" end="00:57:11.520" style="s2">positive effect in the short term</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.280" end="00:57:13.280" style="s2">mean that it&#39;s a good drug it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.520" end="00:57:13.760" style="s2">only thing you track with coping 19 is</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.280" end="00:57:16.079" style="s2">deaths</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.760" end="00:57:18.079" style="s2">right it&#39;s the same thing exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.079" end="00:57:19.680" style="s2">about all of the other lingering effects</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.079" end="00:57:21.359" style="s2">that may actually cause a decrease in</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.680" end="00:57:22.400" style="s2">quality of life or early death that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.359" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t tracking</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.400" end="00:57:25.520" style="s2">what about all the side effects of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">drugs what about all the other systems</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.520" end="00:57:27.520" style="s2">that they affect</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:28.960" style="s2">what about all the other drugs you have</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.520" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">to be on to deal with the side effects</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.960" end="00:57:32.720" style="s2">of the drugs</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:34.240" style="s2">right so there is massive downside much</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.720" end="00:57:35.119" style="s2">of which will not be measured much of</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.240" end="00:57:37.440" style="s2">which is actually</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.119" end="00:57:38.960" style="s2">unknowable because if it manifests after</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.440" end="00:57:40.640" style="s2">decades it won&#39;t have been</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.960" end="00:57:42.079" style="s2">captured in these initial studies that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.640" end="00:57:43.760" style="s2">said these drugs</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.079" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">were a good thing you can&#39;t say it was</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.760" end="00:57:48.000" style="s2">because of that drug right</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.200" end="00:57:49.839" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the overarching</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.000" end="00:57:52.880" style="s2">elephant in the room here</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.839" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">which is we know dick about the brain</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.880" end="00:57:57.200" style="s2">okay we really don&#39;t know how it works</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:59.599" style="s2">we know a fair amount about</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.200" end="00:58:00.400" style="s2">what it does phenomenologically but in</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.599" end="00:58:02.880" style="s2">terms of our</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.400" end="00:58:03.920" style="s2">interventions our interventions are all</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.880" end="00:58:06.640" style="s2">crude as</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">hell because a brains are tremendously</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.640" end="00:58:10.720" style="s2">different between people</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:12.240" style="s2">and b because we don&#39;t have control at</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.720" end="00:58:13.839" style="s2">the level of these systems so</p>
<p begin="00:58:12.240" end="00:58:15.520" style="s2">the fact that you&#39;re going to dump some</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.839" end="00:58:17.200" style="s2">chemical into somebody&#39;s system and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.520" end="00:58:18.960" style="s2">going to have some alteration that</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.200" end="00:58:20.960" style="s2">under the best of circumstances makes</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.960" end="00:58:23.200" style="s2">them feel better in the context of this</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.960" end="00:58:24.559" style="s2">drug may well make them feel worse when</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.200" end="00:58:25.920" style="s2">you remove the drug later</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.559" end="00:58:27.599" style="s2">may interfere with all kinds of other</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.920" end="00:58:29.760" style="s2">things that make them happy and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.599" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">the positive effect of the drug is then</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.760" end="00:58:32.160" style="s2">canceled by some other effect in their</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.440" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.160" end="00:58:36.319" style="s2">right null hypothesis should absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:38.319" style="s2">be that if you dump a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.319" end="00:58:39.680" style="s2">neurotransmitter into someone&#39;s system</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.319" end="00:58:40.799" style="s2">that it&#39;s going to have long-term</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.680" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">effects right it&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.799" end="00:58:46.240" style="s2">long-term effects and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:47.920" style="s2">in any case the idea that we take this</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">as a sophisticated approach that what</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.920" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">we&#39;re looking for is the best molecule</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:52.720" style="s2">to dump on the person&#39;s system rather</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:55.280" style="s2">than looking for a deeper cause</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.720" end="00:58:55.760" style="s2">that we do this to children right who</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.280" end="00:58:57.839" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.760" end="00:58:59.359" style="s2">end up in this damned if you do damned</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.839" end="00:59:00.960" style="s2">if you don&#39;t situation later on where</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.359" end="00:59:02.720" style="s2">their development has happened</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.960" end="00:59:04.240" style="s2">in the context of this drug that then</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.720" end="00:59:05.839" style="s2">becomes necessary because</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.240" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">developmentally it was a feature of</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.839" end="00:59:11.280" style="s2">their environment</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:13.280" style="s2">this is so insane as an approach and</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.280" end="00:59:14.400" style="s2">anyway i know i know we&#39;re headed to</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.280" end="00:59:16.799" style="s2">interventions that</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.400" end="00:59:18.000" style="s2">aren&#39;t pharmaceutical in nature and</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.799" end="00:59:19.680" style="s2">that&#39;s a really important thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.000" end="00:59:21.839" style="s2">but it&#39;s so much more important than we</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.680" end="00:59:24.000" style="s2">give it credit for we we could</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.839" end="00:59:25.280" style="s2">we could do two times a week live</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.000" end="00:59:26.400" style="s2">streams just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.280" end="00:59:30.000" style="s2">pharmaceuticals</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.400" end="00:59:32.160" style="s2">and um why why you should not go there</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.000" end="00:59:34.079" style="s2">first when you have a problem and could</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.160" end="00:59:36.000" style="s2">should be seeking other forms</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.079" end="00:59:38.319" style="s2">of relief for whatever symptoms you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.000" end="00:59:39.440" style="s2">experiencing i think we could go one</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.319" end="00:59:42.160" style="s2">live stream a week just</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.440" end="00:59:42.880" style="s2">blowing off steam ranting i think we</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.160" end="00:59:46.400" style="s2">already do that</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.880" end="00:59:47.839" style="s2">okay all right well good point</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.400" end="00:59:50.640" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re going to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.839" end="00:59:53.119" style="s2">alternatives to uh what&#39;s outside</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.640" end="00:59:55.200" style="s2">all right well um i think it&#39;s obvious</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.119" end="00:59:56.960" style="s2">that now we need to talk about zebrafish</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.200" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">of course i couldn&#39;t find a way to talk</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.960" end="00:59:59.599" style="s2">about lizards which is usually my</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:00.559" style="s2">preference but it&#39;s going to be</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.599" end="01:00:03.520" style="s2">zebrafish are</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.559" end="01:00:05.040" style="s2">our longtime listeners know that</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.520" end="01:00:06.720" style="s2">zebrafish are the next topic of</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.040" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">discussion as a result of the way we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.720" end="01:00:10.000" style="s2">built this all i i hope that some people</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:10.640" style="s2">took bets and made a little money on</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.000" end="01:00:11.920" style="s2">that that</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.640" end="01:00:13.920" style="s2">you&#39;re guessing that zebrafish were</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.920" end="01:00:14.720" style="s2">coming up next seriously though um</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.920" end="01:00:18.160" style="s2">zebrafish</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.720" end="01:00:21.440" style="s2">are a model organism and i think</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.160" end="01:00:23.119" style="s2">uh this just that statement needs a</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.440" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">little bit of explaining before</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.119" end="01:00:27.359" style="s2">um we will explain why i will explain</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:28.160" style="s2">why i&#39;m talking about zebrafish here in</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.359" end="01:00:30.160" style="s2">a moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.160" end="01:00:32.640" style="s2">uh can i just say that when you say they</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.160" end="01:00:34.960" style="s2">are model organisms you do not mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.640" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">like he&#39;s a model prisoner you mean</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.960" end="01:00:39.040" style="s2">something entirely different i i do</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:41.520" style="s2">in fact so zach actually if you want to</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.040" end="01:00:44.559" style="s2">show my screen just for a moment</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.520" end="01:00:46.079" style="s2">this is actually a really a lovely paper</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.559" end="01:00:48.799" style="s2">that i just ran across today and i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.079" end="01:00:52.000" style="s2">only um i&#39;ve only skimmed it</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.799" end="01:00:55.359" style="s2">but for those latent or</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.000" end="01:00:56.480" style="s2">nascent biologists who want to know more</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.359" end="01:00:58.880" style="s2">about model organisms</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.480" end="01:01:00.880" style="s2">actually does um sort of an interesting</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.880" end="01:01:04.079" style="s2">job of describing so the the idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.880" end="01:01:05.839" style="s2">is that uh if we you know and most of</p>
<p begin="01:01:04.079" end="01:01:08.559" style="s2">this is in service of</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.839" end="01:01:09.040" style="s2">human health and and and medicine you</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.559" end="01:01:11.440" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.040" end="01:01:12.079" style="s2">how how many organisms are there out</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.440" end="01:01:14.400" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.079" end="01:01:15.920" style="s2">um that we could learn about that would</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.400" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">be relevant something we could learn</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.920" end="01:01:18.319" style="s2">about them would be relevant to</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:19.119" style="s2">something that we could learn about</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.319" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">humans</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.119" end="01:01:23.359" style="s2">obviously hundreds of thousands that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">just i pulled that</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.359" end="01:01:27.040" style="s2">order of magnitude out of a hat but you</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:28.799" style="s2">know certainly many many many more than</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.040" end="01:01:29.440" style="s2">we could possibly learn everything about</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.799" end="01:01:33.200" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.440" end="01:01:36.079" style="s2">and so what has happened in in biology</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.200" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">is that a few organisms have been chosen</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.079" end="01:01:39.520" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:41.359" style="s2">ones that uh some some people are just</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.520" end="01:01:42.160" style="s2">going to learn a tremendous amount about</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.359" end="01:01:44.720" style="s2">from the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.160" end="01:01:45.920" style="s2">from the genomics to the behavior to the</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.720" end="01:01:47.920" style="s2">anatomy physiology</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.920" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">to the cellular molecular biology the</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.920" end="01:01:51.200" style="s2">development you know across the board</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:53.599" style="s2">i&#39;m sure i&#39;m forgetting whole</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.200" end="01:01:55.039" style="s2">whole swaths of biology here but so you</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.599" end="01:01:58.480" style="s2">have c elegans</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.039" end="01:01:59.599" style="s2">you have arabidopsis you have drosophila</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.480" end="01:02:03.760" style="s2">melanogaster</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.599" end="01:02:07.440" style="s2">you have um well musc musculus musculus</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:09.280" style="s2">um and uh and and many more than that</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.440" end="01:02:10.559" style="s2">all of which have proven themselves to</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.280" end="01:02:12.880" style="s2">be you know we know</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.559" end="01:02:14.160" style="s2">enough about that now depending on what</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.880" end="01:02:16.480" style="s2">question you might be asking you can</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.160" end="01:02:18.720" style="s2">tweak some aspects of what they are</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.480" end="01:02:19.920" style="s2">and and have effectively controlled for</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.720" end="01:02:21.359" style="s2">a number of things you would have a hard</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.920" end="01:02:23.280" style="s2">time doing if you just went out</p>
<p begin="01:02:21.359" end="01:02:25.359" style="s2">into nature and picked an organism at</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.280" end="01:02:27.760" style="s2">random so let me just say</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.359" end="01:02:29.680" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of logic behind this one</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.760" end="01:02:30.559" style="s2">of the pieces of logic has to do with</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.680" end="01:02:33.440" style="s2">the trade-off</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.559" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">between knowing something in you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.440" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">you could imagine</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.079" style="s2">that there are creatures in which some</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:39.599" style="s2">system would be best studied</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.079" end="01:02:41.839" style="s2">and then there&#39;s the advantage that</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.599" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">comes from knowing some creature very</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.839" end="01:02:45.200" style="s2">well at multiple levels</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:47.599" style="s2">but one of the downsides of knowing some</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.200" end="01:02:49.039" style="s2">creature very well at multiple levels</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.599" end="01:02:50.640" style="s2">is that to the extent that that creature</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.039" end="01:02:52.319" style="s2">is not representative</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.640" end="01:02:53.839" style="s2">you may be misled in terms of</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.319" end="01:02:56.079" style="s2">understanding uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.839" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">how to extrapolate to the thing we most</p>
<p begin="01:02:56.079" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">typically care about which is humans</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:01.599" style="s2">and you may become more likely to decide</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:03.119" style="s2">that outliers are not relevant</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.599" end="01:03:04.720" style="s2">because they don&#39;t fit a pattern that</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.119" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve already begun to see</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.720" end="01:03:08.160" style="s2">and frankly once you start throwing out</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:09.280" style="s2">outliers you start being a</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.160" end="01:03:12.880" style="s2">verificationist</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.280" end="01:03:15.280" style="s2">you start enforcing the idea that your</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.880" end="01:03:16.720" style="s2">model will conform to the model</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.280" end="01:03:18.480" style="s2">your future results will conform to the</p>
<p begin="01:03:16.720" end="01:03:20.559" style="s2">model that you already had as opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.480" end="01:03:22.880" style="s2">you actually testing a hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.559" end="01:03:23.920" style="s2">so this this is yet another problem with</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.880" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">model organisms</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.920" end="01:03:29.280" style="s2">that said um they have they have their</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:31.760" style="s2">place and zebrafish is</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.280" end="01:03:32.799" style="s2">is one okay so zebrafish is another one</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.760" end="01:03:36.240" style="s2">on the list</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.799" end="01:03:39.599" style="s2">of uh model organisms that i just gave</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.240" end="01:03:43.359" style="s2">and i&#39;ve got this this paper</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.599" end="01:03:44.880" style="s2">um that finds actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.359" end="01:03:47.359" style="s2">zach you could show i think i gave you</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.880" end="01:03:49.520" style="s2">the link for all of ariatal 2020.</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.359" end="01:03:51.599" style="s2">uh the title of which is zebrafish show</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.520" end="01:03:53.920" style="s2">long-term behavioral impairments</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.599" end="01:03:55.440" style="s2">resulting from developmental vitamin d</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.359" end="01:04:01.440" style="s2">in october of this year it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.720" end="01:04:03.359" style="s2">online now already this is not a</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.440" end="01:04:04.160" style="s2">preprint this is just an early online</p>

<p begin="01:04:13.920" end="01:04:17.119" style="s2">sorry sorry i&#39;m trying to go back and</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.359" end="01:04:18.799" style="s2">forth and see um</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.119" end="01:04:20.480" style="s2">what it has to say the highlights of</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.799" end="01:04:24.240" style="s2">this paper are</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.480" end="01:04:27.280" style="s2">uh that when it&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.240" end="01:04:28.079" style="s2">when juvenile zebrafish are given diets</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.280" end="01:04:32.240" style="s2">that are either</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.079" end="01:04:35.440" style="s2">replete with or deficient in vitamin d</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.240" end="01:04:37.839" style="s2">those zebrafish that were as youngsters</p>
<p begin="01:04:35.440" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">given insufficient vitamin d in their</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.839" end="01:04:41.920" style="s2">diets</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:43.680" style="s2">had more anxiety behavior anxiety-like</p>
<p begin="01:04:41.920" end="01:04:46.960" style="s2">behavior as adults</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.680" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">furthermore they swum less</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.960" end="01:04:50.400" style="s2">and their startle response was increased</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:51.680" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:04:50.400" end="01:04:52.799" style="s2">again these are just those are the</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.680" end="01:04:54.720" style="s2">highlights for the paper and there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.799" end="01:04:56.640" style="s2">lot more in there but</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.720" end="01:04:57.760" style="s2">juvenile zebrafish that were deficient</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.640" end="01:05:01.119" style="s2">in vitamin d</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.760" end="01:05:02.880" style="s2">as adults had more anxiety had less</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.119" end="01:05:04.079" style="s2">lower activity in the form of swimming</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.880" end="01:05:04.880" style="s2">because they&#39;re fish and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.079" end="01:05:07.200" style="s2">they do</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.880" end="01:05:08.000" style="s2">and and tended to startle more than</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.200" end="01:05:11.119" style="s2">those who had</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.000" end="01:05:11.520" style="s2">sufficient amounts of vitamin d uh and</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.119" end="01:05:13.680" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.520" end="01:05:15.280" style="s2">you know we went through like well what</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.680" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">are why what does it mean for it to be a</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.280" end="01:05:17.839" style="s2">model organism</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">but you also need to know a little bit</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.839" end="01:05:21.599" style="s2">about the natural history</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:23.359" style="s2">actually of zebrafish to know why this</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.599" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">should matter because if zebrafish</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.359" end="01:05:27.839" style="s2">are cave dwellers right that never get</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:30.640" style="s2">exposure to the sun and therefore don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.839" end="01:05:33.920" style="s2">synthesize vitamin d the way we do</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.640" end="01:05:34.400" style="s2">then maybe the idea of taking it out of</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.920" end="01:05:36.720" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.400" end="01:05:38.319" style="s2">their diet is ridiculous because you</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.720" end="01:05:39.280" style="s2">would never find a zebra fish without</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.319" end="01:05:40.960" style="s2">vitamin d</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.280" end="01:05:42.880" style="s2">um in the wild because they are not</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.960" end="01:05:44.960" style="s2">synthesizing it from the sun anyway</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.880" end="01:05:46.720" style="s2">uh well it turns out um zebrafish are</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.960" end="01:05:48.160" style="s2">teleos which is ray-finned fish which</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.720" end="01:05:50.319" style="s2">are vertebrates</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.160" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">and like us um you know share an</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.319" end="01:05:53.200" style="s2">evolution of the brain and the central</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:54.240" style="s2">nervous system and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.200" end="01:05:56.240" style="s2">have a majority of shared</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.240" end="01:05:58.480" style="s2">neurotransmitters and molecular</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.240" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">mechanisms of physiology</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.480" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">um so that&#39;s that&#39;s true we can we know</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:04.240" style="s2">that just from what</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">where they fit on the phylogenetic tree</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.240" end="01:06:08.319" style="s2">but they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:10.880" style="s2">basically living in shallow streams</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.319" end="01:06:13.520" style="s2">shallow clear streams</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.880" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">where presumably there is access to a</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.520" end="01:06:17.520" style="s2">lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:18.000" style="s2">sun so what i take from this and this is</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.520" end="01:06:20.880" style="s2">just one</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.000" end="01:06:22.160" style="s2">of two things that i want to talk about</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.880" end="01:06:24.000" style="s2">briefly here as</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.160" end="01:06:25.920" style="s2">you know are you beginning to suffer</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.000" end="01:06:26.720" style="s2">from anxiety and depression like</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.920" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">symptoms</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.720" end="01:06:30.079" style="s2">rather than running to your doctor for</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:33.680" style="s2">ssris or similar</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.079" end="01:06:34.720" style="s2">um antidepressant agents consider going</p>
<p begin="01:06:33.680" end="01:06:36.240" style="s2">out in the sun</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.720" end="01:06:37.920" style="s2">and not slathering yourself with</p>
<p begin="01:06:36.240" end="01:06:38.720" style="s2">sunscreen from head to toe before you do</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.920" end="01:06:42.079" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.720" end="01:06:44.079" style="s2">uh this is yes a result from zebrafish</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.079" end="01:06:46.000" style="s2">and yes it&#39;s a result and this i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.079" end="01:06:47.119" style="s2">may help explain further some of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.000" end="01:06:48.880" style="s2">going on with</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.119" end="01:06:50.319" style="s2">a whole generation of young people whose</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.880" end="01:06:51.359" style="s2">parents slathered them with sunscreen</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.319" end="01:06:52.240" style="s2">before they were ever allowed to go</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.359" end="01:06:55.839" style="s2">outside</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.240" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">but children and adults alike benefit</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.839" end="01:06:59.039" style="s2">from having their skin exposed to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:00.880" style="s2">sun and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.039" end="01:07:02.319" style="s2">this is just another result that</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.880" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">suggests that actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.319" end="01:07:07.680" style="s2">uh it may help with mood as well yeah um</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:09.039" style="s2">if i read that i only skimmed the paper</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.680" end="01:07:11.839" style="s2">but if i read it correctly</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.039" end="01:07:14.160" style="s2">also uh increased vitamin d results in</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.839" end="01:07:16.880" style="s2">greater job satisfaction among zebrafish</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.160" end="01:07:18.000" style="s2">yes absolutely yeah especially zebra</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.880" end="01:07:19.119" style="s2">fish who find themselves working in</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.000" end="01:07:21.359" style="s2">cubicles</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.119" end="01:07:22.640" style="s2">oh man if during their 10-minute breaks</p>
<p begin="01:07:21.359" end="01:07:24.160" style="s2">that they&#39;re allowed to take each day</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.640" end="01:07:25.920" style="s2">they go out into the sun</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.160" end="01:07:27.520" style="s2">and leave their cubicles they are they</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.920" end="01:07:28.960" style="s2">are much happier</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.520" end="01:07:31.039" style="s2">i can imagine they would for one thing</p>

<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:40.880" style="s2">they they&#39;re kind of built for speed</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.720" end="01:07:42.640" style="s2">yeah yeah filter speed you&#39;re the first</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.880" end="01:07:43.920" style="s2">person to ever say that about zebrafish</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.640" end="01:07:46.240" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.920" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">okay um on a later episode of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.240" end="01:07:49.520" style="s2">evolutionary lens we will talk about the</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:50.799" style="s2">deep body form in refish probably we</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.520" end="01:07:53.119" style="s2">won&#39;t but we could</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.799" end="01:07:55.520" style="s2">ah we should okay we should we should</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.119" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">okay finally with regard to depression</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.520" end="01:07:58.640" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">um what things besides popping pills you</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.640" end="01:08:01.359" style="s2">might do</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:03.039" style="s2">to help yourself out of the funk that is</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.359" end="01:08:04.960" style="s2">totally justifiable based on what is</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.039" end="01:08:08.640" style="s2">going on in the world</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.960" end="01:08:11.280" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a 2016 paper that uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.640" end="01:08:13.920" style="s2">actually there&#39;s two papers here um one</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.280" end="01:08:17.520" style="s2">two 2016 and one 2019</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.920" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">uh that find that moderate to</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.520" end="01:08:22.159" style="s2">intense exercise uh does a tremendously</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:24.880" style="s2">good job</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.159" end="01:08:25.679" style="s2">of impacting depression so let&#39;s see</p>

<p begin="01:08:29.440" end="01:08:33.520" style="s2">uh paper called sweating away depression</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.520" end="01:08:35.279" style="s2">the impact of intensive exercise on</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.520" end="01:08:38.319" style="s2">depression</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.279" end="01:08:41.279" style="s2">so uh what these uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.319" end="01:08:43.040" style="s2">what this paper finds uh oh again here</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.279" end="01:08:45.199" style="s2">we have highlights on the screen</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.040" end="01:08:46.799" style="s2">uh that like i said modern intensity and</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.199" end="01:08:47.440" style="s2">high intensity exercise was found to</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.799" end="01:08:49.920" style="s2">improve</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.440" end="01:08:51.440" style="s2">uh depression very low intensity</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.920" end="01:08:53.279" style="s2">exercise like walking while it&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.440" end="01:08:55.040" style="s2">for a whole lot of other things doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.279" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">didn&#39;t seem to be particularly</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.040" end="01:08:59.600" style="s2">beneficial</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:01.759" style="s2">and specifically the participants and</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.600" end="01:09:03.759" style="s2">this this is a small study this is 30</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.759" end="01:09:04.960" style="s2">men who showed signs of moderate</p>

<p begin="01:09:04.960" end="01:09:08.719" style="s2">uh the participants showed a slight</p>

<p begin="01:09:08.719" end="01:09:14.000" style="s2">increased seeking behavior so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.759" end="01:09:15.759" style="s2">this is again not zebrafish but men who</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.000" end="01:09:17.679" style="s2">are showing increased seeking behavior</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.759" end="01:09:20.719" style="s2">and decreased panic and fear</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.679" end="01:09:22.880" style="s2">after spending some regular time in</p>

<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:29.279" style="s2">three days a week like not not a</p>

<p begin="01:09:29.279" end="01:09:32.640" style="s2">but not just you know taking a walk</p>

<p begin="01:09:32.640" end="01:09:37.520" style="s2">has benefits for sure but moderate to</p>

<p begin="01:09:39.759" end="01:09:45.120" style="s2">there&#39;s some part of me which just you</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.000" end="01:09:48.159" style="s2">know is thinking about the process</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.120" end="01:09:51.679" style="s2">uh this is the downside of enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:09:48.159" end="01:09:54.960" style="s2">that we needed hundreds of years of</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.679" end="01:09:57.120" style="s2">careful study for scientists to finally</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:10:00.640" style="s2">discover that going out in the sun and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.120" end="01:10:02.239" style="s2">exerting yourself makes you feel better</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.640" end="01:10:03.920" style="s2">there is another way to discover these</p>

<p begin="01:10:12.719" end="01:10:16.880" style="s2">um and then let me just point out that</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.880" end="01:10:18.560" style="s2">there are many follow-up papers and you</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.880" end="01:10:20.320" style="s2">know not even follow-up of course i mean</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.560" end="01:10:20.719" style="s2">just like you say this is at one level</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.320" end="01:10:22.960" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.719" end="01:10:23.920" style="s2">obvious uh but there&#39;s a mcintyre at all</p>

<p begin="01:10:55.199" end="01:11:00.159" style="s2">thinking about this</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.400" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">in the wake of our our kayak</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.159" end="01:11:05.440" style="s2">last night so three of us uh brett and i</p>

<p begin="01:11:08.239" end="01:11:12.400" style="s2">you know what three miles each direction</p>
<p begin="01:11:09.920" end="01:11:15.440" style="s2">we we put in one place and we</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.400" end="01:11:16.400" style="s2">um kayak to dinner we yeah we paddled</p>
<p begin="01:11:15.440" end="01:11:18.400" style="s2">downstream</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.400" end="01:11:19.760" style="s2">um but that it was against such an</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.400" end="01:11:22.480" style="s2">amazing headwind</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.760" end="01:11:23.920" style="s2">like it was really really really hard we</p>
<p begin="01:11:22.480" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">get out we go to dinner we got back to</p>

<p begin="01:11:28.159" end="01:11:32.000" style="s2">um upstream but you know all of that</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.800" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">wind that would have been a tailwind</p>
<p begin="01:11:32.000" end="01:11:36.880" style="s2">taking us home had died</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:39.440" style="s2">so it was it was hard both ways um</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.880" end="01:11:40.080" style="s2">and it was really it was it was dark by</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.440" end="01:11:42.400" style="s2">the time we got</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.080" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">back there was about a i was calling it</p>

<p begin="01:11:46.000" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">pulling into the dock on the far end</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.679" end="01:11:54.320" style="s2">and my tweet uh of this live stream</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:58.080" style="s2">included a very unusual cloud</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.320" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">prism color bow uh that we saw only</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.080" end="01:12:02.000" style="s2">briefly a couple minutes and it was gone</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.920" end="01:12:03.760" style="s2">just as we were just as we were arriving</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.000" end="01:12:07.360" style="s2">towards sunset</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.760" end="01:12:08.800" style="s2">no so it was uh as we had arrived at the</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.360" end="01:12:09.920" style="s2">dock where we were then walking to get</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.800" end="01:12:12.239" style="s2">dinner so it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.920" end="01:12:13.679" style="s2">an hour before sunset or so hour and a</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.239" end="01:12:17.679" style="s2">half before sunset</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.679" end="01:12:20.880" style="s2">um but it&#39;s all it takes is doing it</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.679" end="01:12:23.040" style="s2">to see the change in your own</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.880" end="01:12:24.480" style="s2">in your own mood and of course yes your</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.040" end="01:12:27.600" style="s2">body as well but</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.480" end="01:12:29.920" style="s2">um don&#39;t underestimate</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.600" end="01:12:31.600" style="s2">the effects of this and don&#39;t waste the</p>
<p begin="01:12:29.920" end="01:12:32.640" style="s2">summer and the good weather for those of</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.600" end="01:12:34.480" style="s2">you who have it now</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.640" end="01:12:37.440" style="s2">well while it&#39;s here all right i cannot</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.480" end="01:12:39.360" style="s2">resist going full evolutionary theorists</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.440" end="01:12:40.960" style="s2">on this question so why would you resist</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.360" end="01:12:43.040" style="s2">what we have discovered</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.960" end="01:12:44.400" style="s2">is that going out in the sun and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.040" end="01:12:47.440" style="s2">exerting yourself</p>
<p begin="01:12:44.400" end="01:12:50.320" style="s2">makes you feel better and i&#39;m thinking</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.440" end="01:12:50.880" style="s2">what else might so here&#39;s the hypothesis</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.320" end="01:12:52.239" style="s2">oh wow</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.880" end="01:12:54.320" style="s2">what about it&#39;s gonna be risky what</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.239" end="01:12:55.040" style="s2">about love do you think that might make</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.320" end="01:12:58.880" style="s2">people feel</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.040" end="01:13:02.239" style="s2">better yeah love actual connection</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.880" end="01:13:03.760" style="s2">touch yeah uh finding bags of money</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.239" end="01:13:05.120" style="s2">would that</p>
