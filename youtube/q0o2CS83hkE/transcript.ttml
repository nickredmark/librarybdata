<p begin="00:00:43.440" end="00:00:48.800" style="s2">what are we hearing yeah so we&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.719" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">to humidify the space such that if our</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.800" end="00:00:52.399" style="s2">tech problems were about the dryness</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:54.399" style="s2">we&#39;ve got a steamer going in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.399" end="00:00:57.760" style="s2">background oh no</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.399" end="00:01:01.600" style="s2">we&#39;re revealing secrets yes the um the</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.760" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">frame drop signal failure that happened</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.600" end="00:01:04.960" style="s2">last time</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.320" style="s2">has continued to dog us it was not many</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.960" end="00:01:07.760" style="s2">people suggested that it had something</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.320" end="00:01:09.840" style="s2">to do with the frame rates</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:11.840" style="s2">of the cameras that seemed very unlikely</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.840" end="00:01:13.040" style="s2">for various reasons because</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.840" end="00:01:14.240" style="s2">nothing had changed about the frame</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.040" end="00:01:15.200" style="s2">rates and it happened on multiple</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.240" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">computers but</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.200" end="00:01:19.920" style="s2">anyway we falsified that idea others</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:21.200" style="s2">suggested that it might be related to</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.920" end="00:01:23.680" style="s2">static electricity</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.200" end="00:01:26.640" style="s2">so we&#39;ve been humidifying the room which</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.680" end="00:01:28.799" style="s2">is why it feels tropical in here</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.640" end="00:01:30.240" style="s2">but in any case uh that does not seem to</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.799" end="00:01:32.320" style="s2">have completely cured the problem so</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.240" end="00:01:34.880" style="s2">we&#39;re not sure what&#39;s going on but</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.320" end="00:01:36.720" style="s2">we will forge ahead we are forging yes</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.880" end="00:01:39.840" style="s2">yes consider us forging</p>

<p begin="00:03:25.920" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">straightforward and intuitive that they</p>

<p begin="00:04:05.200" end="00:04:09.200" style="s2">in a giant convergence</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.720" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">yes the convergence has to happen yes uh</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.200" end="00:04:11.840" style="s2">it&#39;s overdue</p>

<p begin="00:04:22.800" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">i found that a fascinating comment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:29.120" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:31.840" style="s2">you know i think the tragedy</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.120" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">of the moment or part of it is that</p>

<p begin="00:04:51.520" end="00:04:56.639" style="s2">and they see that as positive</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.880" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">as do i um that they look past</p>

<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:45.919" style="s2">thought that donald trump was the</p>

<p begin="00:05:45.919" end="00:05:51.840" style="s2">and so so easy to beat right um</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.840" end="00:05:53.199" style="s2">so they used surrogates in the press to</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.840" end="00:05:54.960" style="s2">advance his candidacy</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.199" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">so when you say that he beat half the</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.960" end="00:05:58.639" style="s2">duopoly you mean that he uh</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:06:00.720" style="s2">he smuggled himself in he&#39;s not very</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.639" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">good at smuggling himself he</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.720" end="00:06:04.080" style="s2">crashed crashed in through the wall to</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">the republican party</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.080" end="00:06:08.000" style="s2">and they started trying to go don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:11.120" style="s2">don&#39;t what are you doing and then they</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.000" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">ultimately caved yeah i mean he</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.120" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">he bust in on the republican</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">racket and they could have</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">rebelled but instead they bent the knee</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.919" style="s2">story</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:26.319" style="s2">it&#39;s a very remarkable accomplishment</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.919" end="00:06:27.840" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.319" end="00:06:30.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not the whole tale and the problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.840" end="00:06:32.800" style="s2">is that the characteristics necessary to</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.400" end="00:06:37.039" style="s2">accomplish that</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.800" end="00:06:40.000" style="s2">are i believe not consistent</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.039" end="00:06:41.360" style="s2">with the kind of um nonpartisan</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.000" end="00:06:43.280" style="s2">leadership that we need</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.360" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">at a moment in which we face this level</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.280" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">of divisiveness</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.319" end="00:06:51.120" style="s2">okay one more um just light-hearted</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.800" end="00:06:53.919" style="s2">question from last time someone asked if</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.120" end="00:06:54.639" style="s2">um either of us have a favorite font for</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.919" end="00:06:56.560" style="s2">writing</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.639" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">and if they are the same or if we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.560" end="00:06:59.759" style="s2">font debates</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:02.000" style="s2">and we&#39;ve never actually talked about</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.759" end="00:07:05.840" style="s2">this i&#39;m not sure you have any</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.000" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">opinion at all uh i i do</p>

<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:13.759" style="s2">and my mother who was a calligrapher for</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.680" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">several years while i was growing up</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.759" end="00:07:17.199" style="s2">um instilled in me still a love of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">letter form</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.199" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">and although as a as a left-hander i was</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:23.360" style="s2">never going to become</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:24.160" style="s2">excellent with ink and a pen because um</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.360" end="00:07:26.560" style="s2">at least not</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.160" end="00:07:27.759" style="s2">using um using english if it&#39;d be one</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.560" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">thing if i was trying to write</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.759" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">in a language that went right to left um</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:32.319" style="s2">but but palatino for me and i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:34.400" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.319" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">i don&#39;t honestly know if you have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.400" end="00:07:40.000" style="s2">opinion ah it&#39;s wingdings all the way</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:42.000" style="s2">no you know i&#39;ll tell you what let&#39;s i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.000" end="00:07:43.520" style="s2">gonna answer the question</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.000" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">this is not an insult to your question</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.520" end="00:07:45.520" style="s2">but i&#39;m gonna answer the question i</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:47.599" style="s2">think you should have asked rather than</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.520" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">the question that you actually asked</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.599" end="00:07:51.759" style="s2">um so i do have a couple of interesting</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:54.160" style="s2">relationships with the idea of font one</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.759" end="00:07:55.360" style="s2">is i&#39;m very fond of the idea that font</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.160" end="00:07:58.479" style="s2">became a thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.360" end="00:08:01.599" style="s2">um in the way that it did because of</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.479" end="00:08:03.520" style="s2">um steve jobs steve jobs who dropped out</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.599" end="00:08:05.759" style="s2">of college and kept going and took a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.520" end="00:08:07.520" style="s2">class on calligraphy and anyway read</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.759" end="00:08:08.800" style="s2">right at reed exactly</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.520" end="00:08:10.080" style="s2">exactly um so there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:11.280" style="s2">marvelous about that story and it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.080" end="00:08:14.560" style="s2">connects to our</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.280" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">uh experience in multiple ways we had</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.560" end="00:08:16.879" style="s2">students</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:18.560" style="s2">who after they had graduated kept</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.879" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">attending our classes who we called</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.560" end="00:08:24.319" style="s2">drop-ins following what steve jobs had</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:25.520" style="s2">described himself as doing so that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.319" end="00:08:29.280" style="s2">sort of thread</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.520" end="00:08:31.520" style="s2">sort of the aesthetic flair that the</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.280" end="00:08:33.279" style="s2">the guy who had the insight about um so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.520" end="00:08:35.519" style="s2">much in the space of computers</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.279" end="00:08:36.640" style="s2">and just reminding us that design is</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.519" end="00:08:38.399" style="s2">actually everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.640" end="00:08:40.800" style="s2">and that you don&#39;t tend to notice good</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.399" end="00:08:42.719" style="s2">design you almost always notice bad</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.800" end="00:08:46.320" style="s2">design even if not consciously</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.719" end="00:08:48.959" style="s2">but that he he brought to us the amazing</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.320" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">uh the myriad choices of fonts um to</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.959" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">some degree</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:52.959" style="s2">uh that we have some of which are</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:54.640" style="s2">obviously ugly and bad and there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.959" end="00:08:57.760" style="s2">know there&#39;s plenty of font wars</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.640" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">out there but um but</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.760" end="00:09:01.120" style="s2">probably the history of early personal</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:03.200" style="s2">computing would look</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.120" end="00:09:05.920" style="s2">much different and it would have taken</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.200" end="00:09:07.360" style="s2">off uh with different kinds of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.920" end="00:09:10.399" style="s2">being core users</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.360" end="00:09:13.600" style="s2">had there not been the design in</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.399" end="00:09:14.560" style="s2">font&#39;s attention paid due to steve jobs</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.600" end="00:09:17.279" style="s2">early</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.560" end="00:09:18.240" style="s2">experiences i would agree with that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.279" end="00:09:21.440" style="s2">i would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.240" end="00:09:22.240" style="s2">also at the level of the how might we</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.440" end="00:09:25.279" style="s2">upgrade our</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:29.200" style="s2">system of governance</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.279" end="00:09:32.160" style="s2">it looms very large for me that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.200" end="00:09:32.480" style="s2">government needs to regulate us in a way</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.160" end="00:09:34.959" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.480" end="00:09:37.200" style="s2">is so light-handed and elegant that we</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.959" end="00:09:38.399" style="s2">don&#39;t detect it the way you don&#39;t detect</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.200" end="00:09:40.240" style="s2">all of the inner workings of your</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.399" end="00:09:41.040" style="s2">computer if the interface is well</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.240" end="00:09:43.440" style="s2">designed</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.040" end="00:09:45.680" style="s2">and then the last thing i&#39;ll say is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.440" end="00:09:47.920" style="s2">crazy typewriter over in the corner</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.680" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">um which i&#39;ve told the story of a little</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.920" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">bit but i got that thing for 11 bucks at</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:52.800" style="s2">a goodwill</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:54.640" style="s2">thinking i would um hack into the</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.800" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">keyboard and turn it into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.640" end="00:09:58.959" style="s2">printer and then i discovered there was</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">no electronics to hack into in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.959" end="00:10:01.519" style="s2">machine</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:03.279" style="s2">and i fell into it for a number of</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.519" end="00:10:05.519" style="s2">months and again what it is</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.279" end="00:10:06.640" style="s2">oh it&#39;s a selectric 2 correcting</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.519" end="00:10:09.279" style="s2">selectric 2.</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.640" end="00:10:10.240" style="s2">an amazing device and a whole world of</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.279" end="00:10:13.760" style="s2">people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.240" end="00:10:16.640" style="s2">dying at an incredible rate this team of</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.760" end="00:10:18.320" style="s2">technicians that ibm trained to be able</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.640" end="00:10:19.519" style="s2">to service that thing because it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.320" end="00:10:21.360" style="s2">complex</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.519" end="00:10:23.040" style="s2">um you know some of those people are</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.360" end="00:10:24.720" style="s2">still around and they you know they</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.040" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">serviced a very smaller number of these</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.720" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.519" style="s2">but anyway the thing about that</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:30.800" style="s2">typewriter was that it was built around</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.519" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">this ball</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.800" end="00:10:35.120" style="s2">that solved the problem of the keys of</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:36.399" style="s2">the typewriter sticking with each other</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.120" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">if you hit two letters too close</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.399" end="00:10:39.600" style="s2">together which is of course the reason</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.920" style="s2">that the keyboard is such a crazy</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.600" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">organization of letters was to slow down</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.920" end="00:10:45.440" style="s2">the typist so they were less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">jam the keys of the original</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.440" end="00:10:49.279" style="s2">um electro electric typewriters or any</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">typewriter</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.279" end="00:10:52.720" style="s2">but which you&#39;re talking about qwerty</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:54.079" style="s2">keyboard as opposed to like dvorak</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.720" end="00:10:55.920" style="s2">right so the qwerty keyboard was</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.079" end="00:10:57.120" style="s2">actually designed to slow you down um</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.920" end="00:11:00.399" style="s2">slow you down so you didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.120" end="00:11:03.200" style="s2">jam the keys that uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.399" end="00:11:05.120" style="s2">ball typewriter um solves the problem</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.200" end="00:11:07.040" style="s2">there are no keys it has a ball that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.120" end="00:11:08.720" style="s2">leaps and hits the page at the right</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.040" end="00:11:10.880" style="s2">spot to get the right letter</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.720" end="00:11:12.399" style="s2">leaps and spins it leaps and spins it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.880" end="00:11:14.079" style="s2">the most amazing device ever because</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.399" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">it&#39;s all mechanical except for the motor</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.079" end="00:11:17.839" style="s2">and the switch</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.600" style="s2">and anyway you could replace the ball so</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.839" end="00:11:21.360" style="s2">unlike a regular typewriter you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.600" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">change the font that&#39;s really where</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.360" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">fonts became a thing for somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:26.320" style="s2">know it wasn&#39;t really similar this would</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.399" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.320" end="00:11:29.760" style="s2">late 70s early 80s early 80s mid 80s</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.399" end="00:11:33.760" style="s2">when that one</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.760" end="00:11:36.880" style="s2">is i believe a late 70s</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.760" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">late 70s maybe it&#39;s early 80s but um but</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.880" end="00:11:39.040" style="s2">anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:40.800" style="s2">the balls they&#39;re you know they&#39;re still</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.040" end="00:11:42.079" style="s2">available on ebay and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.800" end="00:11:44.160" style="s2">and there are a couple of them that i</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.079" end="00:11:46.399" style="s2">find captivating there&#39;s one which i</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.160" end="00:11:48.959" style="s2">can&#39;t get the right spacing for but</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.399" end="00:11:50.240" style="s2">there&#39;s one they had which actually does</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.959" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">cursive</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.240" end="00:11:54.639" style="s2">and so basically the cursive was made so</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.480" style="s2">that the ending of one letter</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.639" end="00:11:57.839" style="s2">lines up with the beginning of the next</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.480" end="00:11:59.200" style="s2">letter so if you get the typewriter that</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.839" end="00:12:02.160" style="s2">has the correct spacing</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.200" end="00:12:02.800" style="s2">it will write a cursive um page for you</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.160" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">and it&#39;s pretty</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.800" end="00:12:06.000" style="s2">freaking compelling that&#39;s amazing</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:08.480" style="s2">because obviously there are different</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.000" end="00:12:10.320" style="s2">widths i mean so i have i have</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.480" end="00:12:11.760" style="s2">in college played around a lot with sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.320" end="00:12:13.760" style="s2">of movable type and</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.760" end="00:12:14.880" style="s2">and uh broadsheets and you&#39;ve done some</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:17.360" style="s2">print making and such</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.880" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">and you know we know that um there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.360" end="00:12:20.320" style="s2">just there&#39;s there&#39;s different widths to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:22.560" style="s2">letters for words to look</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.320" end="00:12:24.000" style="s2">reasonable yep um so the idea that you</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.560" end="00:12:27.040" style="s2">could do cursive would seem</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.000" end="00:12:28.639" style="s2">to presume that either the typewriter</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.040" end="00:12:30.000" style="s2">already knows what you&#39;re about to type</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.639" end="00:12:33.440" style="s2">which it presumably can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.000" end="00:12:35.200" style="s2">or it has um controlled for what such</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.440" end="00:12:37.600" style="s2">all of the wits are the same yeah what</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.200" end="00:12:38.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve done somebody spent a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.600" end="00:12:41.279" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.079" end="00:12:43.519" style="s2">designing the font so that it uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.279" end="00:12:44.720" style="s2">solved the problem of wits and left it</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.519" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">readable yeah</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.720" end="00:12:49.040" style="s2">and anyway the first time i saw a page</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:49.600" style="s2">that had been typed out on this thing i</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.040" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">was just</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.600" end="00:12:52.959" style="s2">stunned at how compelling it actually</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:55.839" style="s2">was and</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.959" end="00:12:58.000" style="s2">you know what that suggested also about</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.839" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">you know there was a way in which</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.000" end="00:13:02.880" style="s2">you know early printers had a very harsh</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.399" style="s2">look you know dot matrix printers</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.880" end="00:13:06.000" style="s2">like they were you know personal letter</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.399" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">on a dot matrix printer is just</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.000" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">you know a uh it&#39;s hard to write a</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:11.600" style="s2">compelling</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.279" style="s2">love letter on a dot matrix printer</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.600" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">don&#39;t i know it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.279" end="00:13:16.800" style="s2">but yes so um so the idea that um this</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:19.600" style="s2">printer</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.800" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">involved or this uh typewriter involved</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.600" end="00:13:22.639" style="s2">the ability</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:25.040" style="s2">and that somebody would be inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.639" end="00:13:28.160" style="s2">design a font that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.040" end="00:13:29.200" style="s2">um have that that leave the the reader</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.160" end="00:13:31.440" style="s2">with that impression</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.200" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">i don&#39;t know captured my imagination so</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.440" end="00:13:34.160" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:36.160" style="s2">so you know we could we could talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.160" end="00:13:37.440" style="s2">fonts for a while but maybe maybe we</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.160" end="00:13:39.920" style="s2">won&#39;t man i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.440" end="00:13:40.880" style="s2">i feel like i&#39;ve said when i need to i</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.920" end="00:13:42.320" style="s2">could keep talking you could keep</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.880" end="00:13:45.440" style="s2">talking about fonts</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.320" end="00:13:47.680" style="s2">um okay first question from today</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.440" end="00:13:49.199" style="s2">john baez world class mathematician was</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.680" end="00:13:51.120" style="s2">recently cancelled for a joke about</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.199" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">obscure algebraic structures</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.120" end="00:13:55.600" style="s2">jokingly calling them oppressed in math</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.440" style="s2">bullying rose so high he deleted the</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.600" end="00:13:59.279" style="s2">joke left twitter he is a great mind i</p>

<p begin="00:14:20.399" end="00:14:27.360" style="s2">such an upsetting description</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:29.680" style="s2">um i mean i&#39;ve said it so many times</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.360" end="00:14:32.720" style="s2">before but you have to be free to make</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.680" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">jokes in order to navigate the difficult</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.720" end="00:14:35.839" style="s2">stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.399" end="00:14:42.000" style="s2">that means you have to have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.199" end="00:14:44.800" style="s2">to make jokes</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.000" end="00:14:45.760" style="s2">up through the border of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.800" end="00:14:49.360" style="s2">acceptable</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.360" end="00:14:55.279" style="s2">algebraic structures oppressed</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.040" end="00:14:58.399" style="s2">is uh is clearly not at the limit of</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.279" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">what anyone should find</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.399" end="00:15:01.600" style="s2">right exactly and you know to the extent</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.399" end="00:15:04.800" style="s2">that it is offensive</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.600" end="00:15:08.399" style="s2">the answer is thicker goddamn skin</p>

<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:15.199" style="s2">said but what</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.360" end="00:15:17.199" style="s2">not knowing really almost anything about</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.199" end="00:15:19.199" style="s2">what this guy&#39;s situation was but what</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.199" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">should he have done then</p>

<p begin="00:15:36.160" end="00:15:39.839" style="s2">level i think you have an</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.120" end="00:15:40.959" style="s2">obligation to stand up to that level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.839" end="00:15:44.639" style="s2">absurdity</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.959" end="00:15:45.360" style="s2">right and you know you have to also just</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.639" end="00:15:47.360" style="s2">have</p>

<p begin="00:15:49.759" end="00:15:56.560" style="s2">uh of some kind of bias or ism</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.240" end="00:15:58.720" style="s2">for having called mathematical</p>

<p begin="00:16:04.399" end="00:16:07.040" style="s2">sort of moral defect for having said</p>

<p begin="00:16:07.040" end="00:16:11.199" style="s2">increasingly this one but increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.959" end="00:16:13.440" style="s2">this one because</p>

<p begin="00:16:13.440" end="00:16:17.279" style="s2">are so flabbergasted</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.199" end="00:16:18.240" style="s2">uh that they shut it down i said this is</p>

<p begin="00:16:21.360" end="00:16:25.759" style="s2">and so i&#39;m just gonna shut down my</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.759" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">and um and i you know i get that</p>

<p begin="00:16:36.560" end="00:16:41.600" style="s2">at some level i mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.759" end="00:16:43.759" style="s2">maybe this is what needs to be said</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.600" end="00:16:45.519" style="s2">there&#39;s a difference between</p>

<p begin="00:16:50.639" end="00:16:54.160" style="s2">them exhaust themselves doing whatever</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">they&#39;re going to do and</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.160" end="00:16:57.199" style="s2">so rather than shutting your twitter</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:58.079" style="s2">down just just like not going there for</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.199" end="00:16:59.680" style="s2">a week or something</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.079" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">right i mean so walking away could mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.680" end="00:17:02.800" style="s2">two different things here in one way he</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:04.000" style="s2">has walked away you&#39;re saying the other</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">kind of walk away is what he should have</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.000" end="00:17:06.400" style="s2">done</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:07.919" style="s2">i think he needs to walk away strong he</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.400" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to sit there and listen to</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.919" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:11.839" style="s2">i certainly understand i mean it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:14.959" style="s2">hard not to respond so</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.839" end="00:17:16.720" style="s2">not engaging yeah is one thing but</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.959" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">i think the thing is we need to let</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.720" end="00:17:19.360" style="s2">these people look like idiots because</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:22.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what they are</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.360" end="00:17:23.439" style="s2">and if what we do is we surrender out of</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.160" end="00:17:25.280" style="s2">self-protection</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.439" end="00:17:27.039" style="s2">each time this happens it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.280" end="00:17:30.080" style="s2">keep happening</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.039" end="00:17:32.240" style="s2">so in any case</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.080" end="00:17:33.760" style="s2">i would ask him maybe reinstate his</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.240" end="00:17:37.520" style="s2">account and let</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.760" end="00:17:40.640" style="s2">whatever has happened there um remind us</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.520" end="00:17:42.320" style="s2">of the fact that there is no bottom</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.640" end="00:17:43.760" style="s2">when it comes to the stupidity these</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.320" end="00:17:46.960" style="s2">people are willing to deploy</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.760" end="00:17:50.080" style="s2">yep that&#39;s right okay</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:51.679" style="s2">um totally here for sp i&#39;m totally here</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.080" end="00:17:56.320" style="s2">for speciation discussion</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.679" end="00:17:57.679" style="s2">dive in please the speciation discussion</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.320" end="00:17:59.840" style="s2">i did not know we were going to have a</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.679" end="00:18:00.320" style="s2">speciation i didn&#39;t either and i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.840" end="00:18:01.919" style="s2">sure</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.320" end="00:18:03.679" style="s2">so i mean that&#39;s it&#39;s a little hard to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.919" end="00:18:05.120" style="s2">do from</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.679" end="00:18:07.200" style="s2">zero i suppose you know we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.120" end="00:18:09.679" style="s2">any context specifically</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.200" end="00:18:10.480" style="s2">well we you know there&#39;s speciation</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.679" end="00:18:12.160" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.480" end="00:18:13.760" style="s2">is a large topic but there&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.160" end="00:18:14.400" style="s2">question of species concepts and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.760" end="00:18:16.559" style="s2">know if</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.400" end="00:18:17.679" style="s2">speciation is what uh he wants to hear</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.559" end="00:18:20.320" style="s2">us riff on a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.679" end="00:18:21.120" style="s2">yeah um so i&#39;m trying to figure out in</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.320" end="00:18:23.760" style="s2">real time</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.120" end="00:18:25.200" style="s2">how to um deliver some chunk that will</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.760" end="00:18:29.200" style="s2">be satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.200" end="00:18:34.080" style="s2">um in my opinion the speciation question</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.200" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">is one that we have failed to answer</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.080" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">because we bought into some wrong</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">early on in the discussion and um</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:45.280" style="s2">that it&#39;s solvable but like with so many</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:47.360" style="s2">of these things</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.280" end="00:18:48.960" style="s2">solving it requires questioning the</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.360" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">assumptions rather than trying to take</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.960" end="00:18:50.960" style="s2">the assumptions and just answer the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:54.080" style="s2">puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.960" end="00:18:57.360" style="s2">even though it doesn&#39;t resolve and so um</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.080" end="00:18:59.120" style="s2">the the basic problem is this we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.360" end="00:19:01.360" style="s2">different modes of speciation we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.120" end="00:19:02.000" style="s2">what we call allopatric speciation which</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.360" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">means</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.000" end="00:19:06.000" style="s2">speciation in different places and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:08.799" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.000" end="00:19:10.320" style="s2">sympatric speciation which means a</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.799" end="00:19:12.080" style="s2">population that is</p>
<p begin="00:19:10.320" end="00:19:13.600" style="s2">in the same location turning into two</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.080" end="00:19:15.919" style="s2">different species and</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.600" end="00:19:17.520" style="s2">allopatric speciation we know happens</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.919" end="00:19:19.200" style="s2">right it definitely happens as a matter</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.520" end="00:19:21.760" style="s2">of fact all you have to do is separate</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.200" end="00:19:23.520" style="s2">two populations for a long enough period</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.760" end="00:19:25.200" style="s2">of time and even just the accumulation</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.520" end="00:19:27.039" style="s2">of random changes will eventually make</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.200" end="00:19:29.120" style="s2">them unrecognizable to each other</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.039" end="00:19:31.200" style="s2">at first behaviorally if they&#39;re animals</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.120" end="00:19:33.679" style="s2">and secondly molecularly if</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.200" end="00:19:35.679" style="s2">they&#39;re not a river course diverts and a</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.679" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">population of 100</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.679" end="00:19:39.600" style="s2">ungulates now has 80 on one side of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.760" style="s2">river and 20 on the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.600" end="00:19:42.799" style="s2">and if they don&#39;t if they can&#39;t swim if</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.760" end="00:19:44.400" style="s2">they don&#39;t swim they don&#39;t cross the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.799" end="00:19:46.160" style="s2">river they will diverge over time that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.400" end="00:19:47.679" style="s2">allopatric species if those populations</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.160" end="00:19:48.160" style="s2">are too small they&#39;ll go extinct both of</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.679" end="00:19:51.760" style="s2">them but</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.160" end="00:19:52.240" style="s2">um but if we scale it up same same thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.760" end="00:19:54.720" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.240" end="00:19:55.360" style="s2">the problem with sympatric speciation is</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.720" end="00:19:57.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.360" end="00:20:01.200" style="s2">um it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not easy to imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.760" end="00:20:03.600" style="s2">how it occurs because the amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.200" end="00:20:05.120" style="s2">gene flow between two populations that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.600" end="00:20:08.000" style="s2">has to occur to prevent</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.120" end="00:20:10.159" style="s2">divergence is tiny we know this for sure</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.000" end="00:20:12.159" style="s2">now that&#39;s pending certain assumptions</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.159" end="00:20:14.400" style="s2">but the basic point is if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.159" end="00:20:16.960" style="s2">something like the amazon</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.400" end="00:20:19.120" style="s2">you&#39;ve got evidence of a huge amount of</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.960" end="00:20:21.840" style="s2">speciation it&#39;s the most specious</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.120" end="00:20:23.280" style="s2">place on earth but you have very few</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.840" end="00:20:25.919" style="s2">borders that would actually</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.280" end="00:20:26.640" style="s2">constitute an obstacle to a creature</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.919" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">crossing</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.640" end="00:20:29.679" style="s2">so if you think about the amazon the</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:32.640" style="s2">amazon is not</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.679" end="00:20:34.640" style="s2">mountainous it does have lots of rivers</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.640" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">and things in it but the most specious</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.640" end="00:20:37.679" style="s2">things there are insects that fly</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.720" style="s2">they&#39;re beetles</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.679" end="00:20:43.679" style="s2">so why the heck are these tiny little</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.720" end="00:20:44.720" style="s2">rivulets creating species divisions</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.679" end="00:20:46.960" style="s2">between</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.720" end="00:20:48.000" style="s2">populations of beetles well and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.960" end="00:20:50.640" style="s2">of course a question</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.000" end="00:20:52.320" style="s2">of um you know at what scale are you</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.640" end="00:20:54.159" style="s2">counting it as simpatric versus</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.320" end="00:20:56.159" style="s2">allopatric and i think this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.159" end="00:20:57.840" style="s2">part of maybe where you&#39;re going that</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.159" end="00:20:59.919" style="s2">you know when we think on the scale of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.840" end="00:21:01.600" style="s2">mountains and rivers and such dividing</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.919" end="00:21:02.880" style="s2">species and those being our indicators</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.600" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">of allopatry</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.880" end="00:21:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s both really easy to imagine because</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly the scale that we live at</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.280" end="00:21:10.799" style="s2">but it probably is not the scale at</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:13.760" style="s2">which most of these things happen</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.799" end="00:21:14.559" style="s2">and so you get niche partitioning within</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.760" end="00:21:16.240" style="s2">a space</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.559" end="00:21:18.480" style="s2">where you know you might have say</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.240" end="00:21:19.440" style="s2">insects wood borers on a tree some of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.480" end="00:21:21.039" style="s2">which are boring</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.440" end="00:21:23.280" style="s2">closer to the ground and some of which</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.039" end="00:21:24.320" style="s2">up high um because the</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.280" end="00:21:25.679" style="s2">you know the stuff that they&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.320" end="00:21:26.400" style="s2">from the tree is actually differently</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.679" end="00:21:28.000" style="s2">accessible</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.400" end="00:21:29.520" style="s2">um you know when the tree is you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.000" end="00:21:30.240" style="s2">very thick at the bottom versus high at</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.520" end="00:21:31.280" style="s2">the top</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.240" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">and so you get these insects</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.280" end="00:21:36.480" style="s2">specializing within a single</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:39.039" style="s2">place on the earth and yet they are</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.480" end="00:21:40.480" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re niche partitioning some</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.039" end="00:21:42.480" style="s2">of these insects become ones that</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.480" end="00:21:43.280" style="s2">specialize on lower some on higher parts</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.480" end="00:21:44.640" style="s2">of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.280" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a kind of allopatry if you think</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.640" end="00:21:48.080" style="s2">about it the right spatial scale same</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:50.000" style="s2">thing with the cichlids in the african</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.080" end="00:21:51.840" style="s2">rift lakes right you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.000" end="00:21:53.360" style="s2">gosh i think it&#39;s hundreds of species of</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.840" end="00:21:56.640" style="s2">these fish</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.360" end="00:21:58.960" style="s2">that have speciated within in some cases</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.640" end="00:22:00.320" style="s2">like feet of each other but they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.960" end="00:22:01.919" style="s2">doing different things they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.320" end="00:22:03.840" style="s2">different use of the resources</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.919" end="00:22:05.200" style="s2">um i don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.840" end="00:22:08.320" style="s2">with the african cichlids</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.200" end="00:22:10.880" style="s2">it is in some cases um</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.320" end="00:22:12.640" style="s2">well i i remain to be convinced that</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.880" end="00:22:14.480" style="s2">that can happen on that scale</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.640" end="00:22:16.320" style="s2">in an aquatic environment without</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:19.360" style="s2">something else like fluctuating</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.320" end="00:22:20.799" style="s2">water levels but um certainly there are</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.360" end="00:22:21.360" style="s2">also fluctuating water levels that</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.799" end="00:22:23.200" style="s2">explain</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.360" end="00:22:25.039" style="s2">a lot of the speciation at least i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.200" end="00:22:27.360" style="s2">two of the three lakes the african rift</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.039" end="00:22:30.320" style="s2">lakes and africa i&#39;d have to go back and</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.360" end="00:22:32.320" style="s2">look to remind myself um and you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.320" end="00:22:34.240" style="s2">your point about niche partitioning</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.320" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">is right in principle this can work it</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.240" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">has to be really the problem</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">that so this is going to get so tangled</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">the problem is fisher</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:48.400" style="s2">gave us robust math that shows</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">just how little leakage between</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.400" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">populations you need to keep two</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:54.400" style="s2">populations that are</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:55.679" style="s2">initially alike from diverging and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.400" end="00:22:58.799" style="s2">almost nothing</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.679" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">but this is with respect to neutral</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.799" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">genes</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:02.880" style="s2">yeah and the frequencies have to start</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:04.559" style="s2">out alike</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.880" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">so anyway there are some some built-in</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.559" end="00:23:09.760" style="s2">assumptions there but</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:10.880" style="s2">um but this isn&#39;t really where the</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.760" end="00:23:14.080" style="s2">problem is</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.880" end="00:23:14.960" style="s2">um oh i did want to say my advisor dick</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.080" end="00:23:17.520" style="s2">alexander</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.960" end="00:23:19.280" style="s2">did create a model for what he called</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.520" end="00:23:20.320" style="s2">allocronic speciation</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.280" end="00:23:21.919" style="s2">which is a little bit like niche</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.320" end="00:23:23.600" style="s2">partitioning in fact it is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.919" end="00:23:25.440" style="s2">niche partitioning but basically what it</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.600" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">had was species that are overlapping in</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.440" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">space</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:29.360" style="s2">that breed at different times which</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:31.200" style="s2">keeps them from</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.360" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">interbreeding well and you can also i</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.200" end="00:23:34.080" style="s2">mean that also would work at the</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:36.080" style="s2">circadian level so you could have</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">breeding at different times of the year</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.080" end="00:23:39.440" style="s2">you&#39;d also have activity levels being</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:41.039" style="s2">diurnal versus crepuscular versus</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.440" end="00:23:41.360" style="s2">nocturnal and we see all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.039" end="00:23:43.919" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.360" end="00:23:46.640" style="s2">but again the problem with all of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.919" end="00:23:48.240" style="s2">is that a little leakage is too much</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.640" end="00:23:51.200" style="s2">leakage between populations is too much</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.240" end="00:23:53.120" style="s2">and it&#39;s very hard to get zero</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.200" end="00:23:54.320" style="s2">so i think there&#39;s a whole other way of</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.120" end="00:23:56.159" style="s2">solving this puzzle</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.320" end="00:23:58.720" style="s2">and this is the wrong place to do it but</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.159" end="00:24:00.400" style="s2">i will say peripatric speciation is</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.720" end="00:24:01.440" style="s2">going to be the answer and at some other</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.400" end="00:24:03.600" style="s2">point i&#39;ll deploy</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.440" end="00:24:05.200" style="s2">the mechanism by which it works but</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.600" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">allopatric speciation has two</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.200" end="00:24:08.240" style="s2">populations that are</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.320" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">isolated from each other and simpatric</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.240" end="00:24:12.559" style="s2">speciation is two populations</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.080" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">that are in the same place parapatric is</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.559" end="00:24:16.000" style="s2">neighboring populations like two</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">countries that share a border</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.000" end="00:24:21.919" style="s2">and um it is possible to explain things</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">like the amazon through parapatric</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.919" end="00:24:24.400" style="s2">speciation</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:27.039" style="s2">if you have a mechanism that keeps</p>
<p begin="00:24:24.400" end="00:24:30.159" style="s2">things from sexually crossing the border</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.039" end="00:24:32.400" style="s2">which we do um</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.159" end="00:24:34.400" style="s2">so anyway a little tease at the end yep</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.400" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.400" end="00:24:38.000" style="s2">yeah uh everyone in the chat is saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:42.000" style="s2">they would prefer the camera</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.000" end="00:24:44.880" style="s2">to this webcam so do it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:46.159" style="s2">okay so all right yep sorry about the</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.880" end="00:24:47.120" style="s2">glitchiness we don&#39;t it looks more</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.159" end="00:24:50.720" style="s2">normal from our end</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.120" end="00:24:51.600" style="s2">yep um okay from an evolutionary point</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.720" end="00:24:53.039" style="s2">of view</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.600" end="00:24:54.400" style="s2">how come we&#39;re able to consume high</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.039" end="00:24:55.360" style="s2">temperature foods and liquids without</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.400" end="00:24:56.880" style="s2">much problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.360" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">does hot food occur naturally does it</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.880" end="00:24:59.440" style="s2">come from a relationship with fire and</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:01.440" style="s2">cooked food</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.440" end="00:25:02.480" style="s2">if so do other species have more trouble</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.440" end="00:25:05.120" style="s2">consuming hot</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.480" end="00:25:06.400" style="s2">stuff it&#39;s a great question that is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.120" end="00:25:09.760" style="s2">great question</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.400" end="00:25:12.240" style="s2">um um okay yeah</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.760" end="00:25:12.880" style="s2">so i mean i guess you know very fresh</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.240" end="00:25:16.240" style="s2">meat</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.880" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">um is is warm um it&#39;s you know it&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.240" end="00:25:20.640" style="s2">temperature obviously</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:23.200" style="s2">yeah uh but it cools off quickly</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.640" end="00:25:23.919" style="s2">and body temperature is body temperature</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.200" end="00:25:25.600" style="s2">it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.919" end="00:25:27.440" style="s2">you know a small number of degrees so</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.600" end="00:25:31.200" style="s2">that ought not cause us a problem</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.440" end="00:25:33.360" style="s2">yeah um so you know does anyone else eat</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.200" end="00:25:35.360" style="s2">anything that&#39;s warmer than body</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.360" end="00:25:37.039" style="s2">temperature</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.360" end="00:25:39.039" style="s2">um you know undoubtedly there are going</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.039" end="00:25:42.480" style="s2">to be examples of</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.039" end="00:25:45.760" style="s2">things that get you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.480" end="00:25:48.720" style="s2">sit in the sun and baked in a</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.760" end="00:25:49.600" style="s2">shell and sit on a hot surface on a rock</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.720" end="00:25:50.720" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.600" end="00:25:53.039" style="s2">but it&#39;s going to be pretty in general</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.720" end="00:25:54.480" style="s2">not pretty rare also most creatures are</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.039" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">small and that means the things they eat</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.480" end="00:25:58.320" style="s2">are small which means that the rate at</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:01.520" style="s2">which they dissipate heat is large</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.320" end="00:26:03.840" style="s2">or as high but i would say look</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.520" end="00:26:05.919" style="s2">a long history of eating things from a</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.840" end="00:26:09.840" style="s2">fire is going to result in selection</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.919" end="00:26:11.200" style="s2">for resistance to being burned by hot</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.840" end="00:26:14.559" style="s2">food</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.200" end="00:26:15.520" style="s2">we are aided in this by virtue of being</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.559" end="00:26:17.440" style="s2">so thoroughly</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.520" end="00:26:19.120" style="s2">made of water because water has an</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.440" end="00:26:21.120" style="s2">incredibly high specific heat</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.120" end="00:26:22.320" style="s2">and that means it takes a lot of energy</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.120" end="00:26:26.080" style="s2">to um</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.320" end="00:26:28.720" style="s2">to raise the temperature of water and so</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.080" end="00:26:30.720" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know there&#39;s a already a</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.720" end="00:26:32.080" style="s2">built-in kind of safety because we are</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.720" end="00:26:33.600" style="s2">made of water the same thing allows you</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.080" end="00:26:35.039" style="s2">to walk over hot coals even though</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.600" end="00:26:36.000" style="s2">that&#39;s not something your ancestor would</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.039" end="00:26:38.799" style="s2">have done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.000" end="00:26:39.360" style="s2">if you don&#39;t linger too long the coals</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.799" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">are very</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.360" end="00:26:43.200" style="s2">hot but they&#39;re not as full of energy as</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:45.919" style="s2">you would imagine</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.200" end="00:26:47.520" style="s2">and you can do it so being made of water</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.919" end="00:26:50.960" style="s2">provides advantages</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.520" end="00:26:54.320" style="s2">um the fact that you&#39;re interacting with</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.960" end="00:26:57.360" style="s2">the hot food at a wet surface</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.320" end="00:26:58.640" style="s2">also provides an advantage because what</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.360" end="00:26:59.919" style="s2">service being your tongue and the inside</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.640" end="00:27:01.279" style="s2">of your mouth</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.919" end="00:27:03.120" style="s2">you know so in the same way that you</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.279" end="00:27:05.840" style="s2">might burn your finger</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.120" end="00:27:07.200" style="s2">if you touch the surface of a hot pan</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.840" end="00:27:09.360" style="s2">but if you licked your finger</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.200" end="00:27:10.960" style="s2">and you touch the surface you&#39;ll boil</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.360" end="00:27:12.240" style="s2">off the water and that will give you</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.960" end="00:27:13.120" style="s2">time to get away before you harm</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.240" end="00:27:16.799" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.120" end="00:27:18.159" style="s2">that sort of thing uh but anyway yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.799" end="00:27:19.440" style="s2">would say selection will have help and</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.159" end="00:27:20.080" style="s2">what would i expect that selection to</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.440" end="00:27:23.520" style="s2">have been</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.080" end="00:27:26.880" style="s2">i would expect increased circulation</p>

<p begin="00:27:28.320" end="00:27:33.600" style="s2">hot food so the prediction is greater</p>

<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:50.080" style="s2">learning a what foods if you put them in</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.600" end="00:27:52.240" style="s2">your mouth they&#39;re way too freaking hot</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.080" end="00:27:53.279" style="s2">and so learning to blow on them learning</p>

<p begin="00:27:59.679" end="00:28:03.039" style="s2">if you do put something that&#39;s too hot</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.880" end="00:28:05.679" style="s2">in your mouth or a whole you know the</p>

<p begin="00:28:09.200" end="00:28:11.679" style="s2">up somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:13.600" style="s2">right now you may have learned it from</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.679" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">having burned you know gotten pizza</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.600" end="00:28:16.240" style="s2">mouth and</p>

<p begin="00:28:16.240" end="00:28:20.000" style="s2">that from happening it gets really</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.000" end="00:28:21.679" style="s2">important anyone out there who&#39;s gotten</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.000" end="00:28:23.039" style="s2">pizza mouth once and only once</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.679" end="00:28:25.360" style="s2">i mean like that&#39;s actually one that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.039" end="00:28:27.919" style="s2">seems to be hard to learn perfectly from</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.360" end="00:28:30.480" style="s2">somehow it&#39;s either testament to our</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.919" end="00:28:32.399" style="s2">stupidity or just how very good pizza is</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.480" end="00:28:34.159" style="s2">it is very good i mean it&#39;s also it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.399" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">not just good but it&#39;s geometrically</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.159" end="00:28:37.120" style="s2">interesting ah that&#39;s true because you</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s a triangle till you get to</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.120" end="00:28:39.760" style="s2">the crust and then you&#39;ve got this arc</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:42.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s like one</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.760" end="00:28:44.320" style="s2">different yeah hey zach yeah would you</p>

<p begin="00:28:55.120" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">university</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.480" end="00:28:59.120" style="s2">one month then she informed me that we</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.919" end="00:29:00.559" style="s2">could only be together short-term</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.120" end="00:29:02.159" style="s2">because she wanted children</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.559" end="00:29:03.919" style="s2">and under no circumstances would she</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.159" end="00:29:06.720" style="s2">have an all-white child</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.919" end="00:29:09.200" style="s2">oh my god was this learned and can it be</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.720" end="00:29:12.080" style="s2">unlearned</p>

<p begin="00:29:32.000" end="00:29:35.200" style="s2">learned</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.600" end="00:29:37.760" style="s2">that kind of stupidity doesn&#39;t exist in</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.200" end="00:29:41.039" style="s2">nature no one&#39;s born that dumb</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.760" end="00:29:42.559" style="s2">yeah um oh look who&#39;s back um</p>

<p begin="00:29:44.559" end="00:29:47.440" style="s2">unlearned</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.279" end="00:29:49.279" style="s2">yes but it&#39;s gonna require some some</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.440" end="00:29:50.640" style="s2">active unlearning and frankly it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.279" end="00:29:52.240" style="s2">your responsibility to teacher</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.640" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">yeah although more effective than</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.240" end="00:29:58.399" style="s2">unlearning is just let selection</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:30:00.640" style="s2">take care of this one i i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.399" end="00:30:02.799" style="s2">this level of stupidity is not</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.640" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">consistent with um</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.799" end="00:30:06.159" style="s2">feeding themselves and uh they will get</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">what they deserve</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.159" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">you&#39;re forgetting about success between</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:09.760" style="s2">men and women we will get what they</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:11.520" style="s2">deserve</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.760" end="00:30:12.799" style="s2">but yeah you&#39;re right but differential</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.520" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">reproductive success</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.799" end="00:30:17.200" style="s2">being what it is she&#39;s likely to find</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">someone no matter what</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.200" end="00:30:22.960" style="s2">yes yes that is true yeah okay judging</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:24.799" style="s2">by andy no there are about five</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.960" end="00:30:26.320" style="s2">protesters quote unquote arrested and</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.799" end="00:30:28.799" style="s2">released in portland per day</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.320" end="00:30:30.240" style="s2">with varying serious charges will there</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.799" end="00:30:31.279" style="s2">be a surge of convictions in the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.240" end="00:30:34.399" style="s2">two to five years</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.279" end="00:30:36.640" style="s2">what do you think will happen um</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.399" end="00:30:37.919" style="s2">well as i unders i&#39;ve admit that since</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.640" end="00:30:39.760" style="s2">the fires have happened i haven&#39;t been</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.919" end="00:30:43.120" style="s2">paying as much attention but um</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.760" end="00:30:45.760" style="s2">i understood that the d.a had said maybe</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.120" end="00:30:46.799" style="s2">maybe with help from other authorities</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.760" end="00:30:47.520" style="s2">uh that he was not going to be</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.799" end="00:30:49.120" style="s2">convicting</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.520" end="00:30:50.799" style="s2">any of the people arrested associated</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.120" end="00:30:53.440" style="s2">with the protests and the riots</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.799" end="00:30:54.799" style="s2">in portland which is in a totally insane</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.440" end="00:30:56.640" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.799" end="00:30:57.840" style="s2">but that is that is what i where i</p>

<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:05.519" style="s2">yeah yeah i am prone to ranting go for</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.120" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.519" end="00:31:08.960" style="s2">no i think it&#39;s probably best that i</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:12.159" style="s2">don&#39;t but okay um</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.960" end="00:31:13.440" style="s2">i i can&#39;t imagine you know we were just</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.159" end="00:31:15.519" style="s2">talking about people</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.440" end="00:31:17.600" style="s2">too dumb to reproduce and this strikes</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.519" end="00:31:20.240" style="s2">me as the same level of dumb</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.600" end="00:31:22.240" style="s2">where somehow you think civilization</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.240" end="00:31:23.840" style="s2">continues even though you advertise</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.240" end="00:31:25.440" style="s2">to the world at large that there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.840" end="00:31:26.799" style="s2">certain rules they are allowed to break</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.440" end="00:31:27.519" style="s2">as long as they do so under certain</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.799" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">banners</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.519" end="00:31:30.159" style="s2">and those are some good rules they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:31.360" style="s2">being allowed to break too like don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.159" end="00:31:33.039" style="s2">set fire to people</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.360" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">and things that might have people in</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.039" end="00:31:36.640" style="s2">them right those are really good rules</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:38.399" style="s2">there it&#39;s really essential that we just</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.640" end="00:31:39.919" style="s2">not be flexible about those rules and</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.399" end="00:31:40.559" style="s2">yet we&#39;re being flexible about those</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.919" end="00:31:44.080" style="s2">rules</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.559" end="00:31:46.799" style="s2">um and anyway see earlier discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.080" end="00:31:48.559" style="s2">why people who don&#39;t like donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.799" end="00:31:53.039" style="s2">may end up voting for him because</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.559" end="00:31:55.519" style="s2">this is just madness yep yeah to your</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.039" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">prediction from one or two live streams</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.519" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">ago the man&#39;s gonna win in a landslide</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.399" end="00:32:01.519" style="s2">yeah which is something we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">talking about for a few weeks now</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.519" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">yeah privately but i just i</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:11.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t see how any other outcome is</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">remotely possible at this point</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.200" end="00:32:18.480" style="s2">um i hope well i hope for unity</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:20.880" style="s2">unity to unity yeah</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.480" end="00:32:21.519" style="s2">the popcorn fallacy start with a kernel</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.880" end="00:32:23.840" style="s2">of truth</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.519" end="00:32:25.200" style="s2">add heat ideological spin raise the</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.840" end="00:32:25.600" style="s2">temperature until it undergoes a phase</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.200" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2">shift</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.600" end="00:32:29.039" style="s2">pops so the kernel is no longer hard</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">reliable shelf stable etc</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.039" end="00:32:32.640" style="s2">popped kernels aren&#39;t true</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.080" end="00:32:37.120" style="s2">okay so the idea is yeah it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.559" end="00:32:39.919" style="s2">true but</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.120" end="00:32:41.200" style="s2">the phase shift um turns it into</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.919" end="00:32:42.880" style="s2">something else</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.200" end="00:32:44.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s still you know you can point to</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.880" end="00:32:47.120" style="s2">it and say that&#39;s the same thing it just</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.640" end="00:32:48.320" style="s2">it just looks different but um actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.120" end="00:32:50.159" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.320" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">uh fundamental structural changes happen</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.159" end="00:32:54.720" style="s2">which is lost from any of its virtues</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:56.159" style="s2">yes and at the place that you end the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.720" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">thought experiment it has lost those</p>

<p begin="00:33:38.159" end="00:33:44.480" style="s2">um yeah this is an incredibly</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.480" end="00:33:46.240" style="s2">difficult and important question</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.480" end="00:33:50.480" style="s2">myers-briggs okay um</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.240" end="00:33:53.919" style="s2">blm apologism is a</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.480" end="00:33:56.720" style="s2">destructive instinct that is endangering</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.919" end="00:33:57.440" style="s2">everything and unfortunately the only</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.720" end="00:34:00.559" style="s2">thing</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.440" end="00:34:01.519" style="s2">that there is to do seems to be to talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.559" end="00:34:04.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.519" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">what is actually hidden inside of things</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.960" end="00:34:10.480" style="s2">labeled with that very simple intuitive</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:12.079" style="s2">um and appealing idea i mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.480" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">that&#39;s been the thing that we&#39;ve begun</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.079" end="00:34:18.159" style="s2">to to say most it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.839" end="00:34:19.679" style="s2">reveal to whoever you&#39;re talking to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.159" end="00:34:20.800" style="s2">just because it has the nice sounding</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.679" end="00:34:22.159" style="s2">name doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.800" end="00:34:26.000" style="s2">actually is</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.159" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">yeah you know antifa is not anti-fascist</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.000" end="00:34:31.040" style="s2">anti-racism is actually racist</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:33.280" style="s2">black lives matter does not appear to</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.040" end="00:34:34.800" style="s2">care about many black lives</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.280" end="00:34:35.919" style="s2">despite having a name that would suggest</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.800" end="00:34:36.960" style="s2">that that was exactly what it cared</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.919" end="00:34:40.720" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.960" end="00:34:42.639" style="s2">the so in order to reach everybody and</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.720" end="00:34:43.200" style="s2">maybe even the most important people to</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.639" end="00:34:45.440" style="s2">reach</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.200" end="00:34:46.720" style="s2">in this case you also need the other</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.440" end="00:34:49.359" style="s2">side which is</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.720" end="00:34:50.159" style="s2">the patriot act wasn&#39;t patriotic</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.359" end="00:34:52.560" style="s2">everybody</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.159" end="00:34:54.480" style="s2">understands that all of the people who</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.560" end="00:34:56.399" style="s2">are somehow blinded by the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.480" end="00:34:59.359" style="s2">anti-racism must be</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.399" end="00:35:00.960" style="s2">the right thing now the example i use</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.359" end="00:35:04.000" style="s2">here is pro-life</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.960" end="00:35:05.520" style="s2">isn&#39;t particularly pro-life for for for</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.000" end="00:35:06.400" style="s2">most of our perspectives over on the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.520" end="00:35:09.599" style="s2">left</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.400" end="00:35:12.240" style="s2">um patriot act is more in keeping uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.599" end="00:35:13.599" style="s2">because it&#39;s a political move yeah but</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.240" end="00:35:15.680" style="s2">it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.599" end="00:35:16.960" style="s2">as old as the hills that you would name</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.680" end="00:35:18.880" style="s2">something in a way that makes it</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.960" end="00:35:20.880" style="s2">difficult for people to say no to it</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.880" end="00:35:22.560" style="s2">but at some level at the level that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.880" end="00:35:24.240" style="s2">know if you&#39;re being manipulated by</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.560" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">people mislabeling things so that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.240" end="00:35:27.520" style="s2">can&#39;t say no</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.960" style="s2">then at some point you have to say no i</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.520" end="00:35:30.079" style="s2">mean at some point like right away as</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.960" end="00:35:31.280" style="s2">soon as you figure out that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.079" end="00:35:33.119" style="s2">they&#39;re doing you have to say no</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.280" end="00:35:34.640" style="s2">yeah so what do we think about</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.119" end="00:35:37.920" style="s2">myers-briggs</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.640" end="00:35:39.520" style="s2">um well i guess i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.920" end="00:35:41.599" style="s2">confused by what the quest is just</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.520" end="00:35:44.560" style="s2">general yeah your thoughts um</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.599" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">you know so i was not compelled by</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.560" end="00:35:47.839" style="s2">myers-briggs at all when i heard about</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:50.000" style="s2">it the first time</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.839" end="00:35:51.520" style="s2">and i was asked by a psychologist that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.000" end="00:35:54.400" style="s2">was teaching with guy i quite</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.520" end="00:35:56.640" style="s2">quite like um to take it and just see</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:59.440" style="s2">what it said</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.640" end="00:36:00.480" style="s2">and so i took it and i grumbled through</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.440" end="00:36:02.880" style="s2">the entire</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.480" end="00:36:04.320" style="s2">exercise of taking this thing at the way</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.880" end="00:36:06.320" style="s2">these questions</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.320" end="00:36:08.400" style="s2">were phrased in such a way that i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.320" end="00:36:10.320" style="s2">think the right answer was presented and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.400" end="00:36:11.760" style="s2">so i couldn&#39;t very well</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.320" end="00:36:13.359" style="s2">give the right answer and therefore i</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.760" end="00:36:15.119" style="s2">was forced to pick an answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.359" end="00:36:16.480" style="s2">that i didn&#39;t much like and then i got</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.119" end="00:36:19.440" style="s2">my diagnosis</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.480" end="00:36:20.240" style="s2">and it basically in telling a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.440" end="00:36:22.800" style="s2">things that</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.240" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">matched my life pretty well described my</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.800" end="00:36:24.800" style="s2">annoyance at the test i had just been</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.800" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">oh they&#39;re all going to guess yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:29.280" style="s2">don&#39;t tell them yet let them guess no</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:32.960" style="s2">they&#39;ll figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.280" end="00:36:34.720" style="s2">um so he then uh your faculty colleague</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.960" end="00:36:35.599" style="s2">also had all of your students do it yep</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.720" end="00:36:37.200" style="s2">right and then you had</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.599" end="00:36:38.480" style="s2">you did some seminars i believe around</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.200" end="00:36:39.040" style="s2">like you talked about some of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.480" end="00:36:41.280" style="s2">results</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.040" end="00:36:43.040" style="s2">and you know said that way if i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.280" end="00:36:44.079" style="s2">know you i could say you know it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.040" end="00:36:46.000" style="s2">like you&#39;re talking about a</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.079" end="00:36:47.599" style="s2">horoscope right like doesn&#39;t everyone</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.000" end="00:36:50.000" style="s2">find what they want to find</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.599" end="00:36:51.280" style="s2">in a horoscope yeah but in this case</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.000" end="00:36:53.760" style="s2">description</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.280" end="00:36:54.560" style="s2">was stuff like my fraught relationship</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.760" end="00:36:58.079" style="s2">with my</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.560" end="00:36:59.680" style="s2">phd uh process and all these it was too</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.079" end="00:37:01.760" style="s2">specific to be that i mean i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.680" end="00:37:02.960" style="s2">very sensitive to the idea in fact i</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.760" end="00:37:06.320" style="s2">love the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.960" end="00:37:08.320" style="s2">predicting really off-the-cuff stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.320" end="00:37:09.599" style="s2">you know in the off chance that it turns</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.320" end="00:37:11.119" style="s2">out right then</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.599" end="00:37:12.640" style="s2">you know it looks like you have insight</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.119" end="00:37:14.560" style="s2">and so you know it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.640" end="00:37:15.760" style="s2">the kind of thing i would do but it is</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.560" end="00:37:18.079" style="s2">the kind of thing that i</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.760" end="00:37:18.880" style="s2">uh i understand how it works but in this</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.079" end="00:37:22.079" style="s2">case</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.880" end="00:37:25.200" style="s2">the diagnosis was spot on for me yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.079" end="00:37:27.040" style="s2">that said i have</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.200" end="00:37:28.240" style="s2">given it to others and i mean there are</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.040" end="00:37:30.240" style="s2">16 types</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.240" end="00:37:31.440" style="s2">right um and i think there may be like</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.240" end="00:37:33.359" style="s2">subtypes now but like</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.440" end="00:37:35.440" style="s2">there&#39;s 16 types because there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.359" end="00:37:37.119" style="s2">four binary indicators so 16 possible</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.440" end="00:37:39.280" style="s2">combinations and</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.119" end="00:37:41.200" style="s2">um i don&#39;t remember what the ratios are</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.280" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">but there are you know a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.200" end="00:37:44.800" style="s2">these personality types that are like oh</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:45.520" style="s2">that&#39;s like 25 of the population or</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.800" end="00:37:48.640" style="s2">something so</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.520" end="00:37:49.359" style="s2">presumably for those that diagnosis is</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.640" end="00:37:52.000" style="s2">going to be far</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.359" end="00:37:53.280" style="s2">less predictive of who these people are</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.000" end="00:37:54.800" style="s2">but for those of us</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.280" end="00:37:56.400" style="s2">who the result is like oh you&#39;re less</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.800" end="00:37:57.200" style="s2">than one percent of the population is</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.400" end="00:37:58.960" style="s2">you know and</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.200" end="00:38:00.240" style="s2">me you and i don&#39;t show up as the same</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.960" end="00:38:01.839" style="s2">thing but both of us have some of these</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.240" end="00:38:04.960" style="s2">you know very rare</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.839" end="00:38:06.960" style="s2">um myers-briggs types um</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.960" end="00:38:09.040" style="s2">it is more likely to say something</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.960" end="00:38:10.400" style="s2">interesting if there&#39;s some fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.040" end="00:38:12.560" style="s2">accuracy at base</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.400" end="00:38:13.760" style="s2">right right now what i will say is that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.560" end="00:38:16.160" style="s2">i</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.760" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">when i was surprised by how closely it</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.160" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">had matched my experience</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:21.680" style="s2">i gave it to others who did not have</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:24.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.680" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">experience and i know that people i</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.160" end="00:38:28.960" style="s2">respect look at it and they say</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:30.400" style="s2">um it you know it&#39;s nonsense and yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.960" end="00:38:31.839" style="s2">i think psychologists are split</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.400" end="00:38:34.000" style="s2">right so good good psychology</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.839" end="00:38:35.680" style="s2">psychologists whom we respect</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.000" end="00:38:37.359" style="s2">are split on this some people say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.680" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">complete crap and some people</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.359" end="00:38:41.760" style="s2">you know find it quite interesting and</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:45.119" style="s2">useful including at a clinical level</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.760" end="00:38:46.880" style="s2">uh but uh so that that suggests to me</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.119" end="00:38:49.280" style="s2">that there&#39;s likely something there</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.880" end="00:38:50.800" style="s2">it&#39;s not like all of the professionals</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.280" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">who we respect in the field understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.800" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">it to be terrible</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:55.440" style="s2">but um you know some people think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:55.760" style="s2">useful under some circumstances no like</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.440" end="00:38:58.079" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.760" end="00:38:59.200" style="s2">there&#39;s you know there&#39;s there&#39;s good</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.079" end="00:39:02.320" style="s2">professionals</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.200" end="00:39:05.440" style="s2">who think it has validity yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.320" end="00:39:08.480" style="s2">and i would say two things one it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.440" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">purpose originally myers and briggs were</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.480" end="00:39:11.119" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:13.440" style="s2">both females mother sister a mother</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.119" end="00:39:16.240" style="s2">daughter mother daughter yep</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.440" end="00:39:18.079" style="s2">and they designed this test i think it</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.240" end="00:39:20.240" style="s2">derives from something jungian</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.079" end="00:39:22.880" style="s2">i believe a less nuanced version of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.240" end="00:39:26.800" style="s2">test or fewer axes or something but</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.880" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">um the test was designed</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.800" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">to find the proper vocation for people</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">post-world war two that&#39;s actually the</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">first time i was exposed to it was</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">as i was finishing my phd and i was like</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:39.040" style="s2">huh let&#39;s just let&#39;s see i went into</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:41.119" style="s2">like career counseling university of</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.040" end="00:39:43.760" style="s2">michigan yeah they gave it to me</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.119" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">and so anyway one it&#39;s possible that it</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.760" end="00:39:47.839" style="s2">works brilliantly for that because it</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">identifies something at that level</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.839" end="00:39:51.040" style="s2">um i&#39;m not saying it does but i&#39;m saying</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:51.680" style="s2">it&#39;s plausible that it does but that</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.040" end="00:39:53.359" style="s2">when you</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.680" end="00:39:55.440" style="s2">try to drag it into another realm like</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.359" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">how are we gonna relate interpersonally</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.440" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.119" style="s2">a course or measure it&#39;s also possible</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:02.240" style="s2">let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.119" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">um that it&#39;s missing an axis</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.240" end="00:40:06.000" style="s2">yeah right so that the real number would</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:10.240" style="s2">be</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.000" end="00:40:12.480" style="s2">you know 32 types right</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.240" end="00:40:14.160" style="s2">yeah so just one more one more binary</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.480" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">right so if you have so if it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.160" end="00:40:16.640" style="s2">that there was another axis you could</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:19.760" style="s2">add that would give you</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.640" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">30 uh two</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.760" end="00:40:23.680" style="s2">bit resolution that&#39;s right that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:25.839" style="s2">maybe two to the fifth</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.680" end="00:40:27.520" style="s2">then now i know the number&#39;s right i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.839" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">just figuring out whether it means</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.520" end="00:40:32.560" style="s2">it&#39;s accurate to say bit but in any case</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">if it were true that another axis would</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.560" end="00:40:35.440" style="s2">get you high resolution</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">then what it would look like if you</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.440" end="00:40:40.560" style="s2">subtract that axis is it would look like</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">kind of hit and miss it would have</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.560" end="00:40:43.440" style="s2">validity</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:44.960" style="s2">but it would you know group people</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.440" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">together of two different types that</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.960" end="00:40:48.240" style="s2">weren&#39;t similar</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.680" style="s2">yeah and so you might get this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.240" end="00:40:51.680" style="s2">um you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.680" end="00:40:53.040" style="s2">uh division between people who&#39;d looked</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.680" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">at it and they say oh i&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.040" end="00:40:54.880" style="s2">really work and then other people will</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:56.640" style="s2">say no it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.880" end="00:40:57.920" style="s2">complete nonsense yeah you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.640" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">that kind of reactions that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.920" end="00:41:01.359" style="s2">that&#39;s a good really good point</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">who knows what what&#39;s something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.359" end="00:41:04.240" style="s2">accurate</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:05.680" style="s2">but not yet precise enough will look</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.240" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">like as a diagnostic tool</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.680" end="00:41:08.720" style="s2">yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.000" end="00:41:14.000" style="s2">i am a lapsed christian who rediscovered</p>

<p begin="00:41:33.760" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">i&#39;m a little so i&#39;ve heard two different</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.880" end="00:41:39.440" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:40.720" style="s2">i hear a certain number of people</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.440" end="00:41:44.079" style="s2">talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.720" end="00:41:45.680" style="s2">the religiosity of</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.079" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">critical race theory and all of its</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.680" end="00:41:48.079" style="s2">descendants and i hear other people</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:51.200" style="s2">talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.079" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">about wokeness moving</p>

<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:41:58.160" style="s2">and this i couldn&#39;t this actually says</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.920" end="00:42:00.880" style="s2">crt rhetoric is in religion</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.160" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">um but i think ultimately this comment</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.880" end="00:42:03.680" style="s2">is the first thing is the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:05.040" style="s2">and not the second but nonetheless this</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.680" end="00:42:06.400" style="s2">i mean you know and you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.040" end="00:42:07.839" style="s2">based on the fact that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.400" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">analogy that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.839" end="00:42:11.760" style="s2">an openness to this at a level that</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:13.520" style="s2">there shouldn&#39;t be yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.760" end="00:42:15.839" style="s2">actually just driving past churches in</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.520" end="00:42:16.880" style="s2">portland um i like a lot of the you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.839" end="00:42:18.000" style="s2">when churches that have those like</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.880" end="00:42:19.280" style="s2">placards out front where they have</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.000" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">inspirational sayings yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.280" end="00:42:22.720" style="s2">a lot of them are um pretty clearly woke</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:24.319" style="s2">at this point and</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.720" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">part of that&#39;s you know don&#39;t don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.319" end="00:42:27.520" style="s2">judge me don&#39;t hurt me signs but part of</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:29.839" style="s2">it is actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.520" end="00:42:30.800" style="s2">um them just you know feeling feeling</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.839" end="00:42:33.520" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.800" end="00:42:34.240" style="s2">as something that&#39;s actually inclusive</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.520" end="00:42:36.160" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.240" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">healing as opposed to the divisive</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.160" end="00:42:40.800" style="s2">rhetoric that it really is</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:41.359" style="s2">well critical race theory has weaponized</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.800" end="00:42:43.440" style="s2">people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.359" end="00:42:44.560" style="s2">empathy against them and to the extent</p>

<p begin="00:42:44.560" end="00:42:51.200" style="s2">churches are built around you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:53.440" style="s2">sort of cultivating empathy for</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.200" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">yeah you know for people the downtrodden</p>

<p begin="00:43:35.040" end="00:43:38.880" style="s2">in rethinking my position there are very</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.119" end="00:43:40.720" style="s2">few things in that conversation that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.880" end="00:43:42.400" style="s2">think i got wrong</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.720" end="00:43:44.319" style="s2">there are places where i think i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.400" end="00:43:45.200" style="s2">do a good job of marshalling the right</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.319" end="00:43:46.800" style="s2">argument</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.200" end="00:43:48.560" style="s2">and i would do it differently if i had</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.800" end="00:43:54.000" style="s2">it to do over</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.560" end="00:43:57.599" style="s2">but overall my sense is</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.000" end="00:44:01.119" style="s2">the free will discussion is</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.599" end="00:44:05.760" style="s2">totally polluted by</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.119" end="00:44:08.400" style="s2">a failure of precision that is to say</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.760" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">when we talk about a failure of good of</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.400" end="00:44:15.200" style="s2">a free will</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:18.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a question of are we talking about</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.200" end="00:44:20.000" style="s2">a 100 absence which leaves you in one</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.880" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">landscape or</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.000" end="00:44:24.800" style="s2">some amount which leaves you in another</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:28.720" style="s2">and some amount can be very small</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.800" end="00:44:31.520" style="s2">but that distinction between none at all</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.720" end="00:44:31.920" style="s2">in which case one set of things follows</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.520" end="00:44:34.240" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:44:31.920" end="00:44:35.440" style="s2">there is some but it&#39;s a struggle leaves</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.240" end="00:44:38.240" style="s2">you in a totally different place</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.440" end="00:44:40.000" style="s2">so i still am resolutely on the there is</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.240" end="00:44:42.880" style="s2">some but it&#39;s a struggle</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.000" end="00:44:44.560" style="s2">but i recognize the uphill battle in</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.880" end="00:44:47.440" style="s2">convincing anyone who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.560" end="00:44:49.200" style="s2">hold that position or see that as uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.440" end="00:44:52.319" style="s2">intuitively clear</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.200" end="00:44:54.960" style="s2">um convincing them that it is so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.319" end="00:44:56.560" style="s2">i think i feel like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.960" end="00:44:58.000" style="s2">that is yet to be resolved out of that</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.560" end="00:44:58.480" style="s2">conversation and i look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.000" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">getting there</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.480" end="00:45:03.280" style="s2">somehow sec how long 40 months</p>

<p begin="00:45:14.000" end="00:45:16.800" style="s2">the colombian national front was an</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.680" end="00:45:18.000" style="s2">agreement for the liberals and</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.800" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">conservatives to rotate</p>

<p begin="00:45:27.680" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">i don&#39;t know this history at all and it</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.000" end="00:45:36.000" style="s2">feels like a piece of history that</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:38.800" style="s2">we should know um i</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.000" end="00:45:39.119" style="s2">am interested to know more and actually</p>

<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:58.400" style="s2">on um this history that would be very</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.599" end="00:45:59.920" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.400" end="00:46:01.760" style="s2">to look at the history on the columbia</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.920" end="00:46:04.880" style="s2">national front yeah but i would say</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.760" end="00:46:08.480" style="s2">the word rotate there</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.880" end="00:46:11.200" style="s2">um i i spot this as a vulnerability</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.480" end="00:46:13.119" style="s2">that rotate is a bit like the chaotic as</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.200" end="00:46:17.119" style="s2">opposed to sharing</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.119" end="00:46:20.400" style="s2">yes um because</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.119" end="00:46:22.640" style="s2">you&#39;ll get when you&#39;re in power you want</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.400" end="00:46:24.000" style="s2">to move the needle as far as you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.640" end="00:46:25.440" style="s2">because you&#39;re going to lose it and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.000" end="00:46:26.800" style="s2">going to move the other way yeah and so</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.440" end="00:46:28.160" style="s2">this is sorry we&#39;ve got cat madness</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.800" end="00:46:31.599" style="s2">going on here yeah eating</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.160" end="00:46:34.880" style="s2">eating cords oh goodness um but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.599" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">so i think the thing is the system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.880" end="00:46:40.560" style="s2">design has to be really careful in order</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:44.240" style="s2">to work and um close</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.560" end="00:46:45.839" style="s2">prototype level um is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.240" end="00:46:47.440" style="s2">good enough to learn the lesson but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.839" end="00:46:47.920" style="s2">not good enough to be stable long term</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.440" end="00:46:50.400" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:52.240" style="s2">anyway yes i would say it sounds like a</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.400" end="00:46:55.359" style="s2">thematically related</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.240" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">um exercise but but i think it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.359" end="00:46:58.720" style="s2">vulnerable at its inception</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.200" end="00:47:03.520" style="s2">brett at evergreen you had the security</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:05.520" style="s2">of being sure there was no actual</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.520" end="00:47:07.520" style="s2">evidence of your racism</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.520" end="00:47:08.720" style="s2">what if there is racism in your past to</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.520" end="00:47:11.680" style="s2">be found</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.720" end="00:47:14.319" style="s2">uh a 26 year old who was a troubled 16</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.680" end="00:47:16.319" style="s2">year old would appreciate your advice</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.319" end="00:47:18.640" style="s2">such an amazing question yeah that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.319" end="00:47:21.920" style="s2">great question um</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.640" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">you know it&#39;s awkward now because</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.920" end="00:47:29.440" style="s2">if you come clean about this in some way</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">then there&#39;s always the question of</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.440" end="00:47:34.079" style="s2">whether you&#39;re doing it cynically</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:35.119" style="s2">but on the other hand everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.079" end="00:47:38.720" style="s2">understands</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.119" end="00:47:40.480" style="s2">that youth involves stupidity</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.720" end="00:47:41.920" style="s2">of many different kinds everybody used</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.480" end="00:47:43.599" style="s2">to understand that everybody used to</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.920" end="00:47:47.520" style="s2">understand it you&#39;re now being</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.599" end="00:47:49.280" style="s2">persecuted for uh failures that frankly</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.520" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">everybody has in their past</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.280" end="00:47:55.520" style="s2">and so um</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t there&#39;s not a great answer to</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.520" end="00:47:59.200" style="s2">the question i think in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">you&#39;re depending on people recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.200" end="00:48:02.960" style="s2">that they don&#39;t want to be judged based</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:06.400" style="s2">on what they were doing at 16 either</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.960" end="00:48:08.720" style="s2">and to the extent that you are up front</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.400" end="00:48:10.240" style="s2">about i&#39;m not comfortable looking at</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.720" end="00:48:12.480" style="s2">myself at 16</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.240" end="00:48:14.559" style="s2">i&#39;m not comfortable with what i see and</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.480" end="00:48:17.760" style="s2">here&#39;s you know in your case the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.559" end="00:48:21.119" style="s2">you know the uh the racial stuff that i</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.760" end="00:48:22.319" style="s2">no longer feel or believe and maybe i</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.119" end="00:48:23.599" style="s2">didn&#39;t believe it then maybe i was</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.319" end="00:48:25.200" style="s2">motivated to say it</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.599" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">for other reasons you thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.200" end="00:48:30.079" style="s2">going to be cool or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:32.640" style="s2">but you know look um</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.079" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">forgiveness and tolerance these are</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.640" end="00:48:36.960" style="s2">essential</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:39.040" style="s2">values and i will say we had a</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.960" end="00:48:41.200" style="s2">very good friend in grad school you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.040" end="00:48:44.720" style="s2">one of the people we were closest with</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.200" end="00:48:46.880" style="s2">who had experimented in high school</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.720" end="00:48:48.160" style="s2">with some of this you know white</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.880" end="00:48:50.240" style="s2">supremacist stuff</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.160" end="00:48:51.839" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure i know this you do you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.240" end="00:48:53.520" style="s2">just forgotten it because it&#39;s so out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.839" end="00:48:54.880" style="s2">character with the wonderful person that</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.520" end="00:48:58.400" style="s2">we spent all the time with</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.880" end="00:49:01.280" style="s2">oh okay so anyway the point was</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.400" end="00:49:02.559" style="s2">it was some kid yeah doing stupid stuff</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.280" end="00:49:06.000" style="s2">and you know</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.559" end="00:49:07.839" style="s2">we never once thought about holding this</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.000" end="00:49:10.240" style="s2">against this person because</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.839" end="00:49:11.359" style="s2">it just obviously was not consistent</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.240" end="00:49:14.240" style="s2">with their values</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.359" end="00:49:14.880" style="s2">and you know we have to have the ability</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.240" end="00:49:16.720" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.880" end="00:49:18.240" style="s2">to let people grow up you know i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.720" end="00:49:20.079" style="s2">this is i mean we&#39;ve written this</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.240" end="00:49:21.920" style="s2">uh in the childhood chapter of our book</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.079" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">this is this is part of</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.920" end="00:49:24.800" style="s2">this this is not something i&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:26.400" style="s2">elsewhere but this is part of the reason</p>
<p begin="00:49:24.800" end="00:49:28.160" style="s2">that the screens and the social media</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.400" end="00:49:31.040" style="s2">are so dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.160" end="00:49:32.240" style="s2">is that it immoral in it memorializes</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.040" end="00:49:34.880" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.240" end="00:49:36.559" style="s2">all of the mistakes of youth and youth</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.880" end="00:49:38.319" style="s2">and development are exactly the time</p>

<p begin="00:49:55.599" end="00:49:58.000" style="s2">makes some kinds of errors and some</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.280" end="00:49:59.599" style="s2">people make much</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.000" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">graver errors than that depending on</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.599" end="00:50:03.040" style="s2">what exactly your your</p>

<p begin="00:50:04.559" end="00:50:08.480" style="s2">used to be that not just you know not</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.280" end="00:50:11.680" style="s2">just the courts</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.480" end="00:50:13.520" style="s2">but society could recognize uh that</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.680" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">forgiveness was actually the way</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.520" end="00:50:19.200" style="s2">to a a more robust populace</p>

<p begin="00:50:23.280" end="00:50:27.920" style="s2">goes back to our being so visually</p>

<p begin="00:50:27.920" end="00:50:31.920" style="s2">seen it once you&#39;ve seen it either in</p>

<p begin="00:50:33.200" end="00:50:36.800" style="s2">and the fact that social media just is</p>

<p begin="00:50:36.800" end="00:50:40.160" style="s2">that we&#39;re being shown evidence of</p>

<p begin="00:50:47.040" end="00:50:49.920" style="s2">but it was a kid&#39;s exploration from a</p>

<p begin="00:50:49.920" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">uh is causing people to glitch out and</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.559" end="00:50:56.319" style="s2">forget that actually</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.000" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to be able to try to</p>

<p begin="00:50:58.000" end="00:51:01.680" style="s2">and heal and we&#39;re moving away from all</p>

<p begin="00:51:01.680" end="00:51:06.000" style="s2">yeah i guess i would say three final</p>

<p begin="00:52:50.880" end="00:52:54.480" style="s2">along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.920" end="00:52:56.160" style="s2">that evergreen was a failed experiment</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.480" end="00:52:56.880" style="s2">you both have phds from university of</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.160" end="00:52:58.240" style="s2">michigan</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.880" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">so higher tiered universities were</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.240" end="00:53:04.000" style="s2">available to you uh question mark</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:06.480" style="s2">so why evergreen that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.000" end="00:53:08.240" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to talk about there yep uh</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.480" end="00:53:09.760" style="s2">i&#39;m not sure what sort of three bullet</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.240" end="00:53:11.280" style="s2">points since we&#39;re not going to spend an</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.760" end="00:53:15.839" style="s2">hour talking about that here</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.280" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">but well one um</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.839" end="00:53:19.520" style="s2">heather certainly could have gotten a</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:20.240" style="s2">job at a higher tiered place and in fact</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.520" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">she did get</p>
<p begin="00:53:20.240" end="00:53:23.440" style="s2">two job offers evergreen being one of</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:25.440" style="s2">them which is</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.440" end="00:53:27.839" style="s2">not common you know this is without a</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.440" end="00:53:29.680" style="s2">postdoc she got two good offers</p>
<p begin="00:53:27.839" end="00:53:31.280" style="s2">right out of the the gate i didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.680" end="00:53:34.319" style="s2">my phd yet so</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.280" end="00:53:38.400" style="s2">um anyway</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.319" end="00:53:41.599" style="s2">the problem is the deal</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.400" end="00:53:44.000" style="s2">that comes along with these jobs is not</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.599" end="00:53:45.839" style="s2">nearly as desirable as you think</p>
<p begin="00:53:44.000" end="00:53:46.800" style="s2">everybody sees the professor who</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.839" end="00:53:49.119" style="s2">succeeded</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.800" end="00:53:51.040" style="s2">late career has a certain amount of</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.119" end="00:53:53.920" style="s2">freedom and thinks i want that job</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.040" end="00:53:55.280" style="s2">but a there&#39;s less freedom now for even</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.920" end="00:53:56.000" style="s2">people with a fair amount of power in</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.280" end="00:53:58.400" style="s2">these departments</p>
<p begin="00:53:56.000" end="00:53:59.119" style="s2">and b the road there is just appalling</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.400" end="00:54:01.280" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.119" end="00:54:02.960" style="s2">i guess like like i said there&#39;s we</p>
<p begin="00:54:01.280" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">could talk for hours about this and</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.960" end="00:54:06.079" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s worth doing so at some point</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:07.359" style="s2">um because it does</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.079" end="00:54:09.359" style="s2">it is revealing about the state of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.359" end="00:54:12.559" style="s2">higher ed right now but um</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.359" end="00:54:15.760" style="s2">two things two anecdotes um</p>
<p begin="00:54:12.559" end="00:54:19.440" style="s2">evergreen was not just some</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.760" end="00:54:22.800" style="s2">b-roll vanilla liberal arts college</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.440" end="00:54:26.880" style="s2">it was actually uh completely unique</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.800" end="00:54:30.000" style="s2">in what you could do there and um so</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.880" end="00:54:33.040" style="s2">uh you know failed experiment yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.000" end="00:54:33.680" style="s2">ultimately it was but there&#39;s no place</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.040" end="00:54:35.920" style="s2">else</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.680" end="00:54:37.440" style="s2">that has even come close to doing what</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.920" end="00:54:38.799" style="s2">we could do there and a few other</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.440" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">faculty were doing there</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.799" end="00:54:42.240" style="s2">because of the full-time programs</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:43.440" style="s2">largely there are a few other</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.240" end="00:54:45.440" style="s2">things that are unique to the curricular</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.440" end="00:54:47.119" style="s2">structure there but mostly being</p>
<p begin="00:54:45.440" end="00:54:48.559" style="s2">full-time with your students</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.119" end="00:54:50.400" style="s2">and then i will also say my first year</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.559" end="00:54:52.319" style="s2">at evergreen i was invited back to</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.400" end="00:54:54.880" style="s2">michigan along with two other recent phd</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.319" end="00:54:56.640" style="s2">graduates to be on a panel talking about</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.880" end="00:54:58.079" style="s2">uh what life after graduate school looks</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.640" end="00:55:00.079" style="s2">like if you&#39;ve gone to academia</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.079" end="00:55:01.440" style="s2">and so there was there&#39;s me at a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.079" end="00:55:03.280" style="s2">arts college</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.440" end="00:55:05.200" style="s2">there was someone in r1 you know a major</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.280" end="00:55:06.079" style="s2">research university with the expectation</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.200" end="00:55:08.559" style="s2">of low teaching</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.079" end="00:55:10.079" style="s2">high research etc and then there was</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.559" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">someone at sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.079" end="00:55:14.640" style="s2">mid-tier public university um</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.280" end="00:55:16.480" style="s2">and you might think that the mid-tier</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.640" end="00:55:18.079" style="s2">public university would be the sweet</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.480" end="00:55:18.720" style="s2">spot but now it seemed like by far the</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.079" end="00:55:21.920" style="s2">worst</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.720" end="00:55:23.440" style="s2">like this woman had</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.920" end="00:55:24.960" style="s2">you know an incredibly high teaching</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.440" end="00:55:28.240" style="s2">load and incredibly high research</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.960" end="00:55:28.799" style="s2">expectations and none of the um the</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.240" end="00:55:30.480" style="s2">clout</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.799" end="00:55:32.880" style="s2">or the respect that she might have had</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.480" end="00:55:34.640" style="s2">if she&#39;d been at either you know an r1</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.880" end="00:55:36.240" style="s2">or a different kind of respect that you</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.640" end="00:55:39.040" style="s2">get when you you know really dive deep</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:41.119" style="s2">at a liberal arts college um and so each</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.040" end="00:55:42.720" style="s2">of us basically gave little</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.119" end="00:55:44.400" style="s2">little statements and then we fielded</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.720" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">questions from at that point there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.400" end="00:55:46.880" style="s2">still</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:48.480" style="s2">current phd students in the department</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.880" end="00:55:51.920" style="s2">of biology at michigan</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.480" end="00:55:54.880" style="s2">and the person who was at an r1</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.920" end="00:55:55.839" style="s2">started out by saying if you take one of</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.880" end="00:55:57.440" style="s2">these jobs</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.839" end="00:55:59.440" style="s2">you can do this and one of the one other</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.440" end="00:56:01.040" style="s2">thing so choose one thing</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.440" end="00:56:02.079" style="s2">if you want a family you can do that</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.040" end="00:56:02.880" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to do it great but you</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.079" end="00:56:04.480" style="s2">can do it</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.880" end="00:56:06.319" style="s2">if you have a hobby that you really love</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.480" end="00:56:06.799" style="s2">you can do that but you can&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.319" end="00:56:08.240" style="s2">family</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.799" end="00:56:11.280" style="s2">and you sort of went down the list of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.240" end="00:56:13.359" style="s2">some other things that you could do</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.280" end="00:56:14.400" style="s2">and you know maybe maybe that was a</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.359" end="00:56:17.440" style="s2">little bit extreme</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.400" end="00:56:18.880" style="s2">but i&#39;m not sure at all and i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:17.440" end="00:56:19.680" style="s2">not sure that you could even have two</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.880" end="00:56:21.839" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.680" end="00:56:22.799" style="s2">like you know the the expectation of</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.839" end="00:56:25.920" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.799" end="00:56:29.680" style="s2">uh in in a research university doing an</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.920" end="00:56:31.599" style="s2">active research job um of you know 80</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.680" end="00:56:34.640" style="s2">100 120 hours a week</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.599" end="00:56:35.839" style="s2">and um and increasingly having</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.640" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">incredibly high governance</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.839" end="00:56:39.520" style="s2">requirements as well which is to say you</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:42.160" style="s2">know attending meetings and</p>
<p begin="00:56:39.520" end="00:56:43.119" style="s2">leading committees and all of this um</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.160" end="00:56:45.920" style="s2">seems so</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.119" end="00:56:46.799" style="s2">far from actually doing science that uh</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.920" end="00:56:50.400" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.799" end="00:56:52.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t look in any way enjoyable</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.400" end="00:56:53.440" style="s2">and you know i i could have done the</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.720" end="00:56:55.280" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.440" end="00:56:56.799" style="s2">it was enough in my wheelhouse that i</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.280" end="00:56:58.240" style="s2">could have done that work but i don&#39;t i</p>
<p begin="00:56:56.799" end="00:56:59.680" style="s2">would never have enjoyed it</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.240" end="00:57:03.119" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it was even in your</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.680" end="00:57:04.799" style="s2">wheelhouse to do it not that you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.119" end="00:57:06.319" style="s2">all right what did you make more capable</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.799" end="00:57:08.160" style="s2">of the science than</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.319" end="00:57:10.000" style="s2">you know perhaps any other human being</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.160" end="00:57:12.000" style="s2">on the planet but the idea of the</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.000" end="00:57:13.440" style="s2">logistics involved</p>
<p begin="00:57:12.000" end="00:57:14.960" style="s2">would have would have rendered it</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.440" end="00:57:16.400" style="s2">impossible for you yeah it would have</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.960" end="00:57:18.880" style="s2">been it would have been terrible</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.400" end="00:57:20.240" style="s2">um i think the other thing though and</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.880" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">you know you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.240" end="00:57:24.480" style="s2">blew right past it is evergreen had lots</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:28.160" style="s2">of problems</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.480" end="00:57:30.640" style="s2">it did not pay well um it fostered a lot</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.160" end="00:57:31.680" style="s2">of nonsense because there were so many</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.640" end="00:57:33.359" style="s2">you know this wasn&#39;t true at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.680" end="00:57:34.640" style="s2">beginning of the college but at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.359" end="00:57:36.400" style="s2">point that we arrived there there were</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.640" end="00:57:37.760" style="s2">already a huge number of people who had</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.400" end="00:57:41.280" style="s2">these jobs who didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.760" end="00:57:44.079" style="s2">have any interest in making anything any</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.280" end="00:57:45.440" style="s2">use of the freedom that they had yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.079" end="00:57:46.319" style="s2">anyway it was like an obstacle course</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.440" end="00:57:48.880" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.319" end="00:57:49.680" style="s2">the freedom that we had to build</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.880" end="00:57:52.160" style="s2">programs</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.680" end="00:57:53.200" style="s2">that suited us suited our students did</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.160" end="00:57:55.680" style="s2">what we wanted to do</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.200" end="00:57:57.440" style="s2">i mean literally imagine this no</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.680" end="00:57:59.839" style="s2">administrator can tell you</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.440" end="00:58:00.720" style="s2">what to teach or how to teach it as long</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.839" end="00:58:03.040" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.720" end="00:58:04.000" style="s2">students are showing up right if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.040" end="00:58:05.599" style="s2">want to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.000" end="00:58:07.280" style="s2">how to do something totally different</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.599" end="00:58:08.160" style="s2">evergreen was essentially the only place</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.280" end="00:58:09.680" style="s2">you could do that</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.160" end="00:58:11.040" style="s2">without having to get somebody to sign</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.680" end="00:58:11.760" style="s2">off on it i&#39;ve never heard of another</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.040" end="00:58:13.200" style="s2">place like that</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.760" end="00:58:15.280" style="s2">you have an idea you put it in the</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.200" end="00:58:16.000" style="s2">catalog and if students sign up you do</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.280" end="00:58:17.920" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.000" end="00:58:20.160" style="s2">i mean yeah you know and this and it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.920" end="00:58:22.559" style="s2">it was very real freedom and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.160" end="00:58:24.400" style="s2">um you know absolutely possible to screw</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.559" end="00:58:25.520" style="s2">it up it&#39;d be possible to teach things</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.400" end="00:58:28.240" style="s2">nobody cared to learn</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.520" end="00:58:30.559" style="s2">and have nobody show up but for us you</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.240" end="00:58:32.880" style="s2">know we always had waiting lists</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.559" end="00:58:33.920" style="s2">so we had lots of interested students</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.880" end="00:58:35.760" style="s2">who would show up</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.920" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">people bounced back and forth between</p>
<p begin="00:58:35.760" end="00:58:38.400" style="s2">our programs and then we would teach</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:40.319" style="s2">together and so</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:41.680" style="s2">there was always people who knew our</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.319" end="00:58:44.079" style="s2">style of thinking well</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.680" end="00:58:45.599" style="s2">brand new people mixed together it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.079" end="00:58:49.440" style="s2">just amazing it was</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.599" end="00:58:52.240" style="s2">really dynamic and you know i never</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.440" end="00:58:53.200" style="s2">never worried that i wasn&#39;t making a</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.240" end="00:58:54.400" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.200" end="00:58:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s right doing something that</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.400" end="00:58:57.040" style="s2">mattered it was never had trouble</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.680" end="00:58:57.520" style="s2">sleeping at night because of the work</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.040" end="00:58:58.960" style="s2">you were doing</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.520" end="00:59:00.880" style="s2">right and it was always interesting</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.960" end="00:59:02.400" style="s2">right the fact is every day</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.880" end="00:59:04.079" style="s2">every week different every program</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.400" end="00:59:07.839" style="s2">different every year different</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.079" end="00:59:10.720" style="s2">absolutely and you know imagine</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.839" end="00:59:11.920" style="s2">a college in which your professor knows</p>
<p begin="00:59:10.720" end="00:59:14.960" style="s2">you as a human being</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.920" end="00:59:17.200" style="s2">and actually spends time thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.960" end="00:59:18.160" style="s2">what your obstacles are what you might</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.200" end="00:59:19.920" style="s2">be misunderstanding</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.160" end="00:59:21.359" style="s2">and how to teach in such a way that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.920" end="00:59:22.559" style="s2">actually can understand the thing you</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.359" end="00:59:25.119" style="s2">don&#39;t yet get</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.559" end="00:59:26.960" style="s2">right that&#39;s not possible at four</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.119" end="00:59:28.720" style="s2">credits at a time but that is possible</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.960" end="00:59:31.359" style="s2">when somebody is with you for a full</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.720" end="00:59:32.079" style="s2">year at full time you know when you go</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.359" end="00:59:34.400" style="s2">into the field</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.079" end="00:59:35.760" style="s2">together right so when you literally sit</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.400" end="00:59:37.680" style="s2">around campfires together yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.760" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">literally sit around campfires or you</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.680" end="00:59:41.200" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">when uh you know you&#39;re lost in the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.200" end="00:59:45.119" style="s2">amazon and your</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:46.720" style="s2">class figures out how they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.119" end="00:59:49.440" style="s2">you know divide up the forest</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.720" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">and uh you know search it systematically</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.440" end="00:59:52.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:54.000" style="s2">find you as night has fallen you know so</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.160" end="00:59:56.400" style="s2">this wasn&#39;t either of us this was a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.000" end="00:59:57.839" style="s2">couple of our students once right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.400" end="00:59:59.760" style="s2">well but i mean you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.839" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">just just lest you imagine that our</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.760" end="01:00:02.480" style="s2">students were out searching for us who</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:02.799" style="s2">had gotten ourselves lost in the amazon</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.480" end="01:00:05.359" style="s2">no</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.799" end="01:00:06.720" style="s2">no i i have been lost in tropical forest</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.359" end="01:00:08.319" style="s2">a number of times but i always managed</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.720" end="01:00:12.000" style="s2">to find my way out but</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.319" end="01:00:14.240" style="s2">um but nonetheless the</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.000" end="01:00:15.839" style="s2">thing that we were doing looks so little</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.240" end="01:00:17.440" style="s2">like normal college teaching that when</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.839" end="01:00:19.520" style="s2">people ask us why the heck were you at</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.440" end="01:00:20.880" style="s2">evergreen it just it&#39;s hard to answer</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.520" end="01:00:22.480" style="s2">because the fact is we were doing</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.880" end="01:00:26.160" style="s2">something that was</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.480" end="01:00:28.319" style="s2">uh amazing it was exciting it was</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.160" end="01:00:29.599" style="s2">productive it made a difference in</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.319" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">people&#39;s lives</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.599" end="01:00:34.240" style="s2">and you know yeah that college came</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:36.400" style="s2">apart it doesn&#39;t exist anymore</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.240" end="01:00:37.680" style="s2">but it did exist when we were there and</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.400" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">we made good use of it</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.680" end="01:00:43.520" style="s2">yeah do you have any insight into recent</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.359" style="s2">possible life signs in the venus</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.520" end="01:00:47.520" style="s2">atmosphere could it be little green</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.359" end="01:00:49.440" style="s2">women instead of little green men</p>
<p begin="01:00:47.520" end="01:00:50.720" style="s2">well if it&#39;s only one it&#39;s it&#39;s gonna be</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.440" end="01:00:53.839" style="s2">female um</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.720" end="01:00:55.760" style="s2">but uh um good yeah</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.839" end="01:00:57.680" style="s2">well it is it is i&#39;m going to have very</p>
<p begin="01:00:55.760" end="01:00:59.440" style="s2">little to say about it i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.680" end="01:01:01.440" style="s2">just the case even just as we were</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.440" end="01:01:03.839" style="s2">talking about loneliness only</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.440" end="01:01:05.599" style="s2">potentially um turning you into a</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.839" end="01:01:06.720" style="s2">parthenogenic lifestyle effectively if</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.599" end="01:01:07.040" style="s2">you&#39;re female it doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.720" end="01:01:10.079" style="s2">male</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.040" end="01:01:11.839" style="s2">wait a second uh-oh were you saying that</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.079" end="01:01:15.359" style="s2">it was going to be</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.839" end="01:01:17.200" style="s2">uh female because</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.359" end="01:01:18.480" style="s2">because women are from venus or were you</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.200" end="01:01:19.920" style="s2">saying it&#39;s going to be female because</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.480" end="01:01:21.680" style="s2">of the part that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.920" end="01:01:23.599" style="s2">parth and the genesis yeah it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.680" end="01:01:25.520" style="s2">parthenogenesis okay so it just happens</p>
<p begin="01:01:23.599" end="01:01:27.839" style="s2">to dovetail with that trope</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:29.839" style="s2">yeah okay yeah if if we had just</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.839" end="01:01:31.680" style="s2">possibly found life in the atmosphere of</p>
<p begin="01:01:29.839" end="01:01:34.880" style="s2">mars it would still be um</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.680" end="01:01:37.440" style="s2">little green i guess little red females</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.880" end="01:01:38.480" style="s2">right not men okay now in this case</p>
<p begin="01:01:37.440" end="01:01:40.640" style="s2">though we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.480" end="01:01:41.920" style="s2">i&#39;d actually forgotten about the you had</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.640" end="01:01:43.119" style="s2">i thought you had and then it</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.920" end="01:01:45.599" style="s2">hit me that maybe that&#39;s what you were</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.119" end="01:01:47.680" style="s2">getting at but um</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.599" end="01:01:48.960" style="s2">we&#39;re talking about microbial life yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.680" end="01:01:51.280" style="s2">right well yes</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.960" end="01:01:53.040" style="s2">so probably so i mean let&#39;s see like</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.280" end="01:01:54.079" style="s2">microbe is like plankton right like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.040" end="01:01:55.920" style="s2">this yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.079" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">just like a junk term that doesn&#39;t speak</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.920" end="01:02:01.200" style="s2">to much beyond it&#39;s just tiny and</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:04.319" style="s2">right yeah but unlikely it&#39;s sexual</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.200" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">unlikely yeah yeah so it&#39;s uh so</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.319" end="01:02:07.760" style="s2">probably neither male nor female but if</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:11.280" style="s2">it were one uh</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.760" end="01:02:12.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s female um</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.280" end="01:02:14.400" style="s2">yeah i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know much beyond i</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.960" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">saw that uh there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.400" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a possibility and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.920" end="01:02:19.119" style="s2">exciting so</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:20.720" style="s2">i must tell you i you know it hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.119" end="01:02:22.319" style="s2">even occurred to me that i was not</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.720" end="01:02:23.680" style="s2">paying attention to the story until this</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.319" end="01:02:24.000" style="s2">question shows up because i definitely</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.680" end="01:02:26.240" style="s2">saw</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.000" end="01:02:27.839" style="s2">the headline and i thought so little of</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.240" end="01:02:28.799" style="s2">the likelihood that we have found</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.839" end="01:02:31.200" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.799" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">meaningful on this front especially you</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.200" end="01:02:34.079" style="s2">know this isn&#39;t mars</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.680" style="s2">this is venus yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.079" end="01:02:38.640" style="s2">inhospitable yes um</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.680" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit hot it&#39;s hot it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.640" end="01:02:41.599" style="s2">not</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:42.960" style="s2">um so anyway my i think my thought was</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.599" end="01:02:46.720" style="s2">something like</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.960" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">um i can imagine a flurry of excitement</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.720" end="01:02:50.000" style="s2">about this</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:50.559" style="s2">i can imagine the near certainty that</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.000" end="01:02:54.799" style="s2">it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.559" end="01:02:57.760" style="s2">right um i can&#39;t quite imagine what the</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.799" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">data were that suggests this possibility</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.760" end="01:03:01.760" style="s2">i&#39;m curious as to what people you know</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:03.200" style="s2">on mars periodically somebody will find</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.760" end="01:03:04.880" style="s2">a structure in the rocks and they will</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.200" end="01:03:06.720" style="s2">say it&#39;s reminiscent of a bacterial</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.880" end="01:03:07.920" style="s2">colony and it turns out a geological</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.720" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">process can do it</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.920" end="01:03:12.319" style="s2">um so i guess i&#39;m expecting exactly that</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:12.960" style="s2">to unfold here i don&#39;t know what the</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.319" end="01:03:17.520" style="s2">evidence is</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.960" end="01:03:18.799" style="s2">and i know less about what kind of</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.520" end="01:03:20.319" style="s2">what kind of evidence might be left</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.799" end="01:03:22.000" style="s2">atmospherically than sort of</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.319" end="01:03:23.760" style="s2">geologically right like i</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.000" end="01:03:25.119" style="s2">i understand better what kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.760" end="01:03:26.559" style="s2">evidence will look like</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.119" end="01:03:29.039" style="s2">at the like paleontological</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.559" end="01:03:30.240" style="s2">archaeological geological level than</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:34.640" style="s2">atmospheric so</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.240" end="01:03:37.839" style="s2">but i mean okay so maybe i also misread</p>
<p begin="01:03:34.640" end="01:03:39.520" style="s2">the what little i read here but was this</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.839" end="01:03:41.280" style="s2">a new mission to venus</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.520" end="01:03:42.559" style="s2">that descended through the atmosphere</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.280" end="01:03:45.920" style="s2">and collected something</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.559" end="01:03:47.839" style="s2">and sent back some data or was this</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.920" end="01:03:48.960" style="s2">the analysis of something that had</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.839" end="01:03:51.119" style="s2">already</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.960" end="01:03:52.240" style="s2">occurred i don&#39;t know hey zach if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.119" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">seeing anything in the chat that</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.240" end="01:03:55.839" style="s2">addresses that question tell us okay</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.880" end="01:04:00.799" style="s2">with regard to possible life signs in</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.039" end="01:04:02.720" style="s2">the atmosphere of venus</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.799" end="01:04:04.079" style="s2">uh where is the what&#39;s the evidence</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.720" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">coming from</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.079" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">yeah so i think the answer to your</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:09.680" style="s2">question is um</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:11.280" style="s2">a dereliction of duty on both our parts</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.680" end="01:04:12.880" style="s2">as biologists hearing that there might</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.280" end="01:04:15.599" style="s2">be life on another planet</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.880" end="01:04:16.400" style="s2">in our solar system and not having paid</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.599" end="01:04:18.720" style="s2">enough attention</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.400" end="01:04:20.319" style="s2">to it but i chalk it up to smoke</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.720" end="01:04:23.119" style="s2">poisoning smoke poisoning</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.319" end="01:04:24.079" style="s2">and you know having been through this</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.119" end="01:04:26.400" style="s2">many many times</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.079" end="01:04:28.559" style="s2">with mars i would say betting on this</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.400" end="01:04:31.280" style="s2">not being what people think it is</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.559" end="01:04:32.400" style="s2">um and the propensity of headlines to</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.280" end="01:04:33.920" style="s2">get written</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.400" end="01:04:36.720" style="s2">um because it would be very exciting if</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.920" end="01:04:38.240" style="s2">there was life so</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.720" end="01:04:40.240" style="s2">so exciting to think about somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.240" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">else even</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.240" end="01:04:44.799" style="s2">hot hot hot venus yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:04:45.039" end="01:04:48.079" style="s2">okay well we&#39;re getting we got to get</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.160" end="01:04:48.720" style="s2">through a few more of these we barely</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.079" end="01:04:52.079" style="s2">started</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.720" end="01:04:53.359" style="s2">um starting my math masters my preferred</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.079" end="01:04:55.119" style="s2">area requires three courses with</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.359" end="01:04:57.039" style="s2">allegedly terrible professor</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.119" end="01:04:59.520" style="s2">do you have survival advice what i take</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.039" end="01:05:04.240" style="s2">now decides the course of the degree</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.520" end="01:05:05.680" style="s2">i am worried hmm</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.240" end="01:05:07.520" style="s2">the terrible professor problem is a</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.680" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">terrible problem yeah it really really</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.520" end="01:05:10.480" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:11.680" style="s2">i never figured it out a mechanism and</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.480" end="01:05:13.200" style="s2">there are so many of them</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.680" end="01:05:14.640" style="s2">yeah there are so many terrible</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.200" end="01:05:16.799" style="s2">professors and it&#39;s really much more</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.640" end="01:05:18.559" style="s2">common than excellent professors</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.799" end="01:05:19.920" style="s2">so that said sounds to me from your</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.559" end="01:05:20.960" style="s2">question like this professor probably</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.920" end="01:05:24.640" style="s2">really is terrible</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.960" end="01:05:25.520" style="s2">but as i&#39;ve said elsewhere my experience</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.640" end="01:05:27.359" style="s2">in college</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.520" end="01:05:28.720" style="s2">back in my day there used to be an</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.359" end="01:05:33.520" style="s2">actual book</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.720" end="01:05:35.440" style="s2">of reviews that classes and professors</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.520" end="01:05:36.960" style="s2">had that you could look at to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.440" end="01:05:40.480" style="s2">what course to take</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.960" end="01:05:42.640" style="s2">and my experience was very frequently</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.480" end="01:05:44.000" style="s2">the people i really thought were great</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.640" end="01:05:45.520" style="s2">were not well liked</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.000" end="01:05:47.839" style="s2">and the people that others thought were</p>
<p begin="01:05:45.520" end="01:05:51.520" style="s2">great i found</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.839" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">boring or worse and so be aware that</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.520" end="01:05:54.799" style="s2">it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">you know depending upon what terrible</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.799" end="01:05:57.599" style="s2">means if terrible means the person&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:00.000" style="s2">jerk</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.599" end="01:06:01.520" style="s2">right and you know that they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.000" end="01:06:04.160" style="s2">power hungry and they</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.520" end="01:06:05.599" style="s2">you know yep or buy the book yeah and or</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.160" end="01:06:06.880" style="s2">don&#39;t know their subject</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.599" end="01:06:08.160" style="s2">right right any of those things and</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.880" end="01:06:09.039" style="s2">that&#39;s just really bad on the other hand</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.160" end="01:06:10.480" style="s2">polarizing</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.039" end="01:06:12.319" style="s2">and works for some people doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.480" end="01:06:13.760" style="s2">for others maybe it&#39;ll work for you</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.319" end="01:06:15.039" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a different</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.760" end="01:06:16.240" style="s2">situation that&#39;s a different thing but</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.039" end="01:06:19.200" style="s2">assuming it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.240" end="01:06:21.119" style="s2">um you know can you take a summer course</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.200" end="01:06:24.160" style="s2">instead that covers the same</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.119" end="01:06:25.200" style="s2">material with a different person um can</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.160" end="01:06:28.240" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.200" end="01:06:32.000" style="s2">teach yourself and then test out of it</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.240" end="01:06:35.760" style="s2">um can you</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.000" end="01:06:38.400" style="s2">uh go into some form of stasis</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.760" end="01:06:39.839" style="s2">and emerge decades from now when things</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.400" end="01:06:40.799" style="s2">have gotten better i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.839" end="01:06:43.280" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.799" end="01:06:44.240" style="s2">i think that uh the recommendation to</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.280" end="01:06:47.440" style="s2">former chrysalis</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.240" end="01:07:01.680" style="s2">is probably not the best one um yeah for</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.440" end="01:07:03.440" style="s2">technical reasons</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.680" end="01:07:05.760" style="s2">for those who couldn&#39;t hear zach just</p>
<p begin="01:07:03.440" end="01:07:09.039" style="s2">reads from the chat that is was observed</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.760" end="01:07:11.119" style="s2">via telescope uh that a</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.039" end="01:07:13.119" style="s2">signature of microbes that is known from</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.119" end="01:07:16.000" style="s2">earth was also observed in the</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.119" end="01:07:17.359" style="s2">atmosphere of venus is that right yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.000" end="01:07:21.200" style="s2">that better be some signature</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.359" end="01:07:21.200" style="s2">or i&#39;m betting against it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.079" end="01:07:25.599" style="s2">what if any legitimate scientific data</p>
<p begin="01:07:24.000" end="01:07:28.880" style="s2">are the black lives matter leaders</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.599" end="01:07:30.480" style="s2">and nick cannonites using to espouse</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.880" end="01:07:31.680" style="s2">their claims that melanin is of the</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.480" end="01:07:34.160" style="s2">utmost importance</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.680" end="01:07:36.079" style="s2">and how are whites less than due to the</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.160" end="01:07:38.079" style="s2">lack of neuromelanin</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.079" end="01:07:39.760" style="s2">so i don&#39;t i barely recognize this name</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.079" end="01:07:40.160" style="s2">not can i use nick cannonites but i</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.760" end="01:07:42.400" style="s2">can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.160" end="01:07:45.680" style="s2">i don&#39;t quite place it and you know i</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.400" end="01:07:47.039" style="s2">mean this somehow this is the same</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.680" end="01:07:49.200" style="s2">it&#39;s the same thing you know any</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.039" end="01:07:51.680" style="s2">legitimate scientific data</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.200" end="01:07:53.280" style="s2">that melanin is of the no no there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.680" end="01:07:56.559" style="s2">nothing to it</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.280" end="01:07:57.760" style="s2">of course not no um you know</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.559" end="01:07:59.760" style="s2">i mean i guess actually it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.760" end="01:08:02.079" style="s2">same all this just that just</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.760" end="01:08:03.839" style="s2">if if the claim that we&#39;re being asked</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.079" end="01:08:04.559" style="s2">is there any legitimate scientific data</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.839" end="01:08:06.160" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.559" end="01:08:08.640" style="s2">that melanin is the most important</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.160" end="01:08:11.599" style="s2">indicator of who you are as a human</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.640" end="01:08:12.880" style="s2">um and lacking neuromelanin i don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.599" end="01:08:14.480" style="s2">know what that means that&#39;s just that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.880" end="01:08:15.839" style="s2">just [ __ ] but this is this is what</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.480" end="01:08:19.040" style="s2">happens when you take</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.839" end="01:08:20.480" style="s2">a a verificationist approach be licensed</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.040" end="01:08:24.719" style="s2">to throw out whatever</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.480" end="01:08:27.920" style="s2">you don&#39;t find convenient um and</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.719" end="01:08:31.440" style="s2">see a a</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.920" end="01:08:33.279" style="s2">bias in favor of simple mechanisms and</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.440" end="01:08:37.600" style="s2">you try to apply them to a complex</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.279" end="01:08:39.440" style="s2">complex system i would just say look</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.600" end="01:08:41.199" style="s2">melanin is really really important you</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.440" end="01:08:43.120" style="s2">know what else is important face shape</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.199" end="01:08:43.920" style="s2">you know why because it allows people to</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.120" end="01:08:46.000" style="s2">recognize</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.920" end="01:08:47.600" style="s2">whether or not you&#39;re from their lineage</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.000" end="01:08:49.120" style="s2">and we are predisposed</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.600" end="01:08:50.880" style="s2">to cooperate with people who are more</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.120" end="01:08:52.719" style="s2">closely related to us despite what my</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.880" end="01:08:55.920" style="s2">colleagues may say</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.719" end="01:08:57.440" style="s2">eye color right and build and maintain</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.920" end="01:08:58.960" style="s2">low shape and you know what all these</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.440" end="01:09:00.719" style="s2">things are indicators you can look at a</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.960" end="01:09:01.279" style="s2">person on a subway and you can tell</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.719" end="01:09:05.199" style="s2">whether</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.279" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">they&#39;re from you know uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.199" end="01:09:09.440" style="s2">they&#39;re from europe they&#39;re from africa</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:11.679" style="s2">they&#39;re from</p>
<p begin="01:09:09.440" end="01:09:13.199" style="s2">asia and which part these things are</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.679" end="01:09:14.080" style="s2">detectable and we all know it and the</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.199" end="01:09:17.040" style="s2">point is they</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.080" end="01:09:18.799" style="s2">are proxies for relatedness they are not</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.040" end="01:09:21.600" style="s2">perfect but they are proxies</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.799" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">and the question is are we going to get</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.600" end="01:09:24.080" style="s2">past</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:25.759" style="s2">using these indicators to figure out</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.080" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">genetic relatedness and decide who is</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.759" end="01:09:29.440" style="s2">our ally or are we not</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:30.880" style="s2">that&#39;s the question so is melanin</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.440" end="01:09:33.600" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.880" end="01:09:34.159" style="s2">mechanistically probably not very is it</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.600" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">important</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.159" end="01:09:37.520" style="s2">as one of the components that people use</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.000" end="01:09:40.880" style="s2">to recognize</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.520" end="01:09:42.159" style="s2">uh kinetic distance yeah it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.880" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">important but that&#39;s not the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.159" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">as</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:47.040" style="s2">data that suggests it&#39;s an important uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.000" end="01:09:50.560" style="s2">molecule</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.040" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">yeah um keep at it folks</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.560" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">what are your thoughts on nickland&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:55.920" style="s2">philosophy accelerationism and its</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.839" end="01:09:57.520" style="s2">subtypes and or mark fisher&#39;s capitalist</p>
<p begin="01:09:55.920" end="01:09:59.040" style="s2">realism</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.520" end="01:10:00.159" style="s2">i have no thoughts on any of those</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.040" end="01:10:02.400" style="s2">because i don&#39;t know what any of them</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.159" end="01:10:04.960" style="s2">are well accelerationism</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.400" end="01:10:05.840" style="s2">goddamn we know that one i don&#39;t um at</p>
<p begin="01:10:04.960" end="01:10:08.800" style="s2">least not yet</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.840" end="01:10:10.000" style="s2">basically it comes down to if you want</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.800" end="01:10:12.480" style="s2">to make things better</p>
<p begin="01:10:10.000" end="01:10:13.199" style="s2">makes it worse faster oh that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.480" end="01:10:16.159" style="s2">yes</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.199" end="01:10:17.280" style="s2">um so this is a garbage idea in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.159" end="01:10:19.920" style="s2">modern era</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.280" end="01:10:21.360" style="s2">um because although it&#39;s true nothing</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.920" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">protects you from driving yourself</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.360" end="01:10:24.159" style="s2">extinct with this</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.400" end="01:10:26.480" style="s2">and the fact is we&#39;ve got so many</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.159" end="01:10:29.600" style="s2">systems that are so powerful that</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.480" end="01:10:32.239" style="s2">are so inter-related that</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.600" end="01:10:33.440" style="s2">driving things to dysfunction is very</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.239" end="01:10:36.080" style="s2">likely to create</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.440" end="01:10:37.679" style="s2">uh a catastrophe so in some sense if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.080" end="01:10:39.040" style="s2">want to fix things you&#39;re obligated to</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.679" end="01:10:41.280" style="s2">do it without</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.040" end="01:10:43.440" style="s2">taking apart the system on which we are</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.280" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">all depending i mean the simple fact</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.440" end="01:10:47.840" style="s2">that um more than half of the human</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:51.760" style="s2">population</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.840" end="01:10:53.679" style="s2">uh is present because of the haber bosch</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.760" end="01:10:55.280" style="s2">process which has taken inorganic</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.679" end="01:10:56.960" style="s2">nitrogen from the atmosphere and made it</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.280" end="01:10:58.800" style="s2">biologically available in the form of</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.960" end="01:10:59.600" style="s2">fertilizer which then creates foods that</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.800" end="01:11:01.360" style="s2">we eat</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.600" end="01:11:03.199" style="s2">you are you ready to take responsibility</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.360" end="01:11:06.560" style="s2">for disrupting that process</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.199" end="01:11:08.719" style="s2">right you can&#39;t so accelerating</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.560" end="01:11:11.199" style="s2">dysfunction is is an insane idea in</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.719" end="01:11:12.800" style="s2">2020.</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.199" end="01:11:14.480" style="s2">so let&#39;s get through there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.800" end="01:11:16.239" style="s2">number of comments here that</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.480" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">we won&#39;t have a lot to say about i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.239" end="01:11:19.920" style="s2">think um let&#39;s get through</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.320" end="01:11:23.679" style="s2">three more questions here ending with</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.760" end="01:11:25.360" style="s2">that one how would you write a character</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.679" end="01:11:27.600" style="s2">like wolverine from marvel comics</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.360" end="01:11:30.080" style="s2">without violating the laws of senescence</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.600" end="01:11:31.600" style="s2">love your content keep it up so i will</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.080" end="01:11:34.000" style="s2">admit and i&#39;m not maybe you know more</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.600" end="01:11:37.040" style="s2">than i do but i also just</p>

<p begin="01:13:44.400" end="01:13:48.400" style="s2">and uh or maybe and then you will riff a</p>
<p begin="01:13:47.199" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">little bit on the columbia marching band</p>
<p begin="01:13:48.400" end="01:13:51.760" style="s2">and then we&#39;ll find one more</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:53.440" style="s2">to answer today set myself up for that</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.760" end="01:13:55.199" style="s2">now yep you did you did</p>
<p begin="01:13:53.440" end="01:13:57.040" style="s2">read the new york times article your</p>
<p begin="01:13:55.199" end="01:13:58.239" style="s2">coronavirus test is positive maybe it</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.040" end="01:14:00.640" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.239" end="01:14:02.000" style="s2">it makes a case that 85 to 90 of cases</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.640" end="01:14:02.960" style="s2">aren&#39;t contagious and don&#39;t need to</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.000" end="01:14:05.120" style="s2">isolate</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.960" end="01:14:08.159" style="s2">that this isn&#39;t major news suggests that</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.120" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">we&#39;re in a dystopia</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.159" end="01:14:12.960" style="s2">so it&#39;s a weird headline i have not read</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:14.000" style="s2">it um i can imagine what the argument</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.960" end="01:14:16.080" style="s2">probably is i mean</p>
<p begin="01:14:14.000" end="01:14:17.280" style="s2">given that you what this person says the</p>
<p begin="01:14:16.080" end="01:14:18.960" style="s2">argument is</p>
<p begin="01:14:17.280" end="01:14:20.400" style="s2">does not mean that the test shouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.960" end="01:14:22.159" style="s2">positive but that we should be</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.400" end="01:14:26.000" style="s2">understanding that there are gradations</p>
<p begin="01:14:22.159" end="01:14:28.640" style="s2">of of uh basically virulence</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.000" end="01:14:30.239" style="s2">and that um actually there&#39;s a piece we</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.640" end="01:14:32.320" style="s2">didn&#39;t end up talking about today</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.239" end="01:14:34.239" style="s2">um a new piece of research out that</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.320" end="01:14:37.679" style="s2">suggests that actually mask wearing</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.239" end="01:14:40.719" style="s2">is even more effective than we thought</p>
<p begin="01:14:37.679" end="01:14:42.000" style="s2">um because it actually um and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:40.719" end="01:14:44.239" style="s2">talked about other versions</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.000" end="01:14:45.840" style="s2">of this before but that um people who</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.239" end="01:14:46.239" style="s2">are wearing masks and people in places</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:47.520" style="s2">where</p>
<p begin="01:14:46.239" end="01:14:50.480" style="s2">everyone or almost everyone&#39;s wearing</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.520" end="01:14:51.440" style="s2">masks have um not just lower rates of</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.480" end="01:14:55.040" style="s2">transmission but</p>
<p begin="01:14:51.440" end="01:14:57.360" style="s2">much lower rates of hospitalizations</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.040" end="01:14:59.440" style="s2">and and really bad cases of the thing</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.360" end="01:15:00.800" style="s2">and so this has to do with the</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.440" end="01:15:03.760" style="s2">density dependence the viral load</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.800" end="01:15:06.560" style="s2">argument um and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:03.760" end="01:15:08.159" style="s2">probably this is related to that that</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.560" end="01:15:10.560" style="s2">many people who have it have</p>
<p begin="01:15:08.159" end="01:15:12.239" style="s2">a mild case and that a mild case</p>
<p begin="01:15:10.560" end="01:15:13.920" style="s2">effectively acts like a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.239" end="01:15:15.679" style="s2">inoculation so that you end up with</p>
<p begin="01:15:13.920" end="01:15:17.120" style="s2">immunity that the headline i saw</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.679" end="01:15:19.040" style="s2">suggested that you get immunity from</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.120" end="01:15:20.960" style="s2">masks which is an insane headline</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.040" end="01:15:22.239" style="s2">you don&#39;t get immunity from masks you</p>
<p begin="01:15:20.960" end="01:15:23.600" style="s2">may get inoculated</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.239" end="01:15:25.120" style="s2">such that you end up with a mild case</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.600" end="01:15:26.560" style="s2">such that you don&#39;t get you aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:15:25.120" end="01:15:28.480" style="s2">infectable again</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.560" end="01:15:29.920" style="s2">um because you were wearing a mask but</p>
<p begin="01:15:28.480" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">not because the mask itself conferred</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.920" end="01:15:34.080" style="s2">immunity</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:37.360" style="s2">um yeah i don&#39;t know more than that well</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.080" end="01:15:39.600" style="s2">um so i worry</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.360" end="01:15:41.440" style="s2">about this sort of conclusion there</p>
<p begin="01:15:39.600" end="01:15:43.440" style="s2">because this is so politicized</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.440" end="01:15:44.800" style="s2">people are looking for anything that</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.440" end="01:15:47.440" style="s2">pulls in their direction</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.800" end="01:15:48.800" style="s2">and they are not being careful about how</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.440" end="01:15:50.080" style="s2">strongly it pulls in their direction so</p>
<p begin="01:15:48.800" end="01:15:53.120" style="s2">what i worry about</p>
<p begin="01:15:50.080" end="01:15:55.679" style="s2">is it is probably true</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.120" end="01:15:58.719" style="s2">a the tests are garbage and false</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.679" end="01:16:00.960" style="s2">negatives and false positives are so</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.719" end="01:16:02.560" style="s2">um common i mean especially false</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.960" end="01:16:04.000" style="s2">negatives i would say</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.560" end="01:16:05.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s very hard to say what these</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.000" end="01:16:07.760" style="s2">tests do and because we don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:16:05.600" end="01:16:10.320" style="s2">really good tests it&#39;s hard to test</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.760" end="01:16:13.440" style="s2">other tests for what they&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.320" end="01:16:16.480" style="s2">implying but the</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.440" end="01:16:17.840" style="s2">concern i would have is that infections</p>
<p begin="01:16:16.480" end="01:16:20.719" style="s2">go through</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.840" end="01:16:21.520" style="s2">phases and that they are highly</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.719" end="01:16:24.400" style="s2">infectious</p>
<p begin="01:16:21.520" end="01:16:24.880" style="s2">it&#39;s some uh limited for some limited</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.400" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">span</p>
<p begin="01:16:24.880" end="01:16:28.960" style="s2">in the middle and that therefore you</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:30.640" style="s2">would find people who still test</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.960" end="01:16:31.600" style="s2">positive either side of that highly</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.640" end="01:16:33.199" style="s2">infectious phase</p>
<p begin="01:16:31.600" end="01:16:34.560" style="s2">and you might say aha their test was</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.199" end="01:16:35.440" style="s2">positive but they&#39;re not infectious but</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.560" end="01:16:39.040" style="s2">the point is</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.440" end="01:16:41.440" style="s2">if everybody who has the infection</p>
<p begin="01:16:39.040" end="01:16:43.440" style="s2">goes through a period in which they are</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.440" end="01:16:46.480" style="s2">likely to infect others then it is not</p>
<p begin="01:16:43.440" end="01:16:49.199" style="s2">true that because your test is positive</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.480" end="01:16:51.040" style="s2">it is misleading the point is your test</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.199" end="01:16:52.880" style="s2">is indicating that you have an infection</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.040" end="01:16:54.719" style="s2">that goes through a stage at which you</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.880" end="01:16:58.239" style="s2">are capable of infecting others</p>
<p begin="01:16:54.719" end="01:16:58.719" style="s2">and that&#39;s um you know hey we we know</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.239" end="01:17:02.080" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.719" end="01:17:06.640" style="s2">right this is this is presumed</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.080" end="01:17:08.719" style="s2">um that you are infected with the virus</p>
<p begin="01:17:06.640" end="01:17:09.760" style="s2">um but that there are periods in which</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.719" end="01:17:11.199" style="s2">you&#39;re uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:09.760" end="01:17:12.719" style="s2">liable to transmit it to others in</p>

<p begin="01:17:12.719" end="01:17:18.960" style="s2">i&#39;m rambling but</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.560" end="01:17:21.679" style="s2">um the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.960" end="01:17:23.199" style="s2">a period of high transmissibility and</p>
<p begin="01:17:21.679" end="01:17:25.120" style="s2">the fact that you have the virus that</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.199" end="01:17:27.040" style="s2">has that period are consistent with a</p>

<p begin="01:17:27.040" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">matty you&#39;re making it a little bit hard</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.480" end="01:17:31.920" style="s2">to concentrate i&#39;m really not trying to</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:33.440" style="s2">encourage her</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.920" end="01:17:35.199" style="s2">i think she thinks we&#39;ve been on air too</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.440" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">long she may be right about that all</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.199" end="01:17:38.159" style="s2">right i&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:39.440" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna just one more</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.159" end="01:17:40.159" style="s2">question there one more question and</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.440" end="01:17:41.600" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.159" end="01:17:43.600" style="s2">and then we&#39;re off then we&#39;re off no</p>
<p begin="01:17:41.600" end="01:17:45.360" style="s2">columbia marching band</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.600" end="01:17:47.679" style="s2">one more question what is the evolution</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.360" end="01:17:49.440" style="s2">of hugging how far back the evolutionary</p>
<p begin="01:17:47.679" end="01:17:51.120" style="s2">tree does it go and what is its function</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.440" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">i miss it hugely these days thank you</p>
<p begin="01:17:51.120" end="01:17:56.159" style="s2">for the great podcast format</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:57.360" style="s2">um i miss it too a lot i mean we we are</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.159" end="01:18:02.080" style="s2">tactile creatures</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.360" end="01:18:05.360" style="s2">and um and this is this is very hard</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.080" end="01:18:07.040" style="s2">from a tactile perspective well tactile</p>
<p begin="01:18:05.360" end="01:18:07.440" style="s2">and a bunch of other things too the fact</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.040" end="01:18:10.320" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.440" end="01:18:11.679" style="s2">outside uh you&#39;re wearing masks which</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.320" end="01:18:14.000" style="s2">blocks a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.679" end="01:18:15.520" style="s2">so much sensory data are missing data</p>
<p begin="01:18:14.000" end="01:18:18.960" style="s2">transmission and all that</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.520" end="01:18:21.040" style="s2">um yeah and just the simple fact even</p>
<p begin="01:18:18.960" end="01:18:23.199" style="s2">even if you take out the other things</p>
<p begin="01:18:21.040" end="01:18:25.679" style="s2">that you&#39;re looking at people</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.199" end="01:18:27.199" style="s2">and if somebody coughs you know you have</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.679" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">to sense that they are a hostile</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.199" end="01:18:31.840" style="s2">force yeah and all of this so uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:33.840" style="s2">what is the origin of hugging i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.840" end="01:18:35.920" style="s2">think well i know i mean we know that um</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.840" end="01:18:38.400" style="s2">at least jumps and bonobos hug</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.920" end="01:18:42.080" style="s2">um and actually franz duvall&#39;s most</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.400" end="01:18:45.600" style="s2">recent book mama&#39;s last hug is about a</p>
<p begin="01:18:42.080" end="01:18:48.800" style="s2">um an old chimp</p>
<p begin="01:18:45.600" end="01:18:51.199" style="s2">uh who upon having her</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.800" end="01:18:52.560" style="s2">former friend trainer i&#39;m not sure what</p>
<p begin="01:18:51.199" end="01:18:55.199" style="s2">person human</p>
<p begin="01:18:52.560" end="01:18:56.480" style="s2">um come back to see her as she is dying</p>
<p begin="01:18:55.199" end="01:18:59.040" style="s2">many many many years</p>
<p begin="01:18:56.480" end="01:19:00.159" style="s2">after they have ever seen each other um</p>
<p begin="01:18:59.040" end="01:19:02.640" style="s2">through her sort of</p>
<p begin="01:19:00.159" end="01:19:04.480" style="s2">dying eyes she sees him and lights up</p>
<p begin="01:19:02.640" end="01:19:05.920" style="s2">and reaches out to him and hugs him and</p>
<p begin="01:19:04.480" end="01:19:08.000" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s video of this and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.920" end="01:19:09.040" style="s2">it&#39;s extraordinary yeah um and it you</p>
<p begin="01:19:08.000" end="01:19:10.800" style="s2">know it is</p>
<p begin="01:19:09.040" end="01:19:12.159" style="s2">in in that book it does the service of</p>
<p begin="01:19:10.800" end="01:19:14.000" style="s2">discussing um</p>
<p begin="01:19:12.159" end="01:19:16.159" style="s2">the you know the the prevalence and</p>
<p begin="01:19:14.000" end="01:19:17.920" style="s2">depth of emotion in non-human animals</p>
<p begin="01:19:16.159" end="01:19:20.239" style="s2">um but it also reveals that you know</p>
<p begin="01:19:17.920" end="01:19:21.600" style="s2">hugging is and we see this between</p>
<p begin="01:19:20.239" end="01:19:22.800" style="s2">between germs between bone elbows i</p>
<p begin="01:19:21.600" end="01:19:25.360" style="s2">think between gorillas</p>
<p begin="01:19:22.800" end="01:19:26.960" style="s2">yep i don&#39;t orangs are at least on i</p>
<p begin="01:19:25.360" end="01:19:28.719" style="s2">think borneo solitary and that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="01:19:26.960" end="01:19:29.440" style="s2">we know most of our orang behavior from</p>
<p begin="01:19:28.719" end="01:19:31.280" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="01:19:29.440" end="01:19:33.120" style="s2">um they&#39;re less solitary elsewhere but i</p>
<p begin="01:19:31.280" end="01:19:35.199" style="s2">don&#39;t i don&#39;t know if they hug</p>
<p begin="01:19:33.120" end="01:19:36.159" style="s2">um yep gibbons probably at least hug</p>
<p begin="01:19:35.199" end="01:19:38.239" style="s2">their pair bond</p>
<p begin="01:19:36.159" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">um right so gibbons which are certainly</p>
<p begin="01:19:38.239" end="01:19:40.880" style="s2">needed for it</p>
<p begin="01:19:41.360" end="01:19:44.719" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know all primates do a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:19:43.520" end="01:19:47.360" style="s2">touching yep</p>
<p begin="01:19:44.719" end="01:19:49.280" style="s2">but i would also point out yeah um this</p>
<p begin="01:19:47.360" end="01:19:50.800" style="s2">is tangential to your question but i</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.280" end="01:19:54.080" style="s2">find it so compelling</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.800" end="01:19:56.480" style="s2">that uh i think it&#39;s worth introducing</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.080" end="01:19:57.440" style="s2">the fact that there are numerous</p>
<p begin="01:19:56.480" end="01:20:00.480" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.440" end="01:20:03.280" style="s2">of um</p>
<p begin="01:20:00.480" end="01:20:05.600" style="s2">great apes in captivity especially</p>
<p begin="01:20:03.280" end="01:20:10.320" style="s2">gorillas maybe it&#39;s all gorillas</p>
<p begin="01:20:05.600" end="01:20:12.320" style="s2">who have had a relationship with a cat</p>
<p begin="01:20:10.320" end="01:20:14.239" style="s2">right yeah that these relationships make</p>
<p begin="01:20:12.320" end="01:20:17.360" style="s2">sense that a domestic cat</p>
<p begin="01:20:14.239" end="01:20:20.400" style="s2">is wired however it</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:22.960" style="s2">occurs whether it&#39;s in the genome or</p>
<p begin="01:20:20.400" end="01:20:24.800" style="s2">just simply through observation to treat</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.960" end="01:20:26.080" style="s2">relationships with apes as normal</p>
<p begin="01:20:24.800" end="01:20:28.400" style="s2">because people are apes</p>
<p begin="01:20:26.080" end="01:20:29.600" style="s2">and you know they just simply do it</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.400" end="01:20:32.320" style="s2">without thinking</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.600" end="01:20:33.280" style="s2">and that a gorilla for whom presumably</p>
<p begin="01:20:32.320" end="01:20:36.719" style="s2">having a</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.280" end="01:20:38.560" style="s2">pet cat would not be normal nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.719" end="01:20:40.159" style="s2">gets the same thing out of it that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:38.560" end="01:20:42.960" style="s2">know we humans do</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.159" end="01:20:46.480" style="s2">and that these bonds form so easily and</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.960" end="01:20:49.840" style="s2">you know so it&#39;s not so crazy to see a</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.480" end="01:20:51.520" style="s2">you know gorilla holding its kitty cat</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.840" end="01:20:53.360" style="s2">right suggests something about you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.520" end="01:20:54.000" style="s2">the the universality of these things and</p>
<p begin="01:20:53.360" end="01:20:57.920" style="s2">therefore</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.000" end="01:21:00.400" style="s2">the ancientness of the behavior patterns</p>
<p begin="01:20:57.920" end="01:21:01.280" style="s2">in the apes you know because we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:00.400" end="01:21:03.280" style="s2">separated from</p>
<p begin="01:21:01.280" end="01:21:04.480" style="s2">guerrillas by i think ten thousand</p>
<p begin="01:21:03.280" end="01:21:06.800" style="s2">million</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.480" end="01:21:07.679" style="s2">ten thousand what the hell man it must</p>
<p begin="01:21:06.800" end="01:21:12.159" style="s2">be the smoke</p>
<p begin="01:21:07.679" end="01:21:15.040" style="s2">uh yes ten million years um</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.159" end="01:21:17.199" style="s2">so anyway it&#39;s a very ancient pattern it</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.040" end="01:21:20.239" style="s2">covers at least most of the great apes</p>
<p begin="01:21:17.199" end="01:21:23.760" style="s2">back through gorillas yeah</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.239" end="01:21:25.760" style="s2">um and possibly farther and you know</p>
<p begin="01:21:23.760" end="01:21:27.280" style="s2">that that suggests you know we have</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.760" end="01:21:29.520" style="s2">basically not answered your question but</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.280" end="01:21:32.960" style="s2">i think at some level the answer is</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.520" end="01:21:33.280" style="s2">that the emotional uh charge you get</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.960" end="01:21:36.719" style="s2">from</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.280" end="01:21:39.600" style="s2">hugging is</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.719" end="01:21:41.440" style="s2">valuable for the obvious reasons and</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.600" end="01:21:43.440" style="s2">that that particular mechanism</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.440" end="01:21:44.880" style="s2">has a long probably unbroken history</p>
<p begin="01:21:43.440" end="01:21:45.280" style="s2">that goes back 10 million years is</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.880" end="01:21:47.600" style="s2">pretty</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.280" end="01:21:49.280" style="s2">pretty fascinating yeah no that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.600" end="01:21:53.120" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.280" end="01:21:56.400" style="s2">all right well this is a weird one yes</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.120" end="01:21:58.480" style="s2">sorry guys um here we are at the end</p>
<p begin="01:21:56.400" end="01:21:59.520" style="s2">at the end um we will probably be back</p>

<p begin="01:22:07.520" end="01:22:11.120" style="s2">um at which point i think it will have</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.520" end="01:22:12.080" style="s2">rained here and perhaps our brains will</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.120" end="01:22:13.760" style="s2">have returned somewhat</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.080" end="01:22:16.800" style="s2">normal i can hope that would be</p>
