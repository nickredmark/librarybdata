<p begin="00:00:04.730" end="00:00:13.830" style="s2">soon after the election there was this</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.790" end="00:00:15.540" style="s2">very very strange incident at the annual</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.830" end="00:00:18.270" style="s2">meeting of the National Policy Institute</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.540" end="00:00:20.730" style="s2">the NPI and that&#39;s a very innocuous name</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.270" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">for an organization that many people</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.730" end="00:00:25.890" style="s2">believe is sort of you know if not if</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:29.670" style="s2">not you know white you know National is</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.890" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">very very you know far-right and at its</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.670" end="00:00:33.420" style="s2">head at the time was Richard Spencer</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">he&#39;s also the fellow who founded the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.420" end="00:00:37.200" style="s2">alternative right and was a trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:37.559" style="s2">supporter at the time at all and so on</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.200" end="00:00:40.620" style="s2">and so on</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.559" end="00:00:43.590" style="s2">now what was strange about this meeting</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.620" end="00:00:45.539" style="s2">was that at the beginning of it</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.590" end="00:00:47.700" style="s2">Spencer was very excited about Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.539" end="00:00:49.770" style="s2">victory so to start the meeting by</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.700" end="00:00:52.530" style="s2">addressing the crowd and said hail Trump</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.770" end="00:00:55.770" style="s2">now hail are a hero you know hail our</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:00:57.809" style="s2">victory we made this happen we dream</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.770" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">Trump into the White House or something</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.809" end="00:01:03.449" style="s2">along these lines now that the video</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:05.040" style="s2">from that meeting that turned up on all</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.449" end="00:01:06.270" style="s2">you know all the regular press around</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.040" end="00:01:08.880" style="s2">the world and all that but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.270" end="00:01:11.760" style="s2">fella named Harvey Bishop who is a New</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.880" end="00:01:15.330" style="s2">Thought blogger now New Thought is named</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.760" end="00:01:17.640" style="s2">for a generic kind of philosophy called</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:20.310" style="s2">mental science positive thinking a</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.640" end="00:01:23.220" style="s2">simple way to think of it is that you</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.310" end="00:01:25.830" style="s2">know thoughts are causative as I said</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.220" end="00:01:28.770" style="s2">earlier somehow what&#39;s inside our head</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.830" end="00:01:30.420" style="s2">unlike Vegas what&#39;s in the mind does</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.770" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t always stay there what happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.420" end="00:01:35.159" style="s2">in the mind doesn&#39;t always stay there so</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:37.409" style="s2">New Thought philosophy is that you can</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.159" end="00:01:39.240" style="s2">create we create a reality thoughts that</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.409" end="00:01:41.220" style="s2">causative we project out into the world</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.240" end="00:01:42.390" style="s2">the kind of reality that that we want</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.220" end="00:01:44.280" style="s2">was just kind of magic</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.390" end="00:01:45.780" style="s2">yep Matt&#39;s absolutely is magic and we do</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.280" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">this unconsciously it&#39;s magic when you</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.780" end="00:01:52.640" style="s2">you know you&#39;re doing it and you can you</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:54.720" style="s2">can kind of do it at will I guess and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.640" end="00:01:56.549" style="s2">this ship who&#39;s you know writes about</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.720" end="00:01:58.590" style="s2">new thought all the stuff about we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.549" end="00:02:00.719" style="s2">made this happen we dream this into</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.590" end="00:02:02.610" style="s2">reality that sounded a lot like the kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.719" end="00:02:05.070" style="s2">of things that people practice mental</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.610" end="00:02:08.369" style="s2">science and you thought do Trump himself</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.070" end="00:02:11.820" style="s2">is a devotee of New Thought you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.369" end="00:02:13.650" style="s2">he&#39;s a follower of norman vincent peale</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.820" end="00:02:15.720" style="s2">author of the power of positive thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.650" end="00:02:21.390" style="s2">he went to his sermons when he was a boy</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.720" end="00:02:22.860" style="s2">he went there Trump well I say what I</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.390" end="00:02:24.390" style="s2">say whether he&#39;s using magic but he</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.860" end="00:02:25.890" style="s2">certainly is a devotee of positive</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.390" end="00:02:27.540" style="s2">thinking positive thinking has its roots</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.890" end="00:02:29.930" style="s2">and you thought new thought has its</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.540" end="00:02:32.100" style="s2">roots in 19th century occultism and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.930" end="00:02:34.560" style="s2">that&#39;s one side of it the other side is</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.100" end="00:02:36.150" style="s2">the Chaos magic side which I say in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.560" end="00:02:38.700" style="s2">book that he probably has never heard of</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.150" end="00:02:41.010" style="s2">it but he seems to do it naturally he</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.700" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">seems to have a natural sort of talent</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.010" end="00:02:46.590" style="s2">for the ways in which Kaos magicians are</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:51.000" style="s2">said to operate you know the Soviet</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.590" end="00:02:53.660" style="s2">glamour creating chaos moving in and out</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.000" end="00:02:56.250" style="s2">of realities adopting truth and</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.660" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">falsehood as just beliefs that you have</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.250" end="00:02:59.190" style="s2">temporarily and you dismiss them and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:00.870" style="s2">don&#39;t longer do but just the what the</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.190" end="00:03:03.090" style="s2">one thing that really sort of sold me on</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.870" end="00:03:05.160" style="s2">there being kind of a similar morphology</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.090" end="00:03:06.810" style="s2">let&#39;s say between New Thought which</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.160" end="00:03:07.950" style="s2">generally seems kind of innocuous I mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.810" end="00:03:11.130" style="s2">Norman Vincent Peale you know he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.950" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">sober you know conservative Reverend and</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.130" end="00:03:15.090" style="s2">the Chaos magic tends to be a bit more</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:16.800" style="s2">wild in punky and and and and dangerous</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.090" end="00:03:19.170" style="s2">but they&#39;re both results-driven</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.800" end="00:03:22.050" style="s2">they&#39;re both very specific about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.170" end="00:03:23.610" style="s2">not about you know a mystical experience</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.050" end="00:03:24.209" style="s2">it&#39;s not about you know finding your</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.610" end="00:03:25.440" style="s2">higher-self</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.209" end="00:03:28.080" style="s2">it&#39;s about having some effect in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.440" end="00:03:29.519" style="s2">real world and and they&#39;re very specific</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.080" end="00:03:31.500" style="s2">about it and and again it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.519" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">it&#39;s not like expect a miracle it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.500" end="00:03:35.459" style="s2">you have to focus on something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:37.080" style="s2">doable and just needs a little a little</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.459" end="00:03:39.450" style="s2">bit more of a nudge and you&#39;re saying no</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.080" end="00:03:42.180" style="s2">Trump&#39;s victory was just the teetered</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.450" end="00:03:44.700" style="s2">here and there so if I&#39;m saying if if</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.180" end="00:03:47.370" style="s2">you allow for the possibility of in some</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.700" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">way the mind group mind in some way</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.370" end="00:03:51.989" style="s2">being to affect things that well just in</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:54.330" style="s2">chaos theory you know sensitivity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.989" end="00:03:56.100" style="s2">initial conditions in a little butterfly</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.330" end="00:03:59.370" style="s2">flapping over here make something over</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:00.690" style="s2">there so who knows if nudge of some way</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.370" end="00:04:02.100" style="s2">and this is a word that they used in</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.690" end="00:04:04.800" style="s2">Paris magic you can even nudge it in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.100" end="00:04:07.230" style="s2">certain way give it a spin and then it</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.800" end="00:04:09.239" style="s2">comes to the the result that you thought</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.230" end="00:04:11.700" style="s2">you want but in the long run the idea</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.239" end="00:04:14.790" style="s2">was that somehow the people on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:19.979" style="s2">alt-right we had used the Internet as a</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.790" end="00:04:21.989" style="s2">way to propagate what-what means you</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.979" end="00:04:22.540" style="s2">know Richard Dawkins term for this kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.989" end="00:04:24.850" style="s2">of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.540" end="00:04:28.600" style="s2">Jeane kind of thing so we that happens</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.850" end="00:04:31.060" style="s2">anyway without magic but they were using</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.600" end="00:04:33.070" style="s2">one meme in particular which was of this</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.060" end="00:04:34.870" style="s2">cartoon character known known as Pepe</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.070" end="00:04:38.260" style="s2">the Frog who was a very harmless</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.870" end="00:04:39.940" style="s2">amphibian he got drawn into this as I</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.260" end="00:04:43.210" style="s2">cut what they called the sigil and the</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.940" end="00:04:45.760" style="s2">sigil is a kind of symbol or image that</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.210" end="00:04:47.830" style="s2">contains you know magical powers magical</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.760" end="00:04:49.360" style="s2">energies the magician&#39;s intention of his</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.830" end="00:04:51.040" style="s2">will and his imagination and</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.360" end="00:04:53.110" style="s2">traditionally you make you know you draw</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.040" end="00:04:57.580" style="s2">one you make one you know that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.110" end="00:05:00.910" style="s2">thing but what&#39;s called meme magic is an</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.580" end="00:05:06.280" style="s2">offshoot of something called chaos magic</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.910" end="00:05:08.470" style="s2">and you can understand chaos magic by</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.280" end="00:05:10.960" style="s2">thinking of it as something like found</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.470" end="00:05:12.490" style="s2">art you know there&#39;s traditional art</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.960" end="00:05:14.680" style="s2">where the painter paints something and</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.490" end="00:05:16.600" style="s2">works on it and the idea that this</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.680" end="00:05:18.220" style="s2">becomes a focus for intention yes</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.600" end="00:05:20.170" style="s2">exactly I so the Internet becomes this</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.220" end="00:05:23.620" style="s2">kind of the realm in which the magic</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.170" end="00:05:26.710" style="s2">takes place and long story short what</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.620" end="00:05:28.480" style="s2">what people start how this became</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.710" end="00:05:30.370" style="s2">something that people were aware of was</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.480" end="00:05:32.230" style="s2">that people were posting all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.370" end="00:05:33.700" style="s2">and they started to see these strange</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.230" end="00:05:35.440" style="s2">coincidences between what they were</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.700" end="00:05:38.410" style="s2">posting and stuff happening in the real</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.440" end="00:05:40.780" style="s2">world and this got coined syncro</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.410" end="00:05:43.270" style="s2">mysticism which is a kind of techno</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.780" end="00:05:45.040" style="s2">update to Jung&#39;s a notion of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.270" end="00:05:46.930" style="s2">synchronicity which is when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.040" end="00:05:48.640" style="s2">something something taking place in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.930" end="00:05:50.260" style="s2">inner world and something in the outer</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.640" end="00:05:53.230" style="s2">world and they&#39;re absolutely connected</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.260" end="00:05:55.360" style="s2">in some indubitable meaningful way but</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.230" end="00:05:56.980" style="s2">there&#39;s no causal connection you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.360" end="00:05:58.450" style="s2">there&#39;s no there&#39;s no way that one or</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.980" end="00:06:00.220" style="s2">the other is linked in the usual ways</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.450" end="00:06:03.460" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we people isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.220" end="00:06:06.670" style="s2">meaningful coincidence so this mean</p>

<p begin="00:06:06.670" end="00:06:11.110" style="s2">imagination inside our heads even have</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.700" end="00:06:12.850" style="s2">the internet out there so the Internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.110" end="00:06:16.360" style="s2">is a kind of externalized imagination</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.850" end="00:06:19.210" style="s2">and and makes sense because more and</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.360" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">more regular world is in this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.210" end="00:06:23.290" style="s2">strange interface between its</p>

<p begin="00:06:27.250" end="00:06:30.999" style="s2">to be more lifelike so everything&#39;s HD</p>

<p begin="00:06:32.439" end="00:06:36.879" style="s2">stuff like that so again as I said</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.239" end="00:06:38.769" style="s2">earlier there&#39;s this kind of interchange</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.879" end="00:06:40.749" style="s2">going on between reality and its</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.769" end="00:06:44.110" style="s2">representation so it makes sense in some</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.749" end="00:06:46.299" style="s2">way that stuff happening on the internet</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.110" end="00:06:48.389" style="s2">would find it echo out in the world so</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.299" end="00:06:50.319" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the theory behind it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.389" end="00:06:51.639" style="s2">when people notice that this was</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.319" end="00:06:53.199" style="s2">happening they said okay what can we</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.639" end="00:06:55.449" style="s2">make it happen on purpose I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.199" end="00:06:56.679" style="s2">not saying that one group of people got</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.449" end="00:06:58.569" style="s2">together and did it but it was almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.679" end="00:07:00.339" style="s2">like self generated yeah I mean there</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.569" end="00:07:01.899" style="s2">was some I&#39;m assuming that some people</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.339" end="00:07:03.669" style="s2">started it but then when he launched</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.899" end="00:07:06.029" style="s2">these things they get picked up out</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.669" end="00:07:08.499" style="s2">there and you know there was a basically</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.029" end="00:07:10.239" style="s2">I&#39;m not saying every person who did it</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.499" end="00:07:11.469" style="s2">was consciously saying you know okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.239" end="00:07:13.089" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna do this but some people were</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.469" end="00:07:14.529" style="s2">some people were posting things say hey</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.089" end="00:07:16.989" style="s2">look one of the things that happened</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.529" end="00:07:19.269" style="s2">they would post things on these sites</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.989" end="00:07:21.789" style="s2">and the you&#39;re anonymous when you post</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.269" end="00:07:23.349" style="s2">them but you get a number there&#39;s an 8 8</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.789" end="00:07:26.379" style="s2">digit number is assigned to your post</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.349" end="00:07:28.119" style="s2">and people kept seeing when they posted</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.379" end="00:07:32.289" style="s2">stuff about pepie post itself about</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.119" end="00:07:33.969" style="s2">Trump there would be you know duplicates</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.289" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">or triplicates or four of the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.969" end="00:07:38.319" style="s2">number so it seems some kind of approval</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:39.819" style="s2">it&#39;s somehow you know do more of that</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.319" end="00:07:41.469" style="s2">you know and they were betting which</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.819" end="00:07:43.059" style="s2">were they going to get a double they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.469" end="00:07:44.619" style="s2">going to get a trip you know all this</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.059" end="00:07:47.259" style="s2">kind of thing so there seems to be some</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.619" end="00:07:50.199" style="s2">kind of response you know from from the</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.259" end="00:07:52.050" style="s2">medium media that they were using there</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.199" end="00:07:53.919" style="s2">was a kind of chaos magic going on</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.050" end="00:07:56.199" style="s2">there&#39;s a couple of interesting things a</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.919" end="00:08:00.189" style="s2">one that the narrowness of Trump&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.199" end="00:08:01.689" style="s2">victory the the condition it was a it</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.189" end="00:08:03.129" style="s2">was an incredibly narrow victory it was</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.689" end="00:08:05.049" style="s2">almost like if you could see it as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.129" end="00:08:06.129" style="s2">kind of reverse miracle if you didn&#39;t if</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.049" end="00:08:08.439" style="s2">you didn&#39;t want him to be elected you</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.129" end="00:08:10.089" style="s2">could see it was a reverse miracle there</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.439" end="00:08:11.769" style="s2">was some kind of inevitability to it</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.089" end="00:08:13.779" style="s2">that despite the fact he got three</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.769" end="00:08:15.909" style="s2">million less votes he was elected but</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.779" end="00:08:17.229" style="s2">also I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.909" end="00:08:20.469" style="s2">Peterson talking about the frog</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.229" end="00:08:24.009" style="s2">symbolism and how and how you have I</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.469" end="00:08:26.439" style="s2">haven&#39;t so he he says this was the most</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.009" end="00:08:29.139" style="s2">intense synchronicities he ever he ever</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.439" end="00:08:32.529" style="s2">saw as he started becoming aware of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.139" end="00:08:35.379" style="s2">the frog represented so the Frog the</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.529" end="00:08:37.809" style="s2">Frog is between categories so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.379" end="00:08:42.429" style="s2">symbolically it&#39;s between categories and</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.809" end="00:08:44.200" style="s2">also symbolically the frog was the the</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.429" end="00:08:45.950" style="s2">deity of Keck</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.200" end="00:08:48.110" style="s2">well that&#39;s the other thing all these</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.950" end="00:08:50.660" style="s2">strange weird coincidence is the ancient</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.110" end="00:08:53.180" style="s2">Egyptian god of heck is a frog and</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.660" end="00:08:54.320" style="s2">what&#39;s kept the god of chaos and what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.180" end="00:08:58.910" style="s2">the one word that you would characterize</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.320" end="00:09:00.470" style="s2">Trump&#39;s you know mo chaos so hey it all</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.910" end="00:09:02.810" style="s2">seems to make sense because certainly</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.470" end="00:09:04.430" style="s2">within the circle surrounding Trump like</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.810" end="00:09:06.740" style="s2">Steve Bannon for example talks about</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.430" end="00:09:09.440" style="s2">Judea Savola and yes so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.740" end="00:09:11.510" style="s2">certainly an awareness and affinity for</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.440" end="00:09:13.940" style="s2">the occult within the we didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.510" end="00:09:16.399" style="s2">well that was the other thing that sent</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.940" end="00:09:19.339" style="s2">me thinking like yes it&#39;s for the people</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.399" end="00:09:21.110" style="s2">watching who&#39;s Judas of all in in</p>

<p begin="00:09:43.209" end="00:09:49.310" style="s2">global tea party a sort of thing in it</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.860" end="00:09:52.279" style="s2">was that as you say Bannon named Chuck</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.310" end="00:09:54.260" style="s2">Julius Evelyn now if you know who Jesus</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.279" end="00:09:56.720" style="s2">Evelyn is you know that he was the 20th</p>

<p begin="00:09:56.720" end="00:10:03.260" style="s2">far-right political views he&#39;s brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:06.320" style="s2">very controversial he was called the</p>

<p begin="00:10:19.310" end="00:10:23.720" style="s2">the end he gave up on the Italians and</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:26.180" style="s2">he gave up on Mussolini because they</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.720" end="00:10:27.440" style="s2">weren&#39;t fascist enough for him he had</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.180" end="00:10:30.050" style="s2">this vision of a kind of absolute</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.440" end="00:10:33.440" style="s2">fascism it&#39;s kind of theocratic kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.050" end="00:10:36.200" style="s2">state and then he tried to get his ideas</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.440" end="00:10:38.060" style="s2">across to you know people close to</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.200" end="00:10:41.260" style="s2">Hitler but in the long run they they</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.060" end="00:10:47.120" style="s2">didn&#39;t adopt him and then after the war</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.260" end="00:10:49.640" style="s2">he was this kind of fat shadowy figure</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.120" end="00:10:52.190" style="s2">in the background the the the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.640" end="00:10:54.500" style="s2">the intellectual provided material about</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.190" end="00:10:57.070" style="s2">magic and oh yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.500" end="00:11:00.590" style="s2">and he talks precisely about the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.070" end="00:11:02.390" style="s2">using the mind to create reality but I</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.590" end="00:11:03.770" style="s2">would say and so he died again like gap</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.390" end="00:11:05.630" style="s2">so he died there really so the idea I</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.770" end="00:11:07.220" style="s2">mean what was saying is the idea of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.630" end="00:11:08.750" style="s2">this was consciously created by a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.220" end="00:11:11.030" style="s2">certain number of people is not is not</p>

<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.910" style="s2">sort of saying I&#39;m not saying they did</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.240" end="00:11:21.620" style="s2">this I&#39;m saying it looks like all this</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.910" end="00:11:24.530" style="s2">is possible and everything is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.620" end="00:11:27.820" style="s2">lined up and well in the long run yes I</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.530" end="00:11:29.720" style="s2">do say it&#39;s not inconceivable because I</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.820" end="00:11:32.270" style="s2">personally accept the reality of</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.720" end="00:11:34.460" style="s2">synchronicities I&#39;ve had too many of</p>

<p begin="00:11:34.460" end="00:11:41.030" style="s2">sorts of things and okay if and I would</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.660" end="00:11:44.150" style="s2">say my definition of magic is induced</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.030" end="00:11:46.550" style="s2">synchronicity they happen can you make</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.150" end="00:11:47.930" style="s2">them happen and I could say that&#39;s what</p>

<p begin="00:14:37.170" end="00:14:41.790" style="s2">early nineties I mean that that that</p>

<p begin="00:14:41.790" end="00:14:44.519" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t go down that well with Putin</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.259" end="00:14:46.019" style="s2">either because he&#39;s talking about kind</p>

<p begin="00:14:51.209" end="00:14:54.709" style="s2">whole I guess it&#39;s a whole idea it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.709" end="00:14:58.369" style="s2">it&#39;s nationalistic but it&#39;s the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.709" end="00:15:02.249" style="s2">well the idea that the end of history</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.369" end="00:15:04.350" style="s2">arrived when you know free market values</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.249" end="00:15:04.890" style="s2">and liberal democracy have spread around</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.350" end="00:15:07.020" style="s2">the whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.890" end="00:15:09.480" style="s2">I mean for some people yes clap hands</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.020" end="00:15:10.950" style="s2">other people like Dugan and others say</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.480" end="00:15:12.240" style="s2">so this is no they so this is the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.950" end="00:15:14.160" style="s2">being just turned into a market place</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.240" end="00:15:15.840" style="s2">you know for them you know the</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.160" end="00:15:19.020" style="s2">globalization for them is basically</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.840" end="00:15:21.150" style="s2">meaning that you know wherever the US or</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.020" end="00:15:22.680" style="s2">the Western the Western powers go and</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.150" end="00:15:24.330" style="s2">liberate people it&#39;s basically to open</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.680" end="00:15:26.400" style="s2">up a new market and you know we have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.330" end="00:15:28.620" style="s2">say you know there&#39;s a lot to be said</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.400" end="00:15:30.480" style="s2">for that at that point of view but his</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.620" end="00:15:32.910" style="s2">alternative to that is this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.480" end="00:15:34.920" style="s2">theocratic he talks about having seeing</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.910" end="00:15:38.700" style="s2">a fascist state from Vladivostok to</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.920" end="00:15:41.340" style="s2">Dublin and he talks about somebody</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.700" end="00:15:43.800" style="s2">called Eurasia and Eurasia is the idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.340" end="00:15:45.990" style="s2">that Russia is not a backward cousin of</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.800" end="00:15:48.510" style="s2">Europe who&#39;s never quite catching up to</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.990" end="00:15:51.030" style="s2">European Western ways it&#39;s a completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.510" end="00:15:52.440" style="s2">new civilization of its own as different</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.030" end="00:15:56.310" style="s2">routes different influences different</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.440" end="00:15:58.290" style="s2">aims different values and he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.310" end="00:15:59.280" style="s2">rather than this linear idea of history</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.290" end="00:16:01.710" style="s2">of being you know there&#39;s a beginning</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.280" end="00:16:04.140" style="s2">and you know it&#39;s just cumulative it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.710" end="00:16:05.760" style="s2">more like there&#39;s individual cultures it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.140" end="00:16:07.470" style="s2">goes back to a German historian and</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.760" end="00:16:09.810" style="s2">oswald spengler they wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.470" end="00:16:11.120" style="s2">the decline of the West incidentally but</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.810" end="00:16:13.350" style="s2">he talked about rather than</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.120" end="00:16:15.000" style="s2">civilizations or history being this</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.350" end="00:16:16.440" style="s2">linear thing with one civilization</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.000" end="00:16:17.370" style="s2">growing on top of the other were they&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:16:17.370" end="00:16:21.240" style="s2">and they have their own value so that</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.780" end="00:16:23.700" style="s2">there&#39;s not one mathematics there&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.240" end="00:16:25.170" style="s2">know Persian mathematics and there&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:16:25.170" end="00:16:28.770" style="s2">culture any case that&#39;s the idea and</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.940" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">again that&#39;s very much along the lines</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.770" end="00:16:32.700" style="s2">not only in the right not only sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:34.710" style="s2">thing do again century but also in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.700" end="00:16:36.480" style="s2">left the whole idea that you know oh</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.890" end="00:20:04.450" style="s2">to you it&#39;s not an automatic process it</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.350" end="00:20:06.250" style="s2">isn&#39;t the class war you know like oh the</p>

<p begin="00:20:13.420" end="00:20:17.410" style="s2">kind of try and change it I think at all</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.730" end="00:20:20.080" style="s2">times it&#39;s very good to be aware of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.410" end="00:20:22.570" style="s2">what&#39;s going on inside your head I think</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.080" end="00:20:24.820" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s the key and if you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.570" end="00:20:26.740" style="s2">have things going on there then other</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.820" end="00:20:28.240" style="s2">things will be will be in there okay so</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.740" end="00:20:30.040" style="s2">I said what happens in the mind doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.240" end="00:20:31.690" style="s2">know necessarily always stay there but</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.040" end="00:20:34.090" style="s2">it might what happens in somebody else&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.690" end="00:20:36.010" style="s2">mind what might wind up inside yours too</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.090" end="00:20:38.080" style="s2">so the whole idea of wakefulness</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.010" end="00:20:40.750" style="s2">attention all these things which have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.080" end="00:20:41.980" style="s2">kind of cliche but an all character to</p>

<p begin="00:20:41.980" end="00:20:46.870" style="s2">they&#39;re real and again it doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.290" end="00:20:48.070" style="s2">you know shouting down Trump or doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.870" end="00:20:49.810" style="s2">anti-trump stuff or something it just</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.070" end="00:20:51.490" style="s2">means being very very aware in a way</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.810" end="00:20:53.890" style="s2">because I think in these times when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.490" end="00:20:57.220" style="s2">very it&#39;s it is sensitivity to initial</p>

<p begin="00:21:16.660" end="00:21:21.970" style="s2">be critical about it but we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.770" end="00:21:23.650" style="s2">really prepared how to deal with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.970" end="00:21:25.500" style="s2">positively and I don&#39;t mean in the sense</p>

<p begin="00:21:33.540" end="00:21:38.270" style="s2">things I I like to think of it as there</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:40.770" style="s2">was the time we couldn&#39;t talk about sex</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.270" end="00:21:42.930" style="s2">without it you just couldn&#39;t talk about</p>

<p begin="00:21:49.830" end="00:21:53.490" style="s2">of ways very clinically very frank and</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.020" end="00:21:54.750" style="s2">straightforward and it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.490" end="00:21:57.600" style="s2">absolutely uninteresting in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.750" end="00:21:59.670" style="s2">but we still can&#39;t talk about the occult</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.600" end="00:22:01.860" style="s2">or magic in that way you still get the</p>

<p begin="00:22:48.660" end="00:22:52.980" style="s2">is one of the things gaps were felt when</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.580" end="00:22:54.630" style="s2">in Germany in the 20s because he was</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.980" end="00:22:56.460" style="s2">around some of the early Nazi rallies</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.630" end="00:22:59.400" style="s2">and he said and this is why he talks</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.460" end="00:23:02.130" style="s2">about that those group rallies precisely</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.400" end="00:23:04.410" style="s2">as the expression of the magical</p>

<p begin="00:23:11.430" end="00:23:15.240" style="s2">below below the rational line and he</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.040" end="00:23:17.820" style="s2">talks about how when he went to these</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.240" end="00:23:19.680" style="s2">rallies even though he resisted it he</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.820" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">could feel you could feel the kind of</p>

<p begin="00:23:22.710" end="00:23:25.920" style="s2">but people in you know science people</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.780" end="00:23:28.020" style="s2">like Rupert Sheldrake and people like</p>
