<p begin="00:00:03.629" end="00:00:10.139" style="s2">livestream sort of podcast Q&amp;A section</p>
<p begin="00:00:06.779" end="00:00:12.360" style="s2">what this is is a video in which Heather</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.139" end="00:00:14.340" style="s2">and I are going to speak into the camera</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.360" end="00:00:16.230" style="s2">and record the answers to the questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.340" end="00:00:17.670" style="s2">that you filed over super chat the</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.230" end="00:00:19.380" style="s2">reason that we are not doing this live</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.670" end="00:00:22.769" style="s2">is that we have experienced the most</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.380" end="00:00:25.289" style="s2">bizarre and spectacular set of seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.769" end="00:00:27.900" style="s2">unrelated technical glitches all in a</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.289" end="00:00:30.210" style="s2">row it&#39;s hard to fathom we&#39;ve had three</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.900" end="00:00:33.480" style="s2">separate computers fail seemingly</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.210" end="00:00:35.670" style="s2">independently and so we we had that many</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.480" end="00:00:39.780" style="s2">computers in the room well there you go</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.670" end="00:00:42.120" style="s2">now you do yeah as a stopgap measure we</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.780" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">have decided to take up drinking like</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.120" end="00:00:50.370" style="s2">any adult would in this circumstance</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:53.789" style="s2">Cheers alright I feel better already</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.370" end="00:00:55.879" style="s2">mmm-hmm okay so we are going to address</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.789" end="00:00:57.149" style="s2">I no longer have this up because your</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.879" end="00:00:58.949" style="s2">questions</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.149" end="00:01:01.260" style="s2">oh so keep talking for a minute while I</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.949" end="00:01:03.860" style="s2">find this talk yeah speaking into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.260" end="00:01:05.610" style="s2">camera and I&#39;m saying things that are</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.860" end="00:01:08.220" style="s2">you know here&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.610" end="00:01:10.979" style="s2">I am wondering in light of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.220" end="00:01:12.900" style="s2">spectacular set of technical glitches if</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.979" end="00:01:15.270" style="s2">we should get out of the livestream</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.900" end="00:01:18.030" style="s2">business all together and I should take</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.270" end="00:01:20.759" style="s2">up Instagram modeling to substitute for</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.030" end="00:01:22.860" style="s2">the income like whole body or hand model</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.759" end="00:01:24.360" style="s2">or any particular thing gotten that far</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.860" end="00:01:26.400" style="s2">was just kind of thinking it through</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.360" end="00:01:28.350" style="s2">okay alright that&#39;s something to think</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.400" end="00:01:31.140" style="s2">about for sure for sure for sure for</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.350" end="00:01:32.759" style="s2">sure yes alright okay and I apologize</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.140" end="00:01:36.270" style="s2">for that image to those of you watching</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.759" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">at home oh well I mean last time you put</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.270" end="00:01:40.320" style="s2">in everyone&#39;s head the idea of Sam</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:43.049" style="s2">Harrison a french maid outfit I did and</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.320" end="00:01:45.119" style="s2">now it&#39;s um you as an Instagram model</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.049" end="00:01:48.299" style="s2">awesome certain I think that&#39;s fine okay</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.119" end="00:01:50.210" style="s2">fair enough it&#39;s fine for me okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.299" end="00:01:52.350" style="s2">was actually going to start by</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.210" end="00:01:54.540" style="s2">addressing a question that came in on</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.350" end="00:01:56.310" style="s2">the last live streams Q&amp;A about why</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.540" end="00:01:59.250" style="s2">India and other Southeast Asian</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.310" end="00:02:03.210" style="s2">countries have apparently such lower</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.250" end="00:02:05.250" style="s2">rates of koban 19and infection by size</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.210" end="00:02:07.770" style="s2">cope too then one would normally expect</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.250" end="00:02:11.160" style="s2">so I&#39;m gonna just start by reading you I</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.770" end="00:02:13.440" style="s2">can find my list here a list of</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.160" end="00:02:16.190" style="s2">possibilities that&#39;s been that was in</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.440" end="00:02:19.260" style="s2">print sent to us by our friend Keiko</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.190" end="00:02:22.680" style="s2">it&#39;s not it&#39;s just a newspaper article I</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.260" end="00:02:24.090" style="s2">haven&#39;t found anything written in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.680" end="00:02:26.040" style="s2">scientific literature about this but</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.090" end="00:02:28.500" style="s2">here&#39;s a list of six possibilities that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.040" end="00:02:30.720" style="s2">I&#39;m just gonna fly by you and let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.500" end="00:02:32.670" style="s2">let&#39;s talk a little bit about what you</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.720" end="00:02:34.739" style="s2">think of each of them after I read all</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.670" end="00:02:40.440" style="s2">of them great I suspect we will have</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.739" end="00:02:42.510" style="s2">similar responses so why does India and</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.440" end="00:02:44.459" style="s2">other Southeast Asian countries but</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.510" end="00:02:46.099" style="s2">especially Linda Howe India have lower</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.459" end="00:02:50.010" style="s2">than expected rates of CO mid-nineteen</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.099" end="00:02:52.319" style="s2">warmer and more humid weather protection</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.010" end="00:02:54.150" style="s2">offered by the old TB vaccine that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.319" end="00:02:57.480" style="s2">BCG vaccine which we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.150" end="00:02:59.610" style="s2">before here more people in India will</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.480" end="00:03:02.550" style="s2">have had the BCG vaccine of all ages</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.610" end="00:03:04.349" style="s2">then it&#39;s only people above a certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.550" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">age I don&#39;t even know what in the US</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.349" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">they would have had BCG potentially</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.060" style="s2">better immune response among those in</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:13.730" style="s2">the Indian subcontinent compared to</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.060" end="00:03:17.730" style="s2">people say in Europe or the u.s. a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.730" end="00:03:19.379" style="s2">weaker strain of the virus in India more</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.730" end="00:03:21.120" style="s2">effective and earlier physical</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.379" end="00:03:22.379" style="s2">distancing relative to when Koba 19 was</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.120" end="00:03:25.650" style="s2">first spreading through these countries</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.379" end="00:03:29.879" style="s2">so this again raises this question of if</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.650" end="00:03:31.860" style="s2">it didn&#39;t get to India until say late</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.879" end="00:03:33.239" style="s2">March at the point that the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.860" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">world had mostly figured out what was</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.239" end="00:03:38.540" style="s2">going on India was in a much better</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:40.830" style="s2">position to watch and to put in place</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.540" end="00:03:42.870" style="s2">social distancing in lockdown measures</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.830" end="00:03:45.810" style="s2">that looked like it was at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.870" end="00:03:49.110" style="s2">as other countries but was in fact laid</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.810" end="00:03:51.810" style="s2">earlier relative to when the infection</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.110" end="00:03:53.640" style="s2">hit their country and then finally lower</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.810" end="00:03:55.080" style="s2">testing numbers as compared to the rest</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.640" end="00:03:56.939" style="s2">of the world which is both true but</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.080" end="00:03:58.739" style="s2">seems by all accounts to be insufficient</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.939" end="00:04:01.739" style="s2">so it is partially explanatory but not</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.739" end="00:04:03.110" style="s2">wholly explanatory of the lower than</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.739" end="00:04:06.000" style="s2">expected rates of co19</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.110" end="00:04:09.900" style="s2">any reactions yeah well first of all</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.000" end="00:04:12.540" style="s2">that list is are any of the mutually</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.900" end="00:04:14.640" style="s2">exclusive I don&#39;t think so I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.540" end="00:04:17.459" style="s2">so so we&#39;re looking for a set that</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.640" end="00:04:19.799" style="s2">explains the discrepancy between the</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.459" end="00:04:22.330" style="s2">numbers we see in the numbers that that</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.799" end="00:04:24.490" style="s2">we expect and it&#39;s also not</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.330" end="00:04:25.900" style="s2">not only a nun not only are none of</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.490" end="00:04:27.610" style="s2">these mutually exclusive but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.900" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">think this is likely to be an exhaustive</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.610" end="00:04:33.430" style="s2">list right I would say I&#39;m doubtful</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:36.250" style="s2">about the issue of warmer and more humid</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.430" end="00:04:39.909" style="s2">I see that invoked periodically I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.250" end="00:04:42.340" style="s2">heard it invoked over Florida but then</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.909" end="00:04:47.259" style="s2">there&#39;s Guayaquil exactly yeah and why</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.340" end="00:04:50.139" style="s2">Hill is remains a terrible situation and</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.259" end="00:04:52.060" style="s2">suggests that at least if there is any</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.139" end="00:04:54.129" style="s2">benefit to warmer and more humid that</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.060" end="00:04:57.009" style="s2">it&#39;s really limited and to the degree</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.129" end="00:04:58.870" style="s2">that we can control for geography as we</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.009" end="00:05:00.490" style="s2">were trying to do in the first part of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.870" end="00:05:02.979" style="s2">this livestream like comparing Norway</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.490" end="00:05:05.440" style="s2">and Sweden or Sweden and Denmark Quito</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.979" end="00:05:07.659" style="s2">Quito Guayaquil being Ecuador&#39;s largest</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.440" end="00:05:10.419" style="s2">cities key toes at altitude it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.659" end="00:05:13.030" style="s2">close to eight 9,000 feet and glide</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.419" end="00:05:16.509" style="s2">kills in the lowlands close to zero feet</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.030" end="00:05:18.279" style="s2">in altitude Quito has a far less severe</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.509" end="00:05:20.379" style="s2">situation on its hands than Guayaquil</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.279" end="00:05:23.229" style="s2">and there may well be other factors but</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.379" end="00:05:25.330" style="s2">certainly the warmer lowland climate of</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.229" end="00:05:27.279" style="s2">Guayaquil seems to have been if anything</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.330" end="00:05:30.759" style="s2">anti protective rather than protective</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.279" end="00:05:32.919" style="s2">yeah I would say India is also</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.759" end="00:05:35.860" style="s2">tremendously diverse in terms of its</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.919" end="00:05:37.270" style="s2">climate sure certainly have as places</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.860" end="00:05:38.889" style="s2">that match that description but anyway</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.270" end="00:05:41.020" style="s2">it&#39;s easily tested because the variation</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.889" end="00:05:43.659" style="s2">ought to give you a consistent pattern</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.020" end="00:05:47.020" style="s2">if that&#39;s what&#39;s causing it I would say</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.659" end="00:05:49.240" style="s2">in response to that though that well I</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.020" end="00:05:51.759" style="s2">doubt that warmer and more humid as an</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.240" end="00:05:54.699" style="s2">explanation it might be that that is a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.759" end="00:05:56.740" style="s2">proxy for people being outside yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.699" end="00:05:58.860" style="s2">that being outside more may well be</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.740" end="00:06:01.599" style="s2">protective and that also may be</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.860" end="00:06:03.669" style="s2">explanatory with regard to Florida yeah</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.599" end="00:06:05.500" style="s2">in fact I was speaking to our friend</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.669" end="00:06:07.750" style="s2">Dave who&#39;s in Florida I was asking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.500" end="00:06:09.639" style="s2">what I thought might be going on there</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.750" end="00:06:11.710" style="s2">and I said that very same thing it may</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.639" end="00:06:14.949" style="s2">be that it leads people to be outside</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.710" end="00:06:16.479" style="s2">all right the TB vaccine this also seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.949" end="00:06:18.580" style="s2">like it ought to be pretty easy to test</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.479" end="00:06:21.520" style="s2">especially I think we&#39;ve talked about it</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.580" end="00:06:23.949" style="s2">on the podcast before that in places</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.520" end="00:06:25.659" style="s2">where this old test or this old vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.949" end="00:06:27.669" style="s2">was used there are certainly people</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.659" end="00:06:28.870" style="s2">who&#39;ve arrived more recently and haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.669" end="00:06:30.370" style="s2">had it and you have to be able to test</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.870" end="00:06:33.030" style="s2">populations against each other and</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.370" end="00:06:35.850" style="s2">figure out what fraction of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.030" end="00:06:38.280" style="s2">pattern is accounted for exactly but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.850" end="00:06:39.780" style="s2">basically favorable to the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.280" end="00:06:43.139" style="s2">there&#39;s some interaction based on what</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.780" end="00:06:47.720" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen potentially better immune</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.139" end="00:06:51.360" style="s2">response again easily tested I&#39;m dubious</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.720" end="00:06:54.120" style="s2">but it is not impossible yeah but but</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.360" end="00:06:56.490" style="s2">why right like why why would we expect</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.120" end="00:06:58.470" style="s2">people on the Indian subcontinent to</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.490" end="00:07:01.710" style="s2">have a better immune response than</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.470" end="00:07:03.539" style="s2">Germans or Americans or Japanese people</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.710" end="00:07:05.639" style="s2">yeah I mean I guess I wonder a little</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.539" end="00:07:08.220" style="s2">bit whether it stops at the border with</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.639" end="00:07:10.229" style="s2">Pakistan yeah although you know the a</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.220" end="00:07:13.470" style="s2">lot of the Southeast Asian countries and</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.229" end="00:07:14.910" style="s2">I guess India South Asian but South</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.470" end="00:07:19.310" style="s2">Asian and South Asian countries seem to</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.910" end="00:07:22.759" style="s2">have a lower than expected rates okay um</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.310" end="00:07:24.840" style="s2">let&#39;s see weaker strain of the virus</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.759" end="00:07:26.909" style="s2">possible but doubtful would be very</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.840" end="00:07:29.490" style="s2">hopeful of the answers on this list</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.909" end="00:07:33.240" style="s2">maybe the best in the sense that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.490" end="00:07:35.370" style="s2">functioning in some sense as a vaccine</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.240" end="00:07:39.900" style="s2">creating more he herd immunity with less</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.370" end="00:07:43.220" style="s2">illness but if if if this weaker strain</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.900" end="00:07:45.509" style="s2">whatever exactly that means having it</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.220" end="00:07:49.250" style="s2">provided immunity against all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.509" end="00:07:51.630" style="s2">strands yeah I find it doubtful but okay</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.250" end="00:07:54.120" style="s2">more effective and earlier physical</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.630" end="00:07:55.530" style="s2">distancing relative to when kovat</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.120" end="00:07:59.099" style="s2">nineteen was first spreading for this is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.530" end="00:08:02.419" style="s2">likely that we&#39;re testing numbers as you</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.099" end="00:08:06.479" style="s2">said is true but probably inadequate yep</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.419" end="00:08:09.810" style="s2">yep all right okay so that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.479" end="00:08:12.419" style="s2">where we&#39;re at on India let&#39;s go to your</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.779" end="00:08:41.219" style="s2">of it let&#39;s say Wilson is a complex</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.880" end="00:08:44.730" style="s2">figure he is one of the Great&#39;s when it</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.219" end="00:08:48.000" style="s2">comes to ant biology he was</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.730" end="00:08:50.820" style="s2">an early pioneer in sociobiology though</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.000" end="00:08:52.740" style="s2">he is much resented for having gotten</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.820" end="00:08:57.029" style="s2">credit because he published a book under</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.740" end="00:08:59.130" style="s2">that name in my opinion late in his</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.029" end="00:09:02.760" style="s2">career he has gone a little bit off the</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.130" end="00:09:07.139" style="s2">rails in part because of a long-standing</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.760" end="00:09:09.570" style="s2">resentment against against Bill Hamilton</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.139" end="00:09:11.190" style="s2">who got credit for kin selection and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.570" end="00:09:13.440" style="s2">he&#39;s embraced group selection of which I</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.190" end="00:09:15.690" style="s2">am NOT a fan I do believe there is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.440" end="00:09:18.660" style="s2">resolution to the group selection versus</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.690" end="00:09:23.220" style="s2">kin selection debate which has yet to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.660" end="00:09:25.110" style="s2">explored fully and obviously nothing is</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.220" end="00:09:27.750" style="s2">as we expected but David Sloan Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.110" end="00:09:28.949" style="s2">and I were scheduled for a fall meeting</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.750" end="00:09:30.750" style="s2">on stage somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.949" end="00:09:34.350" style="s2">my guess is at this point we should do</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.750" end="00:09:37.949" style="s2">it online instead so David if you&#39;re out</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.350" end="00:09:41.010" style="s2">there let&#39;s consider that let&#39;s let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.949" end="00:09:43.250" style="s2">hope that we are back interacting in</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.010" end="00:09:49.050" style="s2">real life and in real time by the fall</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.250" end="00:09:50.910" style="s2">I&#39;ll drink to that as well so I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.050" end="00:09:52.319" style="s2">to jump around we will answer all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.910" end="00:09:55.380" style="s2">questions this time because there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.319" end="00:09:56.970" style="s2">that many of them and because you all</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.380" end="00:10:00.810" style="s2">put up with so many technical problems</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.970" end="00:10:02.670" style="s2">here so this one is sort of in keeping</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.810" end="00:10:04.019" style="s2">with the last question while at academia</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.670" end="00:10:06.269" style="s2">did you ever get caught up in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.019" end="00:10:08.819" style="s2">clashes against evopsych against</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.269" end="00:10:11.490" style="s2">adaptation ISM in humans by gold and</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.819" end="00:10:13.560" style="s2">rose and I would say luetin on one side</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.490" end="00:10:14.850" style="s2">versus EO Wilson Pinker Dawkins and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.560" end="00:10:15.750" style="s2">others it&#39;s an interesting list of</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.850" end="00:10:19.740" style="s2">characters</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.750" end="00:10:21.899" style="s2">James SC has listed here and this this</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.740" end="00:10:24.000" style="s2">could be the subject of an entire series</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.899" end="00:10:27.839" style="s2">of podcasts anything you want to say</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.000" end="00:10:31.920" style="s2">yeah in some sense this was the water we</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.839" end="00:10:35.100" style="s2">swam in that the laboratory the Dick</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.920" end="00:10:39.240" style="s2">Alexander laboratory that we were both</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.100" end="00:10:45.630" style="s2">members of was very much at the heart of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.240" end="00:10:48.240" style="s2">this debate and I at Dick&#39;s memorial</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.630" end="00:10:53.640" style="s2">service some months ago at a year ago at</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.240" end="00:10:55.740" style="s2">this point a friend reminded me of an</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.640" end="00:10:58.050" style="s2">incident that I had completely forgotten</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.740" end="00:11:02.010" style="s2">where Stephen Jay Gould had</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.050" end="00:11:04.410" style="s2">come to lecture at Michigan and I had</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.010" end="00:11:06.450" style="s2">thoroughly embarrassed him I did</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.410" end="00:11:08.640" style="s2">something that I sort of became known</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.450" end="00:11:10.410" style="s2">for I figured out what the devastating</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.640" end="00:11:12.149" style="s2">question to ask was and I delivered it</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.410" end="00:11:14.250" style="s2">to him it was cool not luangta slow</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.149" end="00:11:15.690" style="s2">anton came to linton came to and there</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.250" end="00:11:18.630" style="s2">was a whole different episode with</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.690" end="00:11:20.519" style="s2">bloomington um but no it was Gould in</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.630" end="00:11:23.820" style="s2">this case I had forgotten the whole</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.519" end="00:11:26.209" style="s2">thing um but in any case yeah it was fun</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.820" end="00:11:29.130" style="s2">it&#39;s one of your strengths right is</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.209" end="00:11:32.190" style="s2">listening and waiting and figuring out</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.130" end="00:11:34.170" style="s2">exactly the right incisive question so</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.190" end="00:11:36.120" style="s2">as to be simultaneously respectful and</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.170" end="00:11:37.500" style="s2">pointed well I mean the thing is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.120" end="00:11:40.050" style="s2">a question that needs to be asked and</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.500" end="00:11:42.959" style="s2">what happens is either the person on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.050" end="00:11:45.029" style="s2">other end understands the question and</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.959" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">deals with it head-on and has a good</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.029" end="00:11:49.769" style="s2">answer which you know just so delightful</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:53.160" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what everyone wants yep or</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.769" end="00:11:55.800" style="s2">or they fumble and reveal that they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.160" end="00:11:58.800" style="s2">hiding something that they knew was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.800" end="00:12:01.380" style="s2">weakness in their argument etc so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.800" end="00:12:04.290" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s um it&#39;s very important stuff I</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.380" end="00:12:07.950" style="s2">will say I don&#39;t think either side had</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.290" end="00:12:09.899" style="s2">it right we we are we come from the</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.950" end="00:12:11.490" style="s2">lineage of kin selection s but I am</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.899" end="00:12:13.770" style="s2">persuaded that the kin selection is</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.490" end="00:12:15.750" style="s2">actually had an error that they were</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.770" end="00:12:18.360" style="s2">doing the logic right but they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.750" end="00:12:21.270" style="s2">extrapolate from it far enough and that</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.360" end="00:12:23.370" style="s2">much that we trip over now is the result</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.270" end="00:12:24.660" style="s2">of the fact that they see that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.370" end="00:12:26.160" style="s2">got the logic right but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.660" end="00:12:29.360" style="s2">understand that that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.160" end="00:12:31.500" style="s2">they missed the extrapolation so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.360" end="00:12:33.839" style="s2">exactly some of what you were hoping to</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.500" end="00:12:35.160" style="s2">talk about what Davidson Wilson on stage</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:39.170" style="s2">but I would also say the question also</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.160" end="00:12:41.699" style="s2">asks sort of it at a less granular level</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.170" end="00:12:44.430" style="s2">what about clashes against adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.699" end="00:12:46.260" style="s2">ISM and humans which could be read as</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.430" end="00:12:48.240" style="s2">the kind of stuff that we saw firsthand</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.260" end="00:12:50.399" style="s2">in our undergraduate experience working</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.240" end="00:12:51.870" style="s2">with Bob Trevor&#39;s one of the other great</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.399" end="00:12:57.199" style="s2">you know perhaps the greatest living</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.870" end="00:12:59.699" style="s2">evolutionary biologist and he was</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.199" end="00:13:01.920" style="s2">constantly battling and we would hear</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.699" end="00:13:03.660" style="s2">about these battles with the people</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.920" end="00:13:05.670" style="s2">including some of the people we</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.660" end="00:13:07.680" style="s2">ourselves were taking classes from who</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.670" end="00:13:09.060" style="s2">didn&#39;t actually believe that you should</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.680" end="00:13:11.080" style="s2">be talking about things like sexual</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.060" end="00:13:13.270" style="s2">selection or reciprocal altruism</p>

<p begin="00:15:29.720" end="00:15:36.580" style="s2">yeah very efficient in that case echo I</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.830" end="00:15:40.490" style="s2">assume echo is man I guess I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.580" end="00:15:43.760" style="s2">has introduced the concept of migrating</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.490" end="00:15:46.460" style="s2">clitoris which is quite an image frankly</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.760" end="00:15:48.620" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s one of the best ones to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.460" end="00:15:51.080" style="s2">introduced on this in this podcast in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.620" end="00:15:56.150" style="s2">this yep it&#39;s a high on the list at</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.080" end="00:16:00.260" style="s2">this point so alright I don&#39;t know you</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.150" end="00:16:02.240" style="s2">know that that suggests that clitoris</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.260" end="00:16:03.230" style="s2">position relative vagina was ever</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.240" end="00:16:06.500" style="s2">anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.230" end="00:16:09.110" style="s2">and given the homology between female</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.500" end="00:16:11.570" style="s2">and male I don&#39;t know why we should</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.110" end="00:16:13.370" style="s2">expect that it was ever internal and</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.570" end="00:16:16.100" style="s2">certainly in other you know other</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.370" end="00:16:18.500" style="s2">mammals it&#39;s always where it is relative</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.100" end="00:16:22.370" style="s2">to the two structures are where they are</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.500" end="00:16:24.440" style="s2">relative to one another I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.370" end="00:16:26.390" style="s2">anyone has ever asked where a lizard</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.440" end="00:16:28.730" style="s2">clitoris is or if they have the no they</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.390" end="00:16:32.090" style="s2">can&#39;t actually so PI can so the origin</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.730" end="00:16:35.480" style="s2">is in mammals so there&#39;s there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.090" end="00:16:36.650" style="s2">lizards don&#39;t have they have a different</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.480" end="00:16:38.960" style="s2">origin of penises and they don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.650" end="00:16:43.450" style="s2">vaginas birds have something else</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.960" end="00:16:47.840" style="s2">entirely just of Chloe cos mammals have</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.450" end="00:16:49.670" style="s2">the origin of penises and vaginas and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.840" end="00:16:53.000" style="s2">it&#39;s always just where it is I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.670" end="00:16:56.780" style="s2">think they&#39;re migrating yeah what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.000" end="00:17:04.420" style="s2">situation in hyenas heavily modified</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.780" end="00:17:04.420" style="s2">external male like male like even</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.870" end="00:17:08.900" style="s2">mmm-hmm like hard to distinguish males</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.490" end="00:17:10.030" style="s2">from females if you don&#39;t know exactly</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.900" end="00:17:14.690" style="s2">what you&#39;re looking for if you&#39;re not a</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.030" end="00:17:18.830" style="s2">hyena sexual dimorphism expert very</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.690" end="00:17:22.310" style="s2">enlarged female clitoris is in spotted</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.830" end="00:17:23.570" style="s2">hyenas look like penises not so much on</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.310" end="00:17:25.570" style="s2">the other species of hyenas but</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.570" end="00:17:27.920" style="s2">specifically in its creek utakata</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.570" end="00:17:32.360" style="s2">spotted hyenas which have a strong</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.920" end="00:17:34.490" style="s2">degree of sex role reversal yep alright</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.360" end="00:17:37.299" style="s2">so anyway we fumbled around the question</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.490" end="00:17:40.790" style="s2">we fumbled around the clitoris</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.299" end="00:17:43.490" style="s2">yeah so anyway yeah I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.790" end="00:17:45.049" style="s2">very good answer I would be inclined to</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.490" end="00:17:47.240" style="s2">look a couple things up and possibly</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.049" end="00:17:49.669" style="s2">return to this question I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.240" end="00:17:53.270" style="s2">a lot to be known that I don&#39;t know off</p>
<p begin="00:17:49.669" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">the top of my head about what it means</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.270" end="00:17:58.669" style="s2">for other mammals to have a clitoris</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:18:00.980" style="s2">because obviously most mammals don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.669" end="00:18:03.890" style="s2">have sex for pleasure as far as we can</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.980" end="00:18:05.570" style="s2">tell if you do and so there&#39;s a question</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.890" end="00:18:06.740" style="s2">about what the structure is there might</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.570" end="00:18:08.740" style="s2">be something that&#39;s home all I guess but</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.740" end="00:18:11.450" style="s2">not functioning the same way well I bet</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.740" end="00:18:14.240" style="s2">banishing vanishingly little isn&#39;t known</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.450" end="00:18:17.000" style="s2">given that it was you know very recently</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.240" end="00:18:18.650" style="s2">before most medical and scientific</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.000" end="00:18:20.690" style="s2">professionals acknowledged that it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.650" end="00:18:21.710" style="s2">real and that female orgasm was real I</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.690" end="00:18:23.540" style="s2">have acknowledged this from the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.710" end="00:18:27.620" style="s2">beginning I know you okay uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.540" end="00:18:29.720" style="s2">but the idea that anyone is out there</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.620" end="00:18:32.270" style="s2">looking for this in other mammal species</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.720" end="00:18:34.640" style="s2">when it wasn&#39;t even believed to be real</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.270" end="00:18:37.220" style="s2">universally in humans yeah really</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.640" end="00:18:39.440" style="s2">unlikely yes bonobos would be a good</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.220" end="00:18:41.120" style="s2">first choice to go looking to go yes</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.440" end="00:18:44.600" style="s2">they would almost certainly have they</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.120" end="00:18:46.100" style="s2">didn&#39;t fight you and bonobo</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.600" end="00:18:48.530" style="s2">professionals would be early in the</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.100" end="00:18:51.020" style="s2">acknowledgement I would imagine yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.530" end="00:18:52.880" style="s2">yeah but in other species their version</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.020" end="00:18:56.960" style="s2">of patriarchy might be suppressing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.880" end="00:18:58.610" style="s2">information we should look at lemurs who</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.960" end="00:19:00.530" style="s2">suffer from no patriarchy at all right a</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.610" end="00:19:02.120" style="s2">male dominance and lemurs we should yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.530" end="00:19:04.850" style="s2">we should see what they have written</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.120" end="00:19:08.470" style="s2">about it good yeah all right okay</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.850" end="00:19:11.500" style="s2">yeah the room is beginning to manifest</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.470" end="00:19:14.840" style="s2">my 12 year old seeing this power boy oh</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.500" end="00:19:16.850" style="s2">wow I&#39;m gonna take back everything we</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.840" end="00:19:18.500" style="s2">just said I&#39;m gonna move this little a a</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.850" end="00:19:21.650" style="s2">little bit later so it&#39;s not quite such</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.500" end="00:19:23.270" style="s2">a such a counterpoint yeah do you think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.650" end="00:19:25.190" style="s2">that hybridization between species is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.270" end="00:19:26.870" style="s2">big contributor to genetic diversity I</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.190" end="00:19:27.919" style="s2">have often wondered about this never</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.870" end="00:19:30.470" style="s2">heard it discussed but I&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.919" end="00:19:34.940" style="s2">biologist loved the podcasts thank you</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.470" end="00:19:36.710" style="s2">um I got a response to you all right so</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.940" end="00:19:39.950" style="s2">here&#39;s the thing hybrids happen a lot</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.710" end="00:19:42.500" style="s2">more than we think they don&#39;t always do</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.950" end="00:19:44.450" style="s2">well sometimes they do really well and</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.500" end="00:19:46.370" style="s2">there&#39;s a question about what we even</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.450" end="00:19:48.919" style="s2">mean so in other words if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.370" end="00:19:49.580" style="s2">cladogram that involves a lot of forks</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.919" end="00:19:51.470" style="s2">we</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.580" end="00:19:52.970" style="s2">sort of the Assumption cladogram being</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.470" end="00:19:55.610" style="s2">an evolutionary tree an evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.970" end="00:19:57.320" style="s2">tree and you zoom in you will find that</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.610" end="00:20:01.340" style="s2">at some level what you really have is a</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.320" end="00:20:04.670" style="s2">net you don&#39;t have bifurcations are</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.340" end="00:20:08.600" style="s2">those hybridization events well no you</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.670" end="00:20:11.920" style="s2">know if you you know become fond of some</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.600" end="00:20:14.690" style="s2">person you know three towns over and you</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.920" end="00:20:15.950" style="s2">mate across some line that&#39;s larger than</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.690" end="00:20:18.530" style="s2">the usual distance it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.950" end="00:20:22.250" style="s2">hybridization event and the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.530" end="00:20:25.700" style="s2">haunts your question is that we do not</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.250" end="00:20:27.440" style="s2">have a good definition for species so I</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.700" end="00:20:31.640" style="s2">would say we have this funny little</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.440" end="00:20:33.530" style="s2">predicament I&#39;ve become enamored of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.640" end="00:20:36.140" style="s2">idea I think I&#39;m the inventor of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.530" end="00:20:39.200" style="s2">idea speciation is a good concept</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.140" end="00:20:42.590" style="s2">species is a bad concept another one</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.200" end="00:20:45.410" style="s2">would be genetic is a good concept gene</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.590" end="00:20:47.290" style="s2">is a bad concept so these are places</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.410" end="00:20:49.790" style="s2">where something happens we have a</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.290" end="00:20:52.160" style="s2">process that takes something that was</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.790" end="00:20:53.630" style="s2">once clearly not to species and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.160" end="00:20:56.090" style="s2">eventually turns it into something that</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.630" end="00:20:57.620" style="s2">clearly is to species but in between</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.090" end="00:21:01.660" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of gray and all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.620" end="00:21:03.860" style="s2">things occur so what I would suggest is</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.660" end="00:21:05.750" style="s2">hybridization happens at levels that are</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.860" end="00:21:08.480" style="s2">so low we don&#39;t call it hybridization</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.750" end="00:21:10.030" style="s2">and so late that we you know look at it</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.480" end="00:21:12.470" style="s2">and say that&#39;s just an anomaly like</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.030" end="00:21:13.970" style="s2">ligers you can make a liger but lions</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.470" end="00:21:16.460" style="s2">and tigers don&#39;t encounter each other in</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.970" end="00:21:18.440" style="s2">the wild so it&#39;s obviously just a</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.460" end="00:21:22.400" style="s2">curiosity but we have every other</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.440" end="00:21:24.980" style="s2">version of this so so I mean it raises</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.400" end="00:21:27.650" style="s2">it raises questions that we could speak</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.980" end="00:21:29.840" style="s2">for an entire academic quarter semester</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.650" end="00:21:31.880" style="s2">about at some level and you know the</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.840" end="00:21:34.160" style="s2">main one being what is a species and let</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.880" end="00:21:36.530" style="s2">therefore the lines between them but one</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.160" end="00:21:38.060" style="s2">one thing that you didn&#39;t raise I think</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.530" end="00:21:40.220" style="s2">is that this is going to be really</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.060" end="00:21:41.390" style="s2">different in different clades so</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.220" end="00:21:43.940" style="s2">vertebrates so what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.390" end="00:21:45.860" style="s2">have an evolutionary tree branching and</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.940" end="00:21:47.120" style="s2">then occasionally some of those branches</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.860" end="00:21:48.470" style="s2">come back together to meet one another</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.120" end="00:21:51.260" style="s2">it&#39;s called reticulation the</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.470" end="00:21:53.840" style="s2">reticulation event and you see a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.260" end="00:21:56.210" style="s2">less reticulation coming back together</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.840" end="00:21:58.430" style="s2">hybridization if you will in vertebrates</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.210" end="00:22:01.159" style="s2">then you do even in vertebrates and</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.430" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2">certainly than in plants or mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.159" end="00:22:05.479" style="s2">are single-celled organisms either with</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.840" end="00:22:07.340" style="s2">nuclei or not so you have all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.479" end="00:22:08.929" style="s2">reticulation events over in plant space</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.340" end="00:22:11.720" style="s2">all sorts of hybridization events and</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.929" end="00:22:13.129" style="s2">there are some clear unknown biological</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.720" end="00:22:15.080" style="s2">reasons for this things like plants</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.129" end="00:22:18.049" style="s2">don&#39;t have what&#39;s called a segregated</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.080" end="00:22:21.710" style="s2">germline they don&#39;t have separation of</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.049" end="00:22:23.830" style="s2">the basically the sexual line from the</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.710" end="00:22:26.090" style="s2">non-sexual or somatic line the soma</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.830" end="00:22:27.590" style="s2">which also affects the way they stand</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.090" end="00:22:29.570" style="s2">nests for people who are following that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.590" end="00:22:31.269" style="s2">thread of the conversation yep yep and</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.570" end="00:22:33.440" style="s2">there and there are a number of other</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.269" end="00:22:37.369" style="s2">biological reasons why you would expect</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.440" end="00:22:38.869" style="s2">reticulation or hybridization loosely</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.369" end="00:22:40.460" style="s2">synonymous terms reticulation and</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.869" end="00:22:42.349" style="s2">hybridization to be more common in</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.460" end="00:22:44.840" style="s2">plants than they aren&#39;t animals for</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.349" end="00:22:47.239" style="s2">instance and vertebrates it being</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.840" end="00:22:48.979" style="s2">extraordinarily rare at this level that</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.239" end="00:22:51.889" style="s2">we like to think of speciation happening</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.979" end="00:22:54.889" style="s2">is true but then there&#39;s also this truth</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.889" end="00:22:56.929" style="s2">that it&#39;s happening all the time at this</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.889" end="00:22:59.720" style="s2">really close up really short time skill</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.929" end="00:23:02.389" style="s2">level and not at all between you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.720" end="00:23:05.059" style="s2">rhinoceroses and that&#39;s not just because</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.389" end="00:23:06.320" style="s2">the size difference but there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.059" end="00:23:09.440" style="s2">sort of intermediate level of genetic</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.320" end="00:23:12.769" style="s2">distance where things could happen it</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.440" end="00:23:14.659" style="s2">could work but it&#39;s unlikely to for any</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.769" end="00:23:16.070" style="s2">number of reasons most of the time so I</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.659" end="00:23:17.720" style="s2">would also point out that this plays</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.070" end="00:23:19.609" style="s2">into the discussion that we have had in</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.720" end="00:23:22.669" style="s2">a couple places including on Joe Rogan</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.609" end="00:23:25.940" style="s2">about the different level of enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.669" end="00:23:26.960" style="s2">for casual sex as between males and</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.940" end="00:23:30.590" style="s2">females so this is about the</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.960" end="00:23:31.999" style="s2">rhinoceroses in the bats no okay no in</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.590" end="00:23:35.450" style="s2">that case I think it&#39;s a bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.999" end="00:23:38.210" style="s2">stretch but but from the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.450" end="00:23:42.099" style="s2">in species in which males invest nothing</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.210" end="00:23:46.309" style="s2">in offspring their willingness to</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.099" end="00:23:48.049" style="s2">hybridize will be greater because they</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.309" end="00:23:50.239" style="s2">have less to lose in other words if they</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.049" end="00:23:53.269" style="s2">fertilize a female from a different</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.239" end="00:23:55.519" style="s2">species and that tends and it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.269" end="00:23:56.899" style="s2">being a negative from the point of view</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.519" end="00:23:59.029" style="s2">of the offspring they haven&#39;t lost very</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.899" end="00:24:00.859" style="s2">much from the females perspective they</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.029" end="00:24:02.659" style="s2">will have lost a great deal but the</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.859" end="00:24:04.849" style="s2">final thing to have in this piece of</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.659" end="00:24:07.609" style="s2">conversation is that there is a very</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.849" end="00:24:08.359" style="s2">interesting phenomenon called hybrid</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.609" end="00:24:11.089" style="s2">vigor</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.359" end="00:24:13.849" style="s2">now hybrid vigor is especially visible</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.089" end="00:24:14.630" style="s2">where we have things like purebred</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.849" end="00:24:16.850" style="s2">strain</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.630" end="00:24:19.670" style="s2">purebred strange that&#39;s human beings</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.850" end="00:24:21.830" style="s2">pure breeding something and then taking</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.670" end="00:24:23.660" style="s2">two pure breads and combining them and</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.830" end="00:24:26.420" style="s2">finding that the combination actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.660" end="00:24:29.870" style="s2">has extraordinary capacities now in part</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.420" end="00:24:33.350" style="s2">this will be because the breeding of a</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.870" end="00:24:34.700" style="s2">purebred line will result in really bad</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.350" end="00:24:36.380" style="s2">compromise so they&#39;re yeah they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.700" end="00:24:37.940" style="s2">effectively it&#39;s very much akin to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.380" end="00:24:39.320" style="s2">immune suppression we&#39;re all walking</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.940" end="00:24:41.030" style="s2">around being immune suppressants let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.320" end="00:24:43.430" style="s2">boost our immune system actually let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.030" end="00:24:47.030" style="s2">let&#39;s get it back to baseline yep right</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.430" end="00:24:48.770" style="s2">but so in this case human breeding you</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.030" end="00:24:50.060" style="s2">will maximize some character at the cost</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.770" end="00:24:51.470" style="s2">of a lot of other things and then if you</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.060" end="00:24:52.940" style="s2">combine two things in which we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.470" end="00:24:54.670" style="s2">maximized different characters you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.940" end="00:24:57.440" style="s2">regain some of the value that you lost</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.670" end="00:25:00.770" style="s2">the final thing I will say is that when</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.440" end="00:25:02.540" style="s2">I was actively working on bats this is a</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.770" end="00:25:04.790" style="s2">subject we should come back to but when</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.540" end="00:25:07.790" style="s2">I was actively working on bats it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.790" end="00:25:10.700" style="s2">surprising how often I would end up with</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.790" end="00:25:13.550" style="s2">a bat in the hand that did not fall out</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.700" end="00:25:17.180" style="s2">as one or the other that hovered between</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.550" end="00:25:19.430" style="s2">two known species and the conclusion not</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.180" end="00:25:21.950" style="s2">just mine but also Charles Handley who</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.430" end="00:25:24.620" style="s2">was a curator of mammals at the</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.950" end="00:25:26.420" style="s2">Smithsonian and one of my mentors he</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.620" end="00:25:30.260" style="s2">concluded that many of these were in</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.420" end="00:25:32.150" style="s2">fact hybrids and the the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.260" end="00:25:33.560" style="s2">the hybridization happens more than we</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.150" end="00:25:36.650" style="s2">think but because it doesn&#39;t tend to</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.560" end="00:25:38.300" style="s2">stick we don&#39;t know about it so anyway</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.650" end="00:25:42.230" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot to your question it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.300" end="00:25:44.450" style="s2">good one yeah and so this is a little</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.230" end="00:25:46.520" style="s2">bit related maybe to some of how you</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.450" end="00:25:49.310" style="s2">just answered Brett another one from</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.520" end="00:25:50.570" style="s2">echo study on mosquitoes studies on</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.310" end="00:25:52.700" style="s2">mosquitoes show positive genetic</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.570" end="00:25:55.160" style="s2">correlation between male genital lengths</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.700" end="00:25:56.750" style="s2">and female brain size possibly linked to</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.160" end="00:25:59.300" style="s2">increased female cognitive ability to</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.750" end="00:26:02.090" style="s2">avoid male coercion it&#39;s not politically</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.300" end="00:26:05.780" style="s2">correct can you discuss so I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.090" end="00:26:07.130" style="s2">sounds like the possible hypothesis that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.780" end="00:26:10.520" style="s2">echo was alluding to is that this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.130" end="00:26:12.110" style="s2">sort of an arms race that as male</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.520" end="00:26:14.470" style="s2">genital length increases female brain</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.110" end="00:26:17.990" style="s2">size increases in order to avoid</p>

<p begin="00:26:17.990" end="00:26:22.310" style="s2">have a arms race I don&#39;t that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.640" end="00:26:25.130" style="s2">certainly only one of many possible</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.310" end="00:26:26.480" style="s2">explanations and I don&#39;t I&#39;d love to see</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.130" end="00:26:27.580" style="s2">what the study is to see if this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.480" end="00:26:29.769" style="s2">actually true</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.580" end="00:26:32.830" style="s2">I&#39;m just struggling with the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.769" end="00:26:35.169" style="s2">mosquito cognitive ability is somehow</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.830" end="00:26:36.879" style="s2">important you know I would I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.169" end="00:26:39.159" style="s2">struggling at the idea of male gentle</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.879" end="00:26:40.179" style="s2">lengthen the mosquito frankly all right</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.159" end="00:26:42.639" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna try not to take that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.179" end="00:26:44.590" style="s2">personally in the mosquito I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.639" end="00:26:48.149" style="s2">you&#39;re struggling with the concept of</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.590" end="00:26:51.429" style="s2">male genital length they don&#39;t miss keep</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.149" end="00:26:53.200" style="s2">all right um have you seen any research</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.429" end="00:26:55.299" style="s2">or data around the efficacy of vitamins</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.200" end="00:26:58.600" style="s2">C and D and preventing treating SARS</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.299" end="00:27:01.600" style="s2">Gove - a little haven&#39;t delved into it</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.600" end="00:27:03.759" style="s2">enough but I see people talking about</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.600" end="00:27:05.499" style="s2">vitamin D as a promising thing I have no</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.759" end="00:27:07.299" style="s2">idea with whether this stands up to</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.499" end="00:27:09.460" style="s2">scrutiny or not yet it&#39;s on my list of</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.299" end="00:27:10.629" style="s2">things to look into but um I will say</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.460" end="00:27:12.399" style="s2">that things that we have thought were</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.629" end="00:27:13.749" style="s2">promising have turned out not to be and</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.399" end="00:27:15.669" style="s2">some of them are counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.749" end="00:27:21.489" style="s2">maybe vitamin D is gonna go this way but</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.669" end="00:27:24.179" style="s2">see yeah we do have this anomalous and</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.489" end="00:27:25.299" style="s2">seemingly very important fact about</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.179" end="00:27:27.730" style="s2">outdoors</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.299" end="00:27:30.700" style="s2">that&#39;s certainly consistent with vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.730" end="00:27:31.960" style="s2">D being important that&#39;s right and at</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.700" end="00:27:34.389" style="s2">this point because this is so</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.960" end="00:27:37.269" style="s2">fast-moving and we have you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.389" end="00:27:40.239" style="s2">incomplete and often flawed data coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.269" end="00:27:41.799" style="s2">in it&#39;s really hard to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.239" end="00:27:43.929" style="s2">distinction but you know as the question</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.799" end="00:27:46.269" style="s2">actually is explicit about it asks about</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.929" end="00:27:48.429" style="s2">preventing and treating and there will</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.269" end="00:27:50.649" style="s2">be some drugs which will be effective in</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.429" end="00:27:52.419" style="s2">one and not the other all right and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.649" end="00:27:54.299" style="s2">know this from malaria for instance we</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.419" end="00:27:58.299" style="s2">know this from all sorts of things so</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.299" end="00:28:01.359" style="s2">it&#39;s quite possible that getting enough</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.299" end="00:28:03.460" style="s2">vitamin C or let&#39;s let&#39;s call it vitamin</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.359" end="00:28:05.470" style="s2">D that&#39;s getting enough vitamin D is</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.460" end="00:28:06.789" style="s2">preventative against getting it but once</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.470" end="00:28:08.619" style="s2">you get it no amount of vitamin D is</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.789" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">going to help you in the course of the</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.619" end="00:28:12.070" style="s2">disease yeah making that up I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:13.269" style="s2">if that&#39;s true but it&#39;s it&#39;s quite</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.070" end="00:28:15.970" style="s2">possible that something would be</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.269" end="00:28:17.649" style="s2">effective somewhat effective in</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.970" end="00:28:18.999" style="s2">preventing you&#39;re getting it but then</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.649" end="00:28:22.929" style="s2">not effective in treating it once you</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.999" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">got it I think I also recall that iron</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.929" end="00:28:27.580" style="s2">is one of these things that an iron</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:30.700" style="s2">deficiency makes you vulnerable so</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.580" end="00:28:33.279" style="s2">having enough iron makes you resistant</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.700" end="00:28:35.259" style="s2">to various things but during certain</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.279" end="00:28:36.720" style="s2">infections iron levels in the blood</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.259" end="00:28:40.020" style="s2">crash and it&#39;s probably an adaptation</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.720" end="00:28:42.540" style="s2">where the body is denying iron</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.020" end="00:28:44.310" style="s2">the tunes that utilize it yeah and this</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.540" end="00:28:46.020" style="s2">could actually be relevant to SARS co2</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.310" end="00:28:48.810" style="s2">as we talked about in early livestreams</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.020" end="00:28:51.960" style="s2">there seems to be a connection with</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.810" end="00:28:53.970" style="s2">hemoglobin absolutely my 12 year old is</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.960" end="00:28:56.100" style="s2">seeing this podcast the first time says</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.970" end="00:28:57.630" style="s2">this is boring by the second time she</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.100" end="00:28:59.010" style="s2">was laughing at Brett&#39;s jokes in the Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.630" end="00:29:00.780" style="s2">now she&#39;s a fan</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.010" end="00:29:02.550" style="s2">thanks for the podcast this is from Eric</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.780" end="00:29:05.610" style="s2">Knight who asks if we can give a</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.550" end="00:29:08.580" style="s2">shout-out to J and Casey absolutely J</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.610" end="00:29:10.740" style="s2">the 12 year old fan we are honored Casey</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.580" end="00:29:13.560" style="s2">I think is Kansas City yeah I&#39;m just a</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.740" end="00:29:15.480" style="s2">fan uh he also likes my jokes</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.560" end="00:29:17.610" style="s2">I think this kid&#39;s gonna be okay you</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.480" end="00:29:20.310" style="s2">think so yeah I do I will say that when</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.610" end="00:29:22.770" style="s2">I think of Kansas City I think of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.310" end="00:29:25.380" style="s2">time there when I was about 12 visiting</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.770" end="00:29:26.970" style="s2">an aunt and uncle and cousins and going</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.380" end="00:29:29.400" style="s2">waterskiing there so I actually have fun</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.970" end="00:29:31.650" style="s2">memories of Kansas City thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.400" end="00:29:33.870" style="s2">that last time you implied that</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.650" end="00:29:35.460" style="s2">recombination of viruses is rare and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.870" end="00:29:38.070" style="s2">that this is evidence of it being a lab</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.460" end="00:29:40.260" style="s2">maid but isn&#39;t this how we have new flu</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.070" end="00:29:43.950" style="s2">strains also couldn&#39;t recombination</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.260" end="00:29:46.950" style="s2">occur in a third animal recombination of</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.950" end="00:29:49.950" style="s2">viruses is not rare flu in particular</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.950" end="00:29:52.800" style="s2">has a known mechanism for this in which</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.950" end="00:29:55.230" style="s2">different components are exchanged I</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.800" end="00:29:56.370" style="s2">know the part of the last live stream</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.230" end="00:29:58.620" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about in which I said</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.370" end="00:30:00.630" style="s2">that I do not mean to imply that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.620" end="00:30:02.630" style="s2">rare but what I&#39;m what I did mean to</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.630" end="00:30:05.040" style="s2">imply was that the particular</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.630" end="00:30:06.840" style="s2">hybridization event would require these</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.040" end="00:30:08.880" style="s2">two strains which were in very different</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.840" end="00:30:11.490" style="s2">creatures to have found themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.880" end="00:30:13.980" style="s2">the same cell of a particular creature</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.490" end="00:30:16.320" style="s2">not saying it couldn&#39;t happen in fact</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.980" end="00:30:19.820" style="s2">what I really want is for a wide open</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.320" end="00:30:22.710" style="s2">discussion to occur in which we consult</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.820" end="00:30:25.590" style="s2">the people who know pangolins the people</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.710" end="00:30:27.920" style="s2">who know rhino loaf and bats and we find</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.590" end="00:30:30.420" style="s2">out whether the ecology provides any</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.920" end="00:30:30.990" style="s2">situation in which this might normally</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.420" end="00:30:33.210" style="s2">occur</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.990" end="00:30:35.490" style="s2">my guess is to the extent that those</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.210" end="00:30:37.110" style="s2">experts exist they would know a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.490" end="00:30:39.480" style="s2">about the ecology that could tell us</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.110" end="00:30:41.550" style="s2">what to make of the fact that we&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.480" end="00:30:43.890" style="s2">a spike protein seeming to come from a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.550" end="00:30:46.380" style="s2">Pangolin and the rest of the genome</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.890" end="00:30:48.150" style="s2">seeming to come from a rhino loaf at bat</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.380" end="00:30:50.910" style="s2">maybe it means nothing maybe it means</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.150" end="00:30:52.710" style="s2">something but I do not mean to imply</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.910" end="00:30:54.150" style="s2">that viruses do not find ways to</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.710" end="00:30:58.490" style="s2">recombine</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.150" end="00:31:01.200" style="s2">but coronaviruses are not like flu virus</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.490" end="00:31:02.580" style="s2">there seems to be a huge huge mismatch</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.200" end="00:31:04.290" style="s2">between the severity of the corona</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.580" end="00:31:06.270" style="s2">pandemic and the social cost imposed by</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.290" end="00:31:07.740" style="s2">lockdown those who protest the trakone</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.270" end="00:31:10.410" style="s2">ian&#39;s measures are stigmatized despite</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.740" end="00:31:13.680" style="s2">the obvious cost so there&#39;s no question</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.410" end="00:31:19.110" style="s2">there you know we have a somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.680" end="00:31:21.240" style="s2">different position that the severity is</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.110" end="00:31:22.560" style="s2">a mismatch for the lockdown and of</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.240" end="00:31:24.840" style="s2">course a successful lockdown is</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.560" end="00:31:27.000" style="s2">successful and necessary lockdown will</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.840" end="00:31:29.220" style="s2">inherently look like it was somewhat</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.000" end="00:31:30.990" style="s2">unnecessary and there&#39;s really very</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.220" end="00:31:33.570" style="s2">little way to tell the difference unless</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.990" end="00:31:35.190" style="s2">you have well controlled situations in</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.570" end="00:31:36.540" style="s2">the world where some locked down and</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.190" end="00:31:38.400" style="s2">some didn&#39;t and we talked a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.540" end="00:31:41.610" style="s2">about this in the first part of this</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.400" end="00:31:43.980" style="s2">live stream where Norway was at Norway</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.610" end="00:31:47.400" style="s2">versus Sweden Norway did lockdown and</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.980" end="00:31:48.990" style="s2">has an order of magnitude close to fewer</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.400" end="00:31:52.020" style="s2">deaths than Sweden which didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.990" end="00:31:55.050" style="s2">lockdown but you know it&#39;s you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.020" end="00:31:56.760" style="s2">talking about the severity and stigma I</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.050" end="00:31:58.530" style="s2">think we&#39;ve beginning to get stigma on</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.760" end="00:32:01.680" style="s2">both sides frankly I think this is</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.530" end="00:32:05.100" style="s2">becoming an almost explicitly political</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.680" end="00:32:06.210" style="s2">problem and it&#39;s that&#39;s diabolical it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.100" end="00:32:07.980" style="s2">not that&#39;s not the way they should have</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.210" end="00:32:10.650" style="s2">gone and yet of course it&#39;s going that</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.980" end="00:32:12.690" style="s2">way yeah it&#39;s a it&#39;s a disaster frankly</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.650" end="00:32:14.670" style="s2">we are all in this together and at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.690" end="00:32:17.250" style="s2">moment we&#39;re all in it together at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.670" end="00:32:21.540" style="s2">same level of lockdown more or less at</p>

<p begin="00:39:48.080" end="00:39:51.880" style="s2">feeding in and to be much less likely to</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.610" end="00:39:54.860" style="s2">be conclusion driven than they are</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.880" end="00:39:57.350" style="s2">hypothesis driven so if these guys a</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.860" end="00:40:00.410" style="s2">couple of Osteopathy had created that</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.350" end="00:40:01.990" style="s2">video that would be shocking to me and</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.410" end="00:40:05.030" style="s2">it turns out it&#39;s not true in this case</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.990" end="00:40:07.580" style="s2">all right might a better name than</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.030" end="00:40:09.590" style="s2">motivated reasoning be used to denote</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.580" end="00:40:12.920" style="s2">evasion of that logical process in favor</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.590" end="00:40:15.320" style="s2">of a chosen conclusion I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.920" end="00:40:18.470" style="s2">motivated reasoning works for me I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.320" end="00:40:20.900" style="s2">it it contains exactly the allegation</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.470" end="00:40:23.350" style="s2">yeah inside the the term but if you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.900" end="00:40:26.950" style="s2">got a better term offer it for sure yep</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.350" end="00:40:30.010" style="s2">I feel like we already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.950" end="00:40:32.720" style="s2">Wilson&#39;s work and cultural evolution oh</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.010" end="00:40:35.090" style="s2">is this a slightly different question</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.720" end="00:40:36.320" style="s2">well the earlier so I was the same no</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.090" end="00:40:39.830" style="s2">it&#39;s the same I think it probably came</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.320" end="00:40:41.330" style="s2">in on a different stream justice so it</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.830" end="00:40:43.940" style="s2">does ask about Concilium sand I will</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.330" end="00:40:46.820" style="s2">just say in general Concilium is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.940" end="00:40:49.700" style="s2">a cool idea I believe it is implicit</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.820" end="00:40:51.980" style="s2">really in the scientific approach in</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.700" end="00:40:53.210" style="s2">other words science proceeds from the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.980" end="00:40:55.340" style="s2">belief that all of these things</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.210" end="00:40:58.250" style="s2">ultimately distill down to some story</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.340" end="00:41:01.070" style="s2">that works across all scales so maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.250" end="00:41:03.860" style="s2">it&#39;s not as radical as it sounds should</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.070" end="00:41:06.290" style="s2">the humanities take a scientific</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.860" end="00:41:08.660" style="s2">approach of course they should Guns</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.290" end="00:41:10.730" style="s2">Germs and Steel is an excellent</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.660" end="00:41:12.440" style="s2">demonstration that history needs a</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.730" end="00:41:15.830" style="s2">scientific approach to be done properly</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.440" end="00:41:17.570" style="s2">so anyway basically at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.830" end="00:41:19.280" style="s2">Concilium stew the extent that I at</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.570" end="00:41:21.710" style="s2">least understand it I would say</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.280" end="00:41:22.970" style="s2">cautiously in favor of roughly that</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.710" end="00:41:26.390" style="s2">approach absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.970" end="00:41:28.550" style="s2">so we&#39;ve got three more questions and a</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.390" end="00:41:30.050" style="s2">couple of comments which I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.550" end="00:41:31.730" style="s2">need to be said out loud here but we</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.050" end="00:41:33.830" style="s2">said that we would read everything so</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.730" end="00:41:35.000" style="s2">let me just start with those a test</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.830" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">someone said super chat was giving</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.000" end="00:41:41.210" style="s2">errors apparently it wasn&#39;t and set</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:42.890" style="s2">encoded to broadcast key frames every</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.210" end="00:41:47.390" style="s2">two seconds that looks like some tech</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.890" end="00:41:50.640" style="s2">advice we have received some supremacy</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.390" end="00:41:52.769" style="s2">tech advice so thank you for that</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.640" end="00:41:54.779" style="s2">okay last three questions if I&#39;m banned</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.769" end="00:41:56.519" style="s2">from normal chap for lowbrow trolling</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.779" end="00:41:58.950" style="s2">can I still super shet apparently you</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.519" end="00:42:02.640" style="s2">can this is the test this is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.950" end="00:42:05.059" style="s2">hypothesis alright so what are the type</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.640" end="00:42:06.960" style="s2">1 and type 2 error values for the tests</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.059" end="00:42:08.130" style="s2">okay so this is gonna be a question</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.960" end="00:42:10.499" style="s2">about false positives and false</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.130" end="00:42:12.089" style="s2">negatives they vary they vary quite a</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.499" end="00:42:14.069" style="s2">lot I actually haven&#39;t I have not heard</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.089" end="00:42:16.380" style="s2">the numbers for the antigen test for the</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.069" end="00:42:18.569" style="s2">so-called molecular tests the PCR test</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.380" end="00:42:20.519" style="s2">those are all synonyms antigen molecular</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.569" end="00:42:22.259" style="s2">PCR tests those aren&#39;t synonyms in any</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.519" end="00:42:24.059" style="s2">other realm but in this case they are I</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.259" end="00:42:25.589" style="s2">have not heard the numbers for false</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.059" end="00:42:27.599" style="s2">positives and false negatives for those</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.589" end="00:42:29.249" style="s2">I&#39;ve been we&#39;ve been more focused on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.599" end="00:42:37.140" style="s2">serology tests which are the antibody</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.249" end="00:42:39.930" style="s2">tests and they are ranging in the 95 to</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.140" end="00:42:41.700" style="s2">99 percent for both false positives and</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.930" end="00:42:43.289" style="s2">false negatives but they have very</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.700" end="00:42:46.529" style="s2">different specifics depending on the</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.289" end="00:42:48.960" style="s2">particular test and I don&#39;t think I have</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.529" end="00:42:50.609" style="s2">much more to say beyond that final</p>
<p begin="00:42:48.960" end="00:42:53.130" style="s2">question what is the adaptive advantage</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.609" end="00:42:54.930" style="s2">of using language copying information</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.130" end="00:42:56.640" style="s2">from speakers to listeners or speakers</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.930" end="00:42:59.099" style="s2">benefit by influencing listening</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.640" end="00:43:02.700" style="s2">behavior or listener behavior excuse me</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.099" end="00:43:06.420" style="s2">well I would say this is the perfect</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.700" end="00:43:08.640" style="s2">place to invite you to our Princeton</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.420" end="00:43:11.249" style="s2">talk tomorrow where we will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.640" end="00:43:14.579" style="s2">closely related issues that are involved</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.249" end="00:43:17.579" style="s2">in consciousness and culture both of</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.579" end="00:43:21.150" style="s2">which take advantage of language in an</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.579" end="00:43:22.559" style="s2">extreme way and I can say that we</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.150" end="00:43:24.359" style="s2">believe the answer we will deliver</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.559" end="00:43:26.789" style="s2">tomorrow will be one you haven&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.359" end="00:43:30.299" style="s2">and will be hopefully fully satisfying</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.789" end="00:43:34.019" style="s2">so that will be on April 29th at 4:30</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.299" end="00:43:35.910" style="s2">p.m. Eastern for those who haven&#39;t heard</p>
<p begin="00:43:34.019" end="00:43:38.579" style="s2">us talk about it before but if you&#39;re if</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.910" end="00:43:42.420" style="s2">you&#39;re seeing this not within the first</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.579" end="00:43:45.269" style="s2">24 hours of posting it it will be posted</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.420" end="00:43:48.900" style="s2">by Princeton sometime after the</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.269" end="00:43:50.910" style="s2">livestream the zoom webinar so it will</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.900" end="00:43:52.650" style="s2">be available for you to go see and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:50.910" end="00:43:55.470" style="s2">we will also be talking about this a bit</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.650" end="00:43:57.420" style="s2">not so much focusing on language but a</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.470" end="00:43:59.579" style="s2">bit the model of culture and</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.420" end="00:44:01.799" style="s2">consciousness in the book under</p>

<p begin="00:44:01.799" end="00:44:05.850" style="s2">which will be out and about</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.300" end="00:44:08.010" style="s2">year assuming that the entire world does</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.850" end="00:44:10.050" style="s2">not continue to go off the rails uh-huh</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.010" end="00:44:11.250" style="s2">it&#39;s a big assumption it is a big</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.050" end="00:44:13.200" style="s2">assembly yeah I wouldn&#39;t make that</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.250" end="00:44:14.730" style="s2">assumption at this point all right to</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.200" end="00:44:15.390" style="s2">the entire world not continuing to go</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.730" end="00:44:24.350" style="s2">off the rails</p>
