<p begin="00:00:00.000" end="00:00:04.859" style="s2">all right so we&#39;re gonna do why do</p>
<p begin="00:00:01.740" end="00:00:08.670" style="s2">plants make medicine yeah does that even</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.859" end="00:00:12.380" style="s2">make sense as a question yeah why do</p>
<p begin="00:00:08.670" end="00:00:14.250" style="s2">plants make this I love this question</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.380" end="00:00:15.929" style="s2">first of all it doesn&#39;t sound like it</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.250" end="00:00:17.789" style="s2">makes any sense because first plants</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.929" end="00:00:20.580" style="s2">aren&#39;t really making medicine they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.789" end="00:00:25.680" style="s2">making molecules that we use for things</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.580" end="00:00:27.560" style="s2">but it seems like perhaps the molecules</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.680" end="00:00:30.179" style="s2">that the plants are using in their own</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.560" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">physiological processes are turning out</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.179" end="00:00:34.770" style="s2">to be medicine and that&#39;s actually not</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:37.260" style="s2">what&#39;s happening medicines that we find</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.770" end="00:00:39.059" style="s2">in nature are typically secondary</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.260" end="00:00:41.219" style="s2">compounds in plants which means that</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.059" end="00:00:44.989" style="s2">inside the plant they serve no useful</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.219" end="00:00:47.879" style="s2">function what they do is they dissuade</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.989" end="00:00:50.670" style="s2">animals from consuming those plants so</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.879" end="00:00:54.149" style="s2">these plants are for whatever reason</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.670" end="00:00:57.989" style="s2">much better at creative chemistry than</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.149" end="00:01:00.809" style="s2">animals are and plants effectively</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.989" end="00:01:03.239" style="s2">evolutionarily experiment with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.809" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">production of poisons and those poisons</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.239" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">cause divorce to have to move on they</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:09.930" style="s2">either can consume none of a plant or</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:12.150" style="s2">have to consume limited amounts and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.930" end="00:01:14.520" style="s2">move on to some other plant in order to</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.150" end="00:01:18.020" style="s2">tolerate the level of toxicity but what</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.520" end="00:01:20.820" style="s2">this means is that plants discover</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.020" end="00:01:22.740" style="s2">molecules that interact with animal</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.820" end="00:01:25.710" style="s2">physiology and they produce them for</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.740" end="00:01:28.560" style="s2">precisely that reason what does it mean</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:31.259" style="s2">to interact with animal physiology in a</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.560" end="00:01:32.220" style="s2">way that could dissuade an animal from</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.259" end="00:01:36.170" style="s2">eating a plant</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.220" end="00:01:38.630" style="s2">well it means figuring out how animals</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.170" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">regulate their own processes and</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.630" end="00:01:43.799" style="s2">interfering with those processes in such</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">a way that the animal is disrupted now</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.799" end="00:01:48.030" style="s2">if you think about what that means what</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:50.939" style="s2">what is it to be disrupted every system</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.030" end="00:01:53.040" style="s2">in the body is regulated by feedbacks so</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.939" end="00:01:55.350" style="s2">that for example the pH in your blood</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.040" end="00:01:57.530" style="s2">your temperature all of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.350" end="00:02:00.150" style="s2">are important to functioning are</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.530" end="00:02:03.060" style="s2">monitored by some system and as they</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.150" end="00:02:04.710" style="s2">move out of range in one direction there</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.060" end="00:02:08.060" style="s2">bumped back in the other direction by</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.710" end="00:02:11.940" style="s2">some set of feedbacks well poisons</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.060" end="00:02:15.770" style="s2">interact with those regulatory processes</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.940" end="00:02:17.850" style="s2">and so the reason that we find so many</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.770" end="00:02:20.340" style="s2">honest-to-goodness medicines in nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.850" end="00:02:22.850" style="s2">is that what it is to be sick to be</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.340" end="00:02:26.250" style="s2">diseased is to have something</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.850" end="00:02:28.560" style="s2">dysregulated and plants have</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.250" end="00:02:31.080" style="s2">experimented with the chemistry and</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.560" end="00:02:33.209" style="s2">they&#39;ve found ways to intervene in all</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.080" end="00:02:35.550" style="s2">of these systems and so if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.209" end="00:02:37.290" style="s2">system in which your dysregulated low</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.550" end="00:02:39.060" style="s2">it&#39;s very likely that there&#39;s a plant</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.290" end="00:02:41.610" style="s2">out of there that has found a molecule</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.060" end="00:02:44.130" style="s2">that will push that system in the high</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:46.320" style="s2">direction and therefore the key to</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.130" end="00:02:48.660" style="s2">taking a poison and turning it into a</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.320" end="00:02:51.180" style="s2">medicine is finding the right molecule</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.660" end="00:02:53.910" style="s2">for a particular kind of dysregulation</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.180" end="00:02:56.490" style="s2">and titrating it so you get just enough</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.910" end="00:02:59.490" style="s2">to bump you back into the the useful</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.490" end="00:03:03.440" style="s2">range so plants really are making</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.490" end="00:03:07.410" style="s2">medicine but they&#39;re doing so because</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.440" end="00:03:09.000" style="s2">medicines are toxins and we use them</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.410" end="00:03:10.709" style="s2">productively because we understand the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.000" end="00:03:12.870" style="s2">systems on how to intervene in those</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.709" end="00:03:14.430" style="s2">systems in many cases but the plants are</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.870" end="00:03:18.870" style="s2">producing them for a hospital purpose</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.430" end="00:03:21.360" style="s2">and then we are caught but plants also</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.870" end="00:03:25.019" style="s2">rely on animals to propagate certain</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.360" end="00:03:28.500" style="s2">plants so like that that&#39;s how we get</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.019" end="00:03:32.040" style="s2">sugars and vitamins that are beneficial</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.500" end="00:03:34.560" style="s2">to systems well plants have complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.040" end="00:03:35.959" style="s2">relationships with animals typically the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.560" end="00:03:40.070" style="s2">animals you&#39;re talking about are either</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.959" end="00:03:45.750" style="s2">pollinators or fruit distributors and</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.070" end="00:03:47.940" style="s2">fruits are tremendously non-toxic for</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.750" end="00:03:49.980" style="s2">the most part except where a plant has</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.940" end="00:03:52.340" style="s2">an interest in one creature distributing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.980" end="00:03:56.100" style="s2">a seed and not another so there are</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.340" end="00:03:59.610" style="s2">plants that for example contain toxins</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.100" end="00:04:02.100" style="s2">for mammals there are small fruits that</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.610" end="00:04:02.470" style="s2">are distributed by birds that mammals</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.100" end="00:04:05.920" style="s2">can</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.470" end="00:04:08.950" style="s2">eat the reason that this is occurring is</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.920" end="00:04:11.350" style="s2">that from a plant&#39;s perspective a bird</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.950" end="00:04:13.000" style="s2">is often a much better distributor</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.350" end="00:04:16.260" style="s2">especially where there are no forgivers</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.000" end="00:04:19.750" style="s2">bats if you have to choose between</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.260" end="00:04:21.400" style="s2">terrestrial mammals and flying birds</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.750" end="00:04:23.200" style="s2">flying birds are obviously capable of</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.400" end="00:04:26.140" style="s2">distributing seeds much farther afield</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.200" end="00:04:28.000" style="s2">and so sometimes plants will intervene</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.140" end="00:04:32.680" style="s2">by introducing something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:35.320" style="s2">unpalatable to to mammals one very</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.680" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">interesting case is actually the Chili</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.320" end="00:04:43.570" style="s2">Peppers Chili Peppers have a compound in</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:46.450" style="s2">them that triggers the mammalian damage</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.570" end="00:04:48.630" style="s2">sensors it actually doesn&#39;t do physical</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.450" end="00:04:51.370" style="s2">damage but it triggers the body&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.630" end="00:04:54.070" style="s2">monitoring apparatus for that damage</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.370" end="00:04:56.169" style="s2">which leaves those Chili Peppers on the</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.070" end="00:04:58.030" style="s2">plant to be distributed by birds who are</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.169" end="00:05:00.040" style="s2">much more effective at spreading their</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.030" end="00:05:02.080" style="s2">seeds so they are it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.040" end="00:05:05.530" style="s2">neurotransmitter mimic that the Chili</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.080" end="00:05:07.630" style="s2">Peppers have in them that causes that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.530" end="00:05:10.590" style="s2">sensation of burning which is not</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.630" end="00:05:13.410" style="s2">actually an indication of damage and</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.590" end="00:05:15.730" style="s2">that is there to intervene in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.410" end="00:05:19.600" style="s2">competition between birds and mammals in</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.730" end="00:05:22.270" style="s2">favor of the birds so do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.600" end="00:05:23.890" style="s2">there&#39;s a higher distribution of what we</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.270" end="00:05:25.900" style="s2">consider what the plant would consider a</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.890" end="00:05:29.830" style="s2">toxin and what we might consider it</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.900" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">medicine and core functioning parts of</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.830" end="00:05:35.290" style="s2">the planet like a fruit isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:37.150" style="s2">necessarily core to the individual plant</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.290" end="00:05:39.370" style="s2">survival it&#39;s more about the propagation</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.150" end="00:05:41.729" style="s2">of the species so would there be more</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.370" end="00:05:46.030" style="s2">toxins in the bark or a root system</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.729" end="00:05:47.919" style="s2">click on you would expect the places</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.030" end="00:05:49.300" style="s2">that have the highest concentration of</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.919" end="00:05:52.030" style="s2">toxins that we would then use as</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.300" end="00:05:54.160" style="s2">medicines to be those tissues that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.030" end="00:05:57.669" style="s2">either most likely to be eaten or most</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.160" end="00:06:00.580" style="s2">valuable if they are lost and this is in</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.669" end="00:06:03.790" style="s2">fact what we see so around here we have</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.580" end="00:06:04.990" style="s2">an invasive species foxglove from which</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.790" end="00:06:07.360" style="s2">the heart drug do</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.990" end="00:06:09.130" style="s2">Tallis has taken and digitalis is</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.360" end="00:06:11.200" style="s2">concentrated in the leaves of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.130" end="00:06:13.810" style="s2">foxglove plant rather than the flowers</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.200" end="00:06:16.450" style="s2">which are very short-lived so the plant</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.810" end="00:06:18.160" style="s2">has a lot more to lose by losing a piece</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.450" end="00:06:20.350" style="s2">of leaf tissue with which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.160" end="00:06:22.330" style="s2">collecting sunlight rather than a flower</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.350" end="00:06:24.490" style="s2">that happens to be available at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.330" end="00:06:28.030" style="s2">moment but will only be blooming for a</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.490" end="00:06:29.980" style="s2">week or two so yes we should expect and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.030" end="00:06:33.250" style="s2">in fact we do see a concentration of</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.980" end="00:06:34.150" style="s2">these molecules in vulnerable valuable</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.250" end="00:06:36.130" style="s2">parts of the plant</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.150" end="00:06:40.240" style="s2">whereas fruits are designed to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.130" end="00:06:42.190" style="s2">expendable fruits are an enticement or</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.240" end="00:06:44.230" style="s2">what we call fruits there are lots of</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.190" end="00:06:46.570" style="s2">fruits that you wouldn&#39;t recognize as</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.230" end="00:06:49.720" style="s2">delicious but when you say further than</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.570" end="00:06:53.020" style="s2">you&#39;re talking about the delicious type</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.720" end="00:06:55.440" style="s2">of fruit those fruits are rewards for an</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.020" end="00:06:59.380" style="s2">animal distributor to take the seeds</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.440" end="00:07:03.220" style="s2">elsewhere and yes it would expect either</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.380" end="00:07:04.990" style="s2">no toxicity or toxicity that works in</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.220" end="00:07:09.220" style="s2">favor of some distributors and against</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.990" end="00:07:15.490" style="s2">others towards weibo thorns what about</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.220" end="00:07:18.220" style="s2">for us what about thorns I like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.490" end="00:07:20.320" style="s2">that&#39;s a that seems like a defense</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.220" end="00:07:21.940" style="s2">mechanism that&#39;s is this is no longer</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.320" end="00:07:25.030" style="s2">we&#39;re not talking about a medicine</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.940" end="00:07:27.100" style="s2">there&#39;s no beneficiary of thorns unless</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.030" end="00:07:29.350" style="s2">we made some sort of bird no there</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.100" end="00:07:32.920" style="s2">aren&#39;t well bird is a good example there</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.350" end="00:07:35.340" style="s2">are many cases that I can think of in</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.920" end="00:07:39.790" style="s2">tropical species especially in which</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.340" end="00:07:42.760" style="s2">thorns block one route of access to</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.790" end="00:07:44.850" style="s2">fruits leaving those fruits available to</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.760" end="00:07:50.740" style="s2">creatures that come a different way so</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.850" end="00:07:53.680" style="s2">for example there are palm fruits in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.740" end="00:07:56.920" style="s2">neotropical forests which are which</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.680" end="00:07:59.530" style="s2">exists on palms with extremely spiky</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.920" end="00:08:02.320" style="s2">trunks that could not be climbed by a</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.530" end="00:08:06.220" style="s2">rodent for example but they can be</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.320" end="00:08:10.060" style="s2">accessed by kinkajous which leap from</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.220" end="00:08:11.710" style="s2">canopy to canopy and so kinky trees are</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.060" end="00:08:13.150" style="s2">actually decent distributors because</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.710" end="00:08:14.030" style="s2">they&#39;re pretty wide-ranging it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.150" end="00:08:19.760" style="s2">fairly large</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.030" end="00:08:22.820" style="s2">mammal and so a poem that that stacks</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.760" end="00:08:24.950" style="s2">the deck in favor of a kinkajou which</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.820" end="00:08:26.540" style="s2">can hang by its prehensile tail and</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.950" end="00:08:29.770" style="s2">access the fruits in the canopy and</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.540" end="00:08:32.150" style="s2">against rodents makes a lot of sense and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.770" end="00:08:34.280" style="s2">give it a little time it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.150" end="00:08:36.440" style="s2">hard to come up with a dozen examples</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.280" end="00:08:38.240" style="s2">like that where the thorns are actually</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.440" end="00:08:42.830" style="s2">a way of intervening in competition</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:51.250" style="s2">between different animal taxa you said</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.830" end="00:08:51.250" style="s2">that plants experiment it&#39;s almost like</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.750" end="00:08:59.540" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like anthropomorphizing</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.860" end="00:09:01.430" style="s2">bench yes yeah well this is a this is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.540" end="00:09:03.890" style="s2">problem that evolutionary biologists are</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.430" end="00:09:05.390" style="s2">constantly stuck in which is we all</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.890" end="00:09:07.430" style="s2">understand that the plants aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.390" end="00:09:10.460" style="s2">intentionally experimenting for example</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.430" end="00:09:13.580" style="s2">but to say things in a way that is</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.460" end="00:09:15.140" style="s2">perfectly rigorous with respect to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.580" end="00:09:17.300" style="s2">absence of consciousness from the</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.140" end="00:09:19.520" style="s2">process is so cumbersome and so hard for</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.300" end="00:09:21.680" style="s2">people to follow that we default into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.520" end="00:09:23.210" style="s2">kind of shorthand where we say things</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.680" end="00:09:25.610" style="s2">like the plant is experimenting because</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.210" end="00:09:27.650" style="s2">what is what it is doing is tantamount</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.610" end="00:09:29.390" style="s2">to experimenting the easiest way to</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.650" end="00:09:31.460" style="s2">understand it is that it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.390" end="00:09:34.550" style="s2">experimenting but experimenting is a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.460" end="00:09:37.730" style="s2">fairly precise analogy to what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.550" end="00:09:39.380" style="s2">actually doing it&#39;s doing a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.730" end="00:09:42.890" style="s2">things and then those things that</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.380" end="00:09:44.930" style="s2">provide a benefit stick and so nature is</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.890" end="00:09:48.250" style="s2">experimenting even though nature isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.930" end="00:09:48.250" style="s2">it&#39;s not even a creature</p>
