<p begin="00:00:23.890" end="00:00:28.360" style="s2">to be honest about it we need to work on</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.230" end="00:00:31.090" style="s2">that because this ties into the three</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.360" end="00:00:33.340" style="s2">utopias to see in a funny way because if</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.090" end="00:00:35.440" style="s2">you have before different transcendent</p>

<p begin="00:01:00.460" end="00:01:04.809" style="s2">so that chain has to work that means</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.590" end="00:01:06.850" style="s2">there&#39;s no direct access to God anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.809" end="00:01:09.460" style="s2">unless you get to the very top and that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.850" end="00:01:11.409" style="s2">means that anything else is indirect you</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.460" end="00:01:13.090" style="s2">have to respect that that&#39;s just the</p>

<p begin="00:01:16.270" end="00:01:20.440" style="s2">way it works in also historically that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.010" end="00:01:22.090" style="s2">the great works almost cosmologically</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.440" end="00:01:24.850" style="s2">but if you don&#39;t say Cosmo at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.090" end="00:01:27.369" style="s2">human so it works them it&#39;s no matter</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.850" end="00:01:30.549" style="s2">logically the right order and if you try</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.369" end="00:01:32.260" style="s2">to jump can&#39;t skip any steps no and if</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.549" end="00:01:33.850" style="s2">you if you want to ignore the steps all</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.260" end="00:01:38.369" style="s2">together you end up with idea that a</p>

<p begin="00:22:06.600" end="00:22:11.820" style="s2">says that one thing we can also strive</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.190" end="00:22:14.309" style="s2">towards creating God Cynthia in that</p>

<p begin="00:22:27.659" end="00:22:31.619" style="s2">artist goes is that which part the</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.730" end="00:22:33.809" style="s2">artist as the artist in the religion</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.619" end="00:22:36.269" style="s2">religious realm or is the artist in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.809" end="00:22:38.309" style="s2">cultural realm or I guess he&#39;s in all of</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.269" end="00:22:40.379" style="s2">them were somewhere well there&#39;s a trick</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.309" end="00:22:41.879" style="s2">about the sham annoyed personality you</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.379" end="00:22:43.860" style="s2">know the shamonite personality doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.879" end="00:22:46.470" style="s2">understand borders and has no membranes</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.860" end="00:22:49.200" style="s2">so the shimmer that personality walks</p>

<p begin="00:22:49.200" end="00:22:54.179" style="s2">God interesting okay for good or bad</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.409" end="00:22:55.889" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly why I could put tons of</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.179" end="00:22:57.210" style="s2">psychedelics into shaman art people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.889" end="00:22:58.259" style="s2">they do not freak out if you like</p>

<p begin="00:30:00.360" end="00:30:04.110" style="s2">but you have to wait until later to</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.159" end="00:30:06.659" style="s2">understand the rest here it&#39;s deeply no</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.110" end="00:30:08.789" style="s2">matter logical it makes total sense it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.659" end="00:30:10.200" style="s2">like you can learn this now and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.789" end="00:30:12.779" style="s2">when you know this we can take the next</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.200" end="00:30:15.389" style="s2">step and then you can when you&#39;re at a</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.779" end="00:30:16.740" style="s2">certain age you have some knowledge that</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.389" end="00:30:19.019" style="s2">somebody who&#39;s ten years younger than</p>

<p begin="00:30:21.120" end="00:30:28.950" style="s2">could just say you know hang in there a</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.450" end="00:30:30.480" style="s2">little bit yeah it&#39;s not so interesting</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.950" end="00:30:31.860" style="s2">that we&#39;re stuck inside our head as</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.480" end="00:30:33.419" style="s2">individuals what&#39;s interesting is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.860" end="00:30:35.279" style="s2">the knowledge is stuck inside our head</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.419" end="00:30:37.559" style="s2">and it&#39;s hard to trust each other&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.279" end="00:30:39.360" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly moving to tential ism now</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.559" end="00:30:42.539" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be very different capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.360" end="00:30:44.190" style="s2">because we can&#39;t trade knowledge mmm it</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.539" end="00:30:45.149" style="s2">can&#39;t trade no I can&#39;t get something out</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.190" end="00:30:46.539" style="s2">of my head and put it in your head</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.149" end="00:30:47.829" style="s2">instantly capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.539" end="00:30:50.109" style="s2">fooled us into believing that anything</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.829" end="00:30:51.999" style="s2">could be traded but trade it in an</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.109" end="00:30:54.459" style="s2">instant matter you get what I have</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.999" end="00:30:57.129" style="s2">arguably you have now instantly in</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.459" end="00:30:59.109" style="s2">exchange for money but there are things</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.129" end="00:31:00.940" style="s2">that cannot be traded and those who</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.109" end="00:31:02.889" style="s2">thinks the most valuable now and that</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.940" end="00:31:04.239" style="s2">system is called attentional ISM and the</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.889" end="00:31:05.889" style="s2">algorithm will only point towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.239" end="00:31:07.629" style="s2">attention list phenomena and not towards</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.889" end="00:31:09.070" style="s2">capitalist phenomena the algorithm will</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.629" end="00:31:10.239" style="s2">not point to or choose the cheapest the</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.070" end="00:31:12.429" style="s2">algorithm will point to was just the</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.239" end="00:31:14.229" style="s2">best quality was the most credibility</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.429" end="00:31:15.999" style="s2">and does the best job he&#39;ll point</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.229" end="00:31:18.190" style="s2">towards quality nothing else but quality</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.999" end="00:31:20.349" style="s2">so the algorithm will be phallic it</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.190" end="00:31:22.239" style="s2">would create phallic order in the chaos</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.349" end="00:31:23.859" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what the algorithms are</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.239" end="00:31:25.809" style="s2">increasingly doing it in smarter smarter</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.859" end="00:31:28.089" style="s2">and more and more becoming more and more</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.809" end="00:31:30.489" style="s2">a phallic more and more exact and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.089" end="00:31:32.139" style="s2">point you towards your subculture tribal</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.489" end="00:31:33.549" style="s2">home and they share the interest you</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.139" end="00:31:34.049" style="s2">have with others any points out who they</p>
