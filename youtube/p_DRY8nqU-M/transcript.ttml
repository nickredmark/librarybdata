<p begin="00:21:05.210" end="00:21:11.170" style="s2">such difficult sits one thing I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.390" end="00:21:14.870" style="s2">learned about doing this over a long</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.170" end="00:21:19.160" style="s2">period of time is that looking back</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.870" end="00:21:21.170" style="s2">retrospectively I find that the</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.160" end="00:21:26.060" style="s2">difficult sits were the ones where the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.170" end="00:21:28.040" style="s2">most change was actually happening those</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.060" end="00:21:29.780" style="s2">wonderful sits are wonderful and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.040" end="00:21:33.290" style="s2">encouraging and they&#39;re motivating us</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.780" end="00:21:36.920" style="s2">and they give us a taste of what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.290" end="00:21:38.840" style="s2">like to see from our Buddha nature of</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.920" end="00:21:40.760" style="s2">what it&#39;s like that had the presence of</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.840" end="00:21:44.840" style="s2">our inner teacher and so those are</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.760" end="00:21:47.240" style="s2">important but the difficult sits and</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.840" end="00:21:49.940" style="s2">again this was not something I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.240" end="00:21:52.120" style="s2">ever realize in those sits but I would</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.940" end="00:21:55.250" style="s2">realize it typically after those sets</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.120" end="00:21:57.650" style="s2">that the difficult sets especially</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.250" end="00:21:59.680" style="s2">they&#39;ve been a sequence of them where</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.650" end="00:22:02.840" style="s2">the ones where something was shifting</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.680" end="00:22:05.500" style="s2">something was changing I was being taken</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.840" end="00:22:08.150" style="s2">out of a comfort zone I was being</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.500" end="00:22:10.580" style="s2">exposed to material that needed to be</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.150" end="00:22:13.670" style="s2">integrated I was dealing with some very</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.580" end="00:22:17.810" style="s2">automatic habits to which I was strongly</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.670" end="00:22:20.120" style="s2">identified and so I&#39;m not trying to in</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.810" end="00:22:22.430" style="s2">any way say oh give you a hallmark it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.120" end="00:22:24.320" style="s2">all good agree they are difficult sits</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.430" end="00:22:26.600" style="s2">they&#39;re just as difficult as the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.320" end="00:22:29.540" style="s2">wonderful suits are wonderful but just</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.600" end="00:22:32.030" style="s2">as the wonder of the wonderful six is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.540" end="00:22:34.550" style="s2">powerful and indicative of something</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.030" end="00:22:36.950" style="s2">happening in us the difficulty of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.550" end="00:22:39.230" style="s2">difficult sets is often also at least</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.950" end="00:22:43.580" style="s2">for me retrospectively and aware an</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.230" end="00:22:47.150" style="s2">indication that powerful change is going</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.580" end="00:22:48.890" style="s2">on I sort of frame it this way that the</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.150" end="00:22:50.480" style="s2">difficult sisters were I am going</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.890" end="00:22:53.880" style="s2">through the process of breaking it</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.480" end="00:22:56.820" style="s2">inappropriate or maladaptive or</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.880" end="00:22:58.320" style="s2">or no longer relevant frame II and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.820" end="00:23:01.140" style="s2">wonderful sits are where I&#39;m sort of</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.320" end="00:23:03.960" style="s2">making a different kind of like you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.140" end="00:23:07.170" style="s2">for pasta and meta so I hope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.960" end="00:23:10.230" style="s2">helpful to you that&#39;s been the case for</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.170" end="00:23:11.910" style="s2">me and I&#39;ve noticed in other people</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.230" end="00:23:14.280" style="s2">writing in these traditions a similar</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.910" end="00:23:16.500" style="s2">thing about the difficult times they</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.280" end="00:23:19.620" style="s2">don&#39;t seem the dry and difficult times</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.500" end="00:23:21.570" style="s2">don&#39;t they seem the most empty the most</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.620" end="00:23:23.580" style="s2">challenging sometimes the most futile</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.570" end="00:23:27.030" style="s2">but they&#39;re actually the time is where a</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.580" end="00:23:29.210" style="s2">lot of really necessary frame breaking</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.030" end="00:23:33.720" style="s2">is going on</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.210" end="00:23:35.490" style="s2">so mark hi mark it&#39;s good to have you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.720" end="00:23:39.770" style="s2">here as always are there more questions</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.490" end="00:23:44.460" style="s2">we can ask for meditative questing yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.770" end="00:23:47.760" style="s2">so beyond Who am I you can also ask what</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.460" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">is really happening right now what is</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.760" end="00:23:54.150" style="s2">really happening right now and so that</p>

<p begin="00:23:54.150" end="00:23:59.940" style="s2">sort of do the Who am I first because</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.800" end="00:24:03.000" style="s2">that sort of it it it gets into the</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.940" end="00:24:05.070" style="s2">attractor space of sort of egocentrism</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.000" end="00:24:07.950" style="s2">and then it works it works with it once</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.070" end="00:24:10.080" style="s2">that&#39;s been loose enough of it try right</p>
