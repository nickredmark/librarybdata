<p begin="00:00:05.470" end="00:00:09.230" style="s2">yeah we wanted to start off despoja</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.970" end="00:00:11.449" style="s2">you introducing yourself a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.230" end="00:00:13.340" style="s2">telling us about your general work</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.449" end="00:00:15.379" style="s2">particularly you talked a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.340" end="00:00:16.699" style="s2">faculty freedom recently and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.379" end="00:00:17.930" style="s2">wondering if you think you want to talk</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.699" end="00:00:20.750" style="s2">a little bit about what you see as the</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.930" end="00:00:26.270" style="s2">ideal relationship between a university</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.750" end="00:00:28.670" style="s2">and its faculty members I think in many</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.270" end="00:00:30.530" style="s2">ways the best thing for the university</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.670" end="00:00:33.770" style="s2">to do with its faculty members is to</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.530" end="00:00:35.420" style="s2">leave them alone and I mean that in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.770" end="00:00:37.100" style="s2">best possible way I mean that was</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.420" end="00:00:39.380" style="s2">actually one of the things I taught here</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.100" end="00:00:41.810" style="s2">from 93 to 98 and one of the things and</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.380" end="00:00:43.070" style="s2">I have the same relationship I would say</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.810" end="00:00:46.399" style="s2">with the university at the University of</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.070" end="00:00:49.370" style="s2">Toronto is that the universities go to a</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.399" end="00:00:52.250" style="s2">tremendous amount of trouble to identify</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.370" end="00:00:53.840" style="s2">promising people in terms of their</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.250" end="00:00:56.270" style="s2">research capability from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.840" end="00:00:59.090" style="s2">world and generally speaking if you</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.270" end="00:01:01.760" style="s2">identify promising people your best bet</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.090" end="00:01:04.820" style="s2">as a manager is to stay out of their way</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.760" end="00:01:06.979" style="s2">now and to remove obstacles from their</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.820" end="00:01:10.069" style="s2">from their from their movement forward</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.979" end="00:01:13.659" style="s2">and I think the universities do a</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.069" end="00:01:16.359" style="s2">credible job of that although my sense</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.659" end="00:01:18.469" style="s2">over the last few decades has been that</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.359" end="00:01:20.840" style="s2">increasingly there are more impediments</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.469" end="00:01:22.639" style="s2">placed in the path of research for</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.840" end="00:01:24.159" style="s2">example I&#39;ve seen that with the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.639" end="00:01:26.329" style="s2">multiplication of the powers of</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.159" end="00:01:28.579" style="s2">institutional review boards for example</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.329" end="00:01:31.130" style="s2">ethics committees which have vastly</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.579" end="00:01:33.529" style="s2">overreached their their their their</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.130" end="00:01:34.939" style="s2">reasonable powers and they slow things</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.529" end="00:01:37.279" style="s2">down and that&#39;s a big mistake if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.939" end="00:01:40.039" style="s2">dealing with people who are conducting</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.279" end="00:01:41.299" style="s2">research into important topics then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.039" end="00:01:42.889" style="s2">want to do everything you possibly can</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.299" end="00:01:44.719" style="s2">to let them move forward as rapidly as</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.889" end="00:01:46.159" style="s2">possible in what ways do you think these</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.719" end="00:01:48.819" style="s2">institutional review boards are these</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:51.409" style="s2">ethics committees have particularly</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.819" end="00:01:53.509" style="s2">damaged the process or the speed of</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.409" end="00:01:55.369" style="s2">research research do you think there are</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.509" end="00:01:56.630" style="s2">times like you have any examples in mind</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.369" end="00:02:01.179" style="s2">of when you think they&#39;ve overreached</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.630" end="00:02:01.179" style="s2">their powers well they may regulate</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.310" end="00:02:18.380" style="s2">I got asked that one&#39;s not on okay find</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.770" end="00:02:19.970" style="s2">it here that better okay now you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.380" end="00:02:25.430" style="s2">hear me which at least in principle</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.970" end="00:02:27.489" style="s2">should be an improvement yeah well I</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.430" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">mean oh yes that&#39;s much better</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.489" end="00:02:32.810" style="s2">yeah well in the social sciences for</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:34.610" style="s2">example the the institutional review</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.810" end="00:02:36.560" style="s2">boards insist upon reviewing the use of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.610" end="00:02:40.190" style="s2">questionnaires in research which i think</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.560" end="00:02:41.690" style="s2">is it&#39;s it&#39;s not helpful questionnaires</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.190" end="00:02:43.519" style="s2">aren&#39;t dangerous and they have no real</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.690" end="00:02:45.650" style="s2">policy set in place to determine the</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.519" end="00:02:47.209" style="s2">difference between dangerous research</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.650" end="00:02:49.849" style="s2">and the normal dangers that people</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.209" end="00:02:53.299" style="s2">expose themselves sells on to on a daily</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.849" end="00:02:54.680" style="s2">basis so and they&#39;ve certainly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.299" end="00:02:56.180" style="s2">institutional review boards have</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.680" end="00:02:57.620" style="s2">certainly slowed down the work in my lab</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.180" end="00:02:59.510" style="s2">for example and made it much more</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.620" end="00:03:01.340" style="s2">onerous we have to do a tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.510" end="00:03:02.540" style="s2">amount of writing and justification for</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.340" end="00:03:04.910" style="s2">this studies long before they&#39;re even</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.540" end="00:03:06.320" style="s2">undertaken and then also to do a fair</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.910" end="00:03:08.540" style="s2">bit of paperwork to keep up with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.320" end="00:03:10.910" style="s2">documentation and I don&#39;t find out the</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.540" end="00:03:12.769" style="s2">least bit useful I know that in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.910" end="00:03:15.049" style="s2">United States the institutional review</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.769" end="00:03:17.359" style="s2">board&#39;s domains of power being cut back</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.049" end="00:03:18.620" style="s2">now because of complaints primarily if I</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.359" end="00:03:20.329" style="s2">remember correctly primary from</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.620" end="00:03:22.299" style="s2">primarily from the granting agencies</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.329" end="00:03:24.620" style="s2">because they&#39;re adding to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.299" end="00:03:28.040" style="s2">unnecessary expense that&#39;s associated</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.620" end="00:03:29.799" style="s2">with research so in the university</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.040" end="00:03:32.269" style="s2">should the university administration</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.799" end="00:03:34.310" style="s2">fundamentally exists to serve the</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.269" end="00:03:36.889" style="s2">faculty and students and probably the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.310" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">students first in the faculty second but</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.889" end="00:03:41.389" style="s2">increasingly I see that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:43.670" style="s2">administration is is multiplying out of</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.389" end="00:03:45.799" style="s2">control and and that&#39;s quite well</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.670" end="00:03:48.440" style="s2">documented in terms of overall cost and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.799" end="00:03:50.540" style="s2">some of that&#39;s driven by legislation and</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.440" end="00:03:52.069" style="s2">it&#39;s so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not something</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.540" end="00:03:53.900" style="s2">that&#39;s necessarily intrinsic to the</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.069" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">administration itself but that&#39;s one of</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.900" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">the things that&#39;s driving the spiraling</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:04:02.269" style="s2">up ever ever upward spiral of Titian</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:03.920" style="s2">costs yep so aside from research ethics</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.269" end="00:04:07.010" style="s2">boards institutional review boards</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.920" end="00:04:07.850" style="s2">ethics committees do you think that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.010" end="00:04:09.260" style="s2">there are other ways that the</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.850" end="00:04:12.620" style="s2">administration has interfered with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.260" end="00:04:15.140" style="s2">work particularly you&#39;ve recently come</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.620" end="00:04:16.760" style="s2">under fire by some administration</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.140" end="00:04:18.530" style="s2">at the University of Toronto for certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.760" end="00:04:19.910" style="s2">controversial views you hold you</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.530" end="00:04:21.920" style="s2">mentioned that you think the</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.910" end="00:04:23.630" style="s2">administration&#39;s primary obligation</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.920" end="00:04:26.570" style="s2">should be to its students and then it</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.630" end="00:04:29.180" style="s2">should also serve its faculty do you see</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.570" end="00:04:31.790" style="s2">the administration using that mission</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.180" end="00:04:33.110" style="s2">properly when they try to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.790" end="00:04:34.280" style="s2">faculty about certain statements that</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.110" end="00:04:37.340" style="s2">they have made or do you think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.280" end="00:04:39.080" style="s2">also an overreach of their power well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.340" end="00:04:41.390" style="s2">think it reflects a more general</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.080" end="00:04:44.080" style="s2">societal confusion about just exactly</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.390" end="00:04:47.960" style="s2">what our priorities are I made a video</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:50.030" style="s2">back in September stating my objections</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.960" end="00:04:52.130" style="s2">to the mandated use of a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.030" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">category of pronoun that I object to</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.130" end="00:04:57.620" style="s2">mostly on the grounds that I felt that</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.040" end="00:05:00.169" style="s2">the government had no right compelling</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.620" end="00:05:01.940" style="s2">people&#39;s speech and also because</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.169" end="00:05:03.440" style="s2">personally I didn&#39;t want to use the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.940" end="00:05:06.440" style="s2">pronouns that were being put forward by</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.440" end="00:05:08.600" style="s2">people I regard as holding up</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.440" end="00:05:11.840" style="s2">philosophical and political ethos that I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.600" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">find really really quite detestable and</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.840" end="00:05:16.460" style="s2">I made a video about that and mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:18.800" style="s2">during the video that the act of making</p>

<p begin="00:05:23.240" end="00:05:27.410" style="s2">become illegal federally with some new</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.490" end="00:05:30.169" style="s2">legislation and that it likely violated</p>

<p begin="00:05:33.860" end="00:05:38.060" style="s2">and the university promptly validated my</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.350" end="00:05:39.950" style="s2">concerns by sending me two letters</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.060" end="00:05:41.930" style="s2">telling me to stop making such</p>

<p begin="00:05:51.190" end="00:05:55.100" style="s2">the reason that the university did that</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.540" end="00:05:56.750" style="s2">was because they had faced a certain</p>

<p begin="00:06:20.600" end="00:06:24.710" style="s2">that they had received hundreds perhaps</p>

<p begin="00:06:28.910" end="00:06:34.850" style="s2">I think when the administration when the</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.390" end="00:06:36.950" style="s2">administration regards its duty its</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.850" end="00:06:39.770" style="s2">fundamental duty to promote some</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.950" end="00:06:41.780" style="s2">illusory notion of safety and then also</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.770" end="00:06:43.700" style="s2">is willing to falsify the facts on the</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.780" end="00:06:45.260" style="s2">ground by omission that they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.700" end="00:06:48.080" style="s2">definitely overstepped their boundaries</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.260" end="00:06:51.590" style="s2">and I would say that they were they were</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.080" end="00:06:53.060" style="s2">put back they were set back on their</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.590" end="00:06:57.530" style="s2">heels let&#39;s put it that way</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.060" end="00:06:59.810" style="s2">by a very strident outpouring strident</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.530" end="00:07:01.790" style="s2">powerful outpouring of public opinion in</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.810" end="00:07:03.410" style="s2">Canada and that was although that was</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.790" end="00:07:05.240" style="s2">good for me because I got two letters</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.410" end="00:07:07.580" style="s2">and generally if you&#39;re dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.240" end="00:07:09.620" style="s2">human resources professionals then three</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.580" end="00:07:11.390" style="s2">letters is the warning and then the next</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.620" end="00:07:12.920" style="s2">step is something more serious I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.390" end="00:07:15.020" style="s2">curious you mentioned the term safe</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.920" end="00:07:17.000" style="s2">space in particular for university and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.020" end="00:07:18.890" style="s2">wanted to link this back to this idea</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.000" end="00:07:21.470" style="s2">that university administration should be</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.890" end="00:07:24.080" style="s2">serving students first and faculty</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.470" end="00:07:25.370" style="s2">second so do you think that the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.080" end="00:07:27.080" style="s2">administration has some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.370" end="00:07:28.970" style="s2">compelling mandate to make sure that</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.080" end="00:07:31.340" style="s2">students feel safe no they haven&#39;t they</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.970" end="00:07:33.650" style="s2">have exactly the reverse mandate there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.340" end="00:07:36.170" style="s2">nothing safe about being educated if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.650" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">want to be safe stay home the things</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.170" end="00:07:39.680" style="s2">that you need to be educated about our</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:41.540" style="s2">terrible things almost always if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.680" end="00:07:42.920" style="s2">study history properly it&#39;s terrible if</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.540" end="00:07:44.450" style="s2">you study literature properly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.920" end="00:07:46.670" style="s2">terrible if you study psychology</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.450" end="00:07:48.680" style="s2">properly all of these fields of endeavor</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.670" end="00:07:50.180" style="s2">teach you the painful things that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.680" end="00:07:52.190" style="s2">need to know to understand what human</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.180" end="00:07:54.230" style="s2">beings and society are like and so the</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.190" end="00:07:55.790" style="s2">idea first of all the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.230" end="00:07:57.440" style="s2">university should be a safe space is</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.790" end="00:08:00.410" style="s2">absolutely preposterous but it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.440" end="00:08:03.140" style="s2">preposterous for more more I would say</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.410" end="00:08:05.240" style="s2">immediate reason so one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.140" end="00:08:08.630" style="s2">the there&#39;s a few things that we know as</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.240" end="00:08:10.520" style="s2">as clinical psychologists as a field and</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.630" end="00:08:12.650" style="s2">also as practitioners with regards to</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.520" end="00:08:15.560" style="s2">how to treat people who suffer let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.650" end="00:08:17.450" style="s2">from an excess of anxiety and what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.560" end="00:08:19.730" style="s2">do with people who suffer from an excess</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.450" end="00:08:21.050" style="s2">of anxiety is exposed them to the very</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.730" end="00:08:23.150" style="s2">things that they&#39;re afraid of or</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.050" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">sometimes disgusted by and you have you</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.150" end="00:08:27.350" style="s2">help them voluntarily expose themselves</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:29.090" style="s2">to such things and that doesn&#39;t make the</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.350" end="00:08:31.910" style="s2">world safer it makes them braver and</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.090" end="00:08:35.300" style="s2">more competent and so the notion that</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.910" end="00:08:37.099" style="s2">you serve students safety concerns even</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.300" end="00:08:38.660" style="s2">by shielding them from things that they</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.099" end="00:08:40.540" style="s2">don&#39;t wish to encounter there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.660" end="00:08:42.649" style="s2">absolutely I can&#39;t think of a single</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.540" end="00:08:45.139" style="s2">possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.649" end="00:08:47.959" style="s2">the reason why you would ever undertake</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.139" end="00:08:49.339" style="s2">such an endeavor I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.959" end="00:08:51.889" style="s2">neat to talk about it in the abstract</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.339" end="00:08:53.720" style="s2">but the particular concern that perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.889" end="00:08:56.209" style="s2">a lot of students and a lot of members</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.720" end="00:08:59.569" style="s2">of the community have with your case is</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.209" end="00:09:01.569" style="s2">the particular pronoun usage issue so in</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.569" end="00:09:04.550" style="s2">that instance I&#39;m wondering if you think</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.569" end="00:09:05.839" style="s2">there&#39;s a real harm so if someone comes</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.550" end="00:09:08.179" style="s2">to you one of your students let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.839" end="00:09:10.579" style="s2">and would really feel more comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.179" end="00:09:12.920" style="s2">engaging with the deep troubling</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.579" end="00:09:16.220" style="s2">historical or psychological or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.920" end="00:09:18.679" style="s2">field truths if you refer to the student</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.220" end="00:09:20.420" style="s2">with certain pronouns do you really</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.679" end="00:09:22.929" style="s2">think that&#39;s a necessary place where</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.420" end="00:09:26.119" style="s2">they need that you know severe exposure</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.929" end="00:09:28.429" style="s2">or do you think there is some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.119" end="00:09:31.399" style="s2">you know harm by calling them the</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.429" end="00:09:33.019" style="s2">pronoun that they well I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.399" end="00:09:34.610" style="s2">it was fundamentally a fabricated issue</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.019" end="00:09:36.350" style="s2">it&#39;s been fabricated for political</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.610" end="00:09:38.149" style="s2">reasons I know the history of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.350" end="00:09:40.459" style="s2">relevant legislation in Ontario and</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.149" end="00:09:42.829" style="s2">initially the legislation was basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.459" end="00:09:44.929" style="s2">predicated on the idea that that gender</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.829" end="00:09:47.059" style="s2">identity was a social construct and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.929" end="00:09:48.559" style="s2">there were going to be protections put</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.059" end="00:09:50.240" style="s2">in place for people whose gender</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.559" end="00:09:51.649" style="s2">identity had switched so that they</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.240" end="00:09:55.220" style="s2">weren&#39;t subject to harassment or</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.649" end="00:09:57.730" style="s2">discrimination and there&#39;s no utility in</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.220" end="00:09:59.480" style="s2">subjecting people to counterproductive</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.730" end="00:10:01.879" style="s2">discrimination and I would consider</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.480" end="00:10:03.829" style="s2">discrimination counterproductive when</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.879" end="00:10:05.540" style="s2">the discrimination occurs for reasons</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.829" end="00:10:08.720" style="s2">that aren&#39;t relevant to the task at hand</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.540" end="00:10:11.620" style="s2">if we discriminate all the time but the</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.720" end="00:10:14.980" style="s2">the government ran the policies by a</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.620" end="00:10:17.660" style="s2">relatively select group of activists and</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.980" end="00:10:19.220" style="s2">transformed it into a piece of policy</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.660" end="00:10:21.410" style="s2">legislation that no one in the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.220" end="00:10:24.110" style="s2">mind would abide by or could abide by</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.410" end="00:10:26.240" style="s2">for that matter and reduced for example</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.110" end="00:10:27.709" style="s2">the idea of human identity to something</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.240" end="00:10:30.350" style="s2">that basically transforms on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.709" end="00:10:31.970" style="s2">subjective whim and so I don&#39;t buy any</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.350" end="00:10:33.350" style="s2">of that I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.970" end="00:10:35.569" style="s2">identity is I don&#39;t think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.350" end="00:10:37.579" style="s2">fundamentally self-generated it it might</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.569" end="00:10:39.799" style="s2">be socio-culturally constructive to some</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.579" end="00:10:43.129" style="s2">degree and then it most certainly is but</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.799" end="00:10:45.499" style="s2">the idea that your identity is solely</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.129" end="00:10:47.929" style="s2">your choice and that you have the right</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.499" end="00:10:51.019" style="s2">to inflict that on other people is</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.929" end="00:10:52.850" style="s2">absolutely preposterous most people grow</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.019" end="00:10:54.740" style="s2">out of that idea when they&#39;re 2 years of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.850" end="00:10:56.089" style="s2">age and I mean that technically because</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.740" end="00:10:57.740" style="s2">we know that</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.089" end="00:10:59.720" style="s2">when children hit about three years of</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.740" end="00:11:00.889" style="s2">age they&#39;re able to start playing social</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.720" end="00:11:04.339" style="s2">games and that&#39;s when they start</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.889" end="00:11:06.740" style="s2">learning that that identity is a is at</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.339" end="00:11:08.209" style="s2">minimum a socially negotiated phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.740" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">no okay</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.209" end="00:11:12.319" style="s2">so apart from that there&#39;s no agreement</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:13.850" style="s2">whatsoever on the set of pronouns that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.319" end="00:11:16.550" style="s2">will be used and they&#39;ve multiplied</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.850" end="00:11:17.660" style="s2">beyond anybody&#39;s anybody&#39;s imagination I</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.550" end="00:11:19.699" style="s2">would say including the people who</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.660" end="00:11:21.110" style="s2">formulated the legislation and then</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.699" end="00:11:23.059" style="s2">there&#39;s the fact that you don&#39;t refer to</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.110" end="00:11:24.949" style="s2">people by their pronouns anyways their</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.059" end="00:11:27.230" style="s2">third-person pronouns and so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.949" end="00:11:28.999" style="s2">call you he when we&#39;re talking I might</p>

<p begin="00:11:30.889" end="00:11:34.279" style="s2">time it&#39;s a moot point</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.910" end="00:11:35.749" style="s2">anyways sure but dr. Peterson in the</p>

<p begin="00:11:44.029" end="00:11:47.300" style="s2">a harm to props you can disagree with</p>

<p begin="00:11:58.610" end="00:12:01.939" style="s2">view that I don&#39;t really think</p>

<p begin="00:12:09.620" end="00:12:14.420" style="s2">by sticking to my belief about what</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.319" end="00:12:15.920" style="s2">their identity is well the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.420" end="00:12:17.389" style="s2">you&#39;d have to establish is whether or</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.920" end="00:12:19.699" style="s2">not that would actually constitute harm</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.389" end="00:12:21.050" style="s2">that&#39;s the claim and the person might</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.699" end="00:12:22.850" style="s2">say well you&#39;re harming me but that</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.050" end="00:12:25.100" style="s2">doesn&#39;t provide evidence that you are</p>

<p begin="00:12:25.970" end="00:12:29.749" style="s2">they&#39;re not harmed by at all so I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.249" end="00:12:31.429" style="s2">think that the mere claim that someone</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.749" end="00:12:33.439" style="s2">thinks that the way I would address them</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.429" end="00:12:35.509" style="s2">might harm them gives them the right to</p>

<p begin="00:12:39.259" end="00:12:42.559" style="s2">here&#39;s something else that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.550" end="00:12:46.429" style="s2">noting from a more practical perspective</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.559" end="00:12:48.829" style="s2">I mean I received letters from about 30</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.429" end="00:12:50.029" style="s2">trans people and that&#39;s actually a lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.829" end="00:12:51.620" style="s2">because there aren&#39;t that many people</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.029" end="00:12:52.819" style="s2">and these are people who by and large</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.620" end="00:12:55.490" style="s2">we&#39;re very serious about their</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.819" end="00:12:57.290" style="s2">transformations and all but one of them</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.490" end="00:12:59.540" style="s2">agreed with what I was doing saying</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.290" end="00:13:01.309" style="s2">first of all that they never asked to be</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.540" end="00:13:03.019" style="s2">represented by the activists who claimed</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.309" end="00:13:04.850" style="s2">to be representing them no so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.019" end="00:13:06.439" style="s2">proposition right so imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.850" end="00:13:08.269" style="s2">there&#39;s a group of people and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.439" end="00:13:09.830" style="s2">somebody is a member of that group of</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.269" end="00:13:11.900" style="s2">people and</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.830" end="00:13:13.790" style="s2">that person stands forth as a member of</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.900" end="00:13:15.380" style="s2">that group and says because I&#39;m a member</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.790" end="00:13:17.350" style="s2">of that group I speak for all those</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.380" end="00:13:19.550" style="s2">people it&#39;s like actually no you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.350" end="00:13:20.840" style="s2">the mere fact that you&#39;re the member of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.550" end="00:13:22.670" style="s2">a group doesn&#39;t give you any right</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.840" end="00:13:24.950" style="s2">whatsoever to speak on behalf of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.670" end="00:13:26.780" style="s2">group you need to have legitimacy as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.950" end="00:13:29.390" style="s2">representative and I don&#39;t I think that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.780" end="00:13:33.590" style="s2">that you can hardly imagine a more</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.390" end="00:13:35.420" style="s2">pernicious example say of racism than to</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.590" end="00:13:37.520" style="s2">presume that if someone is black they</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.420" end="00:13:39.320" style="s2">speak on behalf of all black people all</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.520" end="00:13:41.120" style="s2">black people are homogeneous they all</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.320" end="00:13:43.460" style="s2">believe exactly the same thing therefore</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.120" end="00:13:45.230" style="s2">if you talk to or met one of them you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.460" end="00:13:47.180" style="s2">talked to or met them all respect dr.</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.230" end="00:13:48.740" style="s2">Peterson I think I&#39;m referring to cases</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.180" end="00:13:51.080" style="s2">where the actual people in front of you</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.740" end="00:13:53.090" style="s2">are telling you though that they want to</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.080" end="00:13:54.560" style="s2">they want to represent themselves a</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.090" end="00:13:56.600" style="s2">certain way right so we can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.560" end="00:13:58.550" style="s2">whether or not the activist community is</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.600" end="00:14:01.580" style="s2">accurately representing actual</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.550" end="00:14:02.840" style="s2">communities but I&#39;m wondering you</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.580" end="00:14:04.880" style="s2">mentioned you don&#39;t think like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.840" end="00:14:06.230" style="s2">self-report of like oh this is harming</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.880" end="00:14:08.210" style="s2">me or I would not be comfortable</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.230" end="00:14:09.980" style="s2">interacting with you unless you know X</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.210" end="00:14:12.260" style="s2">happened would not be an accurate way of</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.980" end="00:14:14.840" style="s2">describing real harm are there better</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.260" end="00:14:16.850" style="s2">metrics we have for real harm if someone</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.840" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">comes up to me and they say oh you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.850" end="00:14:21.830" style="s2">when they&#39;re feeling too warm in this</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:23.930" style="s2">room we should leave you know do I say</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.830" end="00:14:26.060" style="s2">ah no like you don&#39;t know how warm you</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.930" end="00:14:27.740" style="s2">are that&#39;s not something you can know</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.060" end="00:14:29.300" style="s2">for yourself that&#39;s just a self-report</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.740" end="00:14:31.880" style="s2">well it would depend on what they were</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.300" end="00:14:33.170" style="s2">asking other people to do and I don&#39;t I</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.880" end="00:14:35.960" style="s2">don&#39;t believe that people have the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.170" end="00:14:37.550" style="s2">to to impose restrictions on what not so</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.960" end="00:14:39.800" style="s2">much restrictions on what I&#39;m allowed to</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.550" end="00:14:41.060" style="s2">say but to determine the content of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.800" end="00:14:43.790" style="s2">speech that&#39;s an entirely different</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.060" end="00:14:45.350" style="s2">thing and so if it&#39;s a matter of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.790" end="00:14:46.790" style="s2">legal principle of whether or not I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.350" end="00:14:48.950" style="s2">free to determine the content of my</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.790" end="00:14:50.600" style="s2">speech or the hypothetical discomfort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.950" end="00:14:52.670" style="s2">a hypothetical person because no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.600" end="00:14:54.050" style="s2">actually asked me this yet okay and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.670" end="00:14:56.270" style="s2">going to go with the freedom from</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.050" end="00:14:58.010" style="s2">compelled speech partly again because I</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.270" end="00:14:59.690" style="s2">think that the idea that the government</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.010" end="00:15:02.180" style="s2">or any other institution should regulate</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.690" end="00:15:04.580" style="s2">the content of your speech is absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.180" end="00:15:06.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s intolerable I think you have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.580" end="00:15:07.850" style="s2">strong legal argument right so the</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.200" end="00:15:10.070" style="s2">government probably should mandate this</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.850" end="00:15:12.500" style="s2">that I&#39;m sure a lot of people might</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.070" end="00:15:13.700" style="s2">agree with that I&#39;m still curious though</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.500" end="00:15:15.440" style="s2">in this hypothetical scenario that a</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.700" end="00:15:18.290" style="s2">student did or a person did approach you</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.440" end="00:15:19.730" style="s2">and they told you they would be harmed</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.290" end="00:15:21.550" style="s2">or they would be uncomfortable unless</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.730" end="00:15:23.660" style="s2">you refer to them with a certain pronoun</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.550" end="00:15:29.180" style="s2">what would you do</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.660" end="00:15:30.830" style="s2">well I really have a hard time answering</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.180" end="00:15:33.050" style="s2">questions like that because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.830" end="00:15:35.600" style="s2">asked in the hypothetical Pinkerton and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.050" end="00:15:37.250" style="s2">they could yeah but my sense because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.600" end="00:15:39.080" style="s2">a clinician is that I generally handle</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.250" end="00:15:41.630" style="s2">those sorts of things at the level of</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.080" end="00:15:43.160" style="s2">actual detail and so I would say it</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.630" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">would depend on the person it would</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.160" end="00:15:46.490" style="s2">depend on the situation it would depend</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:48.110" style="s2">on why they asked me it would depend on</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.490" end="00:15:49.730" style="s2">how they asked me it would depend on</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.110" end="00:15:51.980" style="s2">what I thought they were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.730" end="00:15:53.660" style="s2">accomplish by the request it would it</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.980" end="00:15:55.970" style="s2">would depend on whether or not they were</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.660" end="00:15:57.410" style="s2">filming me well they were asking me it</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.970" end="00:15:59.360" style="s2">would depend on whether they asked me in</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.410" end="00:16:00.830" style="s2">my office or in the hallway you know I</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.360" end="00:16:03.860" style="s2">can tell the difference between a</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.830" end="00:16:05.450" style="s2">genuine plea for understanding and a bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.860" end="00:16:07.340" style="s2">of political theater or political</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.450" end="00:16:09.140" style="s2">manipulation now what I&#39;ve dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.340" end="00:16:10.520" style="s2">people who&#39;ve made all sorts of requests</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.140" end="00:16:12.020" style="s2">of me believe me because I&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.520" end="00:16:14.570" style="s2">clinical practice for about twenty years</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.020" end="00:16:16.220" style="s2">and my experience with with the range of</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.570" end="00:16:18.470" style="s2">human behavior is I would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.220" end="00:16:19.970" style="s2">extraordinarily extensive and so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.470" end="00:16:22.160" style="s2">made all sorts of adjustments to the way</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.970" end="00:16:23.480" style="s2">I interact with people so I can&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.160" end="00:16:25.370" style="s2">exactly what I would do in a given</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.480" end="00:16:26.990" style="s2">situation because I firmly believe that</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.370" end="00:16:29.740" style="s2">the devil is in the details</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.990" end="00:16:32.890" style="s2">and I haven&#39;t been making a case about a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.740" end="00:16:36.650" style="s2">specific interaction that I had actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.890" end="00:16:38.960" style="s2">experienced or or or or or yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.650" end="00:16:40.550" style="s2">experienced I&#39;ve been making a case a</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.960" end="00:16:43.100" style="s2">philosophical fundamentally a</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.550" end="00:16:44.840" style="s2">philosophical case and and secondarily a</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.100" end="00:16:46.820" style="s2">political case and I think that I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.840" end="00:16:48.530" style="s2">made the case properly but you would say</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.820" end="00:16:51.080" style="s2">that you recognize a difference between</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.530" end="00:16:53.120" style="s2">a like legal responsibility to do</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.080" end="00:16:54.980" style="s2">something versus a sort of individual</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.120" end="00:16:56.840" style="s2">personal choice I should do something</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.980" end="00:16:58.340" style="s2">right sometimes I recognize that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.840" end="00:16:59.930" style="s2">sometimes the legal and the</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.340" end="00:17:01.640" style="s2">philosophical and the personal issue are</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.930" end="00:17:03.740" style="s2">all the same it&#39;s simpler when that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.640" end="00:17:05.480" style="s2">the case but I also think that the issue</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.740" end="00:17:08.839" style="s2">is essentially a red herring</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.480" end="00:17:10.730" style="s2">I mean look since I made that video for</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.839" end="00:17:12.290" style="s2">one reason or another things that I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:17:16.880" end="00:17:21.230" style="s2">far has been support and the reason for</p>

<p begin="00:17:27.199" end="00:17:30.620" style="s2">why this issue has had legs are not here</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.270" end="00:17:33.530" style="s2">because people are interested in my</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.620" end="00:17:36.230" style="s2">views on pronouns now I happen to put my</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.530" end="00:17:37.370" style="s2">foot down so to speak at a particular</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.230" end="00:17:38.840" style="s2">place because it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.370" end="00:17:40.250" style="s2">frequently the case that if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.840" end="00:17:42.710" style="s2">engaged in a complex philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.250" end="00:17:45.710" style="s2">dispute which is the case for our</p>

<p begin="00:17:49.370" end="00:17:53.750" style="s2">an actual cause so you have to draw the</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.190" end="00:17:55.640" style="s2">line somewhere and people have asked me</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.750" end="00:17:57.500" style="s2">well why did you pick the pronoun Hill</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.640" end="00:18:00.020" style="s2">to die on and my answer to that</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.500" end="00:18:04.280" style="s2">generally is a I didn&#39;t die and B you</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.020" end="00:18:06.800" style="s2">have it and B you have to you have to</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.280" end="00:18:08.720" style="s2">pick something real yeah to to enter</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.800" end="00:18:09.830" style="s2">into the debate so for example if I</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.720" end="00:18:11.750" style="s2">would have just made another video</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.830" end="00:18:13.700" style="s2">decrying political correctness it would</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.750" end="00:18:15.230" style="s2">have gone nowhere at all but I said that</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.700" end="00:18:17.179" style="s2">there was something I wouldn&#39;t do and</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.230" end="00:18:19.640" style="s2">one of the things I won&#39;t do is use the</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.179" end="00:18:21.410" style="s2">made-up words of postmodern neo-marxists</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.640" end="00:18:23.179" style="s2">who are playing a particular game with</p>

<p begin="00:18:25.280" end="00:18:30.620" style="s2">philosophy and if that happens to mean</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.440" end="00:18:33.490" style="s2">that I have to engage in discussions</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.620" end="00:18:36.170" style="s2">about whether or not if I you know if a</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.020" end="00:18:43.190" style="s2">through life came and asked me politely</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.090" end="00:18:46.010" style="s2">if I would go out of my way to</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.190" end="00:18:47.720" style="s2">accommodate them I I think that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.010" end="00:18:50.030" style="s2">think that those issues actually belong</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.720" end="00:18:54.710" style="s2">on the same in the same they&#39;re not the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.030" end="00:18:56.990" style="s2">same category of issue I mean so so I</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.710" end="00:18:58.929" style="s2">don&#39;t see that there&#39;s well I guess</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.990" end="00:19:01.160" style="s2">that&#39;s enough said about that all right</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.929" end="00:19:04.160" style="s2">let&#39;s transition a little bit so you</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.160" end="00:19:06.200" style="s2">mentioned sort of post-modernism and new</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.160" end="00:19:08.480" style="s2">Marxism in fact in a statement at</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.200" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">McMaster University you claim that an</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.480" end="00:19:13.820" style="s2">expression that the protest that you see</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:15.650" style="s2">at your events are an expression of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.820" end="00:19:17.780" style="s2">philosophy that&#39;s grounded partly in</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.650" end="00:19:20.650" style="s2">post-modernism and partly in Marxism</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.780" end="00:19:23.630" style="s2">yeah what does that mean first and</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.650" end="00:19:25.460" style="s2">secondly how would you say that these</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.630" end="00:19:26.030" style="s2">movements are characterized in those</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.460" end="00:19:28.280" style="s2">ways</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.030" end="00:19:30.260" style="s2">well if McMaster it meant that some of</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.280" end="00:19:31.940" style="s2">the protesters came with came and hid</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.260" end="00:19:33.020" style="s2">behind a banner that had a hammer and</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.940" end="00:19:36.760" style="s2">sickle on it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.020" end="00:19:36.760" style="s2">you know hey no</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.930" end="00:19:41.050" style="s2">so you see the funny thing is the funny</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.250" end="00:19:43.000" style="s2">thing is is that people laugh about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.050" end="00:19:44.230" style="s2">and I understand perfectly well while</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.000" end="00:19:45.400" style="s2">you&#39;re laughing but I can tell you you</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.230" end="00:19:48.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have laughed if it would have</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.400" end="00:19:49.680" style="s2">been a swastika and it&#39;s no no it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.220" end="00:19:53.830" style="s2">funnier that it was a hammer and sickle</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.680" end="00:19:55.600" style="s2">you know the the the the reprehensible</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.830" end="00:19:57.700" style="s2">ideologies that are based in in</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.600" end="00:19:59.080" style="s2">fundamental Marxism killed at least a</p>

<p begin="00:20:10.690" end="00:20:14.290" style="s2">wasn&#39;t real communism or something</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.700" end="00:20:16.300" style="s2">foolish like that even though we had</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.290" end="00:20:17.830" style="s2">multiple examples of exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.300" end="00:20:20.290" style="s2">happens when those doctors are let loose</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.830" end="00:20:22.900" style="s2">in the world and so what what happened</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.290" end="00:20:24.370" style="s2">in the 1960s in the late 1960s as far as</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.900" end="00:20:26.770" style="s2">I can tell and this happened mostly in</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.370" end="00:20:29.380" style="s2">France which has probably produced the</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.770" end="00:20:30.880" style="s2">most reprehensible coterie of public</p>

<p begin="00:20:30.880" end="00:20:36.850" style="s2">managed is that in in the late 1960s</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.360" end="00:20:38.020" style="s2">when all the student activists had</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.850" end="00:20:39.940" style="s2">decided that the marxist revolution</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.020" end="00:20:42.460" style="s2">wasn&#39;t going to occur in the Western</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.940" end="00:20:44.860" style="s2">world and and had finally also realized</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.460" end="00:20:47.680" style="s2">that apologizing for the Soviet for the</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.860" end="00:20:49.720" style="s2">Soviet system was just not going to fly</p>

<p begin="00:20:49.720" end="00:20:53.680" style="s2">of bodies that had stacked up that they</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.880" end="00:20:55.360" style="s2">performed what I would call a</p>

<p begin="00:20:55.360" end="00:20:59.950" style="s2">transformed the class war into a you</p>

<p begin="00:21:01.810" end="00:21:05.410" style="s2">popular mostly transmitted through</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.850" end="00:21:07.300" style="s2">people like Jacques Derrida who became</p>

<p begin="00:24:24.769" end="00:24:28.490" style="s2">mean well let me give you an example so</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.480" end="00:24:29.990" style="s2">and here&#39;s one of the things that really</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.490" end="00:24:31.490" style="s2">bothered me about what was going on in</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.990" end="00:24:33.769" style="s2">Ontario and this is happening everywhere</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.490" end="00:24:35.630" style="s2">and I made this claim when I made my</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.769" end="00:24:38.330" style="s2">first video since we have to get into</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.630" end="00:24:40.940" style="s2">this so the technical claim in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.330" end="00:24:42.409" style="s2">Ontario legislature now and this is how</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.940" end="00:24:43.700" style="s2">this has already happened in New York by</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.409" end="00:24:44.870" style="s2">the way this is not only a Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.700" end="00:24:46.490" style="s2">thing it&#39;s happening in Australia it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.870" end="00:24:48.620" style="s2">happening in New Zealand it&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.490" end="00:24:51.289" style="s2">everywhere here&#39;s the claim there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.620" end="00:24:52.970" style="s2">biological sex there&#39;s gender identity</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.289" end="00:24:54.649" style="s2">there&#39;s gender expression and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.970" end="00:24:56.779" style="s2">sexual proclivity and they vary</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.649" end="00:24:58.850" style="s2">independently that&#39;s the technical claim</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.779" end="00:24:59.630" style="s2">it&#39;s built into the Canadian law that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.850" end="00:25:01.610" style="s2">not true</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.630" end="00:25:03.679" style="s2">no not a bit of that is true the</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.610" end="00:25:06.289" style="s2">correlation between biological sex and</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.679" end="00:25:08.149" style="s2">gender identity exceeds 0.99 it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.289" end="00:25:10.730" style="s2">virtually perfect it&#39;s the very</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.149" end="00:25:12.919" style="s2">definition of non independent so you</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.730" end="00:25:15.230" style="s2">think almost everyone who&#39;s biologically</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.919" end="00:25:17.360" style="s2">male identifies as biologically male</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.230" end="00:25:19.970" style="s2">almost everyone who identifies as</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.360" end="00:25:21.740" style="s2">biologically male dresses and acts male</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.970" end="00:25:23.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the gender identity element and</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.740" end="00:25:26.360" style="s2">almost everybody who is biologically</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.960" end="00:25:29.299" style="s2">male who identifies as male who dresses</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.360" end="00:25:31.220" style="s2">as male is in fact heterosexual those</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.299" end="00:25:32.870" style="s2">things are incredibly tightly linked but</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.220" end="00:25:35.149" style="s2">the technical claim in the legislation</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.870" end="00:25:37.460" style="s2">is that they vary independently wrong</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.149" end="00:25:39.110" style="s2">now I got in trouble for saying that</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.460" end="00:25:41.450" style="s2">because what people claimed was that I</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.110" end="00:25:43.279" style="s2">was denying the existence of people who</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.450" end="00:25:44.659" style="s2">don&#39;t fit neatly into the gendered</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.279" end="00:25:46.370" style="s2">category I thought yeah I&#39;m moving at</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.659" end="00:25:48.830" style="s2">all point zero one or whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.370" end="00:25:50.750" style="s2">percentage may be that wouldn&#39;t fall</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.830" end="00:25:52.639" style="s2">neatly under that quarter suit certainly</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.750" end="00:25:53.929" style="s2">if there were a perfect correlation that</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.639" end="00:25:56.000" style="s2">would work but if there&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.929" end="00:25:58.970" style="s2">it would seem perhaps that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.000" end="00:26:00.590" style="s2">excluding certain people right so if if</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.970" end="00:26:02.130" style="s2">most people tend to identify a certain</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.590" end="00:26:04.770" style="s2">way but there is that point of</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.130" end="00:26:07.260" style="s2">not I know I was never denying their</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.770" end="00:26:08.820" style="s2">existence I was denying the validity of</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.260" end="00:26:11.040" style="s2">the claim that those four levels of</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.820" end="00:26:13.470" style="s2">analysis existed independently of one</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.040" end="00:26:15.810" style="s2">another which they don&#39;t it&#39;s a false</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.470" end="00:26:17.850" style="s2">claim and the reason that the radical</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.810" end="00:26:18.990" style="s2">social constructionist who are pursuing</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.850" end="00:26:20.820" style="s2">this line of reasoning which is</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.990" end="00:26:22.080" style="s2">completely discredited as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.820" end="00:26:24.270" style="s2">concerned I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any better</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.080" end="00:26:26.460" style="s2">than claiming that the world is flat the</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.270" end="00:26:28.050" style="s2">reason that they&#39;re pursuing it legally</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.460" end="00:26:29.790" style="s2">is because they know perfectly well that</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.050" end="00:26:31.680" style="s2">they lost the scientific discussion I</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.790" end="00:26:33.540" style="s2">mean I debated someone on Canadian</p>

<p begin="00:26:33.540" end="00:26:37.230" style="s2">that they know the scientific consensus</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.790" end="00:26:38.700" style="s2">over the last four decades was that</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.230" end="00:26:40.770" style="s2">there was no biological differences</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.700" end="00:26:42.360" style="s2">between men and women I mean and that</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.770" end="00:26:45.090" style="s2">was I could love one of the things that</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.360" end="00:26:46.380" style="s2">was so absolutely absurd about that and</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.090" end="00:26:48.570" style="s2">there were many things that were absurd</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.380" end="00:26:50.100" style="s2">about it was that I was in trouble with</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.570" end="00:26:52.980" style="s2">the University at that point and he</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.100" end="00:26:55.920" style="s2">wasn&#39;t it&#39;s like first of all that is</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.980" end="00:26:57.260" style="s2">what is not the scientific consensus of</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.920" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">the last four decades</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.260" end="00:27:01.740" style="s2">and and the idea that there are no</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:03.210" style="s2">biological differences between men and</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.740" end="00:27:05.220" style="s2">women it&#39;s the sort of thing you hear</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.210" end="00:27:07.860" style="s2">that it just makes your jaw drop</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.220" end="00:27:10.440" style="s2">now what you could say is that if you</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.860" end="00:27:12.660" style="s2">took all the dimensions along which men</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.440" end="00:27:14.070" style="s2">and women vary and there&#39;s a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.660" end="00:27:16.650" style="s2">number of them that there&#39;s substantial</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.070" end="00:27:18.330" style="s2">overlap between men and women on almost</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.650" end="00:27:19.590" style="s2">all of the dimensions now that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.330" end="00:27:21.240" style="s2">particularly true with chromosomal</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.590" end="00:27:23.730" style="s2">identity although there are some</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.240" end="00:27:25.110" style="s2">exceptions like with personality for</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.730" end="00:27:27.060" style="s2">example and I happen to be somewhat of</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.110" end="00:27:29.430" style="s2">an expert on personality there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.060" end="00:27:31.320" style="s2">market differences between men and women</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.430" end="00:27:32.910" style="s2">but the overlap exceeds the differences</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.320" end="00:27:34.260" style="s2">so for example women are higher in</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.910" end="00:27:36.090" style="s2">agreeableness and you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.260" end="00:27:37.710" style="s2">that&#39;s socio-culturally constructive but</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.090" end="00:27:40.320" style="s2">it turns out that it isn&#39;t because if</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.710" end="00:27:41.550" style="s2">you look across cultures and you you</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.320" end="00:27:45.150" style="s2">look at the cultures that have moved</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.550" end="00:27:46.970" style="s2">most forward with with gender equality</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.970" end="00:27:51.000" style="s2">levels and that would be the</p>

<p begin="00:28:02.280" end="00:28:07.080" style="s2">with if you add the personality</p>

<p begin="00:28:57.830" end="00:29:03.080" style="s2">premise for us to accept to have a law</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.830" end="00:29:07.070" style="s2">like that a law that extends protection</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.080" end="00:29:09.110" style="s2">to these groups is that these identities</p>

<p begin="00:29:20.350" end="00:29:26.420" style="s2">would your stance on the law change well</p>

<p begin="00:29:51.470" end="00:29:56.420" style="s2">with it it&#39;s a perfectly valid argument</p>

<p begin="00:33:56.070" end="00:34:00.389" style="s2">it&#39;s male domination of everything and</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.409" end="00:34:01.559" style="s2">nothing but oppression it&#39;s like really</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.389" end="00:34:03.419" style="s2">that&#39;s how we&#39;re going to define our</p>

<p begin="00:34:09.419" end="00:34:13.260" style="s2">free but you know forget that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.069" end="00:34:15.839" style="s2">never going to happen it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.260" end="00:34:18.389" style="s2">this is an oppressive place compared to</p>

<p begin="00:34:50.549" end="00:34:53.399" style="s2">changes that are desirable to be made</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.049" end="00:34:54.690" style="s2">and how would you want to see them</p>

<p begin="00:35:00.690" end="00:35:04.740" style="s2">in the 60s as far as I can tell that</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.310" end="00:35:06.500" style="s2">we&#39;ve got this misbegotten idea that the</p>

<p begin="00:35:15.510" end="00:35:20.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s all appalling I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.119" end="00:35:22.470" style="s2">appalling and I think it&#39;s absolutely</p>

<p begin="00:35:38.190" end="00:35:42.240" style="s2">family for the for the brief few years</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.440" end="00:35:44.160" style="s2">of your existence and the idea that you</p>

<p begin="00:35:53.460" end="00:35:59.730" style="s2">mean it okay so that&#39;s a bad let&#39;s call</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.030" end="00:36:03.060" style="s2">that a bad idea sure shall we and then</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.730" end="00:36:04.740" style="s2">we and then the idea that what you</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.060" end="00:36:06.359" style="s2">should do to change the world is to find</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.740" end="00:36:08.310" style="s2">people who you disagree with in shape</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.359" end="00:36:12.450" style="s2">paper on sticks at them and call them</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.310" end="00:36:14.460" style="s2">names and also and it says and that you</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.450" end="00:36:16.589" style="s2">do that before you grow forbearance oh</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.460" end="00:36:17.819" style="s2">I&#39;ll tell you how serious the activists</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.589" end="00:36:19.470" style="s2">are this is something that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.819" end="00:36:22.280" style="s2">unbelievably comical as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.470" end="00:36:24.420" style="s2">concerned so some of you may know that I</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.280" end="00:36:26.369" style="s2">participated in a debate on free speech</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.420" end="00:36:29.550" style="s2">so-called debate at free speech that the</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.369" end="00:36:31.859" style="s2">University of Toronto hosted it turned</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.550" end="00:36:33.990" style="s2">into a forum and and and whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.859" end="00:36:35.520" style="s2">is but it&#39;s certainly not a debate but</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.990" end="00:36:36.770" style="s2">one of the things I did when I was</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.520" end="00:36:40.230" style="s2">talking to the university administration</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.770" end="00:36:42.660" style="s2">was to suggest how they might deal with</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.230" end="00:36:44.460" style="s2">the possibility of protesters and so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.660" end="00:36:47.369" style="s2">said well that&#39;s easy I know how you can</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.460" end="00:36:48.569" style="s2">have absolutely zero protesters um have</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.369" end="00:36:53.640" style="s2">it in the morning they won&#39;t get out of</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.569" end="00:36:55.220" style="s2">bed in the team so we had it at nine</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.640" end="00:36:58.020" style="s2">o&#39;clock in the morning and there was one</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.220" end="00:36:59.700" style="s2">MPP meant Member of Parliament who</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.020" end="00:37:01.650" style="s2">showed up to hand out some pamphlets not</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.700" end="00:37:03.630" style="s2">a single protester oh it&#39;s like if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.650" end="00:37:05.400" style="s2">want a controversial speaker on campus</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.630" end="00:37:07.440" style="s2">just have it at 7:00 in the morning you</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.400" end="00:37:08.549" style="s2">won&#39;t get a protester within 50 yards of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.440" end="00:37:10.410" style="s2">it because they&#39;ll still be</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.549" end="00:37:20.459" style="s2">leaping off last night&#39;s part and</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.410" end="00:37:22.499" style="s2">alcohol-induced hangover so so Latino</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.459" end="00:37:24.059" style="s2">ended question was how do I think people</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.499" end="00:37:25.410" style="s2">should do and I&#39;ll tell you something</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.059" end="00:37:27.209" style="s2">that&#39;s been very interesting to me and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.410" end="00:37:29.579" style="s2">can see it reflected here the first</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.209" end="00:37:31.769" style="s2">thing I&#39;ve noticed is that when I</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.579" end="00:37:32.999" style="s2">started putting my videos on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.769" end="00:37:34.859" style="s2">which was about three years ago I</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.999" end="00:37:37.170" style="s2">noticed that about 85% of the people</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.859" end="00:37:38.279" style="s2">that were watching them were men and I</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.170" end="00:37:40.349" style="s2">thought that&#39;s pretty weird because</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.279" end="00:37:42.119" style="s2">about 80% of my students are women you</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.349" end="00:37:43.650" style="s2">know because men are bailing out of</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.119" end="00:37:44.849" style="s2">universities like mad and there won&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.650" end="00:37:46.650" style="s2">one in the social sciences and</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.849" end="00:37:48.329" style="s2">humanities left in ten years but you</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.650" end="00:37:49.650" style="s2">know nobody seems particularly worried</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.329" end="00:37:51.299" style="s2">about that you can go look that up</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.650" end="00:37:53.219" style="s2">online if you want and look at the</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.299" end="00:37:54.749" style="s2">enrollment curves and just project them</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.219" end="00:37:56.130" style="s2">ten years old into the future and I had</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.749" end="00:37:56.549" style="s2">been following that for about twenty</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.130" end="00:37:58.380" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.549" end="00:38:00.569" style="s2">but one of the things but online it was</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.380" end="00:38:02.609" style="s2">so is 85% men I thought wow that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.569" end="00:38:05.039" style="s2">really weird and strange and then I made</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.609" end="00:38:08.519" style="s2">these political videos and then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.039" end="00:38:10.319" style="s2">popped up to 91% men and then I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.519" end="00:38:11.969" style="s2">noticed in the audience&#39;s that I&#39;ve gone</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.319" end="00:38:13.890" style="s2">to talk to that it&#39;s almost all men now</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.969" end="00:38:16.109" style="s2">just look around here and it&#39;s like what</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.890" end="00:38:17.640" style="s2">it&#39;s got to be 90% guys in this audience</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.109" end="00:38:20.069" style="s2">and I thought what the hell is going on</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.640" end="00:38:21.719" style="s2">it&#39;s weird and I noticed that at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.069" end="00:38:23.130" style="s2">first Free Speech debate at the</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.719" end="00:38:24.329" style="s2">University of Toronto I made a point of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.130" end="00:38:26.039" style="s2">it I walked into the room and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.329" end="00:38:27.749" style="s2">wow these are all men so I had the men</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.039" end="00:38:29.880" style="s2">stand up and the women stand up and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.749" end="00:38:31.199" style="s2">used that as an example of the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:38:29.880" end="00:38:32.749" style="s2">maybe men and women have different</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.199" end="00:38:34.979" style="s2">interests it was you know just an ad-hoc</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.749" end="00:38:37.319" style="s2">demonstration but it&#39;s really been borne</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.979" end="00:38:39.239" style="s2">out by the demographic analysis of my</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.319" end="00:38:40.979" style="s2">viewers and I have you know several both</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.239" end="00:38:42.269" style="s2">not eight million views or something</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.979" end="00:38:44.579" style="s2">like that now so it&#39;s a pretty big</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.269" end="00:38:47.400" style="s2">population I&#39;ve been talking nonstop</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.579" end="00:38:49.019" style="s2">about personal responsibility and about</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.400" end="00:38:50.160" style="s2">the fact that if you want to change the</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.019" end="00:38:51.599" style="s2">world you should bloody well get your</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.160" end="00:38:53.219" style="s2">act together and quit whining and</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.599" end="00:38:54.719" style="s2">sniveling about how horrible everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.219" end="00:38:57.239" style="s2">is and about how people are we&#39;d more</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.719" end="00:38:58.829" style="s2">rights more privileges and for some</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.239" end="00:39:00.900" style="s2">reason that seems to be a message that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.829" end="00:39:02.910" style="s2">really resonating among young men and I</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.900" end="00:39:04.499" style="s2">think the reason for that first of all I</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.910" end="00:39:06.089" style="s2">think young women have enough to do and</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.499" end="00:39:07.769" style="s2">so that&#39;s perhaps part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.089" end="00:39:09.420" style="s2">the message isn&#39;t is necessary for them</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.769" end="00:39:10.469" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to juggle career they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.420" end="00:39:11.910" style="s2">trying to figure out how to have a</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.469" end="00:39:13.410" style="s2">family and they don&#39;t really have any</p>

<p begin="00:39:13.410" end="00:39:17.309" style="s2">useful and proper so they&#39;re off doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.299" end="00:39:19.079" style="s2">that and and whatever else they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.309" end="00:39:20.459" style="s2">but young men seem to have more of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.079" end="00:39:22.270" style="s2">choice about that and many of them are</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.459" end="00:39:23.680" style="s2">essentially bailing out</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.270" end="00:39:25.840" style="s2">and it&#39;s partly because I think they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.680" end="00:39:28.090" style="s2">been well punished for their virtues and</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.840" end="00:39:29.920" style="s2">so I talked to young guys in particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.090" end="00:39:31.540" style="s2">about you know adopting some</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.920" end="00:39:33.010" style="s2">responsibilities and trying to</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.540" end="00:39:35.230" style="s2">straighten out their lives and to bear</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.010" end="00:39:37.180" style="s2">the load of being properly and to</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.230" end="00:39:39.010" style="s2">forthrightly move through existence and</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.180" end="00:39:40.480" style="s2">to become a credit to themselves in</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.010" end="00:39:42.700" style="s2">their community and that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.480" end="00:39:44.230" style="s2">should do instead of waving cards at</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.700" end="00:39:45.940" style="s2">someone telling them to behave more</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.230" end="00:39:48.280" style="s2">property because you&#39;re morally superior</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.940" end="00:39:50.380" style="s2">to them so and for some reason that</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.280" end="00:39:51.430" style="s2">message which is it&#39;s a really it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.380" end="00:39:54.520" style="s2">the sort of message that you would</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.430" end="00:39:55.900" style="s2">expect to sell right the exactly the</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.520" end="00:39:58.600" style="s2">opposite of something that you would</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.900" end="00:39:59.980" style="s2">consider saleable but my experiences</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.600" end="00:40:02.200" style="s2">being that the young men in particular</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.980" end="00:40:03.850" style="s2">are so bloody desperate for that message</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.200" end="00:40:05.950" style="s2">that they can hardly stand themselves</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.850" end="00:40:08.560" style="s2">and and it&#39;s no wonder because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.950" end="00:40:11.020" style="s2">call - it&#39;s a call to proper being it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.560" end="00:40:12.760" style="s2">a call to heroic being and it&#39;s a call</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.020" end="00:40:14.230" style="s2">for people to adopt their individual</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.760" end="00:40:15.790" style="s2">responsibilities and to straighten</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.230" end="00:40:17.619" style="s2">themselves out and to find out what they</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.790" end="00:40:19.630" style="s2">could be like if they took on the</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.619" end="00:40:22.210" style="s2">burdens of existence like like</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.630" end="00:40:24.730" style="s2">respectable well-educated articulate</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.210" end="00:40:27.609" style="s2">powerful people and that&#39;s just to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.730" end="00:40:29.650" style="s2">benefit of everyone yeah and so well so</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.609" end="00:40:31.780" style="s2">that&#39;s where the responsibility lies and</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.650" end="00:40:34.660" style="s2">I&#39;m not interested in look I&#39;ve thought</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.780" end="00:40:36.790" style="s2">for many many years decades really about</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.660" end="00:40:38.140" style="s2">having a political career I mean I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.790" end="00:40:39.010" style="s2">interested in a political career when I</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.140" end="00:40:41.470" style="s2">was 13</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.010" end="00:40:43.660" style="s2">and so every five years or so I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.470" end="00:40:45.640" style="s2">probably revisited that but every time I</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.660" end="00:40:48.250" style="s2">revisited I came to the same conclusion</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.640" end="00:40:50.410" style="s2">which was that the the work that I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.250" end="00:40:52.720" style="s2">doing that was focused on a philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.410" end="00:40:54.580" style="s2">of individual responsibility and trying</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.720" end="00:40:56.380" style="s2">to identify how that philosophy had</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.580" end="00:40:58.090" style="s2">emerged in the West over thousands of</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.380" end="00:41:00.250" style="s2">years was more important than any</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.090" end="00:41:01.960" style="s2">possible political action could be and I</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.250" end="00:41:03.820" style="s2">still don&#39;t regard what I&#39;m doing as</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.960" end="00:41:05.890" style="s2">political in any sense of the word I</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.820" end="00:41:07.720" style="s2">think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.890" end="00:41:12.700" style="s2">most accurately and there&#39;s an element</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.720" end="00:41:14.950" style="s2">of its theological so so so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.700" end="00:41:16.690" style="s2">individual responsibility the meaning of</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.950" end="00:41:18.880" style="s2">life is to be found in the adoption of</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.690" end="00:41:20.080" style="s2">individual responsibility and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.880" end="00:41:22.480" style="s2">what the university should be teaching</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.080" end="00:41:25.570" style="s2">people so dr. Peterson you mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.480" end="00:41:29.410" style="s2">these ideas of responsibility of virtue</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.570" end="00:41:32.290" style="s2">of respect you&#39;ve I think detailed what</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.410" end="00:41:34.330" style="s2">you think students shouldn&#39;t do in these</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.290" end="00:41:35.980" style="s2">examples of like protests and these</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.330" end="00:41:38.350" style="s2">examples of certain types of activist</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.980" end="00:41:40.000" style="s2">tactics what advice would you have for</p>
<p begin="00:41:38.350" end="00:41:41.109" style="s2">students how can students make the</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.000" end="00:41:43.000" style="s2">changes that they want to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.109" end="00:41:45.070" style="s2">particularly do you have any advice for</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.000" end="00:41:48.490" style="s2">students here yeah read great books</p>

<p begin="00:48:31.459" end="00:48:35.420" style="s2">greedy and one of the great pleasures in</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.589" end="00:48:37.940" style="s2">their lives is to find people who have</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.420" end="00:48:39.979" style="s2">the capacity to also be hyper competent</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.940" end="00:48:41.959" style="s2">and to open doors for them as rapidly as</p>

<p begin="00:50:19.759" end="00:50:24.199" style="s2">being say Harvard students because look</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.069" end="00:50:25.729" style="s2">where it&#39;s got you already you know why</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.199" end="00:50:29.749" style="s2">you&#39;re already sitting on top of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.729" end="00:50:30.740" style="s2">world so may deserve it make use of it</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.749" end="00:50:32.540" style="s2">right go</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.740" end="00:50:33.800" style="s2">out there and fix things up that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.540" end="00:50:35.720" style="s2">you need to do there&#39;s lots of things</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.800" end="00:50:37.430" style="s2">that need to be fixed up and what you</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.720" end="00:50:39.170" style="s2">want to do is burden yourself with so</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.430" end="00:50:41.540" style="s2">much responsibility that you can barely</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.170" end="00:50:43.250" style="s2">stand and then you&#39;ll get stronger</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.540" end="00:50:45.350" style="s2">trying to lift it up and you&#39;ll be won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.250" end="00:50:46.910" style="s2">be asking what should I be doing with my</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.350" end="00:50:48.890" style="s2">life or what&#39;s the meaning of life or</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.910" end="00:50:51.260" style="s2">any of that it will be self-evident it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.890" end="00:50:53.300" style="s2">self-evident at minimum you could say</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.260" end="00:50:53.960" style="s2">there&#39;s more suffering in the world than</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.300" end="00:50:55.190" style="s2">there should be</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.960" end="00:50:57.170" style="s2">and I can probably do something about</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.190" end="00:50:59.660" style="s2">that and you can do something about that</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.170" end="00:51:00.710" style="s2">so go do something about it and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.660" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">they&#39;ll be less suffering in the world</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.710" end="00:51:03.800" style="s2">and then when you&#39;re 80 you can look</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:06.080" style="s2">back on your life and say well you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.800" end="00:51:07.340" style="s2">there&#39;s less suffering in the world than</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.080" end="00:51:10.100" style="s2">there and there would have been had I</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.340" end="00:51:13.220" style="s2">not existed and and you don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.100" end="00:51:15.230" style="s2">even have a sense of ultimate destiny or</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.220" end="00:51:17.450" style="s2">even any sort of theistic belief in to</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.230" end="00:51:20.450" style="s2">regard that as a positive good like I</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.450" end="00:51:22.220" style="s2">think it goes beyond the mere pragmatic</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.450" end="00:51:24.320" style="s2">utility of addressing the world bill</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.220" end="00:51:26.150" style="s2">because I think we do live in a you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.320" end="00:51:28.130" style="s2">in a world that has a transcendent</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.150" end="00:51:30.110" style="s2">reality as well as the reality that we</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.130" end="00:51:32.720" style="s2">can be TechEd but even independently of</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.110" end="00:51:34.100" style="s2">that it doesn&#39;t matter like I mean this</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.720" end="00:51:36.080" style="s2">is part of the reason I like people like</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.100" end="00:51:38.570" style="s2">Bill Gates is a great example man that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.080" end="00:51:40.670" style="s2">guy is he&#39;s after five major diseases at</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.570" end="00:51:44.050" style="s2">the same time right he&#39;s trying to wipe</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.670" end="00:51:46.760" style="s2">out polio he&#39;s trying to wipe out um</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.050" end="00:51:48.950" style="s2">malaria yeah exactly he&#39;s trying to wipe</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.760" end="00:51:51.170" style="s2">out malaria it&#39;s like well what should</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.950" end="00:51:52.760" style="s2">you do with your life well you know take</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.170" end="00:51:54.170" style="s2">a look at Bill Gates and see if you</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.760" end="00:51:57.920" style="s2">could do something like that that would</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.170" end="00:51:59.450" style="s2">be good so so dr. Peterson you talked</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.920" end="00:52:02.570" style="s2">about this idea of ending unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.450" end="00:52:05.180" style="s2">suffering and this idea of committing</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.570" end="00:52:06.980" style="s2">one&#39;s life to that at a minimum I mean</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.180" end="00:52:09.460" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of an odd yeah thing that</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.980" end="00:52:11.960" style="s2">you could do a lot of students I think</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.460" end="00:52:14.480" style="s2">accept that premise and view what</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.960" end="00:52:16.700" style="s2">they&#39;re doing as trying to eliminate or</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.480" end="00:52:18.619" style="s2">reduce unnecessary suffering and they</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.700" end="00:52:21.290" style="s2">see activism or other forms of direct</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.619" end="00:52:23.420" style="s2">service as fulfilling that goal do you</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.290" end="00:52:25.940" style="s2">simply disagree with like the content of</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.420" end="00:52:28.460" style="s2">what they think the tactic that they are</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.940" end="00:52:30.080" style="s2">using to end unnecessary suffering or do</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.460" end="00:52:32.540" style="s2">you think that their motives or their</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.080" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">intentions are not even the same as</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.540" end="00:52:34.720" style="s2">yours</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.490" end="00:52:43.089" style="s2">it&#39;s too public you know there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.470" end="00:52:45.460" style="s2">old there&#39;s this old saying from them</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.089" end="00:52:48.460" style="s2">from the New Testament about not praying</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.460" end="00:52:49.930" style="s2">in public hmm right and the idea is that</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.460" end="00:52:51.430" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to commune for the</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.930" end="00:52:52.900" style="s2">higher good you should do it private</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.430" end="00:52:55.180" style="s2">because otherwise you&#39;re warping your</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.900" end="00:52:56.920" style="s2">ethic in some sense by demonstrating how</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.180" end="00:52:59.079" style="s2">virtuous you virtuous you are to the</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.920" end="00:53:00.640" style="s2">world it&#39;s like you know I you go out</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.079" end="00:53:02.440" style="s2">there with a stick and a sign on it that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.640" end="00:53:06.069" style="s2">says I&#39;m against poverty it&#39;s like yeah</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.440" end="00:53:09.910" style="s2">no kidding man really like who is for</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.069" end="00:53:11.799" style="s2">poverty no one called poverty so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.910" end="00:53:13.809" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s an abdication of</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.799" end="00:53:15.520" style="s2">responsibility with the mask of social</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.809" end="00:53:17.049" style="s2">virtue you want to solve difficult</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.520" end="00:53:18.250" style="s2">problems you figure out how to get along</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.049" end="00:53:19.660" style="s2">with your brother the one you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.250" end="00:53:21.490" style="s2">fighting with for five years or see if</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.660" end="00:53:23.319" style="s2">you can staple your family back together</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.490" end="00:53:24.880" style="s2">see if you can stop fighting with your</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.319" end="00:53:26.950" style="s2">girlfriend and have a relationship that</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.880" end="00:53:28.420" style="s2">lasts for more than two weeks you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.950" end="00:53:29.950" style="s2">it&#39;s like there are things that you</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.420" end="00:53:31.930" style="s2">should be doing in the confines of your</p>
<p begin="00:53:29.950" end="00:53:34.390" style="s2">old life that are private and humble</p>
<p begin="00:53:31.930" end="00:53:35.829" style="s2">that would that would constitute genuine</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.390" end="00:53:37.180" style="s2">accomplishments and those are the things</p>
<p begin="00:53:35.829" end="00:53:38.799" style="s2">that you should attend to and no one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.180" end="00:53:40.839" style="s2">going to come along and say hey you know</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.799" end="00:53:43.599" style="s2">good job your your change in the world</p>
<p begin="00:53:40.839" end="00:53:45.970" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s private but it&#39;s real</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.599" end="00:53:48.160" style="s2">and then people don&#39;t do that and so no</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.970" end="00:53:50.799" style="s2">I don&#39;t I don&#39;t trust the activists I</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.160" end="00:53:53.770" style="s2">don&#39;t trust the activists ethos at all I</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.799" end="00:53:59.279" style="s2">think it I think everything about it is</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.770" end="00:54:04.720" style="s2">is superficial and and trendy and and</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.279" end="00:54:07.089" style="s2">too easy and and it externalizes the</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.720" end="00:54:09.369" style="s2">blame the evil is always elsewhere which</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.089" end="00:54:11.319" style="s2">is a dreadful mistake to make because</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.369" end="00:54:13.059" style="s2">the evil isn&#39;t elsewhere that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.319" end="00:54:15.520" style="s2">the thing that you understand when</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.059" end="00:54:18.369" style="s2">you&#39;re wise is the evil is not elsewhere</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.520" end="00:54:20.559" style="s2">it&#39;s you because you&#39;re not everything</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.369" end="00:54:22.299" style="s2">you could be and so you know you should</p>
<p begin="00:54:20.559" end="00:54:23.740" style="s2">work on that before going and telling</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.299" end="00:54:26.650" style="s2">someone else that maybe they&#39;re not who</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.740" end="00:54:28.990" style="s2">they should be so I think it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.650" end="00:54:31.720" style="s2">I so I don&#39;t buy it it&#39;s too easy it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.990" end="00:54:33.760" style="s2">far too easy and it&#39;s too public and</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.720" end="00:54:35.289" style="s2">it&#39;s too self congratulatory and then</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.760" end="00:54:36.970" style="s2">there&#39;s the murderous like Marxist</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.289" end="00:54:40.660" style="s2">elements which you know I&#39;m always often</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.970" end="00:54:43.119" style="s2">inclined to mention so certainly I think</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.660" end="00:54:46.020" style="s2">you&#39;ve identified certain causes where</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.119" end="00:54:48.520" style="s2">the public element or the</p>

<p begin="00:54:48.520" end="00:54:51.910" style="s2">could be harmful but do you think there</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.559" end="00:54:53.799" style="s2">are cases for instance</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.910" end="00:54:56.049" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking of policy influencing</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.799" end="00:54:58.599" style="s2">policy being a policymaker it seems like</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.049" end="00:55:02.049" style="s2">something like that public policy could</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.599" end="00:55:04.329" style="s2">be used to eliminate some unnecessary</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.049" end="00:55:06.250" style="s2">suffering but would involve a more</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.329" end="00:55:08.980" style="s2">public domain something where you are</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.250" end="00:55:10.839" style="s2">trying to attract followers trying to</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.839" end="00:55:16.059" style="s2">look if you&#39;ve established yourself in</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.359" end="00:55:19.030" style="s2">the world as a credible human being and</p>
<p begin="00:55:16.059" end="00:55:21.309" style="s2">people are asking you to enter public</p>

<p begin="00:59:21.700" end="00:59:28.810" style="s2">helpful but the way that you develop a</p>

<p begin="00:59:28.810" end="00:59:31.780" style="s2">better way of thinking about it or</p>

<p begin="00:59:31.780" end="00:59:37.089" style="s2">which is much better than thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.190" end="00:59:39.580" style="s2">it as an affirmation is to they are up</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.089" end="00:59:41.230" style="s2">under the damn load and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:59:39.580" end="00:59:43.119" style="s2">recognize yourself as something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.230" end="00:59:45.070" style="s2">flawed but that can tolerate the flaw</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.119" end="00:59:46.780" style="s2">and that can work towards alleviating it</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.070" end="00:59:49.060" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s the pathway to the</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.780" end="00:59:52.660" style="s2">transcendence of tragedy which is a much</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.060" end="00:59:59.170" style="s2">like compared just affirmation it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.660" end="01:00:01.770" style="s2">it&#39;s you&#39;re giving us starving you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="01:00:05.280" end="01:00:11.560" style="s2">people have to commit to being in order</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.200" end="01:00:14.410" style="s2">to withstand their own vulnerability and</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.560" end="01:00:17.530" style="s2">fragility and an essentially flawed</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.410" end="01:00:19.480" style="s2">nature the way that you tolerate that is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.530" end="01:00:21.970" style="s2">to the way you stand up underneath that</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.480" end="01:00:24.430" style="s2">is to adopt responsibility for it and</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.970" end="01:00:26.380" style="s2">then your pathway is clear then you can</p>

<p begin="01:04:11.820" end="01:04:15.510" style="s2">universities in some sense are supposed</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.260" end="01:04:17.609" style="s2">to remind you of this but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.510" end="01:04:19.260" style="s2">abdicated their responsibility as far as</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.609" end="01:04:20.880" style="s2">I&#39;m concerned and in many cases are</p>

<p begin="01:04:30.660" end="01:04:39.030" style="s2">so it&#39;s so empty and dead it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.810" end="01:04:40.829" style="s2">it&#39;s you know I read this in Elias</p>

<p begin="01:04:40.829" end="01:04:44.700" style="s2">power it was one of the things that</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.300" end="01:04:47.369" style="s2">really stuck in my imagination he did an</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.700" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">etymological analysis of the word slogan</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.369" end="01:04:54.770" style="s2">and he said that it was derived from the</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:59.190" style="s2">well two words slew AG s Lu agh and</p>
<p begin="01:04:54.770" end="01:05:01.890" style="s2">garam G H AI R M and it meant battle cry</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.190" end="01:05:03.780" style="s2">of the dead and that really struck me</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.890" end="01:05:05.760" style="s2">because I I&#39;ve always had this sense</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.780" end="01:05:07.589" style="s2">that people mouthing ideologies are the</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:10.290" style="s2">puppets of corpses it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.589" end="01:05:12.630" style="s2">that puppets of corpses of malevolent</p>
<p begin="01:05:10.290" end="01:05:14.760" style="s2">philosophers you know when they speak in</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.630" end="01:05:16.319" style="s2">dead tones and they&#39;re not interesting</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.760" end="01:05:17.849" style="s2">like if you&#39;re listening to an ideologue</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.319" end="01:05:19.319" style="s2">errata law and you can hardly</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.849" end="01:05:21.599" style="s2">concentrate and what they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.319" end="01:05:24.390" style="s2">because it&#39;s bad it&#39;s death itself</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.599" end="01:05:27.060" style="s2">speaking and and it compelled zero</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.390" end="01:05:28.650" style="s2">interest and so even discussing this</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.060" end="01:05:30.869" style="s2">sort of thing I find difficult to even</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.650" end="01:05:33.480" style="s2">formulate the the words because I&#39;m so</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.869" end="01:05:36.390" style="s2">tired of that kind of that realm of that</p>
<p begin="01:05:33.480" end="01:05:38.520" style="s2">realm of discourse it&#39;s like there&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.390" end="01:05:40.829" style="s2">many tremendous things that are</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.520" end="01:05:43.790" style="s2">remaining in the world for people to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.829" end="01:05:48.270" style="s2">but they start being dead puppets of</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.790" end="01:05:50.670" style="s2">sick ideas and and and it&#39;s appalling to</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.270" end="01:05:52.819" style="s2">me that it even had that opposition to</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.670" end="01:05:55.440" style="s2">that even has to be justified our</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.819" end="01:05:57.930" style="s2">civilization is opposition to that and</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.440" end="01:05:59.700" style="s2">so I mean we can let it go if we want</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.930" end="01:06:00.720" style="s2">but the alternatives are far gloomier</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.700" end="01:06:03.480" style="s2">than what we have now</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.720" end="01:06:05.700" style="s2">I can tell you that so we can let it all</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.480" end="01:06:07.740" style="s2">go and we&#39;re being taught to let it all</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.700" end="01:06:09.810" style="s2">go it&#39;s corrupt it&#39;s rotten late to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.740" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">roots it needs to be retooled right to</p>
<p begin="01:06:09.810" end="01:06:13.920" style="s2">the very concepts that we use it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:15.780" style="s2">yeah what&#39;s going to replace it what</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.920" end="01:06:18.060" style="s2">have we got this better you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.780" end="01:06:19.500" style="s2">nothing that&#39;s better what we have is</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.060" end="01:06:21.570" style="s2">something that could be far more than it</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.500" end="01:06:23.190" style="s2">is if people would just take it to the</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.570" end="01:06:25.320" style="s2">level that it could be taken to and</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.190" end="01:06:27.210" style="s2">anyone wants to hear that and then it</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.320" end="01:06:30.030" style="s2">well and that&#39;s has been a very long</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.210" end="01:06:31.530" style="s2">answer this is why 91 percent of the</p>

<p begin="01:06:31.530" end="01:06:35.670" style="s2">men as far as I can tell so dr. Pearson</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.500" end="01:06:37.830" style="s2">I think the time for one or two more</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.670" end="01:06:40.560" style="s2">questions and we might open it up to Q&amp;A</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.830" end="01:06:41.760" style="s2">one more question according to Conor and</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.560" end="01:06:42.960" style="s2">I want to end with it because you were</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.760" end="01:06:44.880" style="s2">talking about your experience as a</p>

<p begin="01:06:48.470" end="01:06:54.030" style="s2">general topics of like mental health</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:57.420" style="s2">wellness at college in a lot of ways I</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.030" end="01:06:58.980" style="s2">think you have claimed that by finding</p>

<p begin="01:07:03.720" end="01:07:06.660" style="s2">more self affirmation I&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.580" end="01:07:07.980" style="s2">though if you think there are cases</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.660" end="01:07:10.109" style="s2">where there are people with a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.980" end="01:07:12.300" style="s2">potential especially at Harvard who may</p>

<p begin="01:07:30.690" end="01:07:35.640" style="s2">one of the things that really seems to</p>

<p begin="01:07:52.770" end="01:07:56.970" style="s2">so that I think it&#39;s raising them up and</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.480" end="01:07:59.280" style="s2">it also works spectacularly well for non</p>

<p begin="01:07:59.280" end="01:08:04.109" style="s2">also extraordinarily positive because</p>

<p begin="01:08:09.780" end="01:08:13.540" style="s2">it is to aim at something that&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.609" end="01:08:15.820" style="s2">aiming at yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.540" end="01:08:17.589" style="s2">and how do you determine what&#39;s worth</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.820" end="01:08:19.930" style="s2">aiming at you think well okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.589" end="01:08:22.270" style="s2">here I have my miserable wretched life</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.930" end="01:08:24.130" style="s2">under what conditions would it justify</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.270" end="01:08:25.930" style="s2">itself as far as I&#39;m concerned</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.130" end="01:08:28.060" style="s2">personally like under what conditions</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.930" end="01:08:29.859" style="s2">would my life justify itself and so you</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.060" end="01:08:31.420" style="s2">think well what sort of future would I</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.859" end="01:08:33.130" style="s2">have to have so that I could say this is</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.420" end="01:08:35.710" style="s2">worth it and then that&#39;s what you aim</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.130" end="01:08:37.600" style="s2">for and that and technically that works</p>
<p begin="01:08:35.710" end="01:08:39.700" style="s2">in part because we know that most of the</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.600" end="01:08:41.109" style="s2">systems that mediate positive emotion in</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.700" end="01:08:42.640" style="s2">human beings and so those would be the</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.109" end="01:08:44.799" style="s2">dopaminergic systems that have their</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.640" end="01:08:47.589" style="s2">roots and I polemic exploratory centres</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.799" end="01:08:49.750" style="s2">are activated in relationship to the</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.589" end="01:08:51.700" style="s2">pursuit of a goal not as a consequence</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.750" end="01:08:52.990" style="s2">of attaining something that&#39;s a consumer</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.700" end="01:08:55.540" style="s2">Tory reward system but human beings</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.990" end="01:08:57.880" style="s2">mostly run on incentive reward and so it</p>
<p begin="01:08:55.540" end="01:09:00.640" style="s2">appears that the higher the goal the</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.880" end="01:09:02.950" style="s2">more kick you get from from noting your</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.640" end="01:09:04.390" style="s2">progress towards that goal now you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.950" end="01:09:06.130" style="s2">to be careful because you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.390" end="01:09:08.049" style="s2">pick a goal that&#39;s so impossible that</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.130" end="01:09:10.420" style="s2">all you ever do is fail in relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.049" end="01:09:12.130" style="s2">to it that&#39;s an issue of self management</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.420" end="01:09:14.589" style="s2">right you want to you want to pick a</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.130" end="01:09:17.950" style="s2">goal that moves you to the next plateau</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.589" end="01:09:20.170" style="s2">that you have a reasonable probable but</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.950" end="01:09:22.120" style="s2">not certain probability of attaining so</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.170" end="01:09:24.520" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s part of it is to is to</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.120" end="01:09:26.710" style="s2">formulate a plan to decide who who it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.520" end="01:09:27.910" style="s2">what it is that you want to be who it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.710" end="01:09:29.799" style="s2">that you want to be from a character</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.910" end="01:09:32.109" style="s2">logical perspective and if you&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="01:09:29.799" end="01:09:34.480" style="s2">other problems well you know some of</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.109" end="01:09:37.630" style="s2">that is when you&#39;re talking more on the</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.480" end="01:09:39.880" style="s2">clinical end of things is that again the</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.630" end="01:09:41.380" style="s2">Devils in the details but it&#39;s useful to</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.880" end="01:09:42.970" style="s2">talk to people it&#39;s useful to write</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.380" end="01:09:44.770" style="s2">about what it is that you&#39;re up to it</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.970" end="01:09:46.930" style="s2">but it&#39;s it&#39;s most worthwhile to</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.770" end="01:09:49.630" style="s2">organize your life I would say and to</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.930" end="01:09:51.069" style="s2">and to pick a goal and to aim at it</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.630" end="01:09:52.390" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a very nice way of</p>

<p begin="01:11:01.519" end="01:11:07.280" style="s2">because the fragility of being is a very</p>

<p begin="01:11:30.860" end="01:11:36.139" style="s2">answer is you justify it by how it is</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.530" end="01:11:38.929" style="s2">that by how you exude justify being by</p>

<p begin="01:12:09.340" end="01:12:13.099" style="s2">all right so we have some questions isin</p>

<p begin="01:12:13.099" end="01:12:18.219" style="s2">um and I&#39;m just going to read them in</p>
<p begin="01:12:15.650" end="01:12:22.820" style="s2">order and you&#39;re gonna have to come</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.219" end="01:12:25.460" style="s2">pretty simple so our first question we</p>
<p begin="01:12:22.820" end="01:12:27.530" style="s2">have here reads I am a postdoc in the</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.460" end="01:12:28.960" style="s2">psychology department and I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.530" end="01:12:31.790" style="s2">interested in conducting research</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.960" end="01:12:33.349" style="s2">examining the extent to which highly</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.790" end="01:12:36.949" style="s2">politically correct individuals are</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.349" end="01:12:39.739" style="s2">analytical in parentheses or not I am</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.949" end="01:12:42.860" style="s2">however very concerned that this pursuit</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.739" end="01:12:45.020" style="s2">will potentially flip to the back proved</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.860" end="01:12:47.150" style="s2">to be quite damaging to my reputation</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.020" end="01:12:49.070" style="s2">and that it will likely hinder my</p>
<p begin="01:12:47.150" end="01:12:52.900" style="s2">chances of obtaining a faculty position</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.070" end="01:12:55.280" style="s2">do you have any advice for me yeah I</p>
<p begin="01:12:52.900" end="01:12:58.639" style="s2">talked to faculty members all the time</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.280" end="01:13:00.980" style="s2">and they say the same thing I&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.639" end="01:13:02.630" style="s2">what I think when I get my first job and</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.980" end="01:13:03.949" style="s2">then they get their first job and they</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.630" end="01:13:06.139" style="s2">say well I&#39;ll say what I think when I</p>
<p begin="01:13:03.949" end="01:13:08.270" style="s2">when I when I&#39;m when I when I have</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.139" end="01:13:10.610" style="s2">tenure and then they get tenure and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.270" end="01:13:11.570" style="s2">like 15 years later ten years later and</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.610" end="01:13:13.099" style="s2">they don&#39;t have anything left to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.570" end="01:13:15.380" style="s2">because they haven&#39;t said anything for</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.099" end="01:13:17.239" style="s2">the last 10 years it&#39;s like that&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:13:15.380" end="01:13:19.580" style="s2">way to live man that&#39;s no way to live</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.239" end="01:13:21.050" style="s2">it&#39;s do your damn research pick the</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.580" end="01:13:23.540" style="s2">hardest topic you can possibly imagine</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.050" end="01:13:25.639" style="s2">and pursue it and state what you believe</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.540" end="01:13:27.050" style="s2">to be the truth and let see there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.639" end="01:13:28.639" style="s2">rule there&#39;s a rule this is an</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.050" end="01:13:29.719" style="s2">existential rule and it&#39;s really one</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.639" end="01:13:32.119" style="s2">we&#39;re really worth thinking about</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.719" end="01:13:34.969" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s a pointer to a</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.119" end="01:13:36.909" style="s2">fundamental mode of being so one mode of</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.969" end="01:13:39.290" style="s2">being involves using your speech</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.909" end="01:13:40.940" style="s2">strategically and that&#39;s exactly what</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.290" end="01:13:43.369" style="s2">these questions most this person is</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.940" end="01:13:44.920" style="s2">basically asking should I use my ability</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.369" end="01:13:47.960" style="s2">to communicate strategically and</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.920" end="01:13:52.340" style="s2">strategically is should I aim at getting</p>

<p begin="01:15:21.310" end="01:15:26.980" style="s2">so the way we did it was we collected</p>
<p begin="01:15:23.620" end="01:15:28.900" style="s2">about 400 statements that were deemed by</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.980" end="01:15:30.610" style="s2">people in the press and so forth as</p>

<p begin="01:15:50.440" end="01:15:56.140" style="s2">can pile up the beliefs that are likely</p>
<p begin="01:15:52.930" end="01:15:57.820" style="s2">to occur if one occurs and the essential</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.140" end="01:15:59.770" style="s2">way to do that is to over sample the</p>

<p begin="01:20:18.580" end="01:20:23.350" style="s2">for example where the last very vocal</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.070" end="01:20:25.960" style="s2">protest occurred mostly what I felt</p>
<p begin="01:20:23.350" end="01:20:27.430" style="s2">about the protesters was sorrow you know</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.960" end="01:20:28.420" style="s2">you know I looked out there I saw well</p>
<p begin="01:20:27.430" end="01:20:30.370" style="s2">there&#39;s these they&#39;re young people</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.420" end="01:20:31.870" style="s2">they&#39;re university students they went to</p>
<p begin="01:20:30.370" end="01:20:33.730" style="s2">university at least in principle to</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.870" end="01:20:35.500" style="s2">learn something about themselves and</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.730" end="01:20:37.630" style="s2">about the world and instead they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.500" end="01:20:41.820" style="s2">transformed into these like they were</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.630" end="01:20:41.820" style="s2">chanting they were chanting like</p>
<p begin="01:20:42.420" end="01:20:47.890" style="s2">profanities at me and really that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:20:45.400" end="01:20:49.810" style="s2">best you can do if you come out your</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.890" end="01:20:51.310" style="s2">dopey little group you hide behind the</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.810" end="01:20:52.599" style="s2">hammer and sickle because of one of your</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.310" end="01:20:54.340" style="s2">fashionable professor</p>
<p begin="01:20:52.599" end="01:20:55.869" style="s2">is convinced you that was a good idea</p>
<p begin="01:20:54.340" end="01:20:59.199" style="s2">and the best you can do is organize</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.869" end="01:20:59.530" style="s2">yourself and chant profanities at me you</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.199" end="01:21:04.209" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.530" end="01:21:05.320" style="s2">it&#39;s so sad either Caesar could be doing</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.209" end="01:21:08.679" style="s2">something better than that</p>
<p begin="01:21:05.320" end="01:21:10.570" style="s2">I mean God come on they have a useful</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.679" end="01:21:12.159" style="s2">protest of some sort at least if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:21:10.570" end="01:21:15.579" style="s2">going to come out protest make it a high</p>
<p begin="01:21:12.159" end="01:21:19.059" style="s2">quality protest instead of like cursing</p>
<p begin="01:21:15.579" end="01:21:25.689" style="s2">at me and repetitively it&#39;s so dull and</p>
<p begin="01:21:19.059" end="01:21:28.979" style="s2">unimaginative and pathetic and so no I</p>
<p begin="01:21:25.689" end="01:21:28.979" style="s2">forgot what question was</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.659" end="01:21:38.109" style="s2">eight more okay five minutes in cases</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.099" end="01:21:40.239" style="s2">where people have sworn chastity</p>

<p begin="01:21:42.159" end="01:21:46.510" style="s2">possible to still develop fully and not</p>

<p begin="01:21:50.349" end="01:22:01.149" style="s2">how is it possible Wow I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:21:55.869" end="01:22:03.849" style="s2">expect that one I can tell you sometimes</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.149" end="01:22:06.849" style="s2">people have to make it sacrifice right</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.849" end="01:22:08.829" style="s2">and everyone always has to make</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.849" end="01:22:11.139" style="s2">sacrifices that&#39;s actually something</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.829" end="01:22:14.229" style="s2">that I learned from reading with ology</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.139" end="01:22:16.300" style="s2">because the ancient myths always talk</p>
<p begin="01:22:14.229" end="01:22:18.489" style="s2">about sacrifice and people claim not to</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.300" end="01:22:20.739" style="s2">understand that that means you always</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.489" end="01:22:23.829" style="s2">have to let go of something in order to</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.739" end="01:22:25.510" style="s2">progress into the future in fact that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.829" end="01:22:27.070" style="s2">the most fundamental discovery human</p>
<p begin="01:22:25.510" end="01:22:28.840" style="s2">beings ever made as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.070" end="01:22:30.969" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s exactly the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.840" end="01:22:32.919" style="s2">that&#39;s discovering the future and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.969" end="01:22:34.719" style="s2">discovered the future were the only</p>
<p begin="01:22:32.919" end="01:22:37.119" style="s2">creatures that we know of who really can</p>
<p begin="01:22:34.719" end="01:22:38.649" style="s2">conceive of the future and the future is</p>
<p begin="01:22:37.119" end="01:22:40.269" style="s2">something that&#39;s made better by letting</p>
<p begin="01:22:38.649" end="01:22:42.129" style="s2">go of things in the presence right</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.269" end="01:22:44.679" style="s2">that&#39;s impulse control you can look at</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.129" end="01:22:46.359" style="s2">it that way if you want the person who</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.679" end="01:22:47.559" style="s2">wrote this is obviously wrestling with</p>
<p begin="01:22:46.359" end="01:22:49.599" style="s2">something you know and maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.559" end="01:22:52.780" style="s2">wrestling with a hyper dominant sexual</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.599" end="01:22:55.329" style="s2">impulse that threatens to be master</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.780" end="01:22:56.889" style="s2">instead of servants and so who knows</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.329" end="01:22:58.989" style="s2">what they have to do in order to bring</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.889" end="01:23:03.849" style="s2">themselves under control I would say</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.989" end="01:23:06.610" style="s2">that less radical solutions might first</p>
<p begin="01:23:03.849" end="01:23:08.810" style="s2">be advised but I</p>
<p begin="01:23:06.610" end="01:23:10.219" style="s2">right because you don&#39;t have to you</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.810" end="01:23:12.500" style="s2">don&#39;t want to whip yourself with a</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.219" end="01:23:14.360" style="s2">bigger whip than you need to use right I</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.500" end="01:23:18.260" style="s2">think that&#39;s that&#39;s minimal necessary</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.360" end="01:23:20.750" style="s2">force dr. essentially but so yeah so</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.260" end="01:23:22.699" style="s2">that&#39;s how I would answer that question</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.750" end="01:23:25.850" style="s2">yeah pretty good for when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:22.699" end="01:23:27.770" style="s2">unexpected dr. Peterson you say that the</p>
<p begin="01:23:25.850" end="01:23:29.239" style="s2">meaning of life is to take an individual</p>
<p begin="01:23:27.770" end="01:23:32.239" style="s2">responsibility for the burdens of</p>
<p begin="01:23:29.239" end="01:23:35.150" style="s2">existence if each person can justifiably</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.239" end="01:23:37.160" style="s2">choose his own way of taking on these</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.150" end="01:23:39.620" style="s2">burdens then how can we prevent</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.160" end="01:23:44.000" style="s2">individuals from committing actions that</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.620" end="01:23:48.080" style="s2">are clearly moral in Justices but we</p>
<p begin="01:23:44.000" end="01:23:51.739" style="s2">can&#39;t hmm I mean that happens all the</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.080" end="01:23:53.870" style="s2">time I think the best we there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.739" end="01:23:55.460" style="s2">sorts of mechanisms for regulating it</p>
<p begin="01:23:53.870" end="01:23:58.489" style="s2">right we have all sorts of mechanisms</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.460" end="01:24:01.370" style="s2">for regulating it civil society and</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.489" end="01:24:03.350" style="s2">policing regulated expectations between</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.370" end="01:24:09.199" style="s2">family members and friends regulated</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.350" end="01:24:12.520" style="s2">your conscience regulates it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.199" end="01:24:18.320" style="s2">believe that people do as a general rule</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.520" end="01:24:20.540" style="s2">commit illegalities or or worse because</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.320" end="01:24:23.270" style="s2">they&#39;ve taken on responsibilities like</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.540" end="01:24:25.010" style="s2">that didn&#39;t know it works pathway to</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.270" end="01:24:27.530" style="s2">criminality is not to be found in the</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.010" end="01:24:29.090" style="s2">adoption of responsibility you don&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.530" end="01:24:30.230" style="s2">that about criminals well if he would</p>
<p begin="01:24:29.090" end="01:24:32.330" style="s2">have just taken on a little less</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.230" end="01:24:36.140" style="s2">responsibility then he wouldn&#39;t be in</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.330" end="01:24:37.880" style="s2">jail no that is now it works so what the</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.140" end="01:24:40.130" style="s2">question is more something like well if</p>
<p begin="01:24:37.880" end="01:24:42.320" style="s2">people are allowed to direct themselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:40.130" end="01:24:44.480" style="s2">how do you stop them from picking a path</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.320" end="01:24:46.310" style="s2">that&#39;s improper and I would say that</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.480" end="01:24:48.500" style="s2">that and I do believe that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.310" end="01:24:49.850" style="s2">essential question and I would say part</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.500" end="01:24:52.610" style="s2">of that is that if you&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.850" end="01:24:55.760" style="s2">self-directed let&#39;s say at least to some</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.610" end="01:24:57.620" style="s2">degree then you have to tell the truth</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.760" end="01:24:59.210" style="s2">because otherwise you pathologize</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.620" end="01:25:00.860" style="s2">yourself and you can&#39;t rely on your own</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.210" end="01:25:02.540" style="s2">judgment then and that&#39;s part of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.860" end="01:25:04.550" style="s2">reason why the truth is so necessary is</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.540" end="01:25:06.469" style="s2">that if you&#39;re going to use yourself as</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.550" end="01:25:08.960" style="s2">the mechanism by which you orient</p>
<p begin="01:25:06.469" end="01:25:11.600" style="s2">yourself in the world and you better</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.960" end="01:25:12.949" style="s2">make sure that you&#39;re not transforming</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.600" end="01:25:17.000" style="s2">yourself into something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:12.949" end="01:25:20.370" style="s2">predicated on error and so so it that</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.000" end="01:25:23.010" style="s2">the attempt to speak the truth is a</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.370" end="01:25:24.780" style="s2">form the psychophysiological hygiene</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.010" end="01:25:28.080" style="s2">that&#39;s one way of thinking about it and</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.780" end="01:25:30.780" style="s2">if you&#39;re oriented as well as you can</p>
<p begin="01:25:28.080" end="01:25:32.430" style="s2">towards the articulated truth then you</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.780" end="01:25:34.440" style="s2">can increasingly rely on your own</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.430" end="01:25:38.660" style="s2">judgment and that&#39;s and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:25:34.440" end="01:25:43.530" style="s2">that&#39;s the best if aunts say against</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.660" end="01:25:45.300" style="s2">against the dark side you&#39;ve attached a</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.530" end="01:25:48.000" style="s2">number of useful ideas ooh this is a fun</p>
<p begin="01:25:45.300" end="01:25:49.920" style="s2">one you number of useful ideas for</p>
<p begin="01:25:48.000" end="01:25:52.950" style="s2">instance overcoming personal</p>

<p begin="01:25:52.950" end="01:25:57.840" style="s2">justice conflict how can we attach</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.170" end="01:26:00.150" style="s2">useful ideas to the social justice side</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.840" end="01:26:03.620" style="s2">of this controversy and convert it into</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.150" end="01:26:05.760" style="s2">a growth full movement for all involved</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.620" end="01:26:08.820" style="s2">well I do think that is what&#39;s happening</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.760" end="01:26:10.440" style="s2">to some degree I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:26:08.820" end="01:26:14.820" style="s2">political dialogue that&#39;s emerging is</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.440" end="01:26:19.200" style="s2">precisely that I don&#39;t know how we can</p>

<p begin="01:26:26.850" end="01:26:32.130" style="s2">you know and knowing that I&#39;m prone to</p>
<p begin="01:26:30.000" end="01:26:33.930" style="s2">error and listening to feedback because</p>
<p begin="01:26:32.130" end="01:26:34.260" style="s2">I would like to know where I&#39;m making</p>

<p begin="01:26:43.260" end="01:26:50.970" style="s2">was second-rate and and egotistical and</p>

<p begin="01:26:50.970" end="01:26:57.270" style="s2">I would say I would say to some degree</p>
<p begin="01:26:55.140" end="01:26:59.490" style="s2">maybe that question is specified at the</p>

<p begin="01:27:33.660" end="01:27:36.209" style="s2">ask you</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.139" end="01:27:37.800" style="s2">last question I think it&#39;s an important</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.209" end="01:27:39.119" style="s2">one especially for some of the people</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.800" end="01:27:41.669" style="s2">who don&#39;t think you should be speaking</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.119" end="01:27:42.869" style="s2">here today whether some of them are in</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.669" end="01:27:45.179" style="s2">this room or some of them were outside</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.869" end="01:27:47.280" style="s2">earlier the question reads given</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.179" end="01:27:50.099" style="s2">extremely elevated violence and murder</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.280" end="01:27:52.260" style="s2">rates against trans people why have you</p>
<p begin="01:27:50.099" end="01:27:54.809" style="s2">chosen to threaten a population that is</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.260" end="01:27:55.829" style="s2">already facing job discrimination murder</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.809" end="01:27:59.760" style="s2">etc</p>
<p begin="01:27:55.829" end="01:28:01.469" style="s2">oh I&#39;m not threatening them I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.760" end="01:28:04.050" style="s2">think there&#39;s any evidence the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:28:01.469" end="01:28:06.389" style="s2">a handful of noisy activists consider me</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.050" end="01:28:10.050" style="s2">a threat is no criteria of proof of any</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.389" end="01:28:12.899" style="s2">sort of anything and I mean so so I just</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.050" end="01:28:16.889" style="s2">reject that entire all every single word</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.899" end="01:28:20.130" style="s2">in that question is meaningless as far</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.889" end="01:28:23.070" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned so people think someone</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.130" end="01:28:25.139" style="s2">said just because someone said that what</p>
<p begin="01:28:23.070" end="01:28:27.449" style="s2">I said is a threat to trans people does</p>
<p begin="01:28:25.139" end="01:28:30.030" style="s2">not make it true and I have the</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.449" end="01:28:32.399" style="s2">testimony of a fair number of trans</p>
<p begin="01:28:30.030" end="01:28:36.689" style="s2">people that that&#39;s actually not only not</p>
<p begin="01:28:32.399" end="01:28:38.030" style="s2">true it&#39;s probably false so sorry not</p>
<p begin="01:28:36.689" end="01:28:40.199" style="s2">guilty</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.030" end="01:28:43.169" style="s2">very stating of you to apologize that</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.199" end="01:28:59.340" style="s2">yeah yeah but not so much to say that</p>
<p begin="01:28:43.169" end="01:29:02.900" style="s2">I&#39;m not guilty I suppose after how do</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.340" end="01:29:04.890" style="s2">you take no responsibility for that</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.900" end="01:29:07.770" style="s2">first of all I want I don&#39;t consider</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.890" end="01:29:10.770" style="s2">threats violence so we have to be very</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.770" end="01:29:12.800" style="s2">careful when we use our words so so</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.770" end="01:29:15.600" style="s2">someone saying something and with</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.800" end="01:29:17.910" style="s2">incredibly brief are not the same thing</p>
<p begin="01:29:15.600" end="01:29:19.500" style="s2">and second there&#39;s no possible way I can</p>
<p begin="01:29:17.910" end="01:29:21.480" style="s2">answer that question because I know</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.500" end="01:29:23.160" style="s2">nothing about the threats I know nothing</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.480" end="01:29:25.260" style="s2">about who uttered them I know nothing</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.160" end="01:29:27.720" style="s2">about who reported them it&#39;s so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.260" end="01:29:31.140" style="s2">your question is basically some people</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.720" end="01:29:33.870" style="s2">said some bad things after I talk it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:31.140" end="01:29:35.190" style="s2">like could be but I have no idea what to</p>
<p begin="01:29:33.870" end="01:29:37.290" style="s2">do about that and I don&#39;t take</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.190" end="01:29:40.260" style="s2">responsibility for it it&#39;s not specific</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.290" end="01:29:43.890" style="s2">enough to take responsibility for okay</p>
<p begin="01:29:40.260" end="01:29:46.440" style="s2">sorry we do we have the officers I have</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.890" end="01:29:50.760" style="s2">to go home I appreciate that you have an</p>
<p begin="01:29:46.440" end="01:29:54.960" style="s2">opinion but at some point at some point</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.760" end="01:29:57.810" style="s2">we do need to call today Thank You Akash</p>
<p begin="01:29:54.960" end="01:30:06.099" style="s2">and professor Peterson so much</p>
