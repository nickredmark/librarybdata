<p begin="00:00:59.430" end="00:01:07.439" style="s2">formula feed for a while and because you</p>

<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:29.420" style="s2">date men the same way you don&#39;t date</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.870" end="00:02:32.420" style="s2">women like this is sure you can be</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.420" end="00:02:37.459" style="s2">bisexual and not at like and be asexual</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.420" end="00:02:39.650" style="s2">more or less and that is Who I am like I</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.459" end="00:02:43.910" style="s2">didn&#39;t realize I was clear until my late</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.650" end="00:02:46.310" style="s2">30s I haven&#39;t kissed a woman because of</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.910" end="00:02:49.190" style="s2">my health conditions and my demisexual</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.310" end="00:02:52.010" style="s2">which is on the a sexual spectrum and so</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.190" end="00:02:53.870" style="s2">I&#39;m like but it&#39;s from inside it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.010" end="00:02:57.860" style="s2">something that someone else labels you</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.870" end="00:03:02.390" style="s2">as or society puts on you I had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.860" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">roommate who was both poly and asexual I</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.390" end="00:03:06.890" style="s2">was like that can&#39;t be a big poster</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">opposite sides of a spectrum and now I</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.890" end="00:03:10.370" style="s2">kind of am both of those things I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:11.660" style="s2">oh I don&#39;t know if I want to have just</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.370" end="00:03:14.150" style="s2">one partner if I did was gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.660" end="00:03:15.290" style="s2">partners I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know and yet I</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.150" end="00:03:16.970" style="s2">don&#39;t know if I have the capacity to</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.290" end="00:03:22.220" style="s2">have more than even one let alone more</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.970" end="00:03:23.900" style="s2">than one and so now it&#39;s funny when I</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.220" end="00:03:25.160" style="s2">hear other people who aren&#39;t parents who</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.900" end="00:03:26.720" style="s2">are judgmental about parent so much</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.160" end="00:03:28.010" style="s2">don&#39;t say it it&#39;s gonna be if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.720" end="00:03:30.410" style="s2">gonna be a parent you&#39;re gonna get the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.010" end="00:03:31.940" style="s2">thing don&#39;t don&#39;t say it but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.410" end="00:03:34.609" style="s2">know if everyone has this happen in</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.940" end="00:03:36.530" style="s2">their lives constantly it happens for me</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.609" end="00:03:38.209" style="s2">and now that enough of them have</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.530" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">happened I&#39;m grateful for it because now</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.209" end="00:03:43.340" style="s2">in the moment when I&#39;m judgmental about</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.920" end="00:03:45.590" style="s2">someone like a note stop talking</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.340" end="00:03:48.290" style="s2">judgmental one you don&#39;t know you not in</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.590" end="00:03:49.730" style="s2">their shoes and I can also see it as</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.290" end="00:03:52.600" style="s2">what it was which is like their thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.730" end="00:03:56.810" style="s2">would trigger this subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.600" end="00:03:57.470" style="s2">knowledge of what I am but not accepting</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.810" end="00:04:01.250" style="s2">in myself</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.470" end="00:04:05.209" style="s2">and so I am both very grateful for my</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.250" end="00:04:07.400" style="s2">judgmental self and it has greatly</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.209" end="00:04:09.620" style="s2">evaporated there&#39;s very few things I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.400" end="00:04:14.569" style="s2">judgmental for people on the one</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.620" end="00:04:16.250" style="s2">probably being like I don&#39;t know like</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.569" end="00:04:18.690" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.250" end="00:04:20.639" style="s2">what is currently propped up in society</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.690" end="00:04:22.019" style="s2">so capitalistic rich you think you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.639" end="00:04:24.510" style="s2">entitled to everything just because you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.019" end="00:04:27.570" style="s2">have money I am still judgmental about</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.510" end="00:04:29.370" style="s2">that and dear goodness if I&#39;m what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.570" end="00:04:31.440" style="s2">looking forward to having to experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.370" end="00:04:34.410" style="s2">that on the other side oh look now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.440" end="00:04:37.320" style="s2">rich let&#39;s see let&#39;s see if I&#39;m still</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.410" end="00:04:39.030" style="s2">that person I don&#39;t think I will be</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:39.900" style="s2">because that judgment comes from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.030" end="00:04:44.370" style="s2">different place</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.900" end="00:04:47.390" style="s2">that&#39;s unfairness on a grand scale and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.370" end="00:04:51.180" style="s2">don&#39;t think that you&#39;ve earned it</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.390" end="00:04:53.730" style="s2">because nobody earns it none of us are</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.180" end="00:04:56.280" style="s2">more entitled to love and connection and</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.730" end="00:04:58.200" style="s2">resources and health and community than</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.280" end="00:04:59.940" style="s2">anybody else you&#39;re entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.200" end="00:05:01.380" style="s2">someone&#39;s community like you can&#39;t force</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.940" end="00:05:06.630" style="s2">people to be friends with you but you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.380" end="00:05:08.760" style="s2">not entitled to you know having better</p>

<p begin="00:05:15.270" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">it&#39;s like the more narcissistic you are</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.400" end="00:05:19.860" style="s2">the easier it is to get rich and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:21.540" style="s2">the more you feel that you&#39;re entitled</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.860" end="00:05:23.850" style="s2">to be enriched because you&#39;ve got rich</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.540" end="00:05:25.530" style="s2">and you tried hard to do it anyway so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.850" end="00:05:26.910" style="s2">they look at that there comes out my</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.530" end="00:05:29.460" style="s2">judgment it&#39;s not like I&#39;m at zero</p>
