<p begin="00:00:03.870" end="00:00:07.680" style="s2">much for making time this has been I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.879" end="00:00:11.670" style="s2">been looking forward to this all day for</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.680" end="00:00:13.679" style="s2">me this is a really special moment it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.670" end="00:00:16.650" style="s2">really nice to talk to you again</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.679" end="00:00:19.740" style="s2">we&#39;ve had some stimulating conversations</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.650" end="00:00:22.080" style="s2">in the past both personally and done on</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.740" end="00:00:25.529" style="s2">video and so I really look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.080" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">that great so I&#39;ve prepared a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.529" end="00:00:31.590" style="s2">questions for you and I always like to</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:34.020" style="s2">give people an opportunity to start a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.590" end="00:00:36.960" style="s2">little bit from their story and your</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.020" end="00:00:38.969" style="s2">story is so fascinating because um you</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.960" end="00:00:41.489" style="s2">started your professional career very</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.969" end="00:00:44.629" style="s2">successfully as physicist the research</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.489" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">physicist worked in a number of really</p>
<p begin="00:00:44.629" end="00:00:48.480" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">renown institutions as a physicist and</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.480" end="00:00:55.320" style="s2">then somehow something happened that</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:59.129" style="s2">made you look at life as a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.320" end="00:01:01.500" style="s2">process and ecology and biology in much</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.129" end="00:01:03.030" style="s2">more detail so I would love to take us</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.500" end="00:01:05.420" style="s2">on a journey for you to take us on a</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.030" end="00:01:09.390" style="s2">journey to tell what made that change</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.420" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s actually a long journey and</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.390" end="00:01:17.220" style="s2">and I have to try and sort of summarize</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:20.549" style="s2">it and it all began in the 1960s this</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.220" end="00:01:23.250" style="s2">was a period in which I experienced a</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.549" end="00:01:25.920" style="s2">profound personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.250" end="00:01:31.350" style="s2">these were my formative years I was in</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.920" end="00:01:34.439" style="s2">my twenties I you know I I graduated in</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.350" end="00:01:38.759" style="s2">physics and at the University of Vienna</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.439" end="00:01:42.530" style="s2">in in 65 and then had my first postdoc</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.759" end="00:01:45.930" style="s2">appointments and I was very much</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.530" end="00:01:51.540" style="s2">influenced by the cultural movements of</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.930" end="00:01:56.009" style="s2">the 1960s and looking back now I can say</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.540" end="00:01:59.670" style="s2">that there were two main cultural</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.009" end="00:02:02.130" style="s2">movements and both of them had to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.670" end="00:02:04.439" style="s2">with an expansion of consciousness an</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.130" end="00:02:08.310" style="s2">expansion of consciousness in two</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.439" end="00:02:11.730" style="s2">different directions into the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.310" end="00:02:12.920" style="s2">dimension of consciousness and into the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.730" end="00:02:17.599" style="s2">social dimension</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.920" end="00:02:21.400" style="s2">so in the spiritual dimension you had a</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.599" end="00:02:25.400" style="s2">very strong interest in meditation in</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.400" end="00:02:28.010" style="s2">Eastern spirituality in indigenous</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.400" end="00:02:31.610" style="s2">spirituality with the books of Castaneda</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.010" end="00:02:38.120" style="s2">for example and this was supported by</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.610" end="00:02:40.370" style="s2">the arts by music by literature there</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.120" end="00:02:41.120" style="s2">was this famous book Hundred Years of</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.370" end="00:02:46.519" style="s2">Solitude</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.120" end="00:02:48.769" style="s2">by Garcia Marquez the magic realism that</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.519" end="00:02:51.610" style="s2">was really very characteristic of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.769" end="00:02:54.530" style="s2">60s and of course there was</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.610" end="00:02:58.959" style="s2">experimentation with psychedelics so all</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.530" end="00:03:01.250" style="s2">of that combined to a very strong</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.959" end="00:03:04.430" style="s2">expansion of consciousness into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.250" end="00:03:08.120" style="s2">spirit spiritual domain and then there</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.430" end="00:03:11.120" style="s2">was the social consciousness raising as</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.120" end="00:03:15.880" style="s2">it was called in those days and that I</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.120" end="00:03:20.840" style="s2">see essentially as a very broad</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.880" end="00:03:23.209" style="s2">questioning of authority so we had the</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.840" end="00:03:26.269" style="s2">civil rights movement in the United</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.209" end="00:03:31.280" style="s2">States questioning the authority of</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.269" end="00:03:33.950" style="s2">whites over blacks we had the women&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.280" end="00:03:36.739" style="s2">movement questioning patriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.950" end="00:03:39.109" style="s2">Authority the student movements</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.739" end="00:03:42.109" style="s2">questioning the authority of teachers</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.109" end="00:03:44.930" style="s2">and university administrators the Prague</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.109" end="00:03:47.660" style="s2">Spring and the Dubcek questioning the</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.930" end="00:03:51.560" style="s2">authority of the Soviet regime and again</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.660" end="00:03:55.370" style="s2">this was supported by the arts the films</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.560" end="00:03:57.829" style="s2">of Anthony Fellini Goethe and so on</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.370" end="00:04:01.340" style="s2">theater played a big role the living</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.829" end="00:04:05.480" style="s2">theater for example so I was very much</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.340" end="00:04:09.739" style="s2">influenced by all that and in the 1970s</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.480" end="00:04:16.010" style="s2">I first went into the spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.739" end="00:04:18.769" style="s2">dimension in my work exploring parallels</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.010" end="00:04:21.979" style="s2">between modern physics and Eastern</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.769" end="00:04:25.950" style="s2">spirituality in my first book the tower</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.979" end="00:04:28.710" style="s2">physics published in 1975</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.950" end="00:04:31.380" style="s2">then I went into the social and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.710" end="00:04:34.340" style="s2">ecological direction with my second book</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.380" end="00:04:38.960" style="s2">the turning point published in 1982</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.340" end="00:04:42.420" style="s2">where I explored this paradigm shift</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.960" end="00:04:45.390" style="s2">that had happened in physics from a</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.420" end="00:04:49.730" style="s2">mechanistic world view to a holistic or</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.390" end="00:04:55.830" style="s2">ecological view and I explored it in</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.730" end="00:05:03.060" style="s2">various areas and and examined various</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.830" end="00:05:06.810" style="s2">issues such as healthcare management the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.060" end="00:05:11.730" style="s2">economy cycle psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.810" end="00:05:15.330" style="s2">psychotherapy and so on and somewhere in</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.730" end="00:05:19.530" style="s2">the late sometime between the late 70s</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.330" end="00:05:23.310" style="s2">and early 80s I realized that all these</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.530" end="00:05:25.650" style="s2">problems had to do with life actually I</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.310" end="00:05:28.320" style="s2">realized it under the influence of</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.650" end="00:05:36.090" style="s2">Gregory Bateson with whom I spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.320" end="00:05:43.080" style="s2">of time in 1981 and 82 80 81 82 and so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.090" end="00:05:45.300" style="s2">realized that all sorry was that and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.080" end="00:05:48.810" style="s2">also went there to do to give seminars</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.300" end="00:05:53.370" style="s2">and so I had long discussions with</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.810" end="00:05:56.490" style="s2">Bateson and so I realized that these</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.370" end="00:06:00.330" style="s2">issues all had to do with living systems</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.490" end="00:06:05.670" style="s2">with individual organisms social systems</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.330" end="00:06:08.100" style="s2">and ecosystems and so my focus shifted</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.670" end="00:06:12.000" style="s2">from physics to the life sciences</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.100" end="00:06:15.120" style="s2">because physics although it&#39;s relevant</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.000" end="00:06:18.120" style="s2">but it really can&#39;t tell you anything</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.120" end="00:06:20.490" style="s2">about the essential nature of life so</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.120" end="00:06:23.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what I became interested in and</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.490" end="00:06:27.690" style="s2">then for the next thirty years I put</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.700" end="00:06:31.710" style="s2">together a synthesis of an emerging new</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.690" end="00:06:34.170" style="s2">conception of life in terms of networks</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.710" end="00:06:37.590" style="s2">in terms of patterns in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.170" end="00:06:39.960" style="s2">relationships and already in my book the</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.590" end="00:06:42.990" style="s2">turning point I called this</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.960" end="00:06:46.470" style="s2">the systems for your flight and at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.990" end="00:06:48.870" style="s2">end of this trajectory is a textbook</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.470" end="00:06:52.650" style="s2">that I wrote with my friend and</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.870" end="00:06:56.340" style="s2">colleague Pierluigi Luisi biochemist at</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.650" end="00:06:59.220" style="s2">the University of Rome and we called it</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.340" end="00:07:03.900" style="s2">the system&#39;s view of life and this is</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.220" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">for me my grand synthesis of this new</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.900" end="00:07:10.380" style="s2">conception of life which integrates four</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:12.599" style="s2">dimensions of life the biological</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.380" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">dimension obviously but also the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.599" end="00:07:18.810" style="s2">cognitive dimension the social dimension</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:22.289" style="s2">and the ecological dimension so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.810" end="00:07:28.410" style="s2">long trajectory from the sixties when I</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.289" end="00:07:31.349" style="s2">got my inspiration to the 1970s when you</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.410" end="00:07:37.560" style="s2">know some conceptual framework began to</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.349" end="00:07:40.590" style="s2">emerge to the 80s where I got involved</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.560" end="00:07:45.330" style="s2">in green politics and and just went on</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.590" end="00:07:48.810" style="s2">and on and having really lived so</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.330" end="00:07:50.430" style="s2">intimately with some of the the pioneers</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.810" end="00:07:55.470" style="s2">as well I mean you know so many of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:57.060" style="s2">the early actors in the environmental</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.470" end="00:08:00.180" style="s2">movement who really raised awareness</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.060" end="00:08:02.280" style="s2">about the global situation and these</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.180" end="00:08:05.220" style="s2">converging crisises as you&#39;ve called</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.280" end="00:08:07.830" style="s2">them yourself and having seen all the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.220" end="00:08:11.789" style="s2">Big Easy what you just said there that</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.830" end="00:08:13.710" style="s2">in the 1960s and even early 1970s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.789" end="00:08:16.259" style="s2">social change in environmental change</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.710" end="00:08:20.699" style="s2">movement was very much also accompanied</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.259" end="00:08:23.220" style="s2">by cultural change by the arts theater</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.699" end="00:08:25.940" style="s2">music all of that right now</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.220" end="00:08:29.159" style="s2">there seems to be another upsurge of</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.940" end="00:08:32.550" style="s2">issues or like that but we still haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.159" end="00:08:35.849" style="s2">reached that broad social movement that</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.550" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">includes the arts and culture enough and</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.849" end="00:08:41.190" style="s2">having already lived through it 50 years</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:48.870" style="s2">ago are you hopeful that this time</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.190" end="00:08:53.709" style="s2">around we see a lot looking back I feel</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.870" end="00:08:56.220" style="s2">now that social change</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.709" end="00:09:00.310" style="s2">of course does not happen as smoothly</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.220" end="00:09:04.360" style="s2">it&#39;s not you know a broad trajectory</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.680" end="00:09:19.600" style="s2">is something we study in chaos theory</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.600" end="00:09:23.290" style="s2">this this is a pendulum that is highly</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.600" end="00:09:25.839" style="s2">irregular unpredictable and goes back</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.290" end="00:09:29.649" style="s2">and forth but never in the same way and</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.839" end="00:09:32.410" style="s2">so we had the early inspiration the</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.649" end="00:09:36.880" style="s2">change of awareness in the 1960s and</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.410" end="00:09:41.440" style="s2">1970s we had the political manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.880" end="00:09:45.100" style="s2">in green politics and in the 1980s and I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.440" end="00:09:47.860" style="s2">believed to what the end of the 1980s</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.100" end="00:09:50.920" style="s2">that we were now ready to embrace this</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.860" end="00:09:53.410" style="s2">new vision of reality and embodied</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.920" end="00:09:55.899" style="s2">politically and really changed the world</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.410" end="00:09:58.420" style="s2">well what happened then was something</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.899" end="00:10:00.760" style="s2">totally unforeseen which nobody had</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.420" end="00:10:04.060" style="s2">predicted and that was the information</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.760" end="00:10:08.640" style="s2">technology revolution which led among</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.060" end="00:10:13.870" style="s2">many other things to a new a new</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.640" end="00:10:18.360" style="s2">materialism really and of course a new</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.870" end="00:10:22.089" style="s2">global economy which was dominated by</p>

<p begin="00:10:22.089" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">and brought with it</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.779" end="00:10:34.779" style="s2">materialism and greed very much the</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:37.540" style="s2">opposite of the values we had developed</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.779" end="00:10:41.350" style="s2">in the 60s and 70s and it took us a</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.540" end="00:10:43.019" style="s2">whole decade the decade of the 90s to</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.350" end="00:10:46.480" style="s2">really deal with that because</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.019" end="00:10:50.019" style="s2">globalization that was the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.480" end="00:10:52.540" style="s2">umbrella term is not only economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.019" end="00:10:54.550" style="s2">globalization corporate economic</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.540" end="00:10:58.600" style="s2">globalization but also cultural</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.550" end="00:11:02.829" style="s2">globalization you and I today we and and</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.600" end="00:11:06.230" style="s2">even more so younger people lives in in</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.829" end="00:11:09.830" style="s2">a networked world in a globally</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.230" end="00:11:13.970" style="s2">work well and so we were very excited</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.830" end="00:11:18.050" style="s2">about that but the shadow side is the</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.970" end="00:11:20.810" style="s2">the corporate economy which is you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.050" end="00:11:24.560" style="s2">geared toward exploitation and about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.810" end="00:11:28.580" style="s2">shifting wealth from you know as the</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.560" end="00:11:35.020" style="s2">Occupy movements at the 99% to to the 1%</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.580" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">so in 1999 there was the meeting of the</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.020" end="00:11:41.960" style="s2">WTO the World Trade Organization in</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">Seattle where a new global civil society</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.960" end="00:11:49.940" style="s2">emerged and and so now we have two main</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:52.460" style="s2">forces we have the corporate world the</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.940" end="00:11:55.190" style="s2">corporate economy and we have the global</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.460" end="00:11:59.120" style="s2">civil society and they are on a</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.190" end="00:12:03.260" style="s2">collision course and and the crisis that</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.120" end="00:12:06.670" style="s2">I described and foresaw in the turning</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.260" end="00:12:09.200" style="s2">point in in the late 70s has now</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.670" end="00:12:13.100" style="s2">intensified and of course it has been</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.200" end="00:12:17.390" style="s2">exacerbated by climate change really</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.100" end="00:12:20.840" style="s2">climate breakdown which we also foresaw</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.390" end="00:12:23.300" style="s2">you know I wrote about climate change or</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.840" end="00:12:27.410" style="s2">global warming as as it was called then</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.300" end="00:12:29.950" style="s2">in 1988 so that&#39;s that&#39;s a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.410" end="00:12:33.320" style="s2">but and of course we could have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.950" end="00:12:38.300" style="s2">alleviated it much easier than we can</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.320" end="00:12:42.950" style="s2">now so there is there is a sharp crisis</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.300" end="00:12:46.070" style="s2">well am i hopeful I am hopeful yes but</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.950" end="00:12:50.090" style="s2">in a particular sense I have been very</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.070" end="00:12:54.700" style="s2">much inspired by BATS love hobble I met</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.090" end="00:13:00.050" style="s2">Hubble in 1997 when he invited me to a</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.700" end="00:13:02.900" style="s2">symposium called forum 2000 and I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.050" end="00:13:04.820" style="s2">I&#39;ve been very much inspired by</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.900" end="00:13:07.880" style="s2">something he wrote when he was a</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.820" end="00:13:11.900" style="s2">dissident and was actually in prison and</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.880" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">it is a meditation on hope where Hubble</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.900" end="00:13:19.830" style="s2">sees hope as he says as a dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:22.320" style="s2">the soul and not as the result of</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.830" end="00:13:25.070" style="s2">assessment of the situation in the world</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.320" end="00:13:28.050" style="s2">let me read to you what what he writes</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.070" end="00:13:30.810" style="s2">hope is not the conviction that</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.050" end="00:13:33.230" style="s2">something will turn out well but the</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.810" end="00:13:36.540" style="s2">certainty that something makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.230" end="00:13:39.180" style="s2">regardless of how it turns out and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.540" end="00:13:42.560" style="s2">I&#39;ve tried to live like that I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.180" end="00:13:46.860" style="s2">very inspired by that ya know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.560" end="00:13:50.930" style="s2">really rings true the how do you see</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.860" end="00:13:53.640" style="s2">I mean you rightly spoke to that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.930" end="00:13:55.710" style="s2">many faceted dimensions of that</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.640" end="00:13:57.690" style="s2">globalization process that neoliberal</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.710" end="00:14:01.170" style="s2">globalization had took took hold of us</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.690" end="00:14:03.450" style="s2">in the 1990s and one of them is like a</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.170" end="00:14:05.220" style="s2">globalization or colonialization of the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.450" end="00:14:09.390" style="s2">mind which has been going on for a long</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.220" end="00:14:13.290" style="s2">time it&#39;s it&#39;s and we need to re-educate</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.390" end="00:14:17.970" style="s2">and begin to see the world from a</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.290" end="00:14:19.830" style="s2">systems pure view of life and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.970" end="00:14:22.050" style="s2">still so few institutions in the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.830" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">that actually really focus on that</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.050" end="00:14:26.790" style="s2">education that is now so neat I mean you</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:28.860" style="s2">co founded the Center for eco literacy</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.790" end="00:14:31.350" style="s2">and and spent a long time actually</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.860" end="00:14:34.080" style="s2">looking at how how do we start through</p>
<p begin="00:14:31.350" end="00:14:36.360" style="s2">education to create this mind shift and</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.080" end="00:14:39.180" style="s2">and we first met at Omaha College in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.360" end="00:14:41.910" style="s2">2001 and I would love to take to take</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.180" end="00:14:44.130" style="s2">this opportunity for you to say a little</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.910" end="00:14:46.050" style="s2">bit about you&#39;ve had a relationship with</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.130" end="00:14:48.000" style="s2">Juma has since the beginning and why do</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.050" end="00:14:51.000" style="s2">you think because in those days that was</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.000" end="00:14:53.760" style="s2">the only place you taught regularly yes</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.000" end="00:14:58.620" style="s2">and could you say a little bit more</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.760" end="00:15:03.330" style="s2">about what you first let me say that it</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.620" end="00:15:06.360" style="s2">is true that systems thinking and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.330" end="00:15:09.330" style="s2">the ecological values the values of deep</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.360" end="00:15:12.810" style="s2">ecology which are essentially spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.330" end="00:15:16.830" style="s2">values all that all that is not in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.810" end="00:15:19.830" style="s2">mainstream however it is very broadly</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.830" end="00:15:22.410" style="s2">embraced in the global civil society</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.830" end="00:15:25.290" style="s2">which is very powerful and it has</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.410" end="00:15:28.020" style="s2">hundreds and hundreds of NGOs with their</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.290" end="00:15:31.310" style="s2">research institutes and centers of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.020" end="00:15:33.270" style="s2">learning where this thinking is is</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.310" end="00:15:36.440" style="s2">developed and practiced</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.270" end="00:15:39.810" style="s2">and trauma Hawk college for the last</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.440" end="00:15:44.630" style="s2">what is it thirty forty years has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.810" end="00:15:48.080" style="s2">at the forefront it is a very unique</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.630" end="00:15:52.680" style="s2">center of transformative learning</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.080" end="00:15:55.230" style="s2">learning where you not only absorb ideas</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.680" end="00:16:02.510" style="s2">in information but where you really</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.230" end="00:16:06.510" style="s2">transform in your your very nature and</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.510" end="00:16:13.290" style="s2">as you know it was founded by our friend</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.510" end="00:16:16.880" style="s2">and mentor Satish Kumar who thought and</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.290" end="00:16:20.370" style="s2">I discussed this with him several times</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:24.690" style="s2">that this transformative learning would</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.370" end="00:16:28.320" style="s2">best take place in community in locally</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.690" end="00:16:31.440" style="s2">rooted community although rooted there</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.320" end="00:16:34.080" style="s2">only for a short time but he has been</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.440" end="00:16:36.840" style="s2">able to create a very strong sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.080" end="00:16:39.990" style="s2">community where people from all over the</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.840" end="00:16:43.950" style="s2">world take short courses of two or three</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.990" end="00:16:47.040" style="s2">weeks and not only learn together but</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.950" end="00:16:49.500" style="s2">also live together and work together run</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.040" end="00:16:52.530" style="s2">the college in terms of cooking cleaning</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.500" end="00:16:55.890" style="s2">gardening and so on and so while they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.530" end="00:16:56.880" style="s2">doing this they talk they talk around</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.890" end="00:17:00.240" style="s2">the clock</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.880" end="00:17:02.940" style="s2">they they they discuss things in the</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.240" end="00:17:04.980" style="s2">lectures in the morning and then they</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.940" end="00:17:09.330" style="s2">talk while they&#39;re cutting vegetables</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.980" end="00:17:12.060" style="s2">they talk by they&#39;re preparing rooms for</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.330" end="00:17:15.390" style="s2">special events and they end up late late</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.060" end="00:17:18.180" style="s2">at night you know talking in the bar you</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.390" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">know tasting Scottish single malt</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.180" end="00:17:28.020" style="s2">whiskey no edge of chaos and so so this</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:33.360" style="s2">creates a very strong sense of community</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.020" end="00:17:36.930" style="s2">and in particular in my courses when the</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.360" end="00:17:40.080" style="s2">subject of learning is patterns of</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.930" end="00:17:42.600" style="s2">relationships because that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.080" end="00:17:44.730" style="s2">systems thinking is all about and when</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.600" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">you experience patterns of human</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.730" end="00:17:50.070" style="s2">relationships at the same time</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:52.890" style="s2">that&#39;s very powerful and so that&#39;s why I</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.070" end="00:17:55.410" style="s2">think Schumann college is so unique yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.890" end="00:17:58.580" style="s2">I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m a testimony for it</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.410" end="00:18:01.169" style="s2">because basically it was your work and</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.169" end="00:18:05.070" style="s2">seats work that first made me aware of</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.240" end="00:18:07.980" style="s2">the college and that made me want to go</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.070" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">there because I found out that all three</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.980" end="00:18:13.140" style="s2">of you were occasionally teaching there</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:16.770" style="s2">and then being there for 18 months in</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.140" end="00:18:18.390" style="s2">between 2001 and 2003 really did exactly</p>

<p begin="00:18:18.390" end="00:18:23.370" style="s2">Leslie they have these longer courses</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.790" end="00:18:24.270" style="s2">also the MSC program so that&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.370" end="00:18:26.250" style="s2">took right</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.270" end="00:18:28.440" style="s2">okay I was on the masters and holistic</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.250" end="00:18:31.380" style="s2">science and the but the fourth year of</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.440" end="00:18:33.360" style="s2">it running and and then I stayed on as a</p>

<p begin="00:18:33.360" end="00:18:37.830" style="s2">for another half year after the course</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:40.290" style="s2">yeah but since since so much has moved</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.830" end="00:18:42.290" style="s2">on even then like I mean I think Satish</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.290" end="00:18:46.410" style="s2">is absolutely right the most</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.290" end="00:18:48.720" style="s2">transformative experience embodied</p>

<p begin="00:18:48.720" end="00:18:53.970" style="s2">I mean even the Buddha said that one of</p>

<p begin="00:18:53.970" end="00:18:59.640" style="s2">the community but but now these these</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.309" end="00:19:03.900" style="s2">days because we&#39;re such a globally</p>

<p begin="00:19:03.900" end="00:19:08.640" style="s2">the planet and online learning is</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.690" end="00:19:11.970" style="s2">something that while at the beginning we</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.640" end="00:19:13.620" style="s2">might have looked at it not as ideal or</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.970" end="00:19:15.660" style="s2">not as powerful as face-to-face learning</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.620" end="00:19:17.549" style="s2">we&#39;ve realized that can do wonderful</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.660" end="00:19:19.290" style="s2">things and you yourself have set up a</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.549" end="00:19:21.330" style="s2">wonderful online course that I&#39;ve also</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.290" end="00:19:24.510" style="s2">had the pleasure not to take twice</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.330" end="00:19:26.730" style="s2">already the fridge of couple of course</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.510" end="00:19:30.540" style="s2">and I also think it created a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.730" end="00:19:33.929" style="s2">nice schedule for it but not only has it</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.540" end="00:19:36.860" style="s2">been a very well received course you</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.929" end="00:19:39.929" style="s2">have grown it into a community of global</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.860" end="00:19:42.660" style="s2">graduates from that&#39;s really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.929" end="00:19:46.679" style="s2">can you tell about that story the</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.660" end="00:19:49.770" style="s2">subject of my course which is called you</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.679" end="00:19:53.460" style="s2">know officially you know the system&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.770" end="00:19:56.130" style="s2">view of life but for PR purposes Capra</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.460" end="00:19:59.380" style="s2">cost because it&#39;s easy to remember and</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.130" end="00:20:03.340" style="s2">it has a website Capra course taught net</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.380" end="00:20:06.340" style="s2">and so it is based on the textbook that</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.340" end="00:20:10.720" style="s2">I wrote with Luigi the four dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.340" end="00:20:12.940" style="s2">of the system&#39;s view of life integrating</p>

<p begin="00:20:12.940" end="00:20:21.490" style="s2">and the ecological and it consists of</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.710" end="00:20:25.240" style="s2">twelve pre-recorded lectures of about 40</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.490" end="00:20:30.130" style="s2">minutes and they were recorded for some</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.240" end="00:20:33.610" style="s2">reason in Brazil in the home of an</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.130" end="00:20:40.780" style="s2">architect a beautiful living room with a</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.610" end="00:20:42.730" style="s2">very small group of participants and I</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.780" end="00:20:45.580" style="s2">can tell you I don&#39;t know whether you</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.730" end="00:20:48.190" style="s2">realize this watching the lectures that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.580" end="00:20:50.290" style="s2">this is really modeled after Samaha</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.190" end="00:20:53.260" style="s2">college because when you see people</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.290" end="00:20:55.560" style="s2">sitting on the floor and on couches in</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.260" end="00:20:58.840" style="s2">this sort of intimate environment</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.560" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">discussing things that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.840" end="00:21:04.150" style="s2">with people at Yuma College for twenty</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:06.880" style="s2">years and so I modeled my lectures after</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.150" end="00:21:09.070" style="s2">that and in addition to the lectures</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.880" end="00:21:11.610" style="s2">there is a discussion forum an online</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.070" end="00:21:14.740" style="s2">discussion forum where people post</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.610" end="00:21:16.990" style="s2">comments and questions and I participate</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.740" end="00:21:21.760" style="s2">in that during the whole course</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.990" end="00:21:24.430" style="s2">so for 12 weeks one lecture a week I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.760" end="00:21:27.640" style="s2">there every day for about half an hour</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.430" end="00:21:29.770" style="s2">to an hour answering questions and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.640" end="00:21:34.510" style="s2">that has been a real experience for me</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.770" end="00:21:38.110" style="s2">because although I don&#39;t have the face</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.510" end="00:21:41.680" style="s2">to face contact with people that I have</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.110" end="00:21:44.200" style="s2">in a classroom the conversations and the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.680" end="00:21:48.490" style="s2">discussions are much more substantial</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.200" end="00:21:50.140" style="s2">because in a classroom when you teach in</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.490" end="00:21:52.840" style="s2">a classroom and somebody asks you a</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.140" end="00:21:54.490" style="s2">question you have to say something you</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.840" end="00:21:56.700" style="s2">have to answer whether you know that an</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.490" end="00:21:59.890" style="s2">answer or not you have to say something</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.700" end="00:22:02.530" style="s2">online that&#39;s not true I can go away and</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.890" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">do some research I can look at books I</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.530" end="00:22:07.960" style="s2">can I can browse the internet that can</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:10.090" style="s2">think about it and usually what I do in</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.960" end="00:22:13.059" style="s2">the morning when I brush my teeth during</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.090" end="00:22:16.120" style="s2">the course and and shave I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.059" end="00:22:18.340" style="s2">but I checked the questioners first when</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.120" end="00:22:20.950" style="s2">I get up and then I think about it and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.340" end="00:22:24.190" style="s2">Mull them over and then I go and discuss</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.950" end="00:22:27.279" style="s2">things with my students so as you</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.190" end="00:22:31.210" style="s2">mentioned the course is now run for four</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.279" end="00:22:35.499" style="s2">years we have thirteen hundred more or</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.210" end="00:22:37.990" style="s2">less alumni around the world in almost I</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.499" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">think in 70 countries now on all</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.990" end="00:22:44.100" style="s2">continents and even in a single course</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:47.679" style="s2">you know the next course is starting on</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.100" end="00:22:51.850" style="s2">let me see the 26th of February and have</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.679" end="00:22:54.639" style="s2">these postcards and we have over a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.850" end="00:22:57.639" style="s2">hundred registrations now for the 26th</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.639" end="00:23:00.580" style="s2">of February from about 30 countries</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.639" end="00:23:02.409" style="s2">around the world from all continents so</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.580" end="00:23:05.889" style="s2">like at Omaha college it&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.409" end="00:23:10.059" style="s2">multicultural you know global community</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.889" end="00:23:13.600" style="s2">and we have so many alumni now that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.059" end="00:23:17.529" style="s2">have alumni meetings on zoom&#39; like you</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.600" end="00:23:20.799" style="s2">and I have right now but also face to</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.529" end="00:23:25.299" style="s2">face because whenever I travel somewhere</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.799" end="00:23:28.210" style="s2">I meet alumni where they go to Italy or</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.299" end="00:23:30.700" style="s2">to Austria or to London or to Sweden I</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.210" end="00:23:32.169" style="s2">have alumni meetings and and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.700" end="00:23:35.649" style="s2">need to be there they have alumni</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.169" end="00:23:38.440" style="s2">meetings in in Rio de Janeiro and in</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.649" end="00:23:42.190" style="s2">when Osiris and in various places around</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.440" end="00:23:46.869" style="s2">the world so I&#39;m really realizing my</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.190" end="00:23:50.019" style="s2">dream here to grow a global community a</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.869" end="00:23:53.409" style="s2">global network of systemic thinkers and</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.019" end="00:23:55.929" style="s2">activists and it&#39;s very fulfilling to me</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.409" end="00:23:58.749" style="s2">it&#39;s for me and this is so wonderful and</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.929" end="00:24:03.399" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna in a minute stop this and then</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.749" end="00:24:05.649" style="s2">we&#39;d go into the second part and but one</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.399" end="00:24:07.299" style="s2">thing that I learned from our common</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.649" end="00:24:09.549" style="s2">friend Brian Goodwin while at you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.299" end="00:24:12.700" style="s2">her college is that you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.549" end="00:24:16.110" style="s2">predict and control complex dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.700" end="00:24:18.580" style="s2">systems but the one way of influencing</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.110" end="00:24:20.799" style="s2">emergence in a way that it is more</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.580" end="00:24:22.960" style="s2">likely to be positive properties that</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.799" end="00:24:25.659" style="s2">emerge rather than negative ones is to</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.960" end="00:24:26.410" style="s2">pay attention to who&#39;s connected to whom</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.659" end="00:24:28.990" style="s2">in the system</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.410" end="00:24:32.020" style="s2">and what the quality of the connections</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.990" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">and also what information flows in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.020" end="00:24:35.350" style="s2">system and the quality of the</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:37.810" style="s2">information and what I hear you doing</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.350" end="00:24:41.470" style="s2">with this course is actually building a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.810" end="00:24:43.690" style="s2">network of global systems thinkers that</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.470" end="00:24:45.220" style="s2">that I imbued and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.690" end="00:24:47.020" style="s2">system&#39;s view of life because they had</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.220" end="00:24:49.540" style="s2">the privilege of learning directly from</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.020" end="00:24:52.120" style="s2">you and and then engaging them with each</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.540" end="00:24:55.230" style="s2">other and so much beautiful things can</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.120" end="00:25:00.100" style="s2">happen from that yeah and also it it</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.230" end="00:25:04.590" style="s2">underlying it all is a system of shared</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.100" end="00:25:08.680" style="s2">values and a certain spiritual attitude</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.590" end="00:25:11.920" style="s2">which is implicit and this is also</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.680" end="00:25:13.450" style="s2">something I learned from Satish Kumar at</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.920" end="00:25:16.450" style="s2">Summa College</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.450" end="00:25:20.950" style="s2">Satish who is a spiritual teacher does</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.450" end="00:25:21.820" style="s2">not push Jainism or Hinduism or or any</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.950" end="00:25:24.400" style="s2">religion</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.820" end="00:25:27.100" style="s2">he doesn&#39;t even push meditation you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.400" end="00:25:29.350" style="s2">when he comes to the college as you will</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.100" end="00:25:32.470" style="s2">remember what he does he goes to the</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.350" end="00:25:34.510" style="s2">kitchen and he cooks with students so so</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.470" end="00:25:38.050" style="s2">it&#39;s a very it&#39;s a in fact a Gandhian</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.510" end="00:25:40.630" style="s2">type of spirituality and and so in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.050" end="00:25:43.870" style="s2">Capra cause also there is a very strong</p>
