<p begin="00:00:44.460" end="00:00:48.860" style="s2">amazing age of prosperity in the 20th</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.769" end="00:00:52.019" style="s2">century how this actually happened so</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.860" end="00:00:54.120" style="s2">capitalism slowly revved up in the 19th</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.019" end="00:00:55.559" style="s2">century people were desperately poor in</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.120" end="00:00:58.379" style="s2">the 19th century nonetheless even though</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.559" end="00:01:02.309" style="s2">there was there was there was this this</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.379" end="00:01:07.979" style="s2">new prosperity was happening it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.309" end="00:01:11.369" style="s2">me that the economic decency came to the</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.979" end="00:01:14.100" style="s2">larger Western public in the first half</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.369" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">of the 20th century and this great event</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.100" end="00:01:18.180" style="s2">which is an absolutely amazing event was</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:20.369" style="s2">obscured by the events of the wars the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.180" end="00:01:23.100" style="s2">wars were so dramatic and occupied us in</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.369" end="00:01:26.100" style="s2">in such a deep way that we were unaware</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.100" end="00:01:28.200" style="s2">of of this other great event that was</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.100" end="00:01:31.649" style="s2">going on independently of the wars and</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.200" end="00:01:34.229" style="s2">what was going on was are you sure was</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.649" end="00:01:36.090" style="s2">independently of the worst that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.229" end="00:01:37.979" style="s2">that&#39;s that does doesn&#39;t quite work for</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.090" end="00:01:41.100" style="s2">me because somehow there&#39;s always this</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.979" end="00:01:42.689" style="s2">story where wars are big money general</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.100" end="00:01:44.009" style="s2">or tire wars every economy generators</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.689" end="00:01:45.030" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s a big theory and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.009" end="00:01:46.649" style="s2">there&#39;s that it&#39;s also another theory</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.030" end="00:01:49.289" style="s2">that the American economy has been a war</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.649" end="00:01:51.569" style="s2">economy for a hundred years and and it</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.289" end="00:01:55.859" style="s2">still is a war economy so the it seems</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.569" end="00:01:58.649" style="s2">to me the Union finally was able to</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.859" end="00:02:02.219" style="s2">integrate itself properly and in the in</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.649" end="00:02:03.810" style="s2">the capitalist economy and I have a</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.219" end="00:02:06.630" style="s2">sociologist friend his name is Steve</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.810" end="00:02:11.670" style="s2">Lopez he explained this to me that when</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.630" end="00:02:13.050" style="s2">the when the war end ended Germany the</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.670" end="00:02:16.310" style="s2">you know the Nazis were completely</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.050" end="00:02:20.010" style="s2">shamed in Germany and and and and your</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.310" end="00:02:22.740" style="s2">Germans were completely humbled and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.010" end="00:02:25.110" style="s2">went about the process of building a new</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.740" end="00:02:27.180" style="s2">society and they created this</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.110" end="00:02:28.950" style="s2">fascinating structure they created this</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.180" end="00:02:31.769" style="s2">threefold negotiating structure between</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.950" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">government business and and the unions</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.769" end="00:02:36.930" style="s2">and so in order to make in order for big</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:39.480" style="s2">companies to make any decision</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.930" end="00:02:42.450" style="s2">had to be made at the table with</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.480" end="00:02:43.769" style="s2">government and with the unions so that</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.450" end="00:02:46.920" style="s2">all three of them came to an agreement</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.769" end="00:02:49.319" style="s2">and they would on a on a regular basis</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.920" end="00:02:51.780" style="s2">sit down if there was a and and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.319" end="00:02:53.939" style="s2">renegotiate and make plans for the</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.780" end="00:02:55.859" style="s2">future and this was a in many ways a</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.939" end="00:02:58.079" style="s2">very non conflictual way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.859" end="00:03:00.900" style="s2">because that all the conflict was in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.079" end="00:03:03.359" style="s2">negotiation and once the negotiations</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.900" end="00:03:05.430" style="s2">were were achieved when we&#39;re finished</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.359" end="00:03:07.170" style="s2">then business they just went to head</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.430" end="00:03:08.579" style="s2">with their plan they went they with the</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.170" end="00:03:10.379" style="s2">exact plan that all three all three</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.579" end="00:03:11.609" style="s2">parties agreed to so I was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.379" end="00:03:12.900" style="s2">fascinated by this I thought this was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.609" end="00:03:13.829" style="s2">really fascinating thing and I do think</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.900" end="00:03:15.299" style="s2">that all around the Western world</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.829" end="00:03:17.730" style="s2">including North America there was</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.299" end="00:03:19.650" style="s2">whether or not this was this particular</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.730" end="00:03:22.290" style="s2">three-way negotiating process was</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.650" end="00:03:24.480" style="s2">official it it was more or less</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.290" end="00:03:27.150" style="s2">something like that that that that</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.480" end="00:03:29.879" style="s2">occurred so government was evolved in in</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.150" end="00:03:32.159" style="s2">in in the economy in in business and</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.879" end="00:03:33.750" style="s2">capitalism and so was were big business</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.159" end="00:03:35.819" style="s2">and so were unions and they were all</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.750" end="00:03:38.239" style="s2">involved and they all had a stake and</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.819" end="00:03:42.750" style="s2">that and that created this complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.239" end="00:03:46.069" style="s2">counterpoint of powers and a sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.750" end="00:03:49.229" style="s2">complexity of counterpoint is is is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.069" end="00:03:52.650" style="s2">seems to me is what it is what is needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.229" end="00:03:55.290" style="s2">to make a fair economy and what this did</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.650" end="00:03:56.609" style="s2">in the post-war years was what I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.290" end="00:03:58.109" style="s2">the Western world happened to be</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.609" end="00:04:00.930" style="s2">extremely prosperous during those years</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.109" end="00:04:03.510" style="s2">and the and the whole society you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.930" end="00:04:06.810" style="s2">with relatively few exceptions did</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.510" end="00:04:10.739" style="s2">extremely well the the it was an amazing</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.810" end="00:04:13.949" style="s2">period and now the West in a left-wing</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.739" end="00:04:16.620" style="s2">house and and and and we you know I I</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.949" end="00:04:19.159" style="s2">was around a culture that&#39;s picked apart</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.620" end="00:04:22.560" style="s2">all the negatives of this particular</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.159" end="00:04:24.330" style="s2">social economy but nonetheless in</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.560" end="00:04:25.860" style="s2">retrospect looking back it seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.330" end="00:04:28.190" style="s2">it&#39;s probably the fairest society we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.860" end="00:04:31.830" style="s2">ever had the period say between 1945 and</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.190" end="00:04:36.659" style="s2">the mid 80s or so until until Reagan and</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.830" end="00:04:40.020" style="s2">neoliberalism and globalization and now</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.659" end="00:04:43.020" style="s2">to explain Reaganism it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.020" end="00:04:45.389" style="s2">in the late 70s the in the 1970s it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.020" end="00:04:48.840" style="s2">didn&#39;t work as well it was it went into</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.389" end="00:04:49.529" style="s2">decline unemployment began to rise there</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.840" end="00:04:50.270" style="s2">was a lot of unease</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.529" end="00:04:55.280" style="s2">in the</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.270" end="00:04:57.740" style="s2">in in in society and there was there was</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.280" end="00:04:59.570" style="s2">seemed to be a feeling that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.740" end="00:05:02.330" style="s2">need to shake things up and another</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.570" end="00:05:04.430" style="s2">thing is big companies knew damn well</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.330" end="00:05:06.650" style="s2">that there was cheap labor outside like</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.430" end="00:05:08.870" style="s2">door take piece these jobs were also</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.650" end="00:05:10.820" style="s2">upheld by you know high tariffs and</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.870" end="00:05:13.640" style="s2">things like that governments governments</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.820" end="00:05:15.620" style="s2">had trade tariffs to to protect these</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.640" end="00:05:20.240" style="s2">industries and whatnot so it was a it</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.620" end="00:05:22.220" style="s2">was a protectionist arrangement but it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.240" end="00:05:24.110" style="s2">seems to me looking at that now now in</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.220" end="00:05:27.380" style="s2">retrospect and I was on the side which</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.110" end="00:05:29.540" style="s2">very much you know I was only a kid at</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.380" end="00:05:32.780" style="s2">the time but I was a part of a culture</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.540" end="00:05:37.040" style="s2">that saw this as dark as this this</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.780" end="00:05:38.540" style="s2">change is something in retrospect forty</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.040" end="00:05:42.800" style="s2">years later I think of it as probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.540" end="00:05:44.900" style="s2">the most amazing period just as amazing</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.800" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">a period of economic history as the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.900" end="00:05:49.580" style="s2">period following the Wars it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:51.380" style="s2">it wasn&#39;t amazing for us in other words</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.580" end="00:05:53.600" style="s2">what happened was the trade barriers</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.380" end="00:05:56.030" style="s2">came down that free trade free trade</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.600" end="00:05:59.600" style="s2">started we moved all our manufacturing</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.030" end="00:06:01.820" style="s2">to - well first of all the unions were</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.600" end="00:06:04.250" style="s2">broken in the US by Reagan but then in</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.820" end="00:06:07.370" style="s2">the 90s globalization began this was a</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.250" end="00:06:10.430" style="s2">very dramatic time very volatile very</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.370" end="00:06:13.100" style="s2">unstable for the Western world it seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.430" end="00:06:18.640" style="s2">to me we paid an enormous price for what</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.100" end="00:06:21.740" style="s2">in turn was the amazing economic</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.640" end="00:06:26.030" style="s2">prosperity of basically the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:28.670" style="s2">world I mean this is it was a credit</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.030" end="00:06:30.620" style="s2">this I mean I was I was terrified of</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.670" end="00:06:32.990" style="s2">this in the 90s when when I was in my</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.620" end="00:06:34.340" style="s2">20s that it was I just felt so</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.990" end="00:06:35.480" style="s2">vulnerable you can AMA cleave almond</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.340" end="00:06:38.150" style="s2">with that there are no jobs and this</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.480" end="00:06:41.600" style="s2">kind of stuff and and I was not alone</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.150" end="00:06:42.710" style="s2">and scores of people wondered if in fact</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.600" end="00:06:44.540" style="s2">our economy was going to collapse</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.710" end="00:06:46.850" style="s2">completely because there seemed to be no</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.540" end="00:06:48.380" style="s2">way of to support government government</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.850" end="00:06:51.200" style="s2">government revenues and these type of</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.380" end="00:06:53.450" style="s2">things that manufacturing base it felt</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.200" end="00:06:54.560" style="s2">as though I think in in reality it</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.450" end="00:06:56.360" style="s2">wasn&#39;t fully the case there was</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.560" end="00:06:59.990" style="s2">manufacturing that stayed and survived</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.360" end="00:07:02.090" style="s2">but we certainly had a feeling that our</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.990" end="00:07:03.610" style="s2">manufacturing base had disappeared had</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.090" end="00:07:05.860" style="s2">been just taken out from under us</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.610" end="00:07:09.789" style="s2">and when that happens you basically lose</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.860" end="00:07:14.860" style="s2">your tax base and that and so we we just</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.789" end="00:07:16.990" style="s2">felt like we had no everything was was</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.860" end="00:07:18.909" style="s2">fluttering in the air with with it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.990" end="00:07:21.819" style="s2">like having a building without a ground</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.909" end="00:07:25.120" style="s2">floor that&#39;s what it felt like and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.819" end="00:07:27.370" style="s2">and and so it was it was hovering in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.120" end="00:07:29.770" style="s2">air and just ready to just ready to fall</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.370" end="00:07:32.500" style="s2">and crash it seemed to me and and I just</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.770" end="00:07:35.139" style="s2">thought I felt through the 90s that this</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.500" end="00:07:36.669" style="s2">was gonna happen and then somewhat what</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.139" end="00:07:38.259" style="s2">amazed me is that the economy turned</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.669" end="00:07:40.330" style="s2">around and everything went to buzz and</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.259" end="00:07:43.419" style="s2">things got things got you know there</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.330" end="00:07:45.580" style="s2">were jobs and things went well again and</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.419" end="00:07:47.770" style="s2">I did I don&#39;t think I understand that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.580" end="00:07:49.330" style="s2">except that capitalists will talk about</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.770" end="00:07:50.979" style="s2">you know there are always up turns and</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.330" end="00:07:53.650" style="s2">downturns in in any in a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.979" end="00:07:56.620" style="s2">economy and that&#39;s that&#39;s life but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.650" end="00:07:57.819" style="s2">I did my understanding of how that</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.620" end="00:08:00.639" style="s2">worked</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.819" end="00:08:03.580" style="s2">didn&#39;t doesn&#39;t I just don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.639" end="00:08:05.860" style="s2">so well it&#39;s a funny thing like I mean</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.580" end="00:08:09.490" style="s2">again I&#39;m not an economist and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.860" end="00:08:13.360" style="s2">really have any much informed vision of</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.490" end="00:08:15.400" style="s2">all this but you know you get a feeling</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.360" end="00:08:17.889" style="s2">of what&#39;s going on from the news in some</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.400" end="00:08:20.860" style="s2">sense and and I felt like like ten years</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.889" end="00:08:23.139" style="s2">ago there was this incredible pessimism</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.860" end="00:08:24.610" style="s2">about where the world was going and now</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.139" end="00:08:27.610" style="s2">it seems like there&#39;s this there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.610" end="00:08:29.349" style="s2">kind of new kind of optimism and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.610" end="00:08:31.870" style="s2">know whether I trust the optimism</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.349" end="00:08:33.430" style="s2">because it&#39;s it&#39;s it might be just the</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.870" end="00:08:38.289" style="s2">information that I&#39;m getting on my</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.430" end="00:08:40.570" style="s2">Twitter feed or you know what I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.289" end="00:08:43.300" style="s2">not well there&#39;s all Steve Pinker and</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.570" end="00:08:45.880" style="s2">and and and you know there&#39;s all this I</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.300" end="00:08:49.209" style="s2">see you you know and I know there&#39;s all</p>

<p begin="00:08:49.209" end="00:08:54.070" style="s2">now you know people are not starving to</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.820" end="00:08:56.019" style="s2">death you know poverty has gone down</p>

<p begin="00:08:57.570" end="00:09:05.140" style="s2">that&#39;s the kind of you know I guess</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.850" end="00:09:06.640" style="s2">maybe even just five years ago mmm I had</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.140" end="00:09:08.860" style="s2">the sense okay there&#39;s like we&#39;re on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.640" end="00:09:10.690" style="s2">Titanic and we&#39;re heading towards global</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.860" end="00:09:12.790" style="s2">warming and the you know everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.690" end="00:09:14.980" style="s2">gonna collapse and recently it&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.790" end="00:09:16.870" style="s2">no no we&#39;re building a better and better</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.980" end="00:09:17.470" style="s2">world and I don&#39;t know why that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.870" end="00:09:20.560" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.470" end="00:09:22.900" style="s2">it&#39;s just I&#39;m just what I&#39;m describing</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.560" end="00:09:24.910" style="s2">is the information that gets fed to me</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.900" end="00:09:27.640" style="s2">through through media which is very</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.910" end="00:09:29.710" style="s2">strange these days and yeah and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.640" end="00:09:32.460" style="s2">it&#39;s very hard to process or understand</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.710" end="00:09:35.650" style="s2">what what the hell it is like yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.460" end="00:09:38.080" style="s2">yeah I mean I&#39;m basically kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.650" end="00:09:40.060" style="s2">talking exactly about that that this was</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.080" end="00:09:41.560" style="s2">a very unstable time but nonetheless the</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.060" end="00:09:42.760" style="s2">word there were enormous benefits going</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.560" end="00:09:44.560" style="s2">on now people are talking about all the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.760" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">enormous benefits that are happening to</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.560" end="00:09:48.220" style="s2">China and India and another that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:49.450" style="s2">mean there aren&#39;t negatives doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.220" end="00:09:51.400" style="s2">there isn&#39;t an environmental</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.450" end="00:09:53.340" style="s2">environmental price to pay and that kind</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.400" end="00:09:55.900" style="s2">of stuff but it does seem that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.340" end="00:09:58.000" style="s2">these countries are way more there&#39;s way</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.900" end="00:10:00.910" style="s2">more money in these economies and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.000" end="00:10:04.030" style="s2">allows for all kinds of other benefits</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.910" end="00:10:06.190" style="s2">to to people all around the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.030" end="00:10:08.470" style="s2">there it seems to me that the period</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.190" end="00:10:09.850" style="s2">beginning with reaganism amounted to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.470" end="00:10:12.100" style="s2">what I would call a capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.850" end="00:10:15.250" style="s2">redistribution of wealth all around the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.100" end="00:10:17.740" style="s2">world of wealth that that was consonant</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.250" end="00:10:20.440" style="s2">what was also new wealth created but in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.740" end="00:10:24.040" style="s2">part some wealth was redistributed from</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.440" end="00:10:25.840" style="s2">the West to to these places I think part</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.040" end="00:10:28.900" style="s2">of the reason why this globalization</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.840" end="00:10:32.500" style="s2">worked is because we in turn we gave up</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.900" end="00:10:34.780" style="s2">good jobs for cheap products so you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.500" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">we would pay back in the 70s we would</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.780" end="00:10:38.200" style="s2">pay way more say for television or</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:40.200" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.200" end="00:10:43.050" style="s2">and we do now and it&#39;s because of</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.200" end="00:10:45.850" style="s2">because they&#39;re made much more cheaply</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.050" end="00:10:48.090" style="s2">at a much cheaper cost well there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.850" end="00:10:51.100" style="s2">the free economy right now and you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.090" end="00:10:54.910" style="s2">in the sense that information is free</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.100" end="00:10:59.740" style="s2">right yeah oh yeah yeah information free</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.910" end="00:11:03.190" style="s2">most music and and and and and and TV</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.740" end="00:11:05.770" style="s2">everything is is you can get it so I was</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.190" end="00:11:06.670" style="s2">legal but everything is you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.770" end="00:11:09.670" style="s2">a whole other it&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.670" end="00:11:11.320" style="s2">dimension of how that&#39;s that seems to me</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.670" end="00:11:13.330" style="s2">almost like a subsidy or something like</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.320" end="00:11:15.670" style="s2">the Internet is is this massive subsidy</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.330" end="00:11:17.500" style="s2">that that that helps us it&#39;s a free tool</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.670" end="00:11:19.050" style="s2">essentially I mean it&#39;s not free we pay</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.500" end="00:11:20.860" style="s2">a little bit but we don&#39;t pay much and</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.050" end="00:11:22.210" style="s2">you know we get all this free</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.860" end="00:11:25.870" style="s2">information which you know in the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.210" end="00:11:27.400" style="s2">we had to pay for quite a bit but but so</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.870" end="00:11:29.830" style="s2">I&#39;m just trying to give you a little</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.400" end="00:11:31.000" style="s2">historical backdrop of my sense of my</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.830" end="00:11:34.300" style="s2">understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.000" end="00:11:36.460" style="s2">where we are now and so in other words</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.300" end="00:11:39.280" style="s2">there&#39;s been a the work was getting the</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.460" end="00:11:44.410" style="s2">world is getting richer but there is a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.280" end="00:11:47.890" style="s2">still a grave sense of insecurity and</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.410" end="00:11:50.320" style="s2">the this sense that you know people</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.890" end="00:11:52.060" style="s2">there was a time when people paid into</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.320" end="00:11:53.350" style="s2">pensions and then then they retired and</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.060" end="00:11:54.730" style="s2">they had this pension and then they were</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.350" end="00:11:57.340" style="s2">set they were set for their retirement</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.730" end="00:11:58.240" style="s2">and this kind of thing well people the</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.340" end="00:12:00.130" style="s2">people haven&#39;t been paying into</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.240" end="00:12:02.320" style="s2">retirement you know people people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.130" end="00:12:03.520" style="s2">have pensions set up anymore this is</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.320" end="00:12:06.640" style="s2">this is something that there was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.520" end="00:12:08.830" style="s2">people prior to 1970s had so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.640" end="00:12:12.700" style="s2">they probably own up until the 80s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.830" end="00:12:16.030" style="s2">and then the pension economy began to</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.700" end="00:12:18.460" style="s2">wane and it&#39;s because the money that was</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.030" end="00:12:20.410" style="s2">there was way more money in in our in</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.460" end="00:12:21.430" style="s2">the Western economies then it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.410" end="00:12:24.040" style="s2">me than there is now</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.430" end="00:12:26.050" style="s2">at least to invest and put a saw maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.040" end="00:12:28.270" style="s2">that&#39;s why everything the prices have</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.050" end="00:12:31.480" style="s2">gone down and there&#39;s all this free this</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.270" end="00:12:34.270" style="s2">free stuff is that you know well we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.480" end="00:12:36.010" style="s2">working out no way can&#39;t really pay for</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.270" end="00:12:39.880" style="s2">anything these days it&#39;s in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.010" end="00:12:41.980" style="s2">you know with your little salary we</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.880" end="00:12:44.110" style="s2">still we definitely still pay definitely</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.980" end="00:12:46.270" style="s2">still pay rent and and how you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.110" end="00:12:47.710" style="s2">property taxes and stuff like that has</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.270" end="00:12:49.750" style="s2">to cause still cost to live but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.710" end="00:12:51.339" style="s2">true that that the money money in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.750" end="00:12:53.170" style="s2">sense is that it almost seems less</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.339" end="00:12:55.180" style="s2">important it&#39;s because other things are</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.170" end="00:13:00.310" style="s2">other things are being covered by other</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.180" end="00:13:05.410" style="s2">means it seems that way anyway the so I</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.310" end="00:13:07.839" style="s2">was thinking about this and and it and</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.410" end="00:13:09.970" style="s2">it dawned on me that well didn&#39;t Donna</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.839" end="00:13:16.089" style="s2">me this came over a very long period of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.970" end="00:13:18.160" style="s2">time that we needed to reintegrate</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.089" end="00:13:20.620" style="s2">notions of subsistence economy back into</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.160" end="00:13:22.930" style="s2">the money economy and I have this sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.620" end="00:13:25.240" style="s2">that a big part of the great prosperity</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.930" end="00:13:28.839" style="s2">of the first to half of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.240" end="00:13:30.339" style="s2">up until about 1970 is due to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.839" end="00:13:31.750" style="s2">continuing existence of subsistence</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.339" end="00:13:33.220" style="s2">economy during that period in other</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.750" end="00:13:35.440" style="s2">words there were still loads and loads</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.220" end="00:13:37.630" style="s2">of family firms out of town and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.440" end="00:13:39.339" style="s2">kind of stuff and the money economy was</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.630" end="00:13:40.300" style="s2">picking up people were getting jobs the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.339" end="00:13:42.520" style="s2">jobs were getting better</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.300" end="00:13:44.860" style="s2">they were good industrial jobs this kind</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.520" end="00:13:47.140" style="s2">of stuff but there were still people</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.860" end="00:13:49.300" style="s2">you know some some remember the family</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.140" end="00:13:51.040" style="s2">still had a firm with with with with</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.300" end="00:13:52.540" style="s2">animals and things like that out of town</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.040" end="00:13:56.020" style="s2">this kind of stuff well yeah even though</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.540" end="00:13:57.760" style="s2">that&#39;s cause it&#39;s a shadow work yeah as</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.020" end="00:13:59.800" style="s2">being like I don&#39;t know 30 percent of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.760" end="00:14:04.480" style="s2">the economy or 40 percent of you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.800" end="00:14:07.510" style="s2">the real economy is not you know taking</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.480" end="00:14:09.070" style="s2">account oh yeah you could call that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.510" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s related to what I</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.070" end="00:14:11.680" style="s2">what I consider to be subsistence</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.690" end="00:14:12.910" style="s2">economy - yeah</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.680" end="00:14:15.700" style="s2">every time you sweep the floor for</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.910" end="00:14:17.680" style="s2">example that&#39;s that&#39;s work but anyway I</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.700" end="00:14:19.600" style="s2">feel that there was a lot of wealth</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.680" end="00:14:22.570" style="s2">generated from subsistence economy</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.600" end="00:14:23.920" style="s2">people had gardens and animals that they</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.570" end="00:14:26.710" style="s2">slaughtered and this type of thing they</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.920" end="00:14:30.010" style="s2">had sheep but they had a cow and they</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.710" end="00:14:32.980" style="s2">and and this became less and less so and</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.010" end="00:14:35.230" style="s2">by 1978 I completely disappeared from at</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.980" end="00:14:37.540" style="s2">least from North America and everybody</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.230" end="00:14:40.120" style="s2">from that point on was entirely</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.540" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">dependent upon money whereas before</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.120" end="00:14:44.380" style="s2">there were these older practices still</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:46.900" style="s2">in place where it just seemed normal</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.380" end="00:14:51.550" style="s2">natural for the old people to carry on</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.900" end="00:14:53.500" style="s2">in their old ways you know but like I</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.550" end="00:14:55.720" style="s2">was thinking like when you always hear</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.500" end="00:14:58.960" style="s2">that oh people been in the past lived on</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.720" end="00:15:01.690" style="s2">one dollar a day and I I hear that I</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.960" end="00:15:03.610" style="s2">think that&#39;s bullshit it&#39;s like they had</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.690" end="00:15:05.890" style="s2">robust subsistence economies that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.610" end="00:15:07.570" style="s2">know I mean that that kind of it that</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.890" end="00:15:10.600" style="s2">kind of statistic in a way there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.570" end="00:15:11.950" style="s2">something true about it right because we</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.600" end="00:15:13.750" style="s2">means I didn&#39;t have money you never</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.950" end="00:15:15.670" style="s2">money economy didn&#39;t leave live how we</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.750" end="00:15:20.020" style="s2">live now but there was other richness</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.670" end="00:15:22.090" style="s2">--is that you know absolutely no no the</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.020" end="00:15:23.530" style="s2">idea that they were dirt poor and had</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.090" end="00:15:27.010" style="s2">nothing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.530" end="00:15:29.380" style="s2">they had they had gardens and fruit</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.010" end="00:15:31.540" style="s2">trees and animals and that&#39;s the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.380" end="00:15:33.580" style="s2">I guess Peterson&#39;s optimism about all of</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.540" end="00:15:35.440" style="s2">you know what&#39;s happening now your and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.580" end="00:15:38.650" style="s2">that&#39;s I always feel critical about that</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.440" end="00:15:40.920" style="s2">a little bit okay back in in in the past</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.650" end="00:15:44.350" style="s2">people had such really terrible hard</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.920" end="00:15:48.220" style="s2">desperate lives and and now I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.350" end="00:15:49.330" style="s2">I I think it is the case that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.220" end="00:15:51.490" style="s2">kind of a difficult thing to talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.330" end="00:15:55.300" style="s2">because it is yeah</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.490" end="00:15:57.820" style="s2">the first things like child mortality</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.300" end="00:15:58.300" style="s2">was really high then you know what it</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.820" end="00:16:00.490" style="s2">was more</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.300" end="00:16:03.160" style="s2">more than it was it was it was related</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.490" end="00:16:04.600" style="s2">to poverty but it was it wasn&#39;t just it</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.160" end="00:16:05.710" style="s2">was mostly related to knowledge it was</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.600" end="00:16:06.850" style="s2">related to the fact that there were no</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.710" end="00:16:09.430" style="s2">cures for a lot of these childhood</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.850" end="00:16:11.980" style="s2">diseases but I think their lives they</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.430" end="00:16:14.050" style="s2">ate well and they were well housed but</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.980" end="00:16:16.300" style="s2">they and maybe that community right they</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.050" end="00:16:20.710" style="s2">didn&#39;t have this level of depression and</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.300" end="00:16:23.770" style="s2">schizophrenia yeah it&#39;s everywhere in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.710" end="00:16:25.810" style="s2">modern I think there was a new there was</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.770" end="00:16:28.240" style="s2">a rise in awareness of a hygiene as well</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.810" end="00:16:34.480" style="s2">in the early 20th century which really</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.240" end="00:16:36.970" style="s2">improved you you know it improved the</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.480" end="00:16:40.870" style="s2">health of the larger population that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.970" end="00:16:45.670" style="s2">another that&#39;s kind of so science and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.870" end="00:16:47.710" style="s2">technology really improved the lives of</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:49.120" style="s2">the average person but the loss of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.710" end="00:16:51.100" style="s2">social services in the economy was a</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.120" end="00:16:52.930" style="s2">terrible loss I think when people call</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.100" end="00:16:56.110" style="s2">this the the loss of traditional life</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.930" end="00:16:59.800" style="s2">but I think that&#39;s a that&#39;s a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.110" end="00:17:02.500" style="s2">of a that&#39;s a little bit of a Miss no</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.800" end="00:17:04.120" style="s2">Miss nomer because it&#39;s very easy to</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.500" end="00:17:06.760" style="s2">have a subsistence economy in a modern</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.120" end="00:17:07.720" style="s2">life or an inner vein life it&#39;s just not</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.760" end="00:17:10.600" style="s2">it was easy but it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.720" end="00:17:12.310" style="s2">imaginable you can do it and that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.600" end="00:17:13.900" style="s2">traditional so subsistence and</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.310" end="00:17:17.410" style="s2">traditional don&#39;t mean the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.900" end="00:17:20.110" style="s2">and so this is kind of so I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.410" end="00:17:23.850" style="s2">working on the idea that subsistence</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.110" end="00:17:26.740" style="s2">economy can can be reintegrated into</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.850" end="00:17:30.700" style="s2">cities into the urban life and we can</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.740" end="00:17:33.280" style="s2">have an entire level of economic life</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.700" end="00:17:34.960" style="s2">which is essentially unrelated to making</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.280" end="00:17:37.390" style="s2">money I&#39;m related to going out getting a</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.960" end="00:17:39.780" style="s2">job and making money yes okay you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.390" end="00:17:42.670" style="s2">in a way where you know I you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.780" end="00:17:44.650" style="s2">I&#39;m putting out content and writing and</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.670" end="00:17:45.910" style="s2">I&#39;m not being paid like you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.650" end="00:17:48.940" style="s2">that we&#39;re having this conversation I</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.910" end="00:17:52.750" style="s2">have my job right on one hand and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.940" end="00:17:55.780" style="s2">about 50% of my even less I probably of</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.750" end="00:17:59.560" style="s2">my work right I mean how would you</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.780" end="00:18:01.390" style="s2">define work right I work is doing the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.560" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">stuff that&#39;s kind of hard that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.390" end="00:18:07.570" style="s2">really want to do right yeah now it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:09.400" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the it&#39;s and and we but</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.570" end="00:18:10.750" style="s2">you do it because it makes your life</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.400" end="00:18:12.409" style="s2">meaningful right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.750" end="00:18:16.730" style="s2">so so</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.409" end="00:18:19.610" style="s2">you know my wife she has a full-time job</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.730" end="00:18:23.000" style="s2">in hotel and and most of her work is</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.610" end="00:18:27.830" style="s2">work you know for me it&#39;s like 50</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.000" end="00:18:29.389" style="s2">percent so so I love that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.830" end="00:18:31.039" style="s2">subsistence economy that&#39;s what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.389" end="00:18:32.720" style="s2">talking about soluti I would say we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.039" end="00:18:35.720" style="s2">moving we&#39;re into that now I&#39;m not being</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.720" end="00:18:40.009" style="s2">paid for that but but it there there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.720" end="00:18:42.529" style="s2">some I guess rewards intangible rewards</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.009" end="00:18:43.820" style="s2">well I would say you would probably</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.529" end="00:18:46.850" style="s2">first and foremost think of essay</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.820" end="00:18:48.350" style="s2">writing as cultural life and you might</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.850" end="00:18:49.940" style="s2">think of it as intellectual life or even</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.350" end="00:18:52.129" style="s2">political or something that but it has</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.940" end="00:18:54.409" style="s2">absolutely is economic it you know it</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.129" end="00:18:56.210" style="s2">has an effect on people if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.409" end="00:18:59.029" style="s2">interested in your essays and they read</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.210" end="00:19:01.639" style="s2">it and it has you know it has an it has</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.029" end="00:19:03.649" style="s2">various effects on them and it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.639" end="00:19:05.629" style="s2">influence how they behave and so</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.649" end="00:19:07.820" style="s2">everything in a sense I mean just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.629" end="00:19:09.769" style="s2">everything everything overlaps a little</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.820" end="00:19:11.720" style="s2">bit with everything else so you know you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.769" end="00:19:12.919" style="s2">can think of that as economic and you</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.720" end="00:19:14.990" style="s2">may eventually get paid for that from</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.919" end="00:19:19.100" style="s2">writing those essays you may nose yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.990" end="00:19:21.320" style="s2">but but I do agree that we can imagine</p>
<p begin="00:19:19.100" end="00:19:23.330" style="s2">say a world of making art like I think</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.320" end="00:19:25.639" style="s2">since most people stack up at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.330" end="00:19:28.340" style="s2">of hierarchies to quote Angie Sweeney</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.639" end="00:19:30.799" style="s2">and for example since most artists don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.340" end="00:19:33.230" style="s2">make any money or Jordan Peterson sorry</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.799" end="00:19:34.250" style="s2">you said to court and your Sweeney but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.230" end="00:19:38.870" style="s2">who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.250" end="00:19:42.950" style="s2">Jordan Peters I wouldn&#39;t want to Cano</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.870" end="00:19:45.080" style="s2">you got right so anyway the that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.950" end="00:19:46.460" style="s2">thinking that there&#39;s all this art and</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.539" end="00:20:04.879" style="s2">to your friend well that&#39;s obviously</p>

<p begin="00:20:36.340" end="00:20:41.200" style="s2">could probably be earning tons of money</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.289" end="00:20:44.260" style="s2">doing that if she wanted to but they</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.200" end="00:20:46.330" style="s2">actually have chosen not to write engage</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.260" end="00:20:50.710" style="s2">in that way so you know they&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.330" end="00:20:53.020" style="s2">all this extraordinary art of music but</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.710" end="00:20:56.770" style="s2">it&#39;s but they&#39;re not they&#39;re not you</p>

<p begin="00:20:58.360" end="00:21:04.210" style="s2">sake of itself but then you know on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.490" end="00:21:07.870" style="s2">other hand right okay if I&#39;m being paid</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.210" end="00:21:09.940" style="s2">if I&#39;m being I&#39;m being paid $10 for it</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.870" end="00:21:12.250" style="s2">for an essay that I put on medium I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.940" end="00:21:15.309" style="s2">pretty damn happy to be to be paid for</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.250" end="00:21:17.529" style="s2">sure for creative about 400 times it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.309" end="00:21:19.600" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the shock of being paid</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.529" end="00:21:20.950" style="s2">for that I think we&#39;re digressing a</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.600" end="00:21:22.659" style="s2">little bit in talking about cultural</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.950" end="00:21:25.149" style="s2">matters such as the arts I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.659" end="00:21:27.250" style="s2">stick as closely as possible to economic</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.149" end="00:21:28.870" style="s2">work in other words work which produces</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.250" end="00:21:30.370" style="s2">things that we consume for economic</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.870" end="00:21:31.799" style="s2">benefits such as food shelter and</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.370" end="00:21:36.370" style="s2">clothing this type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.799" end="00:21:38.590" style="s2">so the so I just want to back up a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.370" end="00:21:41.440" style="s2">little bit so I just discussed Reaganism</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.590" end="00:21:43.659" style="s2">and and and global globalization pre</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.440" end="00:21:48.250" style="s2">free trade and this kind of stuff the I</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.659" end="00:21:50.679" style="s2">think one of the reasons why there was a</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.250" end="00:21:53.039" style="s2">huge amount of capitalist economy was</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.679" end="00:21:55.570" style="s2">shifted over to these countries is I</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.039" end="00:21:58.059" style="s2">mean obviously because the labor was</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.570" end="00:21:59.230" style="s2">much cheaper but there&#39;s a reason why</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.059" end="00:22:00.460" style="s2">the labor was much cheaper because these</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.230" end="00:22:02.799" style="s2">people were living off the land they</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.460" end="00:22:04.750" style="s2">they they were they they were completely</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.799" end="00:22:06.940" style="s2">their economies were basically</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.750" end="00:22:10.419" style="s2">subsistence economies and subsistence</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.940" end="00:22:13.240" style="s2">economies lend themselves to a rapid</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.419" end="00:22:15.820" style="s2">Prospera monetary prosperity in in a</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.240" end="00:22:18.100" style="s2">capitalist climate in other words</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.820" end="00:22:21.970" style="s2">subsistence economy and money economy</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.100" end="00:22:24.130" style="s2">have a dynamic relationship where one</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.970" end="00:22:26.140" style="s2">helps the other and I it seems to me a</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.130" end="00:22:28.570" style="s2">terrible mistake once you develop a</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.140" end="00:22:30.039" style="s2">robust money economy to get rid of your</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.570" end="00:22:32.049" style="s2">subsistence economy it&#39;s a it&#39;s a retro</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.039" end="00:22:34.450" style="s2">mistake you should keep it you should</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.049" end="00:22:36.250" style="s2">make sure you keep it and I think we</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.450" end="00:22:37.630" style="s2">made or you might valorize it because</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.250" end="00:22:38.880" style="s2">it&#39;s always gonna be there in some way</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.630" end="00:22:40.740" style="s2">no I mean</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.880" end="00:22:43.140" style="s2">well it&#39;s always you&#39;re saying it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.740" end="00:22:45.990" style="s2">it was destroyed well in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.140" end="00:22:49.050" style="s2">we got rid of we got rid of animal and</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.990" end="00:22:50.880" style="s2">vegetable husbandry fairly quickly and</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.050" end="00:22:52.530" style="s2">easily in our society you know how much</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.880" end="00:22:56.880" style="s2">people live most people lived on farms</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.530" end="00:22:58.080" style="s2">and 130 years ago and now me you know 2</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.880" end="00:22:59.700" style="s2">percent of the people are involved in</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.080" end="00:23:01.200" style="s2">agriculture and back then it was crazy</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.700" end="00:23:03.390" style="s2">percentage I forget the percentage but</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.200" end="00:23:08.130" style="s2">really high so you&#39;re talking kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.390" end="00:23:12.780" style="s2">return to artisanal yes I am and work in</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.130" end="00:23:17.460" style="s2">a sense I&#39;m basically saying that we if</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.780" end="00:23:19.980" style="s2">we don&#39;t have a strong enough dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.460" end="00:23:21.210" style="s2">economic dynamic of subsistence making</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.980" end="00:23:24.180" style="s2">your own food growing your own food</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.210" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">doing helping each other out developing</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.180" end="00:23:30.990" style="s2">skills to you know fixing up your own</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:33.660" style="s2">house that kind of stuff then you if</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.990" end="00:23:36.540" style="s2">that&#39;s not strong enough then we you you</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.660" end="00:23:39.360" style="s2">you will we will be forever vulnerable</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.540" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">to the volatility of the money economy</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.360" end="00:23:43.710" style="s2">which it seems to me is inherently</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.000" style="s2">volatile at least the capitalist one and</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.710" end="00:23:47.970" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe the Socialists have</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.000" end="00:23:48.630" style="s2">figured out anything different so not</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.970" end="00:23:51.210" style="s2">even going there</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.630" end="00:23:53.280" style="s2">I&#39;m not going it&#39;s not gonna entertain</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.210" end="00:23:55.860" style="s2">alternatives to capitalism because they</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.280" end="00:23:57.390" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to the only the only system</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.860" end="00:24:00.240" style="s2">that seems to have really worked is that</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.390" end="00:24:02.430" style="s2">is you know there there can be</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.240" end="00:24:04.110" style="s2">government revenues can be can be taken</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.430" end="00:24:06.060" style="s2">out of the capitalist economy so as to</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.110" end="00:24:08.520" style="s2">so to create social enterprise which I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.060" end="00:24:10.230" style="s2">which I&#39;m in favor of you know basically</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.520" end="00:24:11.550" style="s2">the mixed economy that we have in the</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.230" end="00:24:13.590" style="s2">Western world seems to be the best</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.550" end="00:24:16.620" style="s2">system that has ever worked mystic and</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.590" end="00:24:19.740" style="s2">it seems to me that the Union was also</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.620" end="00:24:23.670" style="s2">an essential feature of what really set</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.740" end="00:24:26.220" style="s2">down established a voice for the workers</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.670" end="00:24:28.440" style="s2">yes and if and and the fairest</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.220" end="00:24:29.000" style="s2">capitalist economy that the world has</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.440" end="00:24:32.280" style="s2">ever known</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.000" end="00:24:34.080" style="s2">basically was the period between the</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.280" end="00:24:37.770" style="s2">Second World War maybe even a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.080" end="00:24:39.870" style="s2">before and and say 1980 and that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.770" end="00:24:41.280" style="s2">then that was basically dismantled their</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.870" end="00:24:43.230" style="s2">arse there are still some unions but</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.280" end="00:24:44.760" style="s2">basically not nothing I think it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.230" end="00:24:46.680" style="s2">there&#39;s nobody used to be yeah I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.760" end="00:24:48.510" style="s2">gonna say they&#39;re being destroyed in</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.680" end="00:24:50.910" style="s2">France actually the union&#39;s they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.510" end="00:24:52.600" style="s2">they&#39;re just seems to me that the unions</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.910" end="00:24:54.940" style="s2">don&#39;t have and it&#39;s simply</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.600" end="00:24:57.940" style="s2">we they don&#39;t have a strong enough</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.940" end="00:24:59.500" style="s2">footing anymore so and so what I thought</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.940" end="00:25:02.920" style="s2">about this for a long time and I and I</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.500" end="00:25:04.710" style="s2">realized that I&#39;m not going to even</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.920" end="00:25:06.760" style="s2">though I&#39;m going to acknowledge the</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.710" end="00:25:08.710" style="s2">importance of the unions historically</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.760" end="00:25:12.610" style="s2">I&#39;m not going to think about them as as</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.710" end="00:25:14.350" style="s2">a viable piece of the future so they may</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.610" end="00:25:15.940" style="s2">well be or they may or there may be a</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.350" end="00:25:18.130" style="s2">smaller piece or something that but</p>
<p begin="00:25:15.940" end="00:25:20.940" style="s2">they&#39;re not then in other words I I did</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.130" end="00:25:23.680" style="s2">not I just simply didn&#39;t consider the</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.940" end="00:25:25.270" style="s2">their importance in the future and so if</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.680" end="00:25:27.400" style="s2">you&#39;re in a capitalist economy and</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.270" end="00:25:28.600" style="s2">you&#39;re subject to the whims of the</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.400" end="00:25:30.310" style="s2">capitalist come the up turns in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.600" end="00:25:33.010" style="s2">downturns and all kind of stuff and you</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.310" end="00:25:35.920" style="s2">basically are you only get paid you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.010" end="00:25:37.660" style="s2">whatever in other words the salaries in</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.920" end="00:25:40.330" style="s2">that in this at least for the time being</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.660" end="00:25:41.650" style="s2">are gonna remain relatively low it&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.330" end="00:25:43.150" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s an argument out there</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.650" end="00:25:45.400" style="s2">that as as the rest of the world gets</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.150" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">richer then the cost of their labor also</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.400" end="00:25:48.910" style="s2">goes up and that will bring up in turn</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:50.170" style="s2">bring up the cost of our labor and that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.910" end="00:25:52.510" style="s2">will make us that&#39;ll that&#39;ll be better</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.170" end="00:25:56.800" style="s2">as well but in terms of making a living</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.510" end="00:25:59.740" style="s2">through by having a job that is a that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.800" end="00:26:01.530" style="s2">a that is something I certainly don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.740" end="00:26:05.200" style="s2">have a huge amount of faith in as that</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.530" end="00:26:08.320" style="s2">you know that being the fundamental unit</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.200" end="00:26:12.550" style="s2">of Social Work socio-economic that</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.320" end="00:26:16.270" style="s2">conversation that comes from that comes</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.550" end="00:26:17.980" style="s2">from factory models doesn&#39;t it yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.270" end="00:26:20.800" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s that&#39;s already</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.980" end="00:26:23.590" style="s2">obsolete in a sense but we have service</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.800" end="00:26:27.220" style="s2">industries that the factory model is</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.590" end="00:26:29.650" style="s2">sort of it&#39;s sort of you know III you</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.220" end="00:26:32.530" style="s2">know even education is like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.650" end="00:26:36.280" style="s2">these monolithic structures that are not</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.530" end="00:26:38.410" style="s2">in tune with yeah how things are how</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.280" end="00:26:39.940" style="s2">things really are moving to what things</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.410" end="00:26:43.660" style="s2">are moving towards and then how people</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.940" end="00:26:44.980" style="s2">are behaving and you know okay I&#39;m glad</p>
<p begin="00:26:43.660" end="00:26:47.380" style="s2">you mentioned that because that makes me</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.980" end="00:26:49.390" style="s2">think of so we&#39;ve also evolved in in in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.380" end="00:26:50.800" style="s2">as a new way of making money people are</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.390" end="00:26:52.540" style="s2">becoming self-employed they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.800" end="00:26:55.990" style="s2">stuff on with their computers on the</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.540" end="00:26:58.660" style="s2">internet there&#39;s all kinds of more but</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.990" end="00:27:00.460" style="s2">the thing is it&#39;s fairly clear to me</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.660" end="00:27:02.230" style="s2">that not everybody&#39;s capable of being</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.460" end="00:27:03.250" style="s2">self-employed it&#39;s a relatively small</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.230" end="00:27:06.279" style="s2">percentage of population who actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.250" end="00:27:09.960" style="s2">have that capacity for to self-employed</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.279" end="00:27:12.820" style="s2">might be true I do think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.960" end="00:27:15.519" style="s2">dimension of shepherding involved in</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.820" end="00:27:17.109" style="s2">social economics in other words there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.519" end="00:27:18.789" style="s2">a there&#39;s a fairly significant</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.109" end="00:27:20.529" style="s2">percentage of population more that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.789" end="00:27:22.239" style="s2">need to be taken care of so to speak now</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.529" end="00:27:25.539" style="s2">this doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t do valuable</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.239" end="00:27:28.149" style="s2">work but they they don&#39;t they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.539" end="00:27:30.609" style="s2">going to Robert I would go even further</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.149" end="00:27:32.769" style="s2">than that I mean I know I when I have</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.609" end="00:27:34.749" style="s2">too much time on my hands I I&#39;m less</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.769" end="00:27:36.340" style="s2">productive actually than when I have you</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.749" end="00:27:37.779" style="s2">know I wouldn&#39;t have a job and then I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.340" end="00:27:39.969" style="s2">you know I you know I have other things</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.779" end="00:27:41.499" style="s2">to do and I there&#39;s a structure of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.969" end="00:27:44.769" style="s2">you don&#39;t have structure in you in your</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.499" end="00:27:49.269" style="s2">life here you could very easily sleep in</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.769" end="00:27:51.519" style="s2">and you know get get hooked to cereal TP</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.269" end="00:27:53.559" style="s2">and and just you know have naps all the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.519" end="00:27:56.440" style="s2">time I know this you know do you just</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.559" end="00:27:57.460" style="s2">lose your your-your-your structure very</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.440" end="00:28:00.999" style="s2">easily I do</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.460" end="00:28:06.369" style="s2">oh me too absolutely yeah yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.999" end="00:28:08.859" style="s2">absolutely so the so I started that</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.369" end="00:28:11.289" style="s2">that&#39;s basically I&#39;m setting it up I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.859" end="00:28:14.249" style="s2">setting I&#39;m setting setting you up so I</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.289" end="00:28:17.169" style="s2">can I can talk about what I think is a</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.249" end="00:28:20.619" style="s2">is a possible solution which I also</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.169" end="00:28:23.169" style="s2">believe is a possible solution for the</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.619" end="00:28:25.509" style="s2">can the environmental environmental</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.169" end="00:28:29.200" style="s2">crisis which we seem to be facing and</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.509" end="00:28:30.969" style="s2">that is there&#39;s a there&#39;s a potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.200" end="00:28:33.039" style="s2">for mass redundancy a potential for a</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.969" end="00:28:35.739" style="s2">lack of money in our economy a potential</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.039" end="00:28:37.359" style="s2">for there being increasing numbers of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.739" end="00:28:40.839" style="s2">dispossessed people people who would</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.359" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">simply cannot cannot find a place in all</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.839" end="00:28:46.899" style="s2">in these competence hierarchies that</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:48.249" style="s2">that basically run the world and and and</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.899" end="00:28:49.330" style="s2">you know when you think of competence</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.249" end="00:28:50.950" style="s2">are keys you don&#39;t just think of</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.330" end="00:28:52.989" style="s2">electricians and plumbers you you also</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.950" end="00:28:54.909" style="s2">think about someone who can you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.989" end="00:28:56.469" style="s2">play the guitar at a party you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.909" end="00:28:58.409" style="s2">there&#39;s all kinds of there&#39;s all kinds</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.469" end="00:29:02.499" style="s2">of competence hierarchies yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.409" end="00:29:04.450" style="s2">but it seems to me that there&#39;s a there</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.499" end="00:29:06.129" style="s2">and one of one way to include every</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.450" end="00:29:07.719" style="s2">every as many people as possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.129" end="00:29:09.669" style="s2">incompetent hierarchies is to have as</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.719" end="00:29:11.559" style="s2">many competence hierarchies as possible</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.669" end="00:29:13.149" style="s2">so if you don&#39;t fit into one well then</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.559" end="00:29:14.619" style="s2">you go off and try your hand at</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.149" end="00:29:16.059" style="s2">something else you keep trying your hand</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.619" end="00:29:18.159" style="s2">at something until you find the place</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.059" end="00:29:20.230" style="s2">inside the hierarchy but even and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.159" end="00:29:23.290" style="s2">it that&#39;s a beautiful and dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.230" end="00:29:26.290" style="s2">and a free way to think of the world but</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.290" end="00:29:27.760" style="s2">it it seems to me also that huge number</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.290" end="00:29:30.450" style="s2">of numbers of people are still left out</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.760" end="00:29:32.710" style="s2">of it they just don&#39;t they just don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.450" end="00:29:35.080" style="s2">they don&#39;t find a place or at least</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.710" end="00:29:36.910" style="s2">there&#39;s a fear that increasingly people</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.080" end="00:29:40.120" style="s2">won&#39;t find a place I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.910" end="00:29:41.980" style="s2">all of the waste that we produce because</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.120" end="00:29:43.179" style="s2">we&#39;re consumers Society and the amount</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.980" end="00:29:45.669" style="s2">of garbage that goes out on the street</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.179" end="00:29:47.020" style="s2">every week in say in my neighborhood</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.669" end="00:29:48.640" style="s2">there&#39;s a you know crazy amount of</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.020" end="00:29:52.150" style="s2">garbage goes out on the street the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.640" end="00:29:53.200" style="s2">amount of cars that get sent to the to</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.150" end="00:29:54.669" style="s2">the junkyard</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.200" end="00:29:58.059" style="s2">now they do gets melted down and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.669" end="00:29:58.950" style="s2">but I&#39;m thinking that this this all of</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.059" end="00:30:01.690" style="s2">this garbage</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.950" end="00:30:02.410" style="s2">including the stuff whatever we flush</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.690" end="00:30:07.090" style="s2">down the toilet</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.410" end="00:30:10.270" style="s2">you know feces and including that kind</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.090" end="00:30:13.059" style="s2">of sewage is is valuable and it has</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.270" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">enormous economic potential and what if</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.059" end="00:30:20.530" style="s2">we set up a new ethic in which nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:22.780" style="s2">absolutely no not one unit of waste were</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.530" end="00:30:25.720" style="s2">to leave your neighborhood if absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.780" end="00:30:28.750" style="s2">everything worked out and you organize</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.720" end="00:30:31.510" style="s2">yourself you organized yourself very</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.750" end="00:30:34.030" style="s2">deliberately in such a way that nothing</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.510" end="00:30:35.980" style="s2">would leave then and and what what if</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.030" end="00:30:38.110" style="s2">this became a very profound ethic first</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.980" end="00:30:42.970" style="s2">of all it would take care of a Norseman</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.110" end="00:30:44.890" style="s2">of our environmental problem I believe</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.970" end="00:30:46.840" style="s2">for one we would we would start</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.890" end="00:30:48.390" style="s2">consuming less because we would have all</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.840" end="00:30:50.950" style="s2">this stuff that we would be forced to</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.390" end="00:30:54.820" style="s2">reconvert into something new which would</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.950" end="00:30:56.169" style="s2">function as economic wealth you know we</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.820" end="00:30:57.130" style="s2">could you could create all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.169" end="00:30:59.710" style="s2">stuff with it you could build you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.130" end="00:31:01.510" style="s2">you I can imagine that with the waste</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.710" end="00:31:03.309" style="s2">produced by neighbourhood you can build</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.510" end="00:31:04.750" style="s2">new houses fairly easily in it I can</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.309" end="00:31:06.940" style="s2">also imagine that rich neighborhoods</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.750" end="00:31:09.880" style="s2">because they&#39;re too busy making money</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.940" end="00:31:11.830" style="s2">would not be interested in doing this</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.880" end="00:31:13.419" style="s2">but they would most definitely be</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.830" end="00:31:15.010" style="s2">interested in throwing all the garbage</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.419" end="00:31:16.870" style="s2">down into poor neighborhoods and if they</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.010" end="00:31:18.730" style="s2">were adequately organized they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.870" end="00:31:21.070" style="s2">delighted to have it all all these they</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.730" end="00:31:23.200" style="s2">could create a house through 3d printing</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.070" end="00:31:26.860" style="s2">they just put all the material and</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.200" end="00:31:29.049" style="s2">garbage some kind of VAT and make this</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.860" end="00:31:30.850" style="s2">new material and then build houses of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.049" end="00:31:32.500" style="s2">yeah yeah I mean you could match there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.850" end="00:31:34.870" style="s2">no end to imagining what can happen with</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.500" end="00:31:38.140" style="s2">every time a house gets torn down for</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.870" end="00:31:40.510" style="s2">you you have very strict strict ethic in</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.140" end="00:31:42.310" style="s2">place where nothing is nothing is wasted</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.510" end="00:31:44.800" style="s2">so you save all the wood you save the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.310" end="00:31:46.960" style="s2">windows you even as much as possible if</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.800" end="00:31:49.210" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna beat beat up the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.960" end="00:31:51.370" style="s2">concrete foundation for example then you</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.210" end="00:31:53.080" style="s2">save you just saved the blocks of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.370" end="00:31:55.390" style="s2">rocks you know and then the debris and</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.080" end="00:31:58.030" style="s2">that gets reused all of it absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.390" end="00:31:59.770" style="s2">every in the plastic and they change it</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.030" end="00:32:01.450" style="s2">it&#39;s strange that we have what we use</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.770" end="00:32:04.150" style="s2">all the stuff and then we just throw it</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.450" end="00:32:07.210" style="s2">away isn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.150" end="00:32:09.250" style="s2">what I&#39;m getting at is we we have this</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.210" end="00:32:11.440" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s right we make all this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.250" end="00:32:13.090" style="s2">and then we put it in the dump or now</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.440" end="00:32:15.160" style="s2">there is a lot of recycling that&#39;s going</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.090" end="00:32:18.460" style="s2">on but I think recycling is very</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.160" end="00:32:19.840" style="s2">expensive and doesn&#39;t it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.460" end="00:32:21.400" style="s2">very inefficient way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.840" end="00:32:23.680" style="s2">yeah but it&#39;s not the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.400" end="00:32:25.240" style="s2">recycling is is it&#39;s another government</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.680" end="00:32:28.660" style="s2">service that&#39;s doing it you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.240" end="00:32:31.090" style="s2">really exactly that engaged in it yes I</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.660" end="00:32:33.190" style="s2">think what you&#39;re talking about is some</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.090" end="00:32:35.830" style="s2">kind of again it comes goes back to</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.190" end="00:32:37.870" style="s2">Peter Sounion idea of responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.830" end="00:32:40.870" style="s2">right yeah absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.870" end="00:32:43.000" style="s2">yeah yeah so so so it&#39;s a question of</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.870" end="00:32:46.390" style="s2">how do you engage it&#39;s question of being</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.000" end="00:32:48.760" style="s2">engaged in in that kind of process which</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.390" end="00:32:51.340" style="s2">right now we&#39;re kind of helpless in a</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.760" end="00:32:53.050" style="s2">sense yeah we&#39;re very vulnerable we we</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.340" end="00:32:55.630" style="s2">have emini relatively meaningless lives</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.050" end="00:32:57.040" style="s2">and we don&#39;t make anything we don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.630" end="00:32:58.330" style="s2">stuff I mean some people do but they do</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.040" end="00:32:59.950" style="s2">it because they&#39;re driven to do it</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.330" end="00:33:01.480" style="s2">because they they like that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.950" end="00:33:03.190" style="s2">thing it&#39;s a hobby or whatever but you</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.480" end="00:33:07.210" style="s2">know they make clothes or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.190" end="00:33:09.910" style="s2">what if everybody who doesn&#39;t fit in</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.210" end="00:33:12.220" style="s2">well or I mean I can imagine lots of it</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.910" end="00:33:13.900" style="s2">this particular way of life were to</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.220" end="00:33:16.990" style="s2">really take off people would lose</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.900" end="00:33:18.790" style="s2">interest in low-wage jobs because their</p>
<p begin="00:33:16.990" end="00:33:20.470" style="s2">lives their economic lives in</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.790" end="00:33:23.500" style="s2">neighborhoods would be more interesting</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.470" end="00:33:26.440" style="s2">and more more prosperous because they I</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.500" end="00:33:29.170" style="s2">can imagine if you imagine the reason</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.440" end="00:33:31.300" style="s2">for example I have worm composting here</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.170" end="00:33:34.210" style="s2">in my basement I like what I do is I</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.300" end="00:33:36.280" style="s2">shred cardboard and paper and I take my</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.210" end="00:33:38.380" style="s2">food scraps from my kitchen and I mix it</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.280" end="00:33:40.510" style="s2">all together and I have worms that that</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.380" end="00:33:43.960" style="s2">eat it and they eat the paper too and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.510" end="00:33:46.060" style="s2">they they create compost with it takes a</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.960" end="00:33:47.789" style="s2">few months and you feed it you know I</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.060" end="00:33:50.070" style="s2">just dump the new</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.789" end="00:33:53.970" style="s2">you sort of organize in such a way that</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.070" end="00:33:55.919" style="s2">the its eventual you know you have you</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.970" end="00:33:58.919" style="s2">sort of peed the paper and the food</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.919" end="00:34:01.169" style="s2">scraps at one end and the the compost is</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.919" end="00:34:02.549" style="s2">eventually is formed at the other end</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.169" end="00:34:05.729" style="s2">you know there&#39;s this process that</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.549" end="00:34:08.059" style="s2">happens and so there&#39;s all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.729" end="00:34:12.599" style="s2">ideas which would result I believe in in</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.059" end="00:34:14.909" style="s2">robust food production in in in in the</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.599" end="00:34:16.980" style="s2">neighborhoods of inner cities in poor</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.909" end="00:34:19.399" style="s2">neighborhoods that if if people saw the</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.980" end="00:34:22.319" style="s2">logic of this and actually began to</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.399" end="00:34:25.169" style="s2">organize around it then we would have</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.319" end="00:34:26.339" style="s2">robust under economies yeah but then</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.169" end="00:34:33.030" style="s2">we&#39;d have to talk to our neighbors</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.339" end="00:34:35.010" style="s2">Steven that would be terrible this is</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.030" end="00:34:37.049" style="s2">this is another thing this is the social</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.010" end="00:34:39.419" style="s2">side I&#39;ve been very worried about oh</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.049" end="00:34:40.770" style="s2">yeah all my life I&#39;d been worried about</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.419" end="00:34:43.740" style="s2">the loss of community I had a very</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.770" end="00:34:46.669" style="s2">strong sense as a child that the the</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.740" end="00:34:51.089" style="s2">older generations had a much stronger</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.669" end="00:34:53.549" style="s2">community than then then I had and and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.089" end="00:34:55.859" style="s2">that I also had a community which was</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.549" end="00:34:58.230" style="s2">ever weakening and had the older I got I</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.859" end="00:35:00.059" style="s2">could see that community was was ever</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.230" end="00:35:02.460" style="s2">diminishing well you probably have more</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.059" end="00:35:04.260" style="s2">of a community in st. John&#39;s than the</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.460" end="00:35:06.210" style="s2">new you would have here it&#39;s funny like</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.260" end="00:35:09.650" style="s2">I find the community here where you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.210" end="00:35:13.410" style="s2">I&#39;m a next Patriot so so I&#39;m not as</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.650" end="00:35:15.349" style="s2">involved in the community as I could I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.410" end="00:35:18.150" style="s2">would be probably if I was French but</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.349" end="00:35:21.630" style="s2">people I know you know a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.150" end="00:35:23.910" style="s2">on a superficial sort of you know you</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.630" end="00:35:25.710" style="s2">never get to another you know nobody</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.910" end="00:35:28.440" style="s2">like I know that I know the upstair Nate</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.710" end="00:35:30.599" style="s2">neighbor we smile we say hello we you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.440" end="00:35:32.460" style="s2">know we both have dogs but we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.599" end="00:35:34.920" style="s2">had exchanged a meal together you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.460" end="00:35:37.829" style="s2">in how many years I&#39;ve been living in</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.920" end="00:35:39.809" style="s2">this apartment complex which which which</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.829" end="00:35:41.670" style="s2">is kind of people let prefer it that way</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.809" end="00:35:46.109" style="s2">because yeah they like to have their</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.670" end="00:35:47.250" style="s2">walls like and you know and but but on</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.109" end="00:35:49.470" style="s2">the other hand it&#39;s a little bit a</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.250" end="00:35:51.569" style="s2">little bit strange isn&#39;t it yeah no I</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.470" end="00:35:53.609" style="s2">completely agree it seems to me that a</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.569" end="00:35:55.530" style="s2">real community is is something like a</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.609" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">circle of fifty to a hundred people and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.530" end="00:35:59.309" style="s2">it does seem to me it&#39;s a bit artificial</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:00.640" style="s2">to like members of the community aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.309" end="00:36:01.809" style="s2">necessarily friends but they</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.640" end="00:36:03.369" style="s2">you recognize that they&#39;re members of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.809" end="00:36:06.130" style="s2">community so there&#39;s there&#39;s some kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.369" end="00:36:07.329" style="s2">of understood it&#39;s at issue of</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.130" end="00:36:08.619" style="s2">collaborative it&#39;s somehow a</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.329" end="00:36:09.970" style="s2">collaborative tissue where people</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.619" end="00:36:11.799" style="s2">support each other but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.970" end="00:36:14.470" style="s2">necessarily like each other and that</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.799" end="00:36:16.510" style="s2">kind of there&#39;s there&#39;s there&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.470" end="00:36:18.519" style="s2">thing that happens in Paris where all</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.510" end="00:36:20.980" style="s2">the all you know there&#39;s a Food Day and</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.519" end="00:36:23.049" style="s2">everybody goes down to the to the canals</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.980" end="00:36:24.339" style="s2">and cooks food and has a big picnic</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.049" end="00:36:26.319" style="s2">together it&#39;s like hmm</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.339" end="00:36:30.549" style="s2">these kind of things are very sane and I</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.319" end="00:36:34.779" style="s2">don&#39;t know yeah yeah yeah so like I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.549" end="00:36:38.559" style="s2">imagining if if these neighborhoods were</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.779" end="00:36:41.170" style="s2">not allowed to you know we&#39;re we&#39;re set</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.559" end="00:36:42.819" style="s2">up so as not to keep to keep every</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.170" end="00:36:45.609" style="s2">article of garbage every article of</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.819" end="00:36:48.400" style="s2">waste every car wreck every every house</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.609" end="00:36:51.220" style="s2">torn down then there would be a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.400" end="00:36:53.140" style="s2">designated area in neighborhoods where</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.220" end="00:36:55.059" style="s2">you would have designated you would</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.140" end="00:36:57.279" style="s2">everything would be sorted so all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.059" end="00:36:58.900" style="s2">metals would be in one pile all the</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.279" end="00:37:00.490" style="s2">heavier metals the lighter metals will</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.900" end="00:37:02.019" style="s2">be in one pile like the tin and that</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.490" end="00:37:03.789" style="s2">kind of stuff the heavier metals will be</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.019" end="00:37:05.920" style="s2">in another and then the wood would be in</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.789" end="00:37:08.940" style="s2">another and then the you know this kind</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.920" end="00:37:12.430" style="s2">of thing and there would be a fairly</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.940" end="00:37:15.309" style="s2">engaged process and with a division of</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.430" end="00:37:16.630" style="s2">labor so and it&#39;ll be a putt because</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.309" end="00:37:18.309" style="s2">people are getting people get rid of</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.630" end="00:37:20.160" style="s2">clothes all the time so you&#39;d have a bit</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.309" end="00:37:22.210" style="s2">you&#39;d have it you&#39;d have one as</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.160" end="00:37:26.259" style="s2">designated area with a pile of clothes</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.210" end="00:37:27.819" style="s2">and and this type of thing you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.259" end="00:37:29.829" style="s2">rubber you&#39;d have a pile of rubber</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.819" end="00:37:31.119" style="s2">rubber tires and rubber boots and you</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.829" end="00:37:33.819" style="s2">know all that kind of stuff leather</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.119" end="00:37:36.190" style="s2">would be another pile and then the then</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.819" end="00:37:38.950" style="s2">you&#39;d have this another level not so</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.190" end="00:37:40.869" style="s2">you&#39;d have people sorting this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.950" end="00:37:42.970" style="s2">organizing it sorting it into its</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.869" end="00:37:45.519" style="s2">quality and then you would have other</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.970" end="00:37:48.309" style="s2">people who would take it and and do</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.519" end="00:37:50.440" style="s2">things with it you know yeah okay so as</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.309" end="00:37:53.019" style="s2">you&#39;re saying this I am I am getting</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.440" end="00:37:57.880" style="s2">some visions of Stella&#39;s collectivism</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.019" end="00:38:01.869" style="s2">and and like it would have to be I&#39;ll I</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.880" end="00:38:03.759" style="s2">would would have to be I agree that I</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.869" end="00:38:05.710" style="s2">worry about how how this would actually</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.759" end="00:38:07.660" style="s2">be put in place I totally am a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.710" end="00:38:09.700" style="s2">free-market person nah you have to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.660" end="00:38:11.589" style="s2">voluntary in some sense yeah it has to</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.700" end="00:38:12.549" style="s2">be totally voluntary and one thing you</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.589" end="00:38:15.670" style="s2">can do though</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.549" end="00:38:17.619" style="s2">is as a government you can you can</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.670" end="00:38:19.539" style="s2">announce this would be my idea if I were</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.619" end="00:38:21.849" style="s2">to do it and I would it&#39;s a - it&#39;s such</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.539" end="00:38:23.559" style="s2">a big idea that&#39;s hard to imagine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.849" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">just that we have to imagine we have to</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.559" end="00:38:26.319" style="s2">write remember that we have pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:28.299" style="s2">serious environmental problem we throw</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.319" end="00:38:31.989" style="s2">away a lot of shit and and then we had</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.299" end="00:38:34.959" style="s2">and that forces us to consume more</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.989" end="00:38:38.019" style="s2">natural resources in order to consume</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.959" end="00:38:40.390" style="s2">more shit and so and what if what if we</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.019" end="00:38:42.249" style="s2">really and truly recycle absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.390" end="00:38:46.089" style="s2">every article of everything that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.249" end="00:38:49.569" style="s2">consumed then you&#39;re looking at a pretty</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.089" end="00:38:51.219" style="s2">pretty serious reduction in in in our</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.569" end="00:38:54.009" style="s2">exploitation that&#39;s our resources</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.219" end="00:38:56.019" style="s2">because we&#39;re reusing it is a natural it</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.009" end="00:38:58.239" style="s2">is in a sense a new natural resource I</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.019" end="00:39:01.269" style="s2">think you would get it would work if you</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.239" end="00:39:03.910" style="s2">announced it would be quite simple I</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.269" end="00:39:05.319" style="s2">think you simply suggest you set up</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.910" end="00:39:07.869" style="s2">program so as to encourage you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.319" end="00:39:09.369" style="s2">force use but you set up say websites</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.869" end="00:39:11.499" style="s2">with information on how to do this and</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.369" end="00:39:14.049" style="s2">how to do that and then you announce</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.499" end="00:39:15.939" style="s2">that within in the next over a long</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.049" end="00:39:18.699" style="s2">period of time there&#39;s a 30 year plan to</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.939" end="00:39:20.829" style="s2">completely remove all elements of social</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.699" end="00:39:23.619" style="s2">welfare from our society so that people</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.829" end="00:39:25.689" style="s2">know that in 30 years time there&#39;s a and</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.619" end="00:39:29.469" style="s2">it&#39;ll be incremental there will be no</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.689" end="00:39:31.509" style="s2">more you know social assistance no more</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.469" end="00:39:34.179" style="s2">employment insurance no more working</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.509" end="00:39:36.429" style="s2">workers compensation all of these base</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.179" end="00:39:38.229" style="s2">subsidies laying out I and our kids are</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.429" end="00:39:40.809" style="s2">a little bit in a way no low-income</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.229" end="00:39:42.099" style="s2">housing you would get a B and and and if</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.809" end="00:39:43.239" style="s2">people know they&#39;re not gonna have that</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.099" end="00:39:46.029" style="s2">then they start to think differently</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.239" end="00:39:47.259" style="s2">pretty quickly and then you say well</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.029" end="00:39:48.819" style="s2">we&#39;re also going to set up an</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.259" end="00:39:50.079" style="s2">infrastructure we&#39;re not forcing you to</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.819" end="00:39:52.449" style="s2">use it but we&#39;re setting up an</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.079" end="00:39:54.789" style="s2">infrastructure which will make it wait</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.449" end="00:39:57.759" style="s2">which will make it very logical for you</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.789" end="00:40:00.160" style="s2">to engage in such an economy in other</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.759" end="00:40:02.079" style="s2">words you can recycle everything and you</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.160" end="00:40:03.969" style="s2">can read you can you can gather up</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.079" end="00:40:04.869" style="s2">everything you can reuse it you can turn</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.969" end="00:40:08.049" style="s2">it into something else</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.869" end="00:40:10.329" style="s2">and and it&#39;ll it&#39;ll it&#39;ll create another</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.049" end="00:40:12.489" style="s2">dimension of wealth I do I have a</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.329" end="00:40:13.539" style="s2">feeling that this is the and there by</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.489" end="00:40:14.769" style="s2">the way there are cultures that do this</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.539" end="00:40:16.179" style="s2">already it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not so</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.769" end="00:40:18.519" style="s2">organized you know there&#39;s shantytown</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.179" end="00:40:22.119" style="s2">cultures Genta in South America are</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.519" end="00:40:24.759" style="s2">known to get rich they they they become</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.119" end="00:40:26.020" style="s2">relatively sophisticated towns you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.759" end="00:40:26.950" style="s2">they are plumbing and electricity</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.020" end="00:40:30.070" style="s2">and all this kind of stuff in there</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.950" end="00:40:31.630" style="s2">shantytowns they&#39;re outside you know I</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.070" end="00:40:33.250" style="s2">think one of the reasons why shanty</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.630" end="00:40:34.810" style="s2">towns developed is they were outside tax</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.250" end="00:40:36.880" style="s2">owns people who didn&#39;t want to be inside</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.810" end="00:40:38.020" style="s2">cities so one of the reasons why I got</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.880" end="00:40:40.810" style="s2">interested in this in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.020" end="00:40:42.640" style="s2">was I realized that the nine-to-five job</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.810" end="00:40:46.060" style="s2">the the the money the money economy</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.640" end="00:40:48.220" style="s2">grind it wraps you it gets you sucks you</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.060" end="00:40:49.750" style="s2">into this high-cost economy you have to</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.220" end="00:40:53.140" style="s2">pay your rent or you got to pay your</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.750" end="00:40:55.270" style="s2">mortgage and you got yeah the you have</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.140" end="00:40:56.560" style="s2">so you had this long list of bills but</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.270" end="00:40:59.560" style="s2">what if you lived in an economy which</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.560" end="00:41:00.880" style="s2">had minimal bills if any at all you mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.560" end="00:41:02.620" style="s2">you might have to pay for a cell phone</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.880" end="00:41:05.110" style="s2">or the internet or something but</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.620" end="00:41:07.030" style="s2">basically what if maybe you know maybe</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.110" end="00:41:08.770" style="s2">you there be a if you&#39;re living in a</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.030" end="00:41:10.120" style="s2">city you&#39;d have to pay property tax but</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.770" end="00:41:11.920" style="s2">what if you built your own house then</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.120" end="00:41:14.110" style="s2">you wouldn&#39;t have a mortgage and you and</p>
<p begin="00:41:11.920" end="00:41:17.220" style="s2">your cot of money that goes into owning</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.110" end="00:41:20.710" style="s2">a house this type of thing what if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.220" end="00:41:22.840" style="s2">repurposed old cars and always had a car</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.710" end="00:41:26.050" style="s2">that was just reconstructed based you</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.840" end="00:41:27.850" style="s2">know and it cost very little I mean I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.050" end="00:41:29.680" style="s2">just imagining different in other words</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.850" end="00:41:31.270" style="s2">what if your costs were extremely low</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.680" end="00:41:33.340" style="s2">and if your costs were extremely low you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.270" end="00:41:34.750" style="s2">would have time you it&#39;s your life would</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.340" end="00:41:35.920" style="s2">still be structured in an economic way</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.750" end="00:41:37.870" style="s2">you&#39;d still have to do stuff you&#39;d have</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.920" end="00:41:40.900" style="s2">to grow food you&#39;d have to make sure</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.870" end="00:41:44.020" style="s2">your house is as well insulated all that</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.900" end="00:41:46.720" style="s2">kind of stuff but basically your your</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.020" end="00:41:48.460" style="s2">time availability of time is there and</p>
<p begin="00:41:46.720" end="00:41:53.380" style="s2">that gives you time to be more creative</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.460" end="00:41:58.170" style="s2">it seems to me something like that that</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.380" end="00:42:04.090" style="s2">that and just it seems to me that we can</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.170" end="00:42:08.130" style="s2">we we we can make life way more stable</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.090" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">way less worrisome way less stressful if</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.130" end="00:42:17.380" style="s2">we think about not throwing our wealth</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.440" end="00:42:18.820" style="s2">away the only way to properly understand</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.380" end="00:42:20.170" style="s2">collectives is to think you&#39;d think of</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.820" end="00:42:23.470" style="s2">it in small groups collectives are made</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.170" end="00:42:25.570" style="s2">of small groups once we step out of that</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.470" end="00:42:27.070" style="s2">then we lose the intelligence of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.570" end="00:42:28.150" style="s2">collective the collective simply become</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.070" end="00:42:31.030" style="s2">something very Dhamma</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.150" end="00:42:33.280" style="s2">yeah well it&#39;s it&#39;s a they&#39;d yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.030" end="00:42:35.890" style="s2">the group has to be small enough for</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.280" end="00:42:38.530" style="s2">there to be the intimacy of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.890" end="00:42:39.820" style="s2">collective or let&#39;s say group group</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.530" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">genius of some</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.820" end="00:42:44.020" style="s2">all right there&#39;s there&#39;s such a thing</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:46.960" style="s2">as a group genius but there isn&#39;t such a</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.020" end="00:42:50.010" style="s2">thing as a collective genius because if</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.960" end="00:42:54.550" style="s2">it&#39;s if it&#39;s too big it&#39;s it&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.010" end="00:43:00.460" style="s2">it&#39;s always done through you know force</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.550" end="00:43:01.870" style="s2">or under the rug or it&#39;s only it&#39;s only</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.460" end="00:43:03.880" style="s2">the small group that makes collective</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.870" end="00:43:06.100" style="s2">intelligence and the small a small group</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.880" end="00:43:08.830" style="s2">for me is defined by its interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.100" end="00:43:10.630" style="s2">interpersonal nature if it&#39;s too big to</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.830" end="00:43:12.550" style="s2">be interpersonal in other words if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.630" end="00:43:16.510" style="s2">too big for every member of a small</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.550" end="00:43:19.570" style="s2">group in to know the other and to know</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.510" end="00:43:21.340" style="s2">each and every other member and then</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.570" end="00:43:24.010" style="s2">it&#39;s then it&#39;s not a small group it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.340" end="00:43:26.410" style="s2">it&#39;s bigger than that so yeah so you</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.010" end="00:43:28.060" style="s2">need to have a big group if you ever we</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.410" end="00:43:30.460" style="s2">have countries right but then the</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.060" end="00:43:32.890" style="s2">everything has to be broken down so that</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.460" end="00:43:36.220" style="s2">each each organization is small enough</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.890" end="00:43:39.700" style="s2">you know to be to be intelligent right</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.220" end="00:43:41.380" style="s2">yeah I think that the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:43:39.700" end="00:43:42.850" style="s2">individual sovereignty is an inherently</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.380" end="00:43:44.230" style="s2">male an option of them thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.850" end="00:43:47.440" style="s2">this lately and that there&#39;s a female</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.230" end="00:43:51.220" style="s2">equivalent which is it has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.440" end="00:43:53.350" style="s2">the making of the person so the making</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.220" end="00:43:56.040" style="s2">this is my female principle the making</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.350" end="00:43:59.140" style="s2">of a person is an interpersonal process</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.040" end="00:44:01.660" style="s2">in other words it&#39;s it&#39;s more in a</p>
<p begin="00:43:59.140" end="00:44:02.230" style="s2">personal course is the flip side of an</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.660" end="00:44:03.340" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.230" end="00:44:05.620" style="s2">I mean ultimately you could argue that</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.340" end="00:44:09.790" style="s2">they&#39;re they&#39;re the same I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.620" end="00:44:12.670" style="s2">a subtle difference but women women</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.790" end="00:44:14.950" style="s2">become persons and they and they</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.670" end="00:44:17.020" style="s2">ultimately become individuals at least</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.950" end="00:44:18.520" style="s2">in their own minds and I of course</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.020" end="00:44:22.000" style="s2">they&#39;re many exceptions to this but as a</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.520" end="00:44:25.240" style="s2">general as a general identity rule they</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.000" end="00:44:27.070" style="s2">they their existing groups they they</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.240" end="00:44:29.380" style="s2">they function they support each other</p>

<p begin="00:44:34.360" end="00:44:38.260" style="s2">a there&#39;s a much more greater sense</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.370" end="00:44:40.300" style="s2">among among women of the of the social</p>
<p begin="00:44:38.260" end="00:44:42.850" style="s2">process which makes them whole which</p>

<p begin="00:44:59.110" end="00:45:06.610" style="s2">nearly as well that sort of engaged like</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.320" end="00:45:08.320" style="s2">almost right away in an intense way</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.610" end="00:45:10.480" style="s2">where men are sort of afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.320" end="00:45:12.100" style="s2">relationship something yeah I mean we</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.480" end="00:45:14.140" style="s2">think of that as a weakness but it can</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.100" end="00:45:16.120" style="s2">also be viewed as a strength and I I</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.140" end="00:45:17.470" style="s2">think of it as a you know it&#39;s possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.120" end="00:45:18.520" style="s2">we consume strength and for women too</p>
<p begin="00:45:17.470" end="00:45:19.690" style="s2">it&#39;s both weakness in the strength</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.520" end="00:45:23.110" style="s2">they&#39;re much more socially dependent but</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.690" end="00:45:25.840" style="s2">like Camila palea sort of negatively</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.110" end="00:45:27.640" style="s2">said you know women they always go</p>

<p begin="00:45:35.050" end="00:45:40.870" style="s2">she said this negatively so you can see</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.120" end="00:45:42.490" style="s2">this wonderful I mean yeah well you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.870" end="00:45:44.860" style="s2">see there&#39;s a negative thing and you can</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.490" end="00:45:47.080" style="s2">see the male attribute of not being not</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.860" end="00:45:48.790" style="s2">being interpersonal as a negative thing</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.080" end="00:45:50.470" style="s2">but you know I think the whole idea of</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.790" end="00:45:52.030" style="s2">the sovereign individual readiest has</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.470" end="00:45:54.460" style="s2">something to do with solitude has</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.030" end="00:45:56.170" style="s2">something to do with taking a long walk</p>

<p begin="00:46:12.070" end="00:46:17.980" style="s2">explicit in her in the way she runs well</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.640" end="00:46:20.290" style="s2">I also have this notion of cumulation</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.980" end="00:46:22.390" style="s2">every time you take out resources out of</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.290" end="00:46:23.770" style="s2">the ground or whatever you&#39;re you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.390" end="00:46:26.410" style="s2">always getting a little bit richer and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.770" end="00:46:29.860" style="s2">even theoretically every time you grow</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.410" end="00:46:31.300" style="s2">food in a field and you eat it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.860" end="00:46:34.120" style="s2">it&#39;s not just energy consumed because</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.300" end="00:46:36.460" style="s2">theoretically you shitted in the toilet</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.120" end="00:46:38.110" style="s2">but that&#39;s actually wealth if you are if</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.460" end="00:46:41.500" style="s2">you properly harvest it you know in</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.110" end="00:46:44.350" style="s2">other words we can if if we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:46:41.500" end="00:46:46.900" style="s2">smart with resources we can get rich or</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.350" end="00:46:49.150" style="s2">you know because we waste absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.900" end="00:46:51.670" style="s2">nothing and and it seems to me that</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.150" end="00:46:52.180" style="s2">nature can can properly recover because</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.670" end="00:46:54.040" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.180" end="00:46:55.660" style="s2">oh we&#39;re not raping we&#39;re not raping the</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.040" end="00:46:58.180" style="s2">earth too quickly we&#39;re simply taking</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.660" end="00:46:59.860" style="s2">what we need provide it that we waste</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.180" end="00:47:03.720" style="s2">absolutely nothing you don&#39;t throw</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.860" end="00:47:06.070" style="s2">anything away and that that vision of of</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.720" end="00:47:08.800" style="s2">drawing from the earth</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.070" end="00:47:11.050" style="s2">of exploring natural resources seems to</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.800" end="00:47:12.370" style="s2">make makes sense to me that that you</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.050" end="00:47:14.170" style="s2">know one of the reasons why we&#39;re raping</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.370" end="00:47:16.720" style="s2">the earth is because we&#39;re we&#39;re wasting</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.170" end="00:47:18.070" style="s2">it&#39;s true that the small groups idea is</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.720" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">something maybe we should focus on</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.070" end="00:47:26.110" style="s2">because that is is is a more it has more</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:29.560" style="s2">potential for for opening up and working</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.110" end="00:47:32.110" style="s2">on like I feel that I I do think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.560" end="00:47:34.540" style="s2">that&#39;s a more it&#39;s a more constructive</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.110" end="00:47:38.890" style="s2">concept in understanding the bottom of</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.540" end="00:47:40.900" style="s2">hierarchies because we assists people</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.890" end="00:47:42.970" style="s2">it&#39;s through small groups that people</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.900" end="00:47:45.940" style="s2">develop the competence that that allows</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.970" end="00:47:48.190" style="s2">them to to find hierarchies yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.940" end="00:47:51.610" style="s2">know it&#39;s there&#39;s a base and it seems to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.190" end="00:47:53.410" style="s2">me that there&#39;s a that was kind of a it</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.610" end="00:47:55.480" style="s2">was like a female ramp realm at one time</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.410" end="00:47:56.920" style="s2">you know the it was this breeding ground</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.480" end="00:48:00.850" style="s2">like children grew up in these</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.920" end="00:48:02.110" style="s2">environments where where they you know</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.850" end="00:48:04.480" style="s2">they developed the confidence and the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.110" end="00:48:06.100" style="s2">ability to to stuff and and then they</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.480" end="00:48:10.030" style="s2">entered they they branch out into the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.100" end="00:48:12.040" style="s2">world this kind of thing so this the</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.030" end="00:48:13.930" style="s2">whole idea of the the it&#39;s it&#39;s like the</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.040" end="00:48:15.250" style="s2">bottom of economies is almost the</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.930" end="00:48:18.730" style="s2">meaning of the word community or</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.250" end="00:48:20.620" style="s2">something you&#39;re I am definitely groping</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.730" end="00:48:22.570" style="s2">at the edge of something right and and</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.620" end="00:48:23.920" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to think think of</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.570" end="00:48:26.550" style="s2">something that doesn&#39;t exist and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.920" end="00:48:28.900" style="s2">kind of a that&#39;s a tough thing to do and</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.550" end="00:48:30.460" style="s2">but as for this so the small groups</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.900" end="00:48:32.470" style="s2">thing we could work on that and a much</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.460" end="00:48:35.950" style="s2">more I think I have a lot more</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.470" end="00:48:37.600" style="s2">confidence in that idea that it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.950" end="00:48:39.970" style="s2">sort of the flipside of individualism</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.600" end="00:48:42.370" style="s2">you week and and it&#39;s also the</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.970" end="00:48:45.370" style="s2">collective but it put it this way the</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.370" end="00:48:47.500" style="s2">the reason why individualism is so</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.370" end="00:48:49.240" style="s2">important is because it&#39;s arguably it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.500" end="00:48:51.130" style="s2">the only way we have positive change we</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.240" end="00:48:53.620" style="s2">changed first of all we get better one</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.130" end="00:48:56.350" style="s2">by one and then when when one gets</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.620" end="00:48:57.700" style="s2">better then they they they they help</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.350" end="00:48:59.410" style="s2">everybody else get better simply by</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.700" end="00:49:02.140" style="s2">getting better and that&#39;s kind of what</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.410" end="00:49:03.430" style="s2">individualism is the the the the</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.140" end="00:49:05.830" style="s2">individual getting his act together</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.430" end="00:49:07.630" style="s2">health is is beneficial to everybody</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.830" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">else and this is the principle of</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.630" end="00:49:11.920" style="s2">individual beautiful thing but there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:15.340" style="s2">collective side of the individual which</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.920" end="00:49:17.740" style="s2">is that you know you know the Annie and</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.340" end="00:49:20.260" style="s2">Peterson for example knows this but he</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.740" end="00:49:22.270" style="s2">he he does he he</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.260" end="00:49:23.860" style="s2">he&#39;s not in the zone where he can</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.270" end="00:49:26.230" style="s2">properly articulate not maybe nobody can</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.860" end="00:49:29.440" style="s2">articulate it but I I was I will go as</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.230" end="00:49:31.210" style="s2">far as to say you cannot have an</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.440" end="00:49:33.550" style="s2">individual without a small group to</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.210" end="00:49:37.750" style="s2">support the individual and in other</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.550" end="00:49:40.030" style="s2">words there&#39;s a conversation between the</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.750" end="00:49:43.180" style="s2">individual and the small group and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.030" end="00:49:45.640" style="s2">ultimately is it in other words we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.180" end="00:49:47.650" style="s2">really have a conversation with the</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.640" end="00:49:49.390" style="s2">collective that&#39;s actually kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.650" end="00:49:52.450" style="s2">load of that there&#39;s something false</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.390" end="00:49:54.460" style="s2">about that yeah we actually only ever</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.450" end="00:49:56.230" style="s2">have a small conversation with a small</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.460" end="00:49:58.450" style="s2">group now we can have many small groups</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.230" end="00:50:00.910" style="s2">and we can have imaginary conversations</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.450" end="00:50:03.970" style="s2">with small groups of you know people we</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.910" end="00:50:06.130" style="s2">imagine there&#39;s all but basically with</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.970" end="00:50:07.810" style="s2">the collective is the small group and</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.130" end="00:50:10.120" style="s2">then there&#39;s and then the larger</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.810" end="00:50:13.000" style="s2">collective the the the the morass of</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.120" end="00:50:14.260" style="s2">countless people is basically can is</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.000" end="00:50:16.870" style="s2">best thought of as a relationship</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.260" end="00:50:19.180" style="s2">between small groups so is art the</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.870" end="00:50:20.950" style="s2">society you live in if you think of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.180" end="00:50:22.300" style="s2">society you live in as a bunch of small</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.950" end="00:50:25.840" style="s2">groups then it suddenly becomes way more</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.300" end="00:50:28.420" style="s2">coherent and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the real</p>

<p begin="00:51:00.910" end="00:51:05.680" style="s2">sustaining him in a sense so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.770" end="00:51:11.920" style="s2">well I mean in many ways this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.680" end="00:51:13.860" style="s2">is a in many ways for me this is a like</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.920" end="00:51:17.320" style="s2">David fuller is kind of basically saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.860" end="00:51:19.900" style="s2">we need a we need to flesh out the left</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.320" end="00:51:22.120" style="s2">side at the left wing side of this yes</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.900" end="00:51:23.410" style="s2">what he seems to be saying and and so</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.120" end="00:51:24.790" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of more interested in many ways</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.410" end="00:51:26.890" style="s2">and what David Fuller&#39;s up there because</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.790" end="00:51:28.450" style="s2">that he understands that there&#39;s a lack</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.890" end="00:51:30.280" style="s2">there&#39;s a little there&#39;s a nap there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.450" end="00:51:32.380" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there yeah so I&#39;d like to</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.280" end="00:51:33.280" style="s2">push that idea and we could try and we</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.380" end="00:51:35.650" style="s2">can work on it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.280" end="00:51:38.320" style="s2">we can work kind of more in later time</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.650" end="00:51:40.390" style="s2">and really trying and and Thresh it out</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.320" end="00:51:43.210" style="s2">as much as possible I also believe that</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.390" end="00:51:47.530" style="s2">that like I said the small group is kind</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.210" end="00:51:50.380" style="s2">of but would to repeat what I said</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.530" end="00:51:52.000" style="s2">earlier on the person and the individual</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.380" end="00:51:53.680" style="s2">are two sides are the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.000" end="00:51:55.960" style="s2">the person is arguably the female</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.680" end="00:51:58.480" style="s2">dimension of the individual they&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.960" end="00:52:00.850" style="s2">of and the individual the undivided self</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.480" end="00:52:03.820" style="s2">yeah this is the positive side the the</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.850" end="00:52:05.440" style="s2">person a person is defined by small</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.820" end="00:52:09.610" style="s2">groups a person is an interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:52:05.440" end="00:52:11.950" style="s2">process that&#39;s so it you cannot think of</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.610" end="00:52:14.140" style="s2">personhood without the interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.950" end="00:52:17.950" style="s2">process that in that envelops the person</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.140" end="00:52:20.170" style="s2">and so and this this I believe is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.950" end="00:52:23.080" style="s2">fundamentally feminine I think and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.170" end="00:52:26.500" style="s2">in its in its in its definition and the</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.080" end="00:52:28.150" style="s2">male the undivided self is is something</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.500" end="00:52:29.830" style="s2">much more mysterious it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.150" end="00:52:32.800" style="s2">spiritual or something it&#39;s unto be</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.830" end="00:52:35.020" style="s2">undivided it&#39;s a you know you come down</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.800" end="00:52:38.170" style="s2">from the mountain there&#39;s undivided this</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.020" end="00:52:41.020" style="s2">undivided soul this individual it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.170" end="00:52:44.530" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s the maleness the</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.020" end="00:52:45.880" style="s2">sovereignty of the individual is is of</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.530" end="00:52:47.470" style="s2">course there&#39;s a there&#39;s a sense in</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.880" end="00:52:49.600" style="s2">which a person and an individual come</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.470" end="00:52:51.130" style="s2">together they&#39;re an identity but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.600" end="00:52:53.470" style="s2">also a sense in which they have</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.130" end="00:52:56.110" style="s2">different origins and one it seems comes</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.470" end="00:52:58.810" style="s2">a person comes up from the bottom and in</p>
<p begin="00:52:56.110" end="00:53:00.400" style="s2">a and an individual some somehow comes</p>
<p begin="00:52:58.810" end="00:53:03.700" style="s2">down from above or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:00.400" end="00:53:05.560" style="s2">and so these are yeah I&#39;d like to talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.700" end="00:53:06.820" style="s2">about that and we can that would be a</p>

<p begin="00:53:06.820" end="00:53:10.840" style="s2">interesting one I think and and struggle</p>
