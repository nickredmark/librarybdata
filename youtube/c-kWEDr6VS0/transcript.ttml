<p begin="00:00:19.350" end="00:00:28.919" style="s2">hello everyone apologies for the delay I</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.330" end="00:00:33.770" style="s2">hope this is all working I&#39;m taking</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.919" end="00:00:38.730" style="s2">questions from patreon people today so</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.770" end="00:00:41.750" style="s2">there&#39;s 841 questions ready to go so</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.730" end="00:00:41.750" style="s2">hopefully I&#39;m up to this</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.670" end="00:00:48.989" style="s2">what should teaching and research in the</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.230" end="00:00:51.360" style="s2">humanities look like I&#39;m going to grad</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.989" end="00:00:55.579" style="s2">school for literature and I don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.360" end="00:00:55.579" style="s2">my work to serve ideological possession</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.719" end="00:01:08.250" style="s2">well the thing is first of all is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.080" end="00:01:11.520" style="s2">you kind of have to educate yourself</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.250" end="00:01:14.700" style="s2">when you go to graduate school you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.520" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">you have your courses but I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.700" end="00:01:20.100" style="s2">that you learn more than about 10% of</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.649" style="s2">what graduate school can teach you by</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.100" end="00:01:24.899" style="s2">taking the courses you have to read and</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.649" end="00:01:27.030" style="s2">the mistake that most people read is</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.899" end="00:01:29.430" style="s2">make is that they only read what&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.030" end="00:01:31.399" style="s2">published in the last five or six years</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.430" end="00:01:35.179" style="s2">in their own narrow field and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.399" end="00:01:38.130" style="s2">increasingly a bad idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.179" end="00:01:43.380" style="s2">the libraries are full of classic books</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.130" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">and I would say take your field go back</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.380" end="00:01:47.850" style="s2">to the beginning of the field at least</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:50.690" style="s2">read the people who wrote the classic</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.850" end="00:01:53.250" style="s2">works bring yourself up to date and then</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.690" end="00:01:56.789" style="s2">familiarize yourself with as much</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.250" end="00:01:58.470" style="s2">history as much history of art as much</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.789" end="00:02:01.020" style="s2">history of literature and literature as</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.470" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">you can possibly manage you want to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.020" end="00:02:05.130" style="s2">learn as much as you can about</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.880" end="00:02:06.599" style="s2">everything I would also say you have two</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.130" end="00:02:07.890" style="s2">li that with a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.599" end="00:02:09.989" style="s2">specialization you have to pick one</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.890" end="00:02:12.239" style="s2">topic and really become expert at it but</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.989" end="00:02:13.800" style="s2">it&#39;ll serve as a doorway to because</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.239" end="00:02:17.280" style="s2">everything&#39;s connected it&#39;ll serve as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.800" end="00:02:20.069" style="s2">doorway to what&#39;s behind it so you focus</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.280" end="00:02:21.840" style="s2">on one thing and read as much as you can</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.069" end="00:02:24.060" style="s2">on that that&#39;s your specific discipline</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.840" end="00:02:26.010" style="s2">then outside of that read as widely as</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.060" end="00:02:27.629" style="s2">you possibly can manage the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.010" end="00:02:29.069" style="s2">I would really recommend and this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.629" end="00:02:32.700" style="s2">also true if you&#39;re going to university</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.069" end="00:02:34.140" style="s2">is it isn&#39;t enough to read you also have</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.700" end="00:02:35.340" style="s2">to write and if you&#39;re gonna go to</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.140" end="00:02:38.340" style="s2">graduate school you should write</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.340" end="00:02:39.239" style="s2">everyday it&#39;s a good idea for anyone who</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.340" end="00:02:41.610" style="s2">wants to develop themselves</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.239" end="00:02:43.080" style="s2">intellectually but even half an hour a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.610" end="00:02:44.940" style="s2">day you know that&#39;s a hundred and eighty</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.080" end="00:02:47.220" style="s2">hours a year that&#39;s a lot of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.940" end="00:02:49.349" style="s2">because writing is thinking and you</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.220" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">should be writing out your understanding</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.349" end="00:02:54.000" style="s2">of what you wrote or what you read and</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.220" style="s2">the questions you have about it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.000" end="00:02:58.349" style="s2">trying to formulate what you regard as</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.220" end="00:03:02.580" style="s2">clear questions and problems and also</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.349" end="00:03:03.870" style="s2">clear answers both of those and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.580" end="00:03:08.609" style="s2">how I would say you should approach</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.870" end="00:03:10.799" style="s2">graduate school have you thought about</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.609" end="00:03:12.060" style="s2">slowing down there are people worried</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.799" end="00:03:13.020" style="s2">about how hard you&#39;re pushing yourself</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.060" end="00:03:16.440" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.020" end="00:03:18.300" style="s2">the countless commitments yes well I</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.440" end="00:03:21.630" style="s2">would say that those people worried</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.300" end="00:03:24.180" style="s2">about that include I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.630" end="00:03:26.910" style="s2">me but certainly my family they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.180" end="00:03:29.130" style="s2">worried about it but I&#39;m putting</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.910" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">competent people around me increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.130" end="00:03:33.660" style="s2">to handle the scheduling of the public</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:38.670" style="s2">events for example and I have good</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.660" end="00:03:41.460" style="s2">agents and a good publisher and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.670" end="00:03:43.920" style="s2">learning how to manage this I think I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.460" end="00:03:45.480" style="s2">I&#39;m not really interested I suppose and</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.920" end="00:03:49.200" style="s2">slowing down although it has been a bit</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.480" end="00:03:51.600" style="s2">much in the last year and a half I I do</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.200" end="00:03:57.750" style="s2">better in some ways when I&#39;m working</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.600" end="00:03:59.850" style="s2">flat out if my health was good it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.750" end="00:04:02.220" style="s2">better than it was by a large margin and</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.850" end="00:04:03.720" style="s2">maybe it&#39;s still getting better if my</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.220" end="00:04:08.250" style="s2">health was good this none of this would</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.720" end="00:04:09.750" style="s2">be an overwhelming challenge but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.250" end="00:04:11.400" style="s2">trying to do everything I can to put my</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.750" end="00:04:16.770" style="s2">health in order and many many things</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.400" end="00:04:18.930" style="s2">have been fixed so yeah I thought about</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.770" end="00:04:21.359" style="s2">slowing down but I&#39;ve decided against it</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.930" end="00:04:23.430" style="s2">I guess is really the final answer to</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.359" end="00:04:25.380" style="s2">that that&#39;s the other thing you know</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.430" end="00:04:27.890" style="s2">there are times in your life where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.380" end="00:04:30.630" style="s2">not time to slow down it&#39;s time to</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.890" end="00:04:33.060" style="s2">become more efficient that&#39;s the thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.630" end="00:04:35.010" style="s2">you can become so efficient you know you</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.060" end="00:04:37.140" style="s2">end up doing things in five minutes that</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.010" end="00:04:38.820" style="s2">would otherwise take you a week might</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.140" end="00:04:41.040" style="s2">that might seem like an exaggeration but</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.820" end="00:04:43.740" style="s2">and I suppose it is to some degree but</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.040" end="00:04:46.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not that much of an exaggeration so</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.740" end="00:04:48.150" style="s2">as you take on more responsibilities and</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.040" end="00:04:50.130" style="s2">you determine that you&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.150" end="00:04:56.460" style="s2">become more efficient the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.130" end="00:04:58.380" style="s2">pushes the efficiency so what do they</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.460" end="00:05:00.980" style="s2">say - there&#39;s time enough to sleep when</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.380" end="00:05:00.980" style="s2">you&#39;re in the grave</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.040" end="00:05:11.330" style="s2">many who respect your work feel your</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.020" end="00:05:14.270" style="s2">tweets are often impulsive or even</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:16.850" style="s2">expedient very funny in certain</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.270" end="00:05:20.390" style="s2">interactions would you consider a change</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.850" end="00:05:23.420" style="s2">in the way you tweet well I&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.390" end="00:05:24.920" style="s2">considering that for a very long time</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.420" end="00:05:27.260" style="s2">one of the things I did in the last</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.920" end="00:05:30.950" style="s2">month which that I think was productive</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.260" end="00:05:33.890" style="s2">Twitter&#39;s a hard dishearten to manage</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.950" end="00:05:37.820" style="s2">because it rewards impulsivity and I</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.890" end="00:05:42.410" style="s2">have somewhat of a temper and I suspect</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.820" end="00:05:50.890" style="s2">that it&#39;s maybe I&#39;m more susceptible to</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.410" end="00:05:50.890" style="s2">being to being tempted to respond in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.400" end="00:05:58.820" style="s2">too forceful manner maybe I&#39;m more</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.290" end="00:06:01.760" style="s2">tempted by that then I should be but</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.820" end="00:06:03.380" style="s2">Twitter is really useful I mean it does</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.760" end="00:06:06.440" style="s2">keep me updated with regards to the</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.380" end="00:06:09.920" style="s2">ongoing let&#39;s say war that&#39;s raging at</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.440" end="00:06:11.950" style="s2">the bottom of our culture and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.920" end="00:06:15.350" style="s2">able me to stay in contact with people</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.950" end="00:06:19.820" style="s2">at least to some degree and it&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.350" end="00:06:22.850" style="s2">way of communicating small but at least</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.820" end="00:06:25.970" style="s2">in principle important ideas and also to</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.850" end="00:06:28.490" style="s2">let people know about what I&#39;m doing on</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.970" end="00:06:33.200" style="s2">YouTube and with the tours and and all</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.490" end="00:06:34.880" style="s2">of that people seem to respond</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.200" end="00:06:38.030" style="s2">positively to those sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.880" end="00:06:41.450" style="s2">notifications so what I did do in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.030" end="00:06:43.160" style="s2">last month was to find people I tweeted</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.450" end="00:06:46.040" style="s2">out one day I asked people to send me</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.160" end="00:06:48.620" style="s2">the Twitter handles of organizations or</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.040" end="00:06:50.660" style="s2">individuals who were reporting on</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.620" end="00:06:53.420" style="s2">positive developments in a credible and</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.660" end="00:06:55.400" style="s2">realistic way human progress org seems</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.420" end="00:06:58.600" style="s2">to be doing that really well I thought</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.400" end="00:07:04.220" style="s2">it would be good to tilt my Twitter feed</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.600" end="00:07:08.240" style="s2">toward or to my Twitter actions towards</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.220" end="00:07:11.600" style="s2">things that are positive and also true</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.240" end="00:07:15.140" style="s2">as much as possible and so I&#39;ve started</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.600" end="00:07:17.320" style="s2">doing that in the last month I feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.140" end="00:07:23.890" style="s2">somewhat of an obligation</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.320" end="00:07:26.710" style="s2">- if I&#39;m being discussed publicly by</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.890" end="00:07:30.100" style="s2">journalists or or other professors and</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.710" end="00:07:32.560" style="s2">they misrepresent me or misrepresent the</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.100" end="00:07:34.150" style="s2">ideas that they&#39;re purporting to discuss</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.560" end="00:07:40.380" style="s2">then I feel like I have a moral</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.150" end="00:07:44.770" style="s2">obligation - I suppose one is to defend</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.380" end="00:07:47.860" style="s2">myself I suppose and certainly to object</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.770" end="00:07:50.110" style="s2">to the MIS utilization of ideas by my</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.349" end="00:08:46.000" style="s2">get tangled up in them so minimum</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.330" end="00:09:00.580" style="s2">them because otherwise they&#39;re not rules</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.900" end="00:09:04.030" style="s2">and so how do you enforce them with</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.580" end="00:09:06.880" style="s2">minimal necessary force and some of that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.030" end="00:09:08.530" style="s2">has to be played with you know and</p>

<p begin="00:09:22.240" end="00:09:26.840" style="s2">you know sometimes when I&#39;ve gone after</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.220" end="00:09:30.520" style="s2">people I went after a couple of</p>

<p begin="00:09:36.170" end="00:09:44.020" style="s2">that&#39;s a bad combination and you know it</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.640" end="00:09:46.580" style="s2">was kind of a harsh exchange I would say</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.020" end="00:09:47.860" style="s2">but it isn&#39;t clear that it was the wrong</p>

<p begin="00:10:11.030" end="00:10:18.980" style="s2">going on in the world so we have poverty</p>

<p begin="00:11:43.000" end="00:11:47.950" style="s2">was worthwhile to change the way that I</p>

<p begin="00:12:45.160" end="00:12:52.990" style="s2">identity in therapy that&#39;s paramount I</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.280" end="00:12:56.350" style="s2">mean in again in my book and in Chapter</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.990" end="00:12:58.260" style="s2">nine assume the person that you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:13:00.430" end="00:13:03.900" style="s2">maybe because you need to learn</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.050" end="00:13:09.880" style="s2">something because like what do you know</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.900" end="00:13:12.780" style="s2">in therapy I don&#39;t think that if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:14:59.050" end="00:15:04.450" style="s2">caused it and so you got to listen</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.840" end="00:15:05.980" style="s2">radically and clarify and ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.450" end="00:15:07.900" style="s2">and make sure you&#39;re not confused so</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.980" end="00:15:09.580" style="s2">that you do understand and maybe you can</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.900" end="00:15:12.520" style="s2">help the person start to understand what</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.580" end="00:15:15.070" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about or thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.520" end="00:15:18.940" style="s2">just talking in thinking are very much</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.070" end="00:15:20.890" style="s2">the same thing and then then well maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.940" end="00:15:22.600" style="s2">you get some sense of what&#39;s wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.890" end="00:15:24.550" style="s2">maybe some sense of how it came about</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.600" end="00:15:26.680" style="s2">god only knows how long that&#39;ll take</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.550" end="00:15:29.500" style="s2">and then the next thing you have to</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.680" end="00:15:30.070" style="s2">figure out is well what would a solution</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.500" end="00:15:32.470" style="s2">look like</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.070" end="00:15:34.900" style="s2">like even hypothetically what does the</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.470" end="00:15:36.100" style="s2">person want and and do they know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.900" end="00:15:37.420" style="s2">they want and if they don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.100" end="00:15:40.060" style="s2">they want then how can you help them</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.420" end="00:15:41.470" style="s2">figure out what they want and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.060" end="00:15:43.210" style="s2">help them figure out what they need and</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.470" end="00:15:45.520" style="s2">how do you help them admit to that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.210" end="00:15:48.520" style="s2">all of that and so that&#39;s a boatload of</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.520" end="00:15:50.290" style="s2">listening there again you know and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.520" end="00:15:52.210" style="s2">the same in every relationship that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.290" end="00:15:54.870" style="s2">have if you try to foster that person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.210" end="00:15:58.270" style="s2">development you want to find out well</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.870" end="00:15:59.650" style="s2">what&#39;s wrong in their lives and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.270" end="00:16:02.050" style="s2">but they have to figure that out because</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.650" end="00:16:02.890" style="s2">they&#39;re the ones that they&#39;re the ones</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.050" end="00:16:05.350" style="s2">that will have to bear the</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.890" end="00:16:06.310" style="s2">responsibility for the decisions so you</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.350" end="00:16:07.840" style="s2">don&#39;t want to take that onto yourself</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.310" end="00:16:09.970" style="s2">it&#39;s like well I don&#39;t want to tell you</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.840" end="00:16:12.760" style="s2">what to do because I don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.970" end="00:16:16.630" style="s2">should do like we can both agree that</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.760" end="00:16:18.610" style="s2">you should move toward what&#39;s better for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.630" end="00:16:20.170" style="s2">you and hopefully for the people around</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.610" end="00:16:21.640" style="s2">you because we would include that in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.170" end="00:16:24.310" style="s2">definition of better right because</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.640" end="00:16:25.840" style="s2">otherwise it&#39;s not sustainable but we</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.310" end="00:16:28.720" style="s2">have to talk forever to find out what</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.840" end="00:16:34.350" style="s2">that is and you have to be you have to</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.720" end="00:16:39.610" style="s2">be very incautious to think that you can</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.350" end="00:16:41.380" style="s2">make decisions for someone it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.610" end="00:16:43.930" style="s2">arrogant move and it&#39;s an ill-advised</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.380" end="00:16:46.090" style="s2">move and you shouldn&#39;t do it if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.930" end="00:16:49.300" style="s2">properly terrified of your errors</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.090" end="00:16:50.860" style="s2">because well again I&#39;ll repeat</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.300" end="00:16:52.720" style="s2">you&#39;re not the one that&#39;s going to have</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.860" end="00:16:55.300" style="s2">to take responsibility for the decisions</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.720" end="00:17:04.570" style="s2">they are so it has to be left in their</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.300" end="00:17:07.060" style="s2">hands and so so autonomy it&#39;s everything</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.570" end="00:17:08.800" style="s2">in a clinical practice no that doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.060" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">mean that you can&#39;t help a person</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.800" end="00:17:15.010" style="s2">strategize you know you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:18.640" style="s2">as you&#39;re moving towards some</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.010" end="00:17:20.650" style="s2">formulation of the problem you might say</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.640" end="00:17:22.450" style="s2">well here&#39;s five things that it might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.650" end="00:17:24.550" style="s2">or here&#39;s a list of things that might be</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.450" end="00:17:28.300" style="s2">bothering you or you know you can make</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.550" end="00:17:30.250" style="s2">suggestions but they can&#39;t be baited</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.300" end="00:17:32.710" style="s2">suggestions either you can&#39;t overweight</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.250" end="00:17:35.380" style="s2">the one you hope they&#39;ll choose you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.710" end="00:17:38.410" style="s2">again it&#39;s it&#39;s incautious a lot of this</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.380" end="00:17:39.790" style="s2">I would say I learned well from thinking</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:41.650" style="s2">about it but also from reading Carl</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.790" end="00:17:43.690" style="s2">Rogers I&#39;d really recommend Carl Rogers</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.650" end="00:17:45.460" style="s2">you know he was a smart guy when it came</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.690" end="00:17:47.770" style="s2">to listening you can really learn a lot</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.460" end="00:17:50.620" style="s2">from and and he was also smart in how we</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.770" end="00:17:52.120" style="s2">outlined the clients need for autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.620" end="00:18:01.750" style="s2">development and that&#39;s the development</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.120" end="00:18:03.280" style="s2">of the individual so any update on your</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.750" end="00:18:06.700" style="s2">plans to start providing independent</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.280" end="00:18:08.350" style="s2">classes or an online university well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.700" end="00:18:09.820" style="s2">working with some young people right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.350" end="00:18:11.740" style="s2">who are very very smart and the first</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.820" end="00:18:12.550" style="s2">thing we&#39;re we&#39;re gonna build modules by</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.740" end="00:18:15.300" style="s2">the looks of things</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.550" end="00:18:17.500" style="s2">each module hopefully will stand alone</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.300" end="00:18:19.090" style="s2">because then we can test them instead of</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.500" end="00:18:21.130" style="s2">launching like a whole University which</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.090" end="00:18:22.780" style="s2">seems to be a crazy thing to do we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.130" end="00:18:24.340" style="s2">gonna make independent modules for</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.780" end="00:18:27.700" style="s2">different purposes and then launch them</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.340" end="00:18:29.950" style="s2">probably as quasi independent products</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.700" end="00:18:31.660" style="s2">let&#39;s say to see if there&#39;s a demand for</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.950" end="00:18:33.700" style="s2">them so the one we&#39;re working right now</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.660" end="00:18:35.740" style="s2">on right now and I&#39;m not gonna say too</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.700" end="00:18:37.840" style="s2">much about it is a competitive writing</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.740" end="00:18:41.350" style="s2">module where you&#39;ll be able to look at</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.840" end="00:18:43.870" style="s2">paragraphs and paragraphs that other</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.350" end="00:18:46.240" style="s2">people have written of a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.870" end="00:18:50.230" style="s2">sorts now I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.240" end="00:18:51.520" style="s2">about that I better wait so anyways</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:18:53.980" style="s2">we&#39;re going to write a competitive</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.520" end="00:18:55.570" style="s2">writing module and because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.980" end="00:18:56.950" style="s2">big problems the biggest problems that</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.570" end="00:18:58.630" style="s2">has to be solved for any online</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.950" end="00:18:59.680" style="s2">university is how do you teach people to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.630" end="00:19:01.150" style="s2">write because you don&#39;t want the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.680" end="00:19:03.160" style="s2">university just to be lectures and</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.150" end="00:19:05.790" style="s2">multiple-choice tests even though</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.160" end="00:19:09.490" style="s2">that could be done with some degree of</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.790" end="00:19:11.410" style="s2">reasonable competence mostly what you</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.490" end="00:19:14.880" style="s2">want when you educate people is to</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.410" end="00:19:18.070" style="s2">educate them not so much into like</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.880" end="00:19:20.260" style="s2">factual knowledge but intellectual skill</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.070" end="00:19:22.090" style="s2">they have to be able to speak so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.260" end="00:19:24.370" style="s2">need a speaking module and they have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.090" end="00:19:27.370" style="s2">be able to think and we&#39;ll have to</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.370" end="00:19:29.170" style="s2">develop exercises that are relevant to</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.370" end="00:19:33.610" style="s2">critical thinking writing is a big part</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.170" end="00:19:37.330" style="s2">of that so and they have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.610" end="00:19:39.610" style="s2">read and so those are the big problems</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.330" end="00:19:41.470" style="s2">to solve and then the other problem for</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.610" end="00:19:42.940" style="s2">an online university is accreditation</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.470" end="00:19:46.180" style="s2">obviously we&#39;ve got some ideas about</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.940" end="00:19:47.710" style="s2">that and also what you do with regards</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.180" end="00:19:50.470" style="s2">to the social element because that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.710" end="00:19:55.090" style="s2">huge part of university is to develop an</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.470" end="00:19:56.740" style="s2">intellectual peer group right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.090" end="00:19:58.440" style="s2">really an important part in you it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.740" end="00:20:00.880" style="s2">going to be easy to replace that online</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.440" end="00:20:03.310" style="s2">because you know the relationships that</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.880" end="00:20:05.500" style="s2">people make in college often last well</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.310" end="00:20:07.710" style="s2">they can last for decades or maybe they</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.500" end="00:20:10.990" style="s2">can last a lifetime for that matter but</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.710" end="00:20:13.150" style="s2">it&#39;s a place where you can eliezer adult</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.990" end="00:20:16.060" style="s2">identity and the peers that you pick are</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.150" end="00:20:17.230" style="s2">a big part of that of course some of the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.060" end="00:20:18.970" style="s2">peers that you pick when you go to</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.230" end="00:20:23.290" style="s2">university should be the great people of</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.970" end="00:20:24.970" style="s2">the past that&#39;s really what university</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.290" end="00:20:26.410" style="s2">is for is to make them in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.970" end="00:20:27.940" style="s2">your peers now that you know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.410" end="00:20:32.080" style="s2">pushing it because you have to do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.940" end="00:20:34.270" style="s2">of work before they become peers anyways</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.080" end="00:20:37.510" style="s2">we&#39;re definitely working on this um the</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.270" end="00:20:43.120" style="s2">part of the problem is is that I&#39;m it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.510" end="00:20:45.490" style="s2">hard it&#39;s what&#39;s the problem I&#39;m doing</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.120" end="00:20:47.230" style="s2">enough other things at the moment so</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.490" end="00:20:49.780" style="s2">that finding the time to do this</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.230" end="00:20:58.660" style="s2">credibly in addition is one of the major</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.780" end="00:21:01.390" style="s2">challenges so I married young and have</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.660" end="00:21:03.310" style="s2">had only one sexual partner now I desire</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.390" end="00:21:05.620" style="s2">variety but value my marriage and will</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.310" end="00:21:08.830" style="s2">not cheat any insight and overcoming</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.620" end="00:21:12.790" style="s2">this conflict as a matter of fact yes I</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.830" end="00:21:16.670" style="s2">would say get the variety with your</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.790" end="00:21:20.100" style="s2">partner you know there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.670" end="00:21:24.390" style="s2">games you can play to spice up your</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.100" end="00:21:27.690" style="s2">sexual life you know buy some lingerie</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.390" end="00:21:30.150" style="s2">like buy a hundred pieces you know buy</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.690" end="00:21:34.980" style="s2">something sexy for your partner to wear</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.150" end="00:21:37.110" style="s2">maybe multiple things buy some buy</p>

<p begin="00:21:39.870" end="00:21:44.730" style="s2">to introduce that spirit of pretend play</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.020" end="00:21:47.580" style="s2">that you had when you were a little kid</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.730" end="00:21:53.820" style="s2">into your sexual life and then you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.580" end="00:21:55.850" style="s2">many partners in the same person and you</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.820" end="00:22:00.150" style="s2">put some thought into it you know I mean</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.850" end="00:22:01.710" style="s2">sex is something that that sex is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.150" end="00:22:03.890" style="s2">domain in which expertise can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.710" end="00:22:07.020" style="s2">developed just like any other domain and</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.890" end="00:22:10.050" style="s2">some of that&#39;s play and fantasy play and</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.020" end="00:22:15.480" style="s2">all of that and some of its sexual</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.050" end="00:22:18.120" style="s2">technique and and I guess then the other</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.480" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">thing I would say is take stock of each</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.120" end="00:22:23.880" style="s2">other and see if there are things that</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:25.470" style="s2">you could do in your life that would</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.880" end="00:22:27.480" style="s2">make you more attractive to one another</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.470" end="00:22:29.070" style="s2">you know those are hard questions</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.480" end="00:22:31.170" style="s2">because no one wants to say well you</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.070" end="00:22:35.370" style="s2">know I&#39;d be more attracted to my wife</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.170" end="00:22:37.500" style="s2">sexually if she just acted xwy and the</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.370" end="00:22:40.050" style="s2">same with regards to how a wife&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.500" end="00:22:42.600" style="s2">contemplation of her husband but those</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.050" end="00:22:44.910" style="s2">are the real questions man it&#39;s like if</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.600" end="00:22:49.080" style="s2">your partner isn&#39;t acting in a manner</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.910" end="00:22:50.520" style="s2">that is sexually attractive then either</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.080" end="00:22:51.930" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with you or</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.520" end="00:22:54.030" style="s2">there&#39;s something wrong with them and of</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.930" end="00:22:55.530" style="s2">course I know people have ill health and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.030" end="00:22:58.110" style="s2">all of that I&#39;m not talking about that</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.530" end="00:23:00.150" style="s2">but those harsh judgments that your</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.110" end="00:23:01.830" style="s2">sexual attraction makes are also very</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.150" end="00:23:04.280" style="s2">useful ways of orienting yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.830" end="00:23:10.590" style="s2">towards proper behavior in the world</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.280" end="00:23:12.600" style="s2">so I would say any insight and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.590" end="00:23:14.610" style="s2">overcoming this conflict now I desire a</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.600" end="00:23:18.510" style="s2">variety but I value my marriage and will</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.610" end="00:23:22.500" style="s2">not cheat well admit to the variety that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.510" end="00:23:24.360" style="s2">you want and see to what degree you can</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.500" end="00:23:26.400" style="s2">fulfill that within the confines of the</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.360" end="00:23:28.440" style="s2">marriage it&#39;s also part of coming into</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.400" end="00:23:29.220" style="s2">contact with the shadow I would say if</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.440" end="00:23:31.260" style="s2">you want to look at it</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.220" end="00:23:34.770" style="s2">a union perspective you might have all</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.260" end="00:23:37.710" style="s2">sorts of sexual desires that are that</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.770" end="00:23:41.270" style="s2">part of you feels should remain taboo</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.710" end="00:23:44.190" style="s2">and maybe they should I&#39;m not suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.270" end="00:23:46.260" style="s2">absolute sexually libertine behavior an</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.190" end="00:23:50.610" style="s2">old sexuality has to be regulated very</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.260" end="00:23:53.610" style="s2">carefully but you might be able to push</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.610" end="00:23:55.860" style="s2">yourself with some time and effort and</p>
<p begin="00:23:53.610" end="00:23:59.370" style="s2">contemplation and some admission of</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.860" end="00:24:02.909" style="s2">fantasy and all of that into domains of</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.370" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">sexual satisfaction that you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.909" end="00:24:06.320" style="s2">achieved before</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.410" end="00:24:31.970" style="s2">why do I not discuss religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.870" end="00:24:34.070" style="s2">fundamentalism more often and more in</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.970" end="00:24:37.240" style="s2">depth many people consider you a</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.070" end="00:24:40.460" style="s2">religious apologist as a consequence</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.240" end="00:24:42.350" style="s2">well it&#39;s okay if people consider me a</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.460" end="00:24:45.260" style="s2">religious apologist I am a religious</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.350" end="00:24:48.110" style="s2">apologist so an apologist is someone who</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.260" end="00:24:49.940" style="s2">makes an argument for something and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.110" end="00:24:52.040" style="s2">constantly making arguments for a</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.940" end="00:24:56.450" style="s2">religious perspective on life a</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.040" end="00:24:58.460" style="s2">religious orientation towards life an</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.450" end="00:25:01.400" style="s2">orientation that&#39;s centered in in</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.460" end="00:25:04.100" style="s2">meaning an orientation that&#39;s centered</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.400" end="00:25:07.720" style="s2">in desire for all things to thrive</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.100" end="00:25:10.700" style="s2">insofar as that&#39;s possible a desire for</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.720" end="00:25:13.430" style="s2">people to speak the truth and act out</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.700" end="00:25:16.430" style="s2">the truth and act responsibility act</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.430" end="00:25:17.800" style="s2">responsibly and all of that and I think</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.430" end="00:25:20.240" style="s2">that there&#39;s something something</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.800" end="00:25:22.010" style="s2">transcendently necessary about all of</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.240" end="00:25:27.140" style="s2">that and I think it is the antidote to</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.010" end="00:25:30.920" style="s2">hell so that that makes me a religious</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.140" end="00:25:32.570" style="s2">apologist the fundamentalists I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.920" end="00:25:34.190" style="s2">know which fundamentalists you mean if</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.570" end="00:25:36.680" style="s2">you mean the Christian fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.190" end="00:25:44.270" style="s2">well I understand where they&#39;re coming</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.680" end="00:25:46.370" style="s2">from you know the Christian Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.270" end="00:25:49.820" style="s2">is an ethical framework above all else</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.370" end="00:25:52.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s predicated in a story about the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.820" end="00:25:55.880" style="s2">way the world is constituted and and the</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.880" end="00:25:58.490" style="s2">story provides the foundation for that</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.880" end="00:26:00.560" style="s2">ethic and the ethic unites the community</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.490" end="00:26:04.310" style="s2">and gives people direction this is a big</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.560" end="00:26:05.990" style="s2">deal now if the story is challenged if</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.310" end="00:26:07.400" style="s2">the foundational story is challenged</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.990" end="00:26:09.110" style="s2">which is certainly what happened as a</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.400" end="00:26:11.720" style="s2">consequence of the rise of empirical</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.110" end="00:26:17.180" style="s2">science then the foundation for the</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.720" end="00:26:20.240" style="s2">ethic starts to starts to shake and</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.180" end="00:26:21.710" style="s2">tremble and that threatens the ethic but</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.240" end="00:26:24.200" style="s2">the ethic is what holds people together</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.710" end="00:26:25.820" style="s2">and gives them direction so you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.200" end="00:26:27.290" style="s2">just lose the ethic so the</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.820" end="00:26:29.300" style="s2">fundamentalist Christians are all</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.290" end="00:26:32.090" style="s2">short-circuited because they know that</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.300" end="00:26:34.460" style="s2">there&#39;s something to the ethic and they</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.090" end="00:26:36.740" style="s2">understand that the foundation has been</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.460" end="00:26:37.220" style="s2">shaken but they don&#39;t know what to do</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.740" end="00:26:40.100" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.220" end="00:26:41.310" style="s2">so they insist that the foundation has</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.100" end="00:26:46.290" style="s2">not been shaken</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.310" end="00:26:50.760" style="s2">and I understand that so I think the way</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.290" end="00:26:53.580" style="s2">out of that is to understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.760" end="00:26:55.350" style="s2">truth that govern ethics and the truths</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.580" end="00:26:58.140" style="s2">that govern the description of the world</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.350" end="00:27:01.260" style="s2">as a material place are not the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.140" end="00:27:05.160" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not they&#39;re not of</p>

<p begin="00:27:05.160" end="00:27:08.970" style="s2">not exactly sure but there&#39;s no simple</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.110" end="00:27:12.930" style="s2">one-to-one relationships you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.970" end="00:27:15.030" style="s2">describe the world and then immediately</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.930" end="00:27:16.440" style="s2">extract out an ethic it&#39;s partly because</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.030" end="00:27:19.430" style="s2">there are just too many ways of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.440" end="00:27:22.050" style="s2">describing the world so and this is the</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.430" end="00:27:24.600" style="s2">the fundamental point of difference as</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.050" end="00:27:26.130" style="s2">far as I can tell between sam harris and</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.600" end="00:27:30.660" style="s2">i and hopefully what we&#39;ll discuss in</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.130" end="00:27:32.340" style="s2">the summer so so that&#39;s the christian</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.660" end="00:27:33.990" style="s2">fundamentalists and i don&#39;t really see</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.340" end="00:27:35.780" style="s2">that they&#39;re a particularly threatening</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.990" end="00:27:38.280" style="s2">group as far as i can tell i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.780" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">they&#39;re certainly not in the ascendance</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.280" end="00:27:41.360" style="s2">by any stretch of the imagination</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.900" end="00:27:46.470" style="s2">they&#39;re not involved in any particularly</p>

<p begin="00:29:25.860" end="00:29:31.260" style="s2">the problem of the current proclivity of</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.740" end="00:29:33.630" style="s2">the extreme end of the Muslim</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.260" end="00:29:38.990" style="s2">fundamentalist world to become to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.630" end="00:29:41.279" style="s2">very violent in very many ways and so</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.990" end="00:29:44.029" style="s2">you know what I&#39;m not a great admirer of</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.279" end="00:29:47.520" style="s2">the Saudis to say the least I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.029" end="00:29:52.950" style="s2">appreciate their brand of of Wahhabi</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.520" end="00:29:55.950" style="s2">Islam and I don&#39;t appreciate their</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.950" end="00:29:59.600" style="s2">exporting of that view with their petrol</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.950" end="00:30:01.730" style="s2">dollars to the rest of the world so I</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.600" end="00:30:06.990" style="s2">guess that&#39;s what I have to say about</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.730" end="00:30:08.610" style="s2">fundamentalists hello dr. Peterson I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.990" end="00:30:10.380" style="s2">been trying to listen to my conscience</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.610" end="00:30:12.809" style="s2">but I can&#39;t tell the difference between</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.380" end="00:30:15.240" style="s2">fear willful blindness or genuine</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.809" end="00:30:17.159" style="s2">conscience well the first thing I would</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.240" end="00:30:18.899" style="s2">say about that is it is quite clear that</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.159" end="00:30:20.669" style="s2">you are in fact trying to listen to your</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.899" end="00:30:22.770" style="s2">conscience because that&#39;s probably the</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.669" end="00:30:27.049" style="s2">first thing that you discover so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.770" end="00:30:27.049" style="s2">a really good question okay</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.520" end="00:30:36.230" style="s2">fear well here&#39;s a test and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.210" end="00:30:36.230" style="s2">want to do this stupidly</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.289" end="00:30:41.370" style="s2">if you think that you should do</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.700" end="00:30:43.110" style="s2">something and you think that the reason</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.370" end="00:30:47.640" style="s2">you might not be doing it is because</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.110" end="00:30:50.570" style="s2">you&#39;re afraid then you should do it so</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.640" end="00:30:52.860" style="s2">that way you can find out if it&#39;s fear</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.570" end="00:30:54.659" style="s2">you know I think your question is well</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.860" end="00:30:56.309" style="s2">hi do I know my conscience isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.659" end="00:30:58.620" style="s2">masquerading as fear saying well you</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.309" end="00:31:00.779" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t do that but it&#39;s rationalizing</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.620" end="00:31:05.100" style="s2">the real issue which is you&#39;re afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.779" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">doing that yeah see here&#39;s a reason that</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.100" end="00:31:08.740" style="s2">you want to tell the truth and I part I</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:10.840" style="s2">kind of figured this out when I</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.740" end="00:31:13.390" style="s2">looking deeply into the Pinocchio story</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.840" end="00:31:15.640" style="s2">you know in Pinocchio as Pinocchio</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.390" end="00:31:18.040" style="s2">strives to become real he he has a</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.640" end="00:31:20.559" style="s2">conscience to guide him but it&#39;s Jiminy</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.040" end="00:31:22.210" style="s2">Cricket this insect but jiminy isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.559" end="00:31:24.130" style="s2">really a very good conscience he&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.210" end="00:31:28.270" style="s2">dogmatic to begin with dogmatic and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.130" end="00:31:31.570" style="s2">inexperienced and so it&#39;s it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.270" end="00:31:35.250" style="s2">the conscience is an unerring guide it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.570" end="00:31:37.960" style="s2">like a partner in discovery and as you</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.250" end="00:31:39.670" style="s2">move forward in your life and you</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.960" end="00:31:43.830" style="s2">consult your conscience and you listen</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.670" end="00:31:46.809" style="s2">to it then it gets smarter and so do you</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.830" end="00:31:49.630" style="s2">but there&#39;s a coda there and this is why</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.809" end="00:31:51.340" style="s2">I&#39;ve suggested part of the reason why</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.630" end="00:31:54.400" style="s2">I&#39;ve suggested so frequently in my</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.340" end="00:31:57.280" style="s2">lectures and in my book that people try</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.400" end="00:31:59.140" style="s2">not to lie you see there are many</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.280" end="00:32:03.490" style="s2">systems you have many systems within</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.140" end="00:32:05.050" style="s2">let&#39;s say that guide you and what one of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.490" end="00:32:06.340" style="s2">those is your capacity for rational</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.050" end="00:32:08.170" style="s2">thought and then you have a variety of</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.340" end="00:32:11.010" style="s2">emotional systems and motivational</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.170" end="00:32:13.900" style="s2">systems and internal dramas and</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.010" end="00:32:16.630" style="s2">intuitions and bodily sensations like</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.900" end="00:32:20.500" style="s2">lots and lots of and senses lots of</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.630" end="00:32:24.600" style="s2">systems that are guiding you and many of</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.500" end="00:32:28.809" style="s2">them operate you might say unconsciously</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.600" end="00:32:33.160" style="s2">autonomously instinctively implicitly</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.809" end="00:32:35.679" style="s2">all of that now you nonetheless you</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.160" end="00:32:37.750" style="s2">program them like you feed them content</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.679" end="00:32:40.390" style="s2">let&#39;s say just like you feed your body</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.750" end="00:32:42.300" style="s2">nourishment you feed them content and a</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.390" end="00:32:45.280" style="s2">lot of the content that you feed them</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.300" end="00:32:47.410" style="s2">pertains directly to your voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.280" end="00:32:49.960" style="s2">thoughts and speech and your actions and</p>
<p begin="00:32:47.410" end="00:32:52.300" style="s2">then if you pathologies those by lying</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.960" end="00:32:54.040" style="s2">so if you say things that you know not</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.300" end="00:32:55.480" style="s2">to be true or you don&#39;t say things that</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.040" end="00:32:58.720" style="s2">you know to be true when you need to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.480" end="00:33:01.750" style="s2">which is more common and if you act in</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.720" end="00:33:04.150" style="s2">ways that you consider that in fact act</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.750" end="00:33:07.480" style="s2">in ways you consider reprehensible then</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.150" end="00:33:09.160" style="s2">you pathologize all of those autonomous</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.480" end="00:33:10.690" style="s2">systems that guide you it&#39;s like you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.160" end="00:33:13.450" style="s2">programming them badly you&#39;re building</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.690" end="00:33:15.340" style="s2">an AI system inside yourself really and</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.450" end="00:33:18.790" style="s2">in some sense that is what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.340" end="00:33:21.010" style="s2">that has very bad it&#39;s very bad training</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.790" end="00:33:22.070" style="s2">data and so the output it produces will</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.010" end="00:33:25.420" style="s2">be will won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.070" end="00:33:29.390" style="s2">I do properly and so you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.420" end="00:33:32.030" style="s2">pathologies your guidance systems it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.390" end="00:33:34.700" style="s2">really bad idea so that&#39;s why you have</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.030" end="00:33:37.160" style="s2">to not lie and maybe that&#39;s also why you</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.700" end="00:33:38.540" style="s2">have to say what you have to say and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.160" end="00:33:39.700" style="s2">have to say it clearly as well and you</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.540" end="00:33:42.380" style="s2">have to learn how to do that</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.700" end="00:33:44.060" style="s2">so that&#39;s one of the ways of getting</p>
<p begin="00:33:42.380" end="00:33:45.710" style="s2">your conscience straightened out and</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.060" end="00:33:47.390" style="s2">then you have to have a dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.710" end="00:33:49.220" style="s2">your conscience and you might ask it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.390" end="00:33:51.350" style="s2">like okay well what should I do</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.220" end="00:33:53.180" style="s2">or what should should I do this or</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.350" end="00:33:54.710" style="s2">should I not do this so let&#39;s say you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.180" end="00:33:56.740" style="s2">thinking should I not do this in the</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.710" end="00:34:00.230" style="s2">case of a temptation maybe you have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.740" end="00:34:02.630" style="s2">chance to develop a new relationship you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.230" end="00:34:04.880" style="s2">know and you&#39;re you&#39;re excited about it</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.630" end="00:34:08.060" style="s2">and apprehensive about it and afraid of</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.880" end="00:34:10.400" style="s2">it and you don&#39;t know how to sort out</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.060" end="00:34:12.170" style="s2">all those feelings and the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.400" end="00:34:13.250" style="s2">is you really have to want to sort them</p>
<p begin="00:34:12.170" end="00:34:15.590" style="s2">out that&#39;s why you have to orient</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.250" end="00:34:18.110" style="s2">yourself to something that&#39;s a genuine</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.590" end="00:34:21.410" style="s2">up you know that the star above the</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.110" end="00:34:22.970" style="s2">horizon you have to really want things</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.410" end="00:34:24.560" style="s2">to be straight and you have to have</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.970" end="00:34:27.380" style="s2">thought that through and you have to</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.560" end="00:34:28.760" style="s2">know what it means for things not to be</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.380" end="00:34:30.410" style="s2">straight and really what it means is</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.760" end="00:34:32.600" style="s2">that you&#39;re headed for hell in one way</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.410" end="00:34:34.640" style="s2">or another and if you understand that</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.600" end="00:34:35.870" style="s2">it&#39;s enough maybe it&#39;s enough to scare</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.640" end="00:34:37.550" style="s2">you straight you really got to think</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.870" end="00:34:39.110" style="s2">that through then you got to think about</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.550" end="00:34:41.210" style="s2">how much better it would be if you aimed</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.110" end="00:34:43.730" style="s2">up and that really has to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.210" end="00:34:45.950" style="s2">permeate your whole being and so then</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.730" end="00:34:47.510" style="s2">you&#39;re oriented that way you&#39;re oriented</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.950" end="00:34:49.460" style="s2">up and you&#39;re deciding that it&#39;s okay to</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.510" end="00:34:51.320" style="s2">try to tell the truth and then you can</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.460" end="00:34:54.800" style="s2">start to rely on this dialogue with your</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.320" end="00:34:56.360" style="s2">conscience but both of you have to learn</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.800" end="00:34:59.000" style="s2">and you&#39;re gonna make mistakes along the</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.360" end="00:35:00.380" style="s2">way you know that&#39;s okay you can say</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.000" end="00:35:02.660" style="s2">well I&#39;m gonna try this without being</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.380" end="00:35:05.330" style="s2">certain that it&#39;s right you can even say</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.660" end="00:35:06.590" style="s2">I&#39;m going to say this without being</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.330" end="00:35:08.210" style="s2">certain that it&#39;s correct like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.590" end="00:35:10.700" style="s2">arguing with your wife or your husband</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.210" end="00:35:12.590" style="s2">or your or your sister your father and</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.700" end="00:35:16.880" style="s2">you have an idea about what might be</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.590" end="00:35:20.420" style="s2">going on you can say look here&#39;s my idea</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.880" end="00:35:22.040" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on who knows what</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.420" end="00:35:23.750" style="s2">that idea might be contaminated with</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.040" end="00:35:25.550" style="s2">like maybe I&#39;m putting it forward just</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.750" end="00:35:28.340" style="s2">because I&#39;m too proud or arrogant or</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.550" end="00:35:30.440" style="s2">angry or fearful or whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.340" end="00:35:35.750" style="s2">possible let&#39;s see if we can figure that</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.440" end="00:35:37.520" style="s2">out but you can offer tentatively and</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.750" end="00:35:39.380" style="s2">have at it that&#39;s what you do if it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.520" end="00:35:41.540" style="s2">hypothesis right you both have at it and</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.380" end="00:35:44.180" style="s2">see if it&#39;s an idea that&#39;s worthy of of</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.540" end="00:35:48.740" style="s2">keeping you do that with your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.180" end="00:35:50.840" style="s2">and then you work move forward there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.740" end="00:35:52.609" style="s2">technique in behavioral psychology</p>

<p begin="00:35:52.609" end="00:35:57.530" style="s2">collaborative empiricism so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.130" end="00:35:58.700" style="s2">that we you and I have been sitting down</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.530" end="00:36:00.740" style="s2">and we decide that you&#39;re gonna try</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.700" end="00:36:02.330" style="s2">something new this week like maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.740" end="00:36:04.340" style="s2">you&#39;re agoraphobic and you&#39;re having a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.330" end="00:36:05.960" style="s2">hard time in a parking lot and so</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.340" end="00:36:08.240" style="s2">getting out of the car and going to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.960" end="00:36:09.470" style="s2">grocery store so maybe we say well you</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.240" end="00:36:12.160" style="s2">know drive to the grocery store and</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.470" end="00:36:14.720" style="s2">you&#39;re just gonna walk halfway to the</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.160" end="00:36:16.310" style="s2">halfway from your car to the door and</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.720" end="00:36:18.440" style="s2">that&#39;s good enough for like do that</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.310" end="00:36:19.910" style="s2">every second day for a week and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.440" end="00:36:21.380" style="s2">come back and let&#39;s talk about it</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.910" end="00:36:23.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s collaborative empiricism</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.380" end="00:36:25.220" style="s2">you&#39;re running a little experiment you</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.240" end="00:36:26.780" style="s2">think when your conscience is guiding</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.220" end="00:36:28.660" style="s2">you towards something you take a</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.780" end="00:36:31.670" style="s2">tentative step in that direction and</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.660" end="00:36:35.030" style="s2">then you check and see well you know did</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.670" end="00:36:36.859" style="s2">what I wanted to have happen occur as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.030" end="00:36:38.720" style="s2">outcome that&#39;s the crucial question</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.859" end="00:36:40.220" style="s2">that&#39;s the crucial question for</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.720" end="00:36:43.339" style="s2">behavioural truth right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.220" end="00:36:45.800" style="s2">pragmatic perspective did what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.339" end="00:36:47.900" style="s2">have happen happen as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.800" end="00:36:51.980" style="s2">my framework of interpretation and my</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.900" end="00:36:54.589" style="s2">action if the answer is yes then I have</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.980" end="00:36:56.480" style="s2">not invalidate it right that&#39;s that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.589" end="00:37:03.740" style="s2">the pragmatic philosophy in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.480" end="00:37:05.210" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s very very smart so you</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.740" end="00:37:06.740" style="s2">have a dialogue with your conscience</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.210" end="00:37:13.700" style="s2">that never ends and hopefully it gets</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.740" end="00:37:15.410" style="s2">wiser and you get wiser and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.700" end="00:37:16.690" style="s2">dialogue that Jung talked about between</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.410" end="00:37:22.130" style="s2">the conscious and the unconscious</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.690" end="00:37:23.690" style="s2">between your your fantasy life say the</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.130" end="00:37:25.880" style="s2">life that&#39;s sort of underneath you is a</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.690" end="00:37:27.800" style="s2">conscious being like you the life that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.880" end="00:37:30.290" style="s2">part of your biological platform the</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.800" end="00:37:32.089" style="s2">biological platform that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.290" end="00:37:34.520" style="s2">miraculously gives rise to your</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.089" end="00:37:38.450" style="s2">consciousness you have a dialogue with</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.520" end="00:37:41.710" style="s2">that we&#39;re always in dialogue we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.450" end="00:37:47.170" style="s2">always in dialogue right with everything</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.710" end="00:37:47.170" style="s2">so pursue that</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.980" end="00:37:59.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve watched many hours of your videos</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.320" end="00:38:02.040" style="s2">but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard you</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.580" end="00:38:03.600" style="s2">describe yourself on the big5 model care</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.040" end="00:38:06.660" style="s2">to tell us how you rank on each trait</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.600" end="00:38:09.450" style="s2">yeah okay well there&#39;s a problem because</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.660" end="00:38:13.530" style="s2">I know the tests and so it&#39;s hard for me</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.450" end="00:38:15.180" style="s2">to take them without being well because</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.530" end="00:38:17.790" style="s2">I know the tests right so it&#39;s hard for</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.180" end="00:38:19.830" style="s2">me to take them without the the</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.790" end="00:38:22.800" style="s2">ever-present threat of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:38:19.830" end="00:38:25.170" style="s2">manipulation I&#39;ve gone through them with</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.800" end="00:38:28.350" style="s2">my family you know to see if we get a</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.170" end="00:38:30.810" style="s2">more accurate accurate judgement so I</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.350" end="00:38:32.850" style="s2">can tell you on the big 10 scale which</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.810" end="00:38:36.300" style="s2">is the understand myself personality</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.850" end="00:38:39.540" style="s2">scale I&#39;m pretty enthusiastic I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.300" end="00:38:42.560" style="s2">its 75th 80th percentile something like</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.540" end="00:38:44.970" style="s2">that 99th percentile for assertiveness</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.560" end="00:38:47.610" style="s2">so I&#39;m pretty extroverted because those</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.970" end="00:38:50.730" style="s2">two together make extraversion and then</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.610" end="00:38:52.980" style="s2">with neuroticism that&#39;s a hard one</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.730" end="00:38:54.780" style="s2">because I&#39;ve had this problem with</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.980" end="00:38:56.970" style="s2">chronic depression that looks like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.780" end="00:38:59.400" style="s2">autoimmune related and so I felt a lot</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.970" end="00:39:01.800" style="s2">more negative emotion then the typical</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.400" end="00:39:05.970" style="s2">person does I would say by a substantial</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.800" end="00:39:09.360" style="s2">margin withdrawal well I don&#39;t seem to</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.970" end="00:39:12.500" style="s2">shy away from things so you know apart</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.360" end="00:39:15.300" style="s2">from the fact that I do feel</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.500" end="00:39:17.550" style="s2">anticipatory anxiety which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.300" end="00:39:20.040" style="s2">secondary to this depression let&#39;s say I</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.550" end="00:39:21.900" style="s2">don&#39;t seem to shy away from things so I</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.040" end="00:39:23.910" style="s2">don&#39;t think that temper mentally I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.900" end="00:39:29.220" style="s2">particularly high in withdrawal I am</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.910" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">more it&#39;s not irritable what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.220" end="00:39:33.900" style="s2">what&#39;s the next one volatile I&#39;m higher</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:36.030" style="s2">in volatility than withdrawal by a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.900" end="00:39:37.770" style="s2">substantial margin I can be quite</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.030" end="00:39:40.230" style="s2">irritable but again it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.770" end="00:39:42.360" style="s2">dissociate that from the depression so</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.230" end="00:39:46.760" style="s2">anyways my levels of negative emotion</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.360" end="00:39:46.760" style="s2">are higher than I would prefer</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.420" end="00:39:52.470" style="s2">agreeableness I&#39;m pretty compassionate</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.860" end="00:39:57.030" style="s2">pretty high in Compassion&#39;s like 75 80th</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.470" end="00:40:00.300" style="s2">percentile so you know and but I&#39;m I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.030" end="00:40:03.600" style="s2">relatively low in politeness so I think</p>
<p begin="00:40:00.300" end="00:40:05.430" style="s2">but not you know not 5th percentile</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.600" end="00:40:08.820" style="s2">something like 30th percentile forty</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.430" end="00:40:12.300" style="s2">percent off I remember correctly so</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.820" end="00:40:13.500" style="s2">that means that huh it means that I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.300" end="00:40:15.060" style="s2">blunt enough to hurt people&#39;s feelings</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.500" end="00:40:16.980" style="s2">now and then and that I really don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.060" end="00:40:22.010" style="s2">like that because the compassion thing</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.980" end="00:40:25.590" style="s2">gets me so conscientiousness I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.010" end="00:40:27.120" style="s2">moderately orderly 70 75th percentile</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.590" end="00:40:31.200" style="s2">and like 99th percentile for</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.120" end="00:40:33.840" style="s2">industriousness and then openness both</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.200" end="00:40:36.930" style="s2">of them intellect in 99th percentile for</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.840" end="00:40:39.120" style="s2">intellect and then it&#39;s like 95th</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.930" end="00:40:42.360" style="s2">something like that for openness or</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.120" end="00:40:50.190" style="s2">higher so that&#39;s where I that&#39;s where I</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.360" end="00:40:51.480" style="s2">rank so my wife and I found out earlier</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.190" end="00:40:53.430" style="s2">in the year and we may not be able to</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.480" end="00:40:58.320" style="s2">have children then last month I was</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.430" end="00:41:00.900" style="s2">diagnosed with cancer man how do I</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.320" end="00:41:02.520" style="s2">combat depression well the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.900" end="00:41:03.900" style="s2">that we should point out here I&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.520" end="00:41:06.660" style="s2">sorry to hear about all that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.900" end="00:41:09.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a lot of tragedy in a very short</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.660" end="00:41:12.570" style="s2">period of time man and I&#39;m not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.600" end="00:41:14.460" style="s2">give you any casual advice because but I</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.570" end="00:41:17.550" style="s2">maybe I can make some things clearer</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.460" end="00:41:19.410" style="s2">the first is you&#39;re not depressed you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.550" end="00:41:23.130" style="s2">had terrible things happen to you that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.410" end="00:41:25.350" style="s2">not the same thing right I distinguish</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.130" end="00:41:27.660" style="s2">between them if a client comes to me and</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.350" end="00:41:29.820" style="s2">they say they&#39;re feeling very sad and</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.660" end="00:41:31.800" style="s2">down and and anxious and worried about</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.820" end="00:41:33.750" style="s2">everything and so forth then I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.800" end="00:41:35.700" style="s2">walk through their life do they have</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.750" end="00:41:37.950" style="s2">friends do they have a family do they</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.700" end="00:41:40.410" style="s2">have a meaningful job is their</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.950" end="00:41:42.060" style="s2">educational background appropriate for</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.410" end="00:41:43.980" style="s2">their level of intelligence and ability</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.060" end="00:41:45.510" style="s2">are they taking care of themselves do</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.980" end="00:41:47.160" style="s2">they have something to look forward to</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.510" end="00:41:49.830" style="s2">do they use their time outside of work</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.160" end="00:41:51.780" style="s2">productively and wisely etc so you think</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.830" end="00:41:54.930" style="s2">about those as the dimensions of a good</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.780" end="00:41:57.030" style="s2">life there&#39;s more or maybe there&#39;s fewer</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.930" end="00:41:59.180" style="s2">but that&#39;s not too bad for a for a quick</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.030" end="00:42:01.560" style="s2">and dirty first pass through let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.180" end="00:42:03.510" style="s2">those are the dimensions by the way that</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.560" end="00:42:05.640" style="s2">you work on if you do the future</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.510" end="00:42:07.020" style="s2">authoring program in the self authoring</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.640" end="00:42:09.750" style="s2">suite you&#39;re asked to think about all</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.020" end="00:42:11.460" style="s2">those dimensions and consider what your</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.750" end="00:42:19.650" style="s2">life might be like if you optimized</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.460" end="00:42:21.300" style="s2">along all of them and so if you if all</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.650" end="00:42:22.920" style="s2">of those things are going well for you</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.300" end="00:42:26.099" style="s2">and you feel terrible all</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.920" end="00:42:27.869" style="s2">the time then you&#39;re depressed because</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.099" end="00:42:29.430" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s something wrong with</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.869" end="00:42:30.839" style="s2">your emotional regulation you know I</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.430" end="00:42:33.059" style="s2">mean maybe you&#39;re having an existential</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.839" end="00:42:34.920" style="s2">crisis that&#39;s a possibility but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.059" end="00:42:36.420" style="s2">let&#39;s assume we can&#39;t see anything</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.920" end="00:42:38.220" style="s2">structurally wrong with your life but</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.420" end="00:42:40.049" style="s2">you&#39;re feeling terrible then I would say</p>

<p begin="00:44:06.510" end="00:44:13.079" style="s2">moment and and there&#39;s no simple answer</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.780" end="00:44:17.910" style="s2">to that I would say you could you could</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.079" end="00:44:21.809" style="s2">take a look at chapter 12 in my book 12</p>

<p begin="00:44:44.979" end="00:44:55.089" style="s2">and it was an ongoing crisis continual</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.170" end="00:44:57.670" style="s2">four years of crisis and so the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.089" end="00:45:01.900" style="s2">is how do you cope with that and the</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.670" end="00:45:06.299" style="s2">answer is the first answer is you shrink</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.900" end="00:45:08.019" style="s2">your timeframe you know you&#39;ve had these</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.299" end="00:45:12.759" style="s2">especially with regards to your</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.019" end="00:45:14.769" style="s2">diagnosis it&#39;s like all of a sudden your</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.759" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">future is being thrown completely into</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.769" end="00:45:22.479" style="s2">chaos and you don&#39;t know how to deal</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.839" end="00:45:23.950" style="s2">with that and and who would you do what</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.479" end="00:45:26.829" style="s2">you can to stabilize your medical</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.950" end="00:45:28.630" style="s2">treatment and to optimize your quality</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.829" end="00:45:31.390" style="s2">of life while that&#39;s happening a very</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.630" end="00:45:33.910" style="s2">complicated thing to do and then I would</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.390" end="00:45:36.609" style="s2">say you live for the day you know for</p>
<p begin="00:45:33.910" end="00:45:39.489" style="s2">the week maybe maybe it weeks too much</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.609" end="00:45:42.369" style="s2">even but for the day just like you get</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.489" end="00:45:45.239" style="s2">up in the morning you think I need to do</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.369" end="00:45:49.719" style="s2">everything I can to make this day as</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.239" end="00:45:54.849" style="s2">meaningful and and rich as I possibly</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.719" end="00:45:56.890" style="s2">can and hopefully I will have had a full</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.849" end="00:45:58.809" style="s2">day by this evening and then I&#39;ll be</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.890" end="00:46:01.509" style="s2">able to sleep and then I&#39;ll be able to</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.809" end="00:46:04.839" style="s2">get up in the morning and say I&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.509" end="00:46:07.710" style="s2">to try to make this day as useful and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.839" end="00:46:09.849" style="s2">meaningful and engaging as it can be and</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.710" end="00:46:11.890" style="s2">then maybe when you&#39;re really sick you</p>
<p begin="00:46:09.849" end="00:46:13.479" style="s2">don&#39;t have a day you have hours and then</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.890" end="00:46:14.829" style="s2">you do the same thing for the hours and</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.479" end="00:46:20.920" style="s2">then maybe you do the same thing with</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.829" end="00:46:23.349" style="s2">the minutes I would also say you know</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.920" end="00:46:25.479" style="s2">you&#39;ve been through a lot of shock and</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.349" end="00:46:27.640" style="s2">it&#39;s conceivable that you might need to</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.479" end="00:46:29.819" style="s2">talk to someone it&#39;s also conceivable</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.640" end="00:46:32.200" style="s2">that an antidepressant could help you</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.819" end="00:46:34.809" style="s2">you know you&#39;ve got a lot to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.200" end="00:46:36.969" style="s2">and you might need your nervous system</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.809" end="00:46:39.999" style="s2">might need some stabilization with all</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.969" end="00:46:42.219" style="s2">that stress and so that&#39;s something to</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.999" end="00:46:44.229" style="s2">consider antidepressants are also quite</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.219" end="00:46:47.289" style="s2">effective as pain medications especially</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.229" end="00:46:49.329" style="s2">a drug called cymbalta so that&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.289" end="00:46:50.280" style="s2">worth knowing because you need to know</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.329" end="00:46:53.760" style="s2">about if</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.280" end="00:46:57.900" style="s2">- pain medication it&#39;s very important in</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.760" end="00:46:59.880" style="s2">extreme situations of pain opiates of</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.900" end="00:47:03.210" style="s2">course are the drug of choice but you</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.880" end="00:47:05.970" style="s2">can use drugs like methylphenidate that</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.210" end="00:47:08.520" style="s2">riddle in the ADHD drug you can use them</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.970" end="00:47:11.660" style="s2">as adjuncts to to pain medication and</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.520" end="00:47:13.850" style="s2">people need to know that because the the</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.660" end="00:47:16.440" style="s2">they&#39;re basically amphetamines</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.850" end="00:47:19.950" style="s2">amphetamines have analgesic properties</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.440" end="00:47:21.840" style="s2">but they also keep they also maintain</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.950" end="00:47:23.640" style="s2">alertness and so the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.840" end="00:47:25.830" style="s2">opiates is they can be sedating but an</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.640" end="00:47:27.540" style="s2">opiate and feta mean combination and</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.830" end="00:47:31.440" style="s2">this is for people who are in absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.540" end="00:47:33.780" style="s2">intractable pain by the way that can</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.440" end="00:47:35.880" style="s2">increase alertness and help cope with</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.780" end="00:47:39.500" style="s2">pain and it&#39;s really useful to know what</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.880" end="00:47:43.520" style="s2">you might need to cope with pain so I</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.500" end="00:47:46.520" style="s2">would say shrink your time horizon and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.520" end="00:47:46.520" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.920" end="00:48:04.589" style="s2">oh thank you okay thanks Tim shrink your</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.470" end="00:48:07.420" style="s2">time horizon and then concentrate on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.589" end="00:48:09.309" style="s2">concentrate on the moment whatever that</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.420" end="00:48:09.819" style="s2">moment happens to be might be the next</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.309" end="00:48:12.309" style="s2">minute</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.819" end="00:48:16.420" style="s2">you know I don&#39;t know what else to do</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.309" end="00:48:17.770" style="s2">when you&#39;re in an extreme situation the</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.420" end="00:48:20.740" style="s2">other thing I guess the final thing I</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.770" end="00:48:22.299" style="s2">would say with regards to the we may not</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.740" end="00:48:24.130" style="s2">have to be able to have children well</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.299" end="00:48:26.470" style="s2">you need a plan to address that to the</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.130" end="00:48:27.819" style="s2">best that that you can to the best way</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.470" end="00:48:31.770" style="s2">that you can and then you have to give</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.819" end="00:48:31.770" style="s2">yourself some time to reconsider</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.790" end="00:48:37.839" style="s2">we may not be able to have children that</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.920" end="00:48:40.420" style="s2">probably takes about a year or a year</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.839" end="00:48:41.980" style="s2">and a half to digest so don&#39;t be too</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.420" end="00:48:44.339" style="s2">hard on yourself if you haven&#39;t figured</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.980" end="00:48:46.660" style="s2">it out yet it&#39;s any major life</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.339" end="00:48:48.190" style="s2">transformation like a really major life</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.660" end="00:48:51.990" style="s2">transformation I would say takes a</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.190" end="00:48:51.990" style="s2">minimum of a year to really adapt you</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.330" end="00:49:12.810" style="s2">please give your perspective on why</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.620" end="00:49:23.880" style="s2">polyamory is bad for the individual in</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.810" end="00:49:25.920" style="s2">society well I think the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.880" end="00:49:29.100" style="s2">reason is there&#39;s a bunch of reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.920" end="00:49:31.670" style="s2">mean the first is societies seem to</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.100" end="00:49:36.060" style="s2">function better that is less violently</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.670" end="00:49:42.810" style="s2">let&#39;s say when there&#39;s one woman per man</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.060" end="00:49:45.840" style="s2">if there&#39;s many women per man there</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.810" end="00:49:48.060" style="s2">aren&#39;t many women for every man there</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.840" end="00:49:51.260" style="s2">are a handful of men let&#39;s say a</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.060" end="00:49:56.910" style="s2">minority of men a Pareto distribution of</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.260" end="00:50:02.460" style="s2">men who have a disproportionate number</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.910" end="00:50:05.190" style="s2">of women and a lot of men who have none</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.460" end="00:50:08.460" style="s2">and those aren&#39;t happy man let&#39;s put it</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.190" end="00:50:11.010" style="s2">that way they&#39;re men who are very likely</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.460" end="00:50:15.600" style="s2">to get up to no good very rapidly so</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.010" end="00:50:18.950" style="s2">there&#39;s that then I would say the women</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.600" end="00:50:21.510" style="s2">who let&#39;s say a man has many women and</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.950" end="00:50:25.230" style="s2">let&#39;s say he&#39;s a desirable man for that</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.510" end="00:50:27.450" style="s2">matter just for the sake of argument if</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.230" end="00:50:30.210" style="s2">he has a variety of women then those</p>

<p begin="00:51:05.010" end="00:51:10.200" style="s2">polyamorous relationships you might ask</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.620" end="00:51:12.020" style="s2">but what about sequential ones where you</p>

<p begin="00:51:14.270" end="00:51:21.120" style="s2">indiscriminate um well from just casual</p>

<p begin="00:51:21.120" end="00:51:26.940" style="s2">I think the problem with that is that to</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.230" end="00:51:29.850" style="s2">sleep around casually is to imply that</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.940" end="00:51:32.850" style="s2">sections casual to imply that sex is</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.850" end="00:51:35.280" style="s2">casual is to assume implicitly that it</p>

<p begin="00:51:37.800" end="00:51:43.650" style="s2">all of that and you can divorce it but</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.850" end="00:51:47.550" style="s2">you pay a big price for that I think the</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.650" end="00:51:52.200" style="s2">price you pay is like the virtual it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.550" end="00:51:55.310" style="s2">it it well the word psychopathic keeps</p>

<p begin="00:52:09.140" end="00:52:14.750" style="s2">transient sexual interaction in order to</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.990" end="00:52:20.580" style="s2">sleep around casually and I think that</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.910" end="00:52:26.970" style="s2">once you establish that as a habit with</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.580" end="00:52:29.730" style="s2">sex which is a deep a deep experience if</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.970" end="00:52:32.070" style="s2">you if you&#39;ll do that with sex which is</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.730" end="00:52:33.810" style="s2">a deep experience then and you learn how</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.070" end="00:52:35.400" style="s2">then what makes you think that won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:33.810" end="00:52:41.190" style="s2">transfer to everything else that you do</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.400" end="00:52:42.900" style="s2">I don&#39;t see how it can fail to so you</p>

<p begin="00:54:55.140" end="00:55:00.170" style="s2">thing that we should realize is that</p>

<p begin="00:55:00.170" end="00:55:07.230" style="s2">people have been experimenting with them</p>

<p begin="00:55:07.230" end="00:55:14.450" style="s2">consequence of this I certainly believe</p>

<p begin="01:12:30.660" end="01:12:37.740" style="s2">but I would say you better pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.470" end="01:12:41.320" style="s2">to what they&#39;re being taught in school</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.740" end="01:12:43.210" style="s2">my suggestion to parents is that if your</p>
<p begin="01:12:41.320" end="01:12:48.810" style="s2">kids are in a class where they talk</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.210" end="01:12:54.580" style="s2">about diversity equity inclusivity</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.810" end="01:12:56.320" style="s2">gender white privilege that&#39;s not a bad</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.580" end="01:12:58.570" style="s2">there&#39;s other words too but we&#39;ll stick</p>
<p begin="01:12:56.320" end="01:13:00.970" style="s2">with those that your kids should be</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.570" end="01:13:02.380" style="s2">encouraged to leave the class because</p>
<p begin="01:13:00.970" end="01:13:04.890" style="s2">they&#39;re not being educated they&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.380" end="01:13:07.840" style="s2">indoctrinated now that doesn&#39;t mean that</p>
<p begin="01:13:04.890" end="01:13:09.670" style="s2">there can&#39;t be an intelligent discussion</p>
<p begin="01:13:07.840" end="01:13:11.260" style="s2">about any one of those topics but when</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.670" end="01:13:13.210" style="s2">they come together in a group then</p>
<p begin="01:13:11.260" end="01:13:16.530" style="s2">that&#39;s a pretty good marker that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.210" end="01:13:19.000" style="s2">in the vicinity of a radical leftist</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.530" end="01:13:20.740" style="s2">neo-marxist ideology and there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.000" end="01:13:25.180" style="s2">excuse for that being foisted on your</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.740" end="01:13:27.520" style="s2">children you may have to have a serious</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.180" end="01:13:29.260" style="s2">chat with your school with your kids</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.520" end="01:13:30.700" style="s2">teachers with the principal you may have</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.260" end="01:13:33.100" style="s2">to learn how to form your argument</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.700" end="01:13:36.280" style="s2">formulate your arguments against the</p>

<p begin="01:14:07.900" end="01:14:20.139" style="s2">because your being is rebelling against</p>

<p begin="01:15:53.820" end="01:16:01.260" style="s2">book I laid out a description of the way</p>

<p begin="01:16:47.460" end="01:16:51.440" style="s2">you detect whether or not something&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:21:26.570" end="01:21:30.240" style="s2">how is it that society has not learned</p>
<p begin="01:21:28.980" end="01:21:33.720" style="s2">from history about the dangers of</p>
<p begin="01:21:30.240" end="01:21:35.790" style="s2">socialism Marxism ideology etc after</p>
<p begin="01:21:33.720" end="01:21:42.270" style="s2">years how to Marxist get away with it</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.790" end="01:21:44.400" style="s2">well let&#39;s let&#39;s not go with the dangers</p>
<p begin="01:21:42.270" end="01:21:46.470" style="s2">of ideology let&#39;s go with the dangers of</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.400" end="01:21:49.830" style="s2">like to call it radical left-wing</p>
<p begin="01:21:46.470" end="01:21:51.540" style="s2">ideology well I think the reason for</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.830" end="01:21:54.030" style="s2">this and this also might by the reason</p>
<p begin="01:21:51.540" end="01:21:57.210" style="s2">be the reason that there&#39;s a strange</p>
<p begin="01:21:54.030" end="01:21:59.520" style="s2">thing that the iconography of of social</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.210" end="01:22:01.290" style="s2">of communism is still acceptable</p>
<p begin="01:21:59.520" end="01:22:05.100" style="s2">socially whereas the iconography of</p>
<p begin="01:22:01.290" end="01:22:08.610" style="s2">Nazism isn&#39;t now I&#39;m not saying that we</p>
<p begin="01:22:05.100" end="01:22:10.980" style="s2">should make the icons of Nazism socially</p>
<p begin="01:22:08.610" end="01:22:13.170" style="s2">acceptable either I think that the</p>
<p begin="01:22:10.980" end="01:22:15.270" style="s2">communist icons shouldn&#39;t be socially</p>
<p begin="01:22:13.170" end="01:22:18.150" style="s2">acceptable but they are and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.270" end="01:22:20.430" style="s2">probably a reason for that you know now</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.150" end="01:22:23.250" style="s2">part of it is that the left has never</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.430" end="01:22:26.100" style="s2">taken on the radical left has never</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.250" end="01:22:28.200" style="s2">taken responsibility for being on the</p>
<p begin="01:22:26.100" end="01:22:30.390" style="s2">same side as the Stalinists and the</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.200" end="01:22:33.510" style="s2">Maoists and and the Cambodian murderers</p>
<p begin="01:22:30.390" end="01:22:35.070" style="s2">and all of that so that&#39;s part of it but</p>
<p begin="01:22:33.510" end="01:22:39.810" style="s2">then the next part is I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:22:35.070" end="01:22:42.660" style="s2">something deeper I think that you know</p>
<p begin="01:22:39.810" end="01:22:45.240" style="s2">inequality is a reality and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:22:42.660" end="01:22:48.150" style="s2">reality that cannot be put at the feet</p>
<p begin="01:22:45.240" end="01:22:50.190" style="s2">of capitalism or at the feet of human</p>
<p begin="01:22:48.150" end="01:22:51.930" style="s2">political structure there&#39;s a good book</p>
<p begin="01:22:50.190" end="01:22:54.900" style="s2">you guys might want to read this called</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.930" end="01:22:56.700" style="s2">the great leveler by Walter shy del and</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.900" end="01:22:58.350" style="s2">it&#39;s a new book and it&#39;s a study of</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.700" end="01:23:00.180" style="s2">inequality and one of the things he does</p>
<p begin="01:22:58.350" end="01:23:02.940" style="s2">is do an empirical analysis of the</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.180" end="01:23:04.470" style="s2">relationship between inequality the Gini</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.940" end="01:23:07.530" style="s2">coefficient which is a measure of</p>
<p begin="01:23:04.470" end="01:23:10.080" style="s2">inequality and the ideological position</p>
<p begin="01:23:07.530" end="01:23:12.270" style="s2">of governments so here&#39;s the theory the</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.080" end="01:23:13.530" style="s2">hypothesis would be well because the</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.270" end="01:23:16.500" style="s2">left wingers are concerned with</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.530" end="01:23:18.360" style="s2">inequality if you measured inequality in</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.500" end="01:23:19.980" style="s2">left-wing under left-wing governments</p>
<p begin="01:23:18.360" end="01:23:21.420" style="s2">and you measured inequality under right</p>
<p begin="01:23:19.980" end="01:23:23.370" style="s2">wing governments you&#39;d expect the</p>
<p begin="01:23:21.420" end="01:23:28.140" style="s2">reduction in inequality under left-wing</p>
<p begin="01:23:23.370" end="01:23:31.050" style="s2">governments and the results are no</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.140" end="01:23:32.100" style="s2">difference and so what does that mean it</p>
<p begin="01:23:31.050" end="01:23:33.840" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean that left wings are</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.100" end="01:23:35.700" style="s2">hypocrites although it might mean that</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.840" end="01:23:37.710" style="s2">because people can be hypocrites but</p>
<p begin="01:23:35.700" end="01:23:39.219" style="s2">what it means is the problem of</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.710" end="01:23:42.849" style="s2">inequality</p>
<p begin="01:23:39.219" end="01:23:49.320" style="s2">is so intractable that we don&#39;t know of</p>
<p begin="01:23:42.849" end="01:23:52.500" style="s2">any appropriate political sociological</p>
<p begin="01:23:49.320" end="01:23:54.550" style="s2">or economic solutions that actually work</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.500" end="01:23:58.480" style="s2">it&#39;s a real catastrophe</p>
<p begin="01:23:54.550" end="01:24:01.539" style="s2">now inequality in itself might not be a</p>
<p begin="01:23:58.480" end="01:24:03.400" style="s2">bad thing unless it&#39;s too extreme it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.539" end="01:24:05.619" style="s2">extreme when people say start to starve</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.400" end="01:24:09.280" style="s2">and then clearly something&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.619" end="01:24:11.019" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s very difficult to I think</p>
<p begin="01:24:09.280" end="01:24:12.820" style="s2">everyone would agree that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:24:11.019" end="01:24:14.730" style="s2">suboptimal outcome you know we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:24:12.820" end="01:24:17.380" style="s2">need to get all ideological about that</p>
<p begin="01:24:14.730" end="01:24:19.360" style="s2">but some degree of inequality is useful</p>
<p begin="01:24:17.380" end="01:24:20.409" style="s2">because well it gives people something</p>
<p begin="01:24:19.360" end="01:24:23.980" style="s2">to strive for</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.409" end="01:24:25.719" style="s2">it gives them an up right it means I was</p>
<p begin="01:24:23.980" end="01:24:27.489" style="s2">thinking about this and sometimes you</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.719" end="01:24:30.010" style="s2">actually want people to be rich because</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.489" end="01:24:32.500" style="s2">if a new product is introduced into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.010" end="01:24:34.210" style="s2">market the people there have to be</p>
<p begin="01:24:32.500" end="01:24:36.309" style="s2">people around who have substantial tools</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.210" end="01:24:39.460" style="s2">of capital to be able to afford it when</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.309" end="01:24:41.110" style="s2">it&#39;s still novel and then that market</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.460" end="01:24:42.840" style="s2">brings the price down for everyone else</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.110" end="01:24:44.889" style="s2">and so if everyone had exactly the same</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.840" end="01:24:46.630" style="s2">income it would be very difficult to</p>
<p begin="01:24:44.889" end="01:24:48.039" style="s2">introduce expensive products into the</p>
<p begin="01:24:46.630" end="01:24:49.900" style="s2">market with the hope that their price</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.039" end="01:24:52.289" style="s2">would plummet that actually is a big</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.900" end="01:24:54.429" style="s2">deal you want large pools of capital</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.289" end="01:24:56.619" style="s2">sitting around to so that people can</p>
<p begin="01:24:54.429" end="01:24:59.110" style="s2">invest in very very complex things and</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.619" end="01:25:00.820" style="s2">you also want large pools of capital to</p>
<p begin="01:24:59.110" end="01:25:02.889" style="s2">be the hands of to be in the hands of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.820" end="01:25:03.909" style="s2">private individuals so that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.889" end="01:25:05.739" style="s2">competitive</p>
<p begin="01:25:03.909" end="01:25:07.269" style="s2">there&#39;s forces that are powerful that</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.739" end="01:25:10.920" style="s2">are competitive with the government and</p>
<p begin="01:25:07.269" end="01:25:14.340" style="s2">with other large organizations so</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.920" end="01:25:16.900" style="s2">anyways though back to the Marxists</p>
<p begin="01:25:14.340" end="01:25:20.079" style="s2">despite the fact that there are reasons</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.900" end="01:25:22.030" style="s2">for inequality and despite the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.079" end="01:25:23.980" style="s2">you can&#39;t lay that the fact of</p>
<p begin="01:25:22.030" end="01:25:27.400" style="s2">inequality at the feet of capitalism and</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.980" end="01:25:29.710" style="s2">despite the fact that capitalism also</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.400" end="01:25:32.829" style="s2">appears to be making everyone not</p>
<p begin="01:25:29.710" end="01:25:36.309" style="s2">absolutely poor at the same time as it</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.829" end="01:25:38.409" style="s2">makes some people very rich they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:25:36.309" end="01:25:41.019" style="s2">still inequality is still painful</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.409" end="01:25:43.179" style="s2">reality and no one really likes it</p>
<p begin="01:25:41.019" end="01:25:46.210" style="s2">you know I mean you can lord it over</p>
<p begin="01:25:43.179" end="01:25:47.650" style="s2">someone I suppose and and extract out</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.210" end="01:25:49.330" style="s2">some sense of your moral superiority</p>
<p begin="01:25:47.650" end="01:25:51.940" style="s2">because you happen to occupy</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.330" end="01:25:53.920" style="s2">a hierarchical position that&#39;s higher</p>
<p begin="01:25:51.940" end="01:25:55.240" style="s2">and sometimes there&#39;s some validity in</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.920" end="01:25:58.420" style="s2">that especially if you&#39;ve earned it</p>
<p begin="01:25:55.240" end="01:26:01.720" style="s2">although I would say like glorying in it</p>
<p begin="01:25:58.420" end="01:26:03.010" style="s2">is probably a suboptimal outcome it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:01.720" end="01:26:05.770" style="s2">still the case that that inequality</p>
<p begin="01:26:03.010" end="01:26:07.240" style="s2">violates a moral intuition that everyone</p>
<p begin="01:26:05.770" end="01:26:08.920" style="s2">has I think and that&#39;s probably the</p>

<p begin="01:28:20.469" end="01:28:23.860" style="s2">say I could come up with a draft</p>

<p begin="01:28:34.599" end="01:28:38.920" style="s2">then I have a new problem the problem is</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.539" end="01:28:40.360" style="s2">well oh my god I&#39;ve got all this money</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.920" end="01:28:42.179" style="s2">now I have to figure out something to do</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.360" end="01:28:45.039" style="s2">with it and that&#39;s actually a really big</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.179" end="01:28:46.840" style="s2">responsibility not it&#39;s not like you</p>

<p begin="01:28:50.829" end="01:28:59.380" style="s2">real so I have to do a lot more thinking</p>
<p begin="01:28:55.179" end="01:29:03.159" style="s2">and planning and figure out how to</p>
<p begin="01:28:59.380" end="01:29:05.769" style="s2">disperse my time most effectively before</p>
<p begin="01:29:03.159" end="01:29:09.459" style="s2">I dare to take on any additional people</p>
<p begin="01:29:05.769" end="01:29:12.849" style="s2">who would like to help now once my</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.459" end="01:29:14.739" style="s2">organization as is in a place where that</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.849" end="01:29:16.539" style="s2">sort of help would be useful then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.739" end="01:29:19.449" style="s2">make a public announcement and I would</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.539" end="01:29:21.440" style="s2">be more than happy for people to jump on</p>
<p begin="01:29:19.449" end="01:29:23.900" style="s2">board let&#39;s say climb on boards</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.440" end="01:29:25.520" style="s2">pushing devote resources all of those</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.900" end="01:29:27.320" style="s2">things I&#39;d be happy for that to happen</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.520" end="01:29:30.590" style="s2">then but I don&#39;t want to do it</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.320" end="01:29:35.870" style="s2">prematurely because I don&#39;t want people</p>
<p begin="01:29:30.590" end="01:29:41.300" style="s2">to to risk their valuable resources in</p>
<p begin="01:29:35.870" end="01:29:43.580" style="s2">an endeavor that isn&#39;t yet solid so all</p>
<p begin="01:29:41.300" end="01:29:46.390" style="s2">right so I&#39;m only going to do I think</p>
<p begin="01:29:43.580" end="01:29:46.390" style="s2">one more question</p>
<p begin="01:29:59.620" end="01:30:05.080" style="s2">I am a sober alcoholic slash drug addict</p>
<p begin="01:30:03.670" end="01:30:07.480" style="s2">how can I will find my way back to</p>
<p begin="01:30:05.080" end="01:30:09.940" style="s2">belief in a higher power after 10 years</p>
<p begin="01:30:07.480" end="01:30:20.920" style="s2">in the empty void of atheism I&#39;m falling</p>
<p begin="01:30:09.940" end="01:30:25.510" style="s2">apart well I would say your best bet is</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.920" end="01:30:29.080" style="s2">to actually start devoting some some</p>
<p begin="01:30:25.510" end="01:30:31.030" style="s2">time to it you know for me I became</p>
<p begin="01:30:29.080" end="01:30:34.110" style="s2">convinced of the validity of a religious</p>
<p begin="01:30:31.030" end="01:30:41.560" style="s2">viewpoint I think as a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:30:34.110" end="01:30:44.050" style="s2">study read Joseph Campbell read Carl</p>
<p begin="01:30:41.560" end="01:30:46.510" style="s2">Jung Jung&#39;s hard Campbell&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="01:30:44.050" end="01:30:51.070" style="s2">introduction though rich Aurelio de as</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.510" end="01:30:52.750" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know if you can find your</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.070" end="01:30:54.460" style="s2">way back to belief but you might be able</p>
<p begin="01:30:52.750" end="01:30:58.300" style="s2">to find your way back to meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.460" end="01:31:00.220" style="s2">engagement and that might that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.300" end="01:31:02.080" style="s2">better way of thinking about it you know</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.220" end="01:31:03.700" style="s2">the belief thing is a really tricky one</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.080" end="01:31:07.210" style="s2">people asked me do you believe in God</p>
<p begin="01:31:03.700" end="01:31:09.910" style="s2">and I think I really think how dare you</p>
<p begin="01:31:07.210" end="01:31:15.550" style="s2">ask that question I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:31:09.910" end="01:31:16.930" style="s2">what I think but on a more prosaic level</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.550" end="01:31:18.700" style="s2">I usually think well I don&#39;t know what</p>
<p begin="01:31:16.930" end="01:31:21.310" style="s2">you mean by belief I don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.700" end="01:31:25.360" style="s2">mean by belief and I don&#39;t know what you</p>
<p begin="01:31:21.310" end="01:31:27.100" style="s2">mean by God these are very cities are</p>
<p begin="01:31:25.360" end="01:31:31.510" style="s2">very difficult questions and none of</p>
<p begin="01:31:27.100" end="01:31:33.580" style="s2">that self-evident now I would say do I</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.510" end="01:31:36.250" style="s2">believe in the crucifixion well</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.580" end="01:31:38.500" style="s2">certainly I mean people the crucifixion</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.250" end="01:31:41.950" style="s2">how can you not believe in it if you</p>
<p begin="01:31:38.500" end="01:31:44.500" style="s2">think symbolically it&#39;s like human</p>
<p begin="01:31:41.950" end="01:31:48.010" style="s2">beings are we&#39;re eternally crucified</p>
<p begin="01:31:44.500" end="01:31:50.260" style="s2">right our lives are tragic and they end</p>
<p begin="01:31:48.010" end="01:31:54.160" style="s2">in death and we&#39;re all betrayed and</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.260" end="01:31:59.230" style="s2">we&#39;re all betrayed we all experience</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.160" end="01:32:00.610" style="s2">betrayal so ok you can&#39;t not believe in</p>
<p begin="01:31:59.230" end="01:32:04.810" style="s2">the crucifixion do you believe in the</p>
<p begin="01:32:00.610" end="01:32:07.630" style="s2">resurrection well people die and are</p>
<p begin="01:32:04.810" end="01:32:09.310" style="s2">reborn all the time no they they go</p>
<p begin="01:32:07.630" end="01:32:11.650" style="s2">through this is what you&#39;re after here</p>

<p begin="01:32:11.650" end="01:32:15.550" style="s2">well you know you you had to let</p>
<p begin="01:32:13.660" end="01:32:17.710" style="s2">you die when you stop being an addict</p>
<p begin="01:32:15.550" end="01:32:19.420" style="s2">and something new be reborn it&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:32:19.420" end="01:32:23.920" style="s2">and how is it tied to the notion of</p>
<p begin="01:32:21.280" end="01:32:25.810" style="s2">bodily resurrection well I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="01:32:23.920" end="01:32:29.730" style="s2">what the ultimate significance is but it</p>
<p begin="01:32:25.810" end="01:32:29.730" style="s2">does seem to be the pathway through life</p>
<p begin="01:32:34.080" end="01:32:42.670" style="s2">to believe I would say you start</p>
<p begin="01:32:37.840" end="01:32:46.780" style="s2">believing not by attempting to convince</p>
<p begin="01:32:42.670" end="01:32:51.670" style="s2">yourself that the statement there is a</p>
<p begin="01:32:46.780" end="01:32:54.160" style="s2">God is true like a fact is true but to</p>
<p begin="01:32:51.670" end="01:32:56.650" style="s2">act out the proposition that you should</p>

<p begin="01:32:56.650" end="01:33:07.410" style="s2">towards the City of God that&#39;s belief</p>
<p begin="01:32:59.560" end="01:33:10.390" style="s2">man and you can do that right away</p>
<p begin="01:33:07.410" end="01:33:13.360" style="s2">now you might ask well do I have any</p>
<p begin="01:33:10.390" end="01:33:16.410" style="s2">guarantee that that has transcendent and</p>
<p begin="01:33:13.360" end="01:33:19.450" style="s2">universal significance it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="01:33:16.410" end="01:33:20.950" style="s2">it&#39;s not a bad model for emulation so it</p>
<p begin="01:33:19.450" end="01:33:25.930" style="s2">has Universal significance in that</p>
<p begin="01:33:20.950" end="01:33:27.910" style="s2">regard we each have to shoulder the</p>
