<p begin="00:03:41.360" end="00:03:46.720" style="s2">standard practice and um</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.560" end="00:03:49.040" style="s2">was not able to make it to the supreme</p>

<p begin="00:04:01.280" end="00:04:06.080" style="s2">right so so that was a very interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:07.360" style="s2">experience in educational for two years</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.080" end="00:04:10.720" style="s2">and i went from there</p>

<p begin="00:04:12.959" end="00:04:18.959" style="s2">political philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.120" end="00:04:20.239" style="s2">um i found uh german philosophers</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.959" end="00:04:23.280" style="s2">particularly interesting</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.239" end="00:04:24.880" style="s2">and ended up writing a dissertation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.280" end="00:04:26.960" style="s2">which i am very proud</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.880" end="00:04:28.400" style="s2">i think it&#39;s the greatest thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.960" end="00:04:32.560" style="s2">i&#39;ve ever done</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.400" end="00:04:36.000" style="s2">um it was really a spark of</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.560" end="00:04:39.120" style="s2">of um kind of</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.000" end="00:04:41.520" style="s2">the the creative muse uh touched me</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.120" end="00:04:43.759" style="s2">for a period of several months and i was</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.520" end="00:04:45.440" style="s2">able to produce something that still</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.759" end="00:04:46.880" style="s2">impresses me and i wonder how the hell i</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.440" end="00:04:48.639" style="s2">was able to do it because i</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.880" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">i could never reproduce something like</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.639" end="00:04:53.040" style="s2">that and</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.160" end="00:04:55.040" style="s2">um it&#39;s accessible it&#39;s on my twitter</p>

<p begin="00:05:43.520" end="00:05:47.840" style="s2">in order to give an original and i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.479" end="00:05:50.880" style="s2">very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.840" end="00:05:51.680" style="s2">explanation as to what the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.880" end="00:05:53.759" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.680" end="00:05:54.800" style="s2">actually is and by modernity i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.759" end="00:05:56.960" style="s2">just mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.800" end="00:05:59.440" style="s2">you know recent stuff that&#39;s happened in</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.960" end="00:06:00.240" style="s2">the past couple months by modernity i</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.440" end="00:06:02.720" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.240" end="00:06:04.960" style="s2">that period of western history and</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.720" end="00:06:08.960" style="s2">consciousness and understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.960" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">inaugurated by uh the key figures</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.960" end="00:06:12.960" style="s2">uh such as descartes galileo and newton</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.360" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.960" end="00:06:16.880" style="s2">um so i can maybe get into that a little</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.360" end="00:06:20.160" style="s2">bit more but that was</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.880" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">uh just a very uh important kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.160" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">chapter in my life where i was</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:25.759" style="s2">reading uh philosophy reading</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:28.960" style="s2">mathematics and then</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.759" end="00:06:32.319" style="s2">this kind of spark of creation</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.960" end="00:06:34.080" style="s2">um uh emerged in my mind and i was able</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.319" end="00:06:35.919" style="s2">to produce this</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.080" end="00:06:37.360" style="s2">and i wrote much of it while i was in</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.919" end="00:06:40.319" style="s2">germany um</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.360" end="00:06:41.919" style="s2">which was a fun experience too well</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.319" end="00:06:43.759" style="s2">could you could you give us just like</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.919" end="00:06:45.199" style="s2">what what is the main takeaway from and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.759" end="00:06:47.199" style="s2">i know it&#39;s impossible to summarize the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.199" end="00:06:48.880" style="s2">dissertation in a couple of minutes but</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.199" end="00:06:50.240" style="s2">it&#39;s important because i believe at the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.880" end="00:06:51.840" style="s2">time you know you&#39;re studying you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.240" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">getting your phd you&#39;re working on all</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.840" end="00:06:53.840" style="s2">this you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:56.639" style="s2">you&#39;re heavily influenced by what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.840" end="00:06:58.400" style="s2">working on and that actually turned into</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.639" end="00:07:00.000" style="s2">sort of where you are now right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.400" end="00:07:00.319" style="s2">a there&#39;s a few direct steps that have</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.000" end="00:07:02.560" style="s2">led</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.319" end="00:07:05.039" style="s2">from that work to where you are and and</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.560" end="00:07:06.639" style="s2">i&#39;m very interested just to hear</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.039" end="00:07:08.080" style="s2">you know you said you were inspired and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.639" end="00:07:09.039" style="s2">it was a great you know the thing you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.080" end="00:07:11.520" style="s2">most proud of what</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.039" end="00:07:13.199" style="s2">what is it what if if somebody read it</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.520" end="00:07:13.680" style="s2">what what do you hope that they take</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.199" end="00:07:15.759" style="s2">away</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.680" end="00:07:17.680" style="s2">from it uh you know that you&#39;re so proud</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.759" end="00:07:21.039" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.680" end="00:07:24.800" style="s2">well i think it gives a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.039" end="00:07:28.080" style="s2">um deep and original account</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.800" end="00:07:30.400" style="s2">of the structure modernity in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.080" end="00:07:31.440" style="s2">illuminates the circumstances that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.400" end="00:07:35.759" style="s2">in today</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.440" end="00:07:39.039" style="s2">at the broadest level how various</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.759" end="00:07:42.400" style="s2">developments in kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.039" end="00:07:44.000" style="s2">science and mathematics and technology</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.400" end="00:07:45.680" style="s2">and the preconditions of those</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.000" end="00:07:49.280" style="s2">developments and how</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.680" end="00:07:52.400" style="s2">those preconditions themselves shape</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.280" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">society in all kinds of</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.400" end="00:07:57.280" style="s2">different ways to really understand</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:08:00.080" style="s2">fundamentally the moment we&#39;re in now</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.280" end="00:08:00.800" style="s2">with technology and its meaning and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.080" end="00:08:03.440" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.800" end="00:08:05.039" style="s2">you really have to go to the root of</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.440" end="00:08:08.720" style="s2">what happened in modernity</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.039" end="00:08:09.520" style="s2">and to be able to give a really powerful</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.720" end="00:08:12.639" style="s2">account</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.520" end="00:08:13.599" style="s2">for that and to give that account</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.639" end="00:08:16.160" style="s2">through the lens</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.599" end="00:08:17.680" style="s2">of a particular conception of what</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.160" end="00:08:20.080" style="s2">mathematics is</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.680" end="00:08:22.240" style="s2">now people might hear that and think oh</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.080" end="00:08:23.840" style="s2">you know he&#39;s just like is he trying to</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.240" end="00:08:25.440" style="s2">you know reduce the world to some kind</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.840" end="00:08:27.759" style="s2">of math formula no</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.440" end="00:08:30.720" style="s2">in fact this robust conception of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.759" end="00:08:34.560" style="s2">mathematics seduced by heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.720" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">is a precondition for the understanding</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.560" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">of mathematics in terms of number</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:44.000" style="s2">so um so it&#39;s it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:46.160" style="s2">uh uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.000" end="00:08:48.160" style="s2">foundational in that respect</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.160" end="00:08:50.800" style="s2">and of course different people would get</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.160" end="00:08:53.519" style="s2">different things out of it depending on</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.800" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">um you know what their background is i</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.519" end="00:08:56.640" style="s2">mean i think</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">there is such a thing as sort of false</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.640" end="00:09:00.320" style="s2">credentialism</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:01.279" style="s2">and hiding ideas within jargon and</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.320" end="00:09:04.399" style="s2">that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.279" end="00:09:07.040" style="s2">largely obfuscatory and usually you can</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.399" end="00:09:08.080" style="s2">explain things in much more simpler term</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:10.560" style="s2">in much simpler</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.080" end="00:09:11.920" style="s2">terms than usually presented by you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.560" end="00:09:15.120" style="s2">academic types</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.920" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">but at the same time um for stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.120" end="00:09:19.200" style="s2">this there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:20.480" style="s2">something to be said for a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.200" end="00:09:23.519" style="s2">background</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.480" end="00:09:26.320" style="s2">knowledge of the history of philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.519" end="00:09:27.760" style="s2">which and the more that one has that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.320" end="00:09:29.440" style="s2">the more that once kind of thought</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.760" end="00:09:32.399" style="s2">through those questions i think</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.440" end="00:09:33.040" style="s2">the more one gets out of it but um i</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.399" end="00:09:35.680" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.040" end="00:09:36.399" style="s2">particularly with heidegger who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.680" end="00:09:38.480" style="s2">generally</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.399" end="00:09:39.600" style="s2">you know other than the kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.480" end="00:09:42.399" style="s2">political</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.600" end="00:09:42.880" style="s2">controversy uh surrounding him which</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.399" end="00:09:46.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.880" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">belabor at infinitum he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.240" end="00:09:50.640" style="s2">associated with a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.399" end="00:09:51.519" style="s2">continental european school of</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.640" end="00:09:55.360" style="s2">philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.519" end="00:09:58.640" style="s2">that uh is kind of criticized as being</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.360" end="00:10:01.839" style="s2">more obscure and that</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.640" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">um it might be responsible for</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.839" end="00:10:06.800" style="s2">certain academics today who hide their</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">own kind of mediocrity and lack of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.800" end="00:10:10.880" style="s2">originality</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:13.519" style="s2">in um in jargon</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.880" end="00:10:15.040" style="s2">and that&#39;s true 99 percent of the time</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.519" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">in fact many of the people who study</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.040" end="00:10:18.800" style="s2">heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:19.200" style="s2">are trash and have weak minds but i</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.800" end="00:10:21.600" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.720" style="s2">in in this particular case heidegger</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.600" end="00:10:24.800" style="s2">himself</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.720" end="00:10:26.320" style="s2">truly is a deeply profound thinker i</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.800" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">think he&#39;s the greatest thinker of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.320" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">20th century</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.519" style="s2">there&#39;s so much to be learned from him</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">and what the sad thing is</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.519" end="00:10:38.160" style="s2">is that his language is a little bit um</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:41.120" style="s2">weird and different and so people who</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.160" end="00:10:41.600" style="s2">when they see that type of language in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.120" end="00:10:43.360" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.600" end="00:10:44.800" style="s2">normally it&#39;s in the context of</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.360" end="00:10:48.560" style="s2">something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.800" end="00:10:50.720" style="s2">trash and obscurantist it takes</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.560" end="00:10:52.640" style="s2">a big commitment to actually give them a</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.720" end="00:10:55.680" style="s2">chance to figure out wow</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.640" end="00:10:59.040" style="s2">this is maybe with a one in a million</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.680" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">case where this new and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.040" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">kind of bizarre language is actually</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:05.760" style="s2">necessary because it&#39;s bringing to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:08.959" style="s2">fore</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.760" end="00:11:10.399" style="s2">an entirely new concept and</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.959" end="00:11:12.240" style="s2">do you think that you could summarize</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.399" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">for us what the concept was i mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.240" end="00:11:15.279" style="s2">my listeners to the podcast we have</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.360" style="s2">talked to michael</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.279" end="00:11:18.320" style="s2">uh michael millerman we have gone in</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.360" end="00:11:21.200" style="s2">depth on</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.320" end="00:11:21.760" style="s2">uh heidegger strauss dugan etc and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.200" end="00:11:23.440" style="s2">there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.760" end="00:11:25.040" style="s2">there&#39;s some context for our listeners</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.440" end="00:11:26.800" style="s2">here and i you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.040" end="00:11:28.320" style="s2">after talking to millerman i realized i</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.800" end="00:11:29.040" style="s2">needed to learn a little bit more about</p>

<p begin="00:11:29.040" end="00:11:33.680" style="s2">myself and uh so if there&#39;s a there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.240" end="00:11:35.360" style="s2">just a way you could maybe summarize</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.680" end="00:11:36.640" style="s2">that for us and then uh you know talk</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.360" end="00:11:38.320" style="s2">about what happened</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.640" end="00:11:39.839" style="s2">to you after that and where did this</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.320" end="00:11:41.760" style="s2">work lead you</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.839" end="00:11:43.440" style="s2">right well i mean it depends in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.760" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">case what the concept is because</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.440" end="00:11:48.800" style="s2">heidegger has developed a number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:52.639" style="s2">of different concepts and terminologies</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.800" end="00:11:54.800" style="s2">um if uh you mean the concept of math</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.639" end="00:11:56.000" style="s2">that i you know yeah the council math</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.800" end="00:11:57.680" style="s2">what was it that struck you the</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.000" end="00:11:59.519" style="s2">most that that has led you to this</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.680" end="00:12:01.120" style="s2">conclusion that one in a million let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.519" end="00:12:04.720" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.120" end="00:12:08.720" style="s2">well his pre his conception of math</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.720" end="00:12:10.000" style="s2">um is really developed in a series of</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.720" end="00:12:13.279" style="s2">lectures about</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.000" end="00:12:15.600" style="s2">uh immanuel kant whose first</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.279" end="00:12:17.760" style="s2">critique was very much a kind of work of</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.600" end="00:12:20.160" style="s2">philosophy of mathematics or really</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.760" end="00:12:22.000" style="s2">the preconditions of thinking about the</p>

<p begin="00:12:22.000" end="00:12:29.519" style="s2">um are you know kind of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.040" end="00:12:30.880" style="s2">um and uh so within that context you</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.519" end="00:12:34.079" style="s2">know heidegger kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.880" end="00:12:35.680" style="s2">uses kant but kind of more as a pretext</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.079" end="00:12:37.760" style="s2">to riff on his own</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.680" end="00:12:40.399" style="s2">ideas and his own ideas math really</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.760" end="00:12:44.240" style="s2">hearken back to the greek conception</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.399" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">of you know mathemata</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.240" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">and you know interested listeners can</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">read say</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:51.600" style="s2">platonic dialogue on the meno which</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">actually explores this</p>

<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:13:00.959" style="s2">uh concept of memory and recollection</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.480" end="00:13:02.560" style="s2">has the same root as tamatha mata</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.959" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">because according to the greeks or at</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.560" end="00:13:06.959" style="s2">least the platonic representation of</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">greek thought which is not of course</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.959" end="00:13:11.360" style="s2">monolithic but the platonic</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:13.600" style="s2">representation of it</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.360" end="00:13:15.120" style="s2">is that learning is actually a process</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.600" end="00:13:18.000" style="s2">of recollection</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.120" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">this is what&#39;s explored in the meno and</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.000" end="00:13:20.079" style="s2">mathematics in the sense that we</p>

<p begin="00:13:24.160" end="00:13:27.680" style="s2">used to illustrate this point that</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.000" end="00:13:28.800" style="s2">learning is recollection and that</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.680" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.800" end="00:13:33.440" style="s2">mathematics lends itself to a certain</p>

<p begin="00:13:40.079" end="00:13:44.720" style="s2">they go into a really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.000" end="00:13:46.560" style="s2">kind of metaphysics as it were of saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.720" end="00:13:48.240" style="s2">that we&#39;re actually</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.240" end="00:13:51.600" style="s2">in past lives so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.600" end="00:13:53.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a whole interesting kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.600" end="00:13:56.639" style="s2">narrative to it as well that is not</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.760" end="00:13:57.600" style="s2">necessarily kind of essential to thought</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.639" end="00:13:59.680" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.600" end="00:14:01.120" style="s2">learning is kind of recollection and in</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.680" end="00:14:02.160" style="s2">fact the idea of learning as</p>

<p begin="00:14:02.160" end="00:14:07.199" style="s2">which is also uh you know kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.040" end="00:14:08.720" style="s2">kantian in the sense that in in kant&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.199" end="00:14:11.040" style="s2">version he talks about</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.720" end="00:14:13.199" style="s2">what types of structures need to be</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.040" end="00:14:15.920" style="s2">built into the mind</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.199" end="00:14:17.600" style="s2">uh in order for us to perceive reality</p>

<p begin="00:14:26.560" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">by virtue of</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.160" end="00:14:31.760" style="s2">uh noam chomsky whose theory of the</p>

<p begin="00:14:31.760" end="00:14:37.839" style="s2">says that you know language is not</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.680" end="00:14:40.480" style="s2">really taught or learned in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:14:37.839" end="00:14:42.639" style="s2">that all languages conform to a basic</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.480" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">structure of universal grammar</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.639" end="00:14:47.360" style="s2">that&#39;s already built into our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:50.800" style="s2">that kind of grows into us</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.360" end="00:14:52.399" style="s2">like like puberty and and so this idea</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.800" end="00:14:55.120" style="s2">of mathematics</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.399" end="00:14:56.880" style="s2">connected with learning but really</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.120" end="00:14:58.079" style="s2">connected with this idea of what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.880" end="00:15:01.440" style="s2">already built</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.079" end="00:15:05.120" style="s2">into us what&#39;s already there in advance</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.440" end="00:15:08.480" style="s2">that idea in advance um</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.120" end="00:15:12.800" style="s2">not precisely the same thing as a priori</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.480" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">but connected and so i appropriate this</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.800" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">idea of in advance and i say</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:19.120" style="s2">there are two fundamental structural</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:23.399" style="s2">features of modernity</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.120" end="00:15:26.880" style="s2">that i induce um uh namely</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.399" end="00:15:30.320" style="s2">self-grounding and self-reference</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.880" end="00:15:34.399" style="s2">which and you know grounding knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.320" end="00:15:36.320" style="s2">in itself is a kind of drawing upon what</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.399" end="00:15:37.759" style="s2">is already there in advance in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.320" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.759" end="00:15:43.120" style="s2">and by that i mean the the the key</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">example for that</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.120" end="00:15:51.040" style="s2">is uh descartes famous cogito</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:53.519" style="s2">which grounds knowledge of the world</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.040" end="00:15:56.519" style="s2">in the self-certainty of the self who is</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.519" end="00:15:58.880" style="s2">the possessor of that knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.519" end="00:16:01.120" style="s2">self-consciousness draws upon what is</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.880" end="00:16:02.639" style="s2">already there in advance namely the self</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.120" end="00:16:06.320" style="s2">who&#39;s doing the knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.639" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">so it&#39;s a particular type of</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.320" end="00:16:11.519" style="s2">uh uh uh reference to an in advance</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:13.600" style="s2">because what&#39;s already there in advance</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.519" end="00:16:16.320" style="s2">is the self who&#39;s doing the knowing</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.600" end="00:16:17.199" style="s2">and that is the ultimate ground for</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.320" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.199" end="00:16:23.199" style="s2">and so so that&#39;s sort of one version</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:23.959" style="s2">and that&#39;s what what grounds what we</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.199" end="00:16:26.639" style="s2">call</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.959" end="00:16:28.800" style="s2">subjectivity as everything&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.639" end="00:16:30.399" style="s2">this cartesian subject</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.800" end="00:16:32.480" style="s2">but then there&#39;s another dimension to</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.399" end="00:16:35.759" style="s2">this and that&#39;s the object sphere</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.480" end="00:16:38.240" style="s2">the subject understands the world as</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.759" end="00:16:40.320" style="s2">objects according to this framework</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.240" end="00:16:43.040" style="s2">and uh that&#39;s where kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.320" end="00:16:45.680" style="s2">newtonian element comes in</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.040" end="00:16:47.519" style="s2">and what does the in advance</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.680" end="00:16:48.079" style="s2">mathematical have to do with the</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.519" end="00:16:51.199" style="s2">so-called</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.079" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">object sphere of newtonian space</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.199" end="00:16:58.240" style="s2">and so i go into that and i show how</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:17:01.600" style="s2">the particular type of modeling of</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.240" end="00:17:04.720" style="s2">the natural world that&#39;s a precondition</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.600" end="00:17:05.199" style="s2">for the newtonian conception conforms to</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.720" end="00:17:08.319" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.199" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">in advance idea and lends itself to a</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.319" end="00:17:11.600" style="s2">very specific type of mathematical</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.600" end="00:17:15.199" style="s2">the ability to grasp the physical world</p>

<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:23.120" style="s2">and putting those two things together</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.720" end="00:17:27.120" style="s2">actually quite interesting because</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.120" end="00:17:29.360" style="s2">you have both the subject</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.120" end="00:17:31.440" style="s2">and the object sphere and people you</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.360" end="00:17:32.960" style="s2">know usually even in colloquial</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.440" end="00:17:35.679" style="s2">understanding think of</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.960" end="00:17:36.160" style="s2">the subject and the object as to kind of</p>

<p begin="00:17:41.600" end="00:17:46.080" style="s2">but actually this shows that both the</p>

<p begin="00:17:46.080" end="00:17:52.559" style="s2">object mode of thinking of</p>

<p begin="00:18:00.880" end="00:18:05.919" style="s2">advance</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.640" end="00:18:07.360" style="s2">and yeah so anyway i can well i was</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.919" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">going to ask you is this related to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.360" end="00:18:10.960" style="s2">heidegger&#39;s concept of jason</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:13.840" style="s2">like that that is what i would took away</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.960" end="00:18:15.760" style="s2">from my conversation with</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.840" end="00:18:17.200" style="s2">down to heidegger which is as i</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.760" end="00:18:19.440" style="s2">understood it was</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.200" end="00:18:20.720" style="s2">sort of the state of being before</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.440" end="00:18:23.919" style="s2">becoming aware</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.720" end="00:18:26.960" style="s2">is that right um sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:29.600" style="s2">um so so this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.960" end="00:18:30.960" style="s2">uh you&#39;re referring to heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:29.600" end="00:18:35.280" style="s2">concept of</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.960" end="00:18:38.080" style="s2">design dozen d-a-s-e-i-n</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.280" end="00:18:39.200" style="s2">now this is you know in in very</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.080" end="00:18:41.679" style="s2">interesting ways</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.200" end="00:18:43.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a trans you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.679" end="00:18:47.120" style="s2">coin it&#39;s a heidigarian</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.440" end="00:18:49.840" style="s2">coinage but it draws upon very simple</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.120" end="00:18:50.880" style="s2">german words well simple in a certain</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.840" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.880" end="00:18:58.000" style="s2">um da literally means</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:19:02.320" style="s2">there um so</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.000" end="00:19:05.360" style="s2">uh yeah vlsind da means we are</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.320" end="00:19:08.840" style="s2">there uh da is simply there</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.360" end="00:19:12.480" style="s2">and zein is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.840" end="00:19:16.559" style="s2">being being</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.480" end="00:19:20.640" style="s2">and so dozen simply means being</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.559" end="00:19:22.880" style="s2">there and um</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.640" end="00:19:24.000" style="s2">of course that doesn&#39;t even begin to</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.880" end="00:19:26.240" style="s2">kind of give a sense</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.000" end="00:19:27.280" style="s2">of what it means in the heideggerian</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.240" end="00:19:31.520" style="s2">context but</p>
<p begin="00:19:27.280" end="00:19:34.720" style="s2">being there is it refers to a specific</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.520" end="00:19:38.640" style="s2">mode of existing</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.720" end="00:19:41.440" style="s2">being a specific mode of existing</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.640" end="00:19:43.760" style="s2">in the world and a whole kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.440" end="00:19:45.919" style="s2">contextual ecology</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.760" end="00:19:47.200" style="s2">that can support a certain way of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.919" end="00:19:52.400" style="s2">existing</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.200" end="00:19:54.640" style="s2">in the world i think that um</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.400" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">maybe the context that you&#39;re describing</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.640" end="00:19:59.679" style="s2">is one that refers to</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.480" style="s2">being in time his first you know major</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.679" end="00:20:02.159" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.480" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">in which there are different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.159" end="00:20:06.799" style="s2">modes of relationship to being there</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:08.799" style="s2">referring to you know different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.799" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">levels of awareness and consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.799" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">and self-awareness so there&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:14.320" style="s2">present at hand ready to hand and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:16.080" style="s2">forth</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.320" end="00:20:17.679" style="s2">you know maybe you don&#39;t need to get</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.080" end="00:20:20.799" style="s2">into all that but the</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.679" end="00:20:24.159" style="s2">the term dozy refers to a specific</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.799" end="00:20:28.640" style="s2">mode of being and</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.159" end="00:20:31.280" style="s2">it&#39;s related to heidegger&#39;s idea that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.640" end="00:20:33.600" style="s2">man is the shepherd of being in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.280" end="00:20:38.240" style="s2">sense that</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.600" end="00:20:42.960" style="s2">being as such is</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.240" end="00:20:45.840" style="s2">transmuted through dozen human beings</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.960" end="00:20:46.240" style="s2">special relation to the world is that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.840" end="00:20:49.440" style="s2">they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.240" end="00:20:50.720" style="s2">kind of the house of being or even a</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.440" end="00:20:54.000" style="s2">vessel through which</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.720" end="00:20:57.039" style="s2">being expresses itself and that is</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.000" end="00:21:00.159" style="s2">kind of the unique feature not</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.039" end="00:21:04.799" style="s2">of human beings but of design</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.159" end="00:21:07.200" style="s2">human being only only human beings can</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.799" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">act as dazzling but human beings aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.200" end="00:21:11.840" style="s2">necessarily dozen</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:13.039" style="s2">and it&#39;s in fact one of heidegger&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.840" end="00:21:15.919" style="s2">concerns</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.039" end="00:21:16.480" style="s2">is that precisely the transformation of</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.919" end="00:21:19.039" style="s2">man&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.480" end="00:21:20.400" style="s2">being in the world inaugurated by</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.039" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">modernity</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.400" end="00:21:24.880" style="s2">and cultivated in you know culminating</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:28.320" style="s2">in technological modernity</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.880" end="00:21:32.080" style="s2">threatens man&#39;s capacity to exist</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.320" end="00:21:35.200" style="s2">as dazine and simply becomes</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.080" end="00:21:38.240" style="s2">another being another</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.200" end="00:21:40.320" style="s2">piece of material as it were another</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.240" end="00:21:44.400" style="s2">resource in fact he even</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.320" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">invokes the now familiar concept</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.400" end="00:21:47.679" style="s2">of human resources</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.840" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">um so hr is in a deep philosophical way</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.720" end="00:21:57.440" style="s2">opposed to man&#39;s uh uh best mode of</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:22:00.799" style="s2">being which is as</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.440" end="00:22:01.360" style="s2">dazzling and so i mean this is something</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.799" end="00:22:04.080" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.360" end="00:22:04.880" style="s2">you know i&#39;ve been i&#39;m very busy these</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.080" end="00:22:07.200" style="s2">days and</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.880" end="00:22:08.240" style="s2">and i haven&#39;t really you know talked</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.200" end="00:22:12.159" style="s2">about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.240" end="00:22:16.559" style="s2">for years but ultimately i really would</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.159" end="00:22:18.480" style="s2">um like to maybe do a series of lectures</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.559" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">really kind of explaining all of these</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.480" end="00:22:22.080" style="s2">things because</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.679" end="00:22:25.280" style="s2">i hate the idea that people think of it</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.080" end="00:22:28.799" style="s2">as obscurantist or there&#39;s nothing there</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.280" end="00:22:31.760" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot there um i mean i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.799" end="00:22:32.480" style="s2">you know i try to be humble but i but i</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.760" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">am a you know</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.480" end="00:22:36.559" style="s2">very perceptive person very talented</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.400" end="00:22:38.400" style="s2">person i spent a lot of time on this</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.559" end="00:22:40.159" style="s2">and i can say that this is you know the</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.400" end="00:22:42.640" style="s2">most uh</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:43.840" style="s2">profound thinker that i&#39;ve ever um</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.640" end="00:22:48.159" style="s2">encountered by far</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.840" end="00:22:51.360" style="s2">and has really fundamentally shaped um</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.159" end="00:22:52.559" style="s2">my understanding of the world so yeah i</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.360" end="00:22:54.240" style="s2">think that that to me</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.559" end="00:22:55.760" style="s2">is fascinating and i would like to maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.240" end="00:22:56.960" style="s2">talk to you another time and dig down on</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.760" end="00:22:59.679" style="s2">this a little bit deeper</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.960" end="00:23:02.000" style="s2">and uh i&#39;ve been reading this book</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.679" end="00:23:03.760" style="s2">horribly titled the war for eternity</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.000" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">about about bannon</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.760" end="00:23:08.880" style="s2">uh and traditionalism and uh dugan</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.799" style="s2">and his experiences and i&#39;m hearing</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.880" end="00:23:13.679" style="s2">echoes of some of those thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.799" end="00:23:15.360" style="s2">uh in this conversation here too so</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.679" end="00:23:16.799" style="s2">maybe another time we&#39;ll dig deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.360" end="00:23:18.640" style="s2">the philosophy of it i</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.799" end="00:23:19.840" style="s2">am fascinated by it but i do know that</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.640" end="00:23:23.200" style="s2">we have a very</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.840" end="00:23:25.200" style="s2">timely topic to get to</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.200" end="00:23:26.640" style="s2">and i was i wanted to give people</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.200" end="00:23:29.520" style="s2">context on sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.640" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">how you operate and think and and from</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.520" end="00:23:32.799" style="s2">what depth</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.320" end="00:23:33.360" style="s2">you&#39;re approaching uh today&#39;s current</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.799" end="00:23:36.559" style="s2">events</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.360" end="00:23:40.159" style="s2">and the frame and to show that uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.559" end="00:23:43.440" style="s2">this is not um willy-nilly or haphazard</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.159" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">or click bait or whatever but this</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.440" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">these thoughts and your ideas and your</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:48.960" style="s2">perceptions of the world are are</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:50.799" style="s2">been developed and honed over time in a</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.960" end="00:23:52.720" style="s2">very rigorous way</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.799" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">and so you know in the nicest way</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.720" end="00:23:56.799" style="s2">possible i say you&#39;re very serious</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:59.440" style="s2">very serious man and what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.799" end="00:24:01.200" style="s2">talk about here is very serious stuff</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.440" end="00:24:02.880" style="s2">um and so i&#39;m going to move us through</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.200" end="00:24:04.960" style="s2">your timeline a little bit here</p>

<p begin="00:25:33.760" end="00:25:38.240" style="s2">after i kind of</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:40.080" style="s2">distinguished myself that way which</p>

<p begin="00:30:22.240" end="00:30:26.640" style="s2">and really paint the picture of what</p>

<p begin="00:31:34.480" end="00:31:40.480" style="s2">might get into as well which i think is</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.200" end="00:31:44.159" style="s2">maybe the greatest crime against</p>

<p begin="00:39:10.960" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">in this color revolution against trump</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.280" end="00:39:17.359" style="s2">since trump was elected nobody knew who</p>

<p begin="00:39:36.960" end="00:39:39.760" style="s2">been having a very interesting past</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.800" end="00:39:42.640" style="s2">couple of days</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.760" end="00:39:44.720" style="s2">he&#39;s very active on twitter now he&#39;s not</p>

<p begin="00:39:54.000" end="00:39:57.599" style="s2">says in the playbook well</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.680" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">first of all his justification for why</p>
<p begin="00:39:57.599" end="00:40:02.720" style="s2">this playbook is needed</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:05.200" style="s2">window of opportunity far-right populist</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.720" end="00:40:07.839" style="s2">parties many with illiberal tendencies</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.200" end="00:40:10.000" style="s2">have gained a toehold or the majority in</p>

<p begin="00:49:17.200" end="00:49:20.480" style="s2">does not have the interests of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:23.200" style="s2">american citizens</p>
<p begin="00:49:20.480" end="00:49:25.520" style="s2">at heart and it&#39;s interesting to see</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.200" end="00:49:28.559" style="s2">that these tactics that were developed</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.520" end="00:49:31.200" style="s2">abroad the playbook that was created by</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.559" end="00:49:32.720" style="s2">norm eisen was used in ukraine and</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.200" end="00:49:34.960" style="s2">belarus</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.720" end="00:49:36.079" style="s2">and it is something that is now being</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.960" end="00:49:39.200" style="s2">used on</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.079" end="00:49:42.880" style="s2">american citizens domestically and that</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.200" end="00:49:44.640" style="s2">is a fascinating highlight of how</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.880" end="00:49:45.920" style="s2">the trump administration is really an</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.640" end="00:49:49.280" style="s2">insurgency</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.920" end="00:49:52.400" style="s2">uh it is an insurgency against the</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.280" end="00:49:54.240" style="s2">uh the the existing uniparty</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.400" end="00:49:55.680" style="s2">welcome back darren the existing</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.240" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">uniparty uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.680" end="00:49:59.760" style="s2">and uh it&#39;s important to keep in mind</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:00.960" style="s2">that trump you know we all kind of wish</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.760" end="00:50:04.000" style="s2">that trump could</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.960" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">go in and wave a magic wand and</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.000" end="00:50:09.040" style="s2">uh affect all the change that he wants</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:12.319" style="s2">to to to do and all the reforms and</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.040" end="00:50:15.280" style="s2">and sort of do the whole maga agenda</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.319" end="00:50:16.720" style="s2">that he was launched by a network right</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.280" end="00:50:19.520" style="s2">because this is a network</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.720" end="00:50:22.240" style="s2">uh candidate network presidency he was a</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.520" end="00:50:24.480" style="s2">an outsider a revolutionary basically a</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.240" end="00:50:26.240" style="s2">weapon that was launched into government</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.480" end="00:50:27.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s important to realize that</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.240" end="00:50:30.800" style="s2">he is constantly</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.599" end="00:50:33.520" style="s2">fighting a struggle on the inside uh</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.800" end="00:50:35.599" style="s2">from people who ostensibly report to him</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.520" end="00:50:38.000" style="s2">within the executive branch</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.599" end="00:50:40.480" style="s2">uh from people that are supposed to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.000" end="00:50:42.079" style="s2">uh carrying out his orders uh and</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.480" end="00:50:44.720" style="s2">carrying out his agenda</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.079" end="00:50:45.280" style="s2">but instead you know he is fighting not</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.720" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">only</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.280" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">the people uh you know on the streets</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">and and blm</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:52.640" style="s2">and antifa and all this but also</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">internally and so darren what i wanted</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.640" end="00:50:56.640" style="s2">to do was tie together</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">uh this comparison between us in the</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.640" end="00:50:59.200" style="s2">state department utilizing the playbook</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:01.280" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.200" end="00:51:02.400" style="s2">foreign elections abroad and in foreign</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.280" end="00:51:03.920" style="s2">countries abroad</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.400" end="00:51:05.520" style="s2">so we&#39;re sort of like the outside</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.920" end="00:51:08.640" style="s2">invading force there</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.520" end="00:51:09.920" style="s2">right uh by by subverting the elections</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.640" end="00:51:11.520" style="s2">in these other countries</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.920" end="00:51:13.680" style="s2">but now we&#39;re using these same</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.520" end="00:51:16.640" style="s2">strategies and tactics and operations</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.680" end="00:51:18.000" style="s2">on ourselves domestically and what is</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.640" end="00:51:20.160" style="s2">this what does it say</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.000" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">that if our own government is using</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.160" end="00:51:25.680" style="s2">these sort of anti-democratic measures</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:27.920" style="s2">on our own democratic process</p>
<p begin="00:51:25.680" end="00:51:29.040" style="s2">what does that tell us about the nature</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.920" end="00:51:31.119" style="s2">and condition</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.040" end="00:51:33.520" style="s2">of politics in our government you know</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.119" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">in general and who is really ruling us</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.520" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">and where do they get their authority</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:38.800" style="s2">and how do they maintain</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.079" end="00:51:39.520" style="s2">it right now that&#39;s a great question and</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.800" end="00:51:41.599" style="s2">i think</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.520" end="00:51:42.559" style="s2">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a process that really</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.599" end="00:51:46.000" style="s2">began</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.559" end="00:51:48.240" style="s2">um you know in 2015 um</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.000" end="00:51:50.240" style="s2">when you know trump announces candidacy</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.240" end="00:51:53.040" style="s2">and conducted a very unconventional</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.240" end="00:51:54.960" style="s2">type of campaign that you know shocked</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.040" end="00:51:57.839" style="s2">everyone and certainly shocked</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.960" end="00:51:58.640" style="s2">these people like norm eisen into terror</p>

<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:28.800" style="s2">a great guy and and basically what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.760" end="00:54:32.880" style="s2">happened is</p>
<p begin="00:54:28.800" end="00:54:35.680" style="s2">the internet that existed in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:54:32.880" end="00:54:37.599" style="s2">doesn&#39;t exist anymore and just the</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.680" end="00:54:40.640" style="s2">profundity of that is it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.599" end="00:54:43.839" style="s2">it&#39;s incredible this is the internet</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.640" end="00:54:47.280" style="s2">does not exist</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.839" end="00:54:50.319" style="s2">in the same form that it existed in 2015</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.280" end="00:54:52.079" style="s2">and um and</p>
<p begin="00:54:50.319" end="00:54:54.720" style="s2">it&#39;s just because the internet</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.079" end="00:54:57.680" style="s2">effectively harvested</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.720" end="00:54:59.200" style="s2">and channeled the energies associated</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.680" end="00:55:01.200" style="s2">with the brexit victory</p>
<p begin="00:54:59.200" end="00:55:04.160" style="s2">and with the trump victory and it gave</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.200" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">the people a kind of voice to combat</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.160" end="00:55:08.799" style="s2">you know the oligarchs that want to keep</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:10.799" style="s2">control over things and just</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.799" end="00:55:13.040" style="s2">you know prevent people from not only</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.799" end="00:55:15.119" style="s2">having a say but having any</p>
<p begin="00:55:13.040" end="00:55:17.200" style="s2">real understanding of what&#39;s going on it</p>
<p begin="00:55:15.119" end="00:55:18.400" style="s2">has to all come from their organs of</p>

<p begin="00:55:18.400" end="00:55:22.640" style="s2">and you see them calling for that now uh</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.559" end="00:55:25.119" style="s2">hillary clinton just tweeted</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.640" end="00:55:26.400" style="s2">yesterday that you know basically</p>

<p begin="00:55:30.640" end="00:55:34.079" style="s2">up to the election</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.760" end="00:55:35.680" style="s2">so that is to ensure that you know</p>

<p begin="00:55:35.680" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">present</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.240" end="00:55:41.599" style="s2">is effectively the narrative in a very</p>

<p begin="00:55:46.839" end="00:55:51.359" style="s2">so yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s very disturbing</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.760" end="00:55:53.200" style="s2">and just getting back to what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:55:51.359" end="00:55:54.079" style="s2">saying about like the power structure</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.200" end="00:55:57.280" style="s2">generally</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.079" end="00:55:57.760" style="s2">is just as we&#39;re all like now required</p>

<p begin="00:56:11.920" end="00:56:16.880" style="s2">basically revealing itself and in a way</p>

<p begin="00:56:16.880" end="00:56:23.040" style="s2">clarifying but in a way it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:56:23.040" end="00:56:29.440" style="s2">they don&#39;t even need the illusions that</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.880" end="00:56:30.079" style="s2">they used to rely upon in the 20th</p>

<p begin="00:56:30.079" end="00:56:33.520" style="s2">and so forth they used to need illusion</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.559" end="00:56:36.319" style="s2">they needed</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.520" end="00:56:37.440" style="s2">kind of false narrative to make things</p>

<p begin="00:57:14.240" end="00:57:18.400" style="s2">need to take precautions it&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.200" end="00:57:21.760" style="s2">deadlier than</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.760" end="00:57:26.400" style="s2">but the idea of shutting down the entire</p>

<p begin="00:57:26.400" end="00:57:33.760" style="s2">indefinitely over this is unprecedented</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:36.960" style="s2">and so absurd it</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.760" end="00:57:39.280" style="s2">goes into the militias and um</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.960" end="00:57:40.760" style="s2">this is maybe like one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.280" end="00:57:44.000" style="s2">important studies that</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.760" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">revolver.news did by three</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.000" end="00:57:50.559" style="s2">phds two of whom uh in economics</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:51.520" style="s2">who have to publish pseudonymously</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.559" end="00:57:53.440" style="s2">because this</p>

<p begin="00:57:53.440" end="00:57:59.520" style="s2">so if you question this kind of thing</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.400" end="00:58:01.040" style="s2">you threaten a large amount of uh</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.520" end="00:58:03.119" style="s2">grant money and that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.040" end="00:58:06.000" style="s2">unfortunately the nature of that</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.119" end="00:58:07.680" style="s2">of that profession is corrupted by money</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.000" end="00:58:10.799" style="s2">just like everything else</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.680" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">but the analysis speaks for itself this</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.799" end="00:58:14.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:17.440" style="s2">on revolver.news the analysis</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.960" end="00:58:19.040" style="s2">was retweeted by the president and</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.440" end="00:58:21.839" style="s2">basically it does</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.040" end="00:58:23.280" style="s2">a rundown on the damage of these</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.839" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">lockdowns</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.280" end="00:58:26.960" style="s2">and shows that the lockdowns have been</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:29.680" style="s2">far more deadly</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.960" end="00:58:30.960" style="s2">than the disease and i use deadly in a</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.680" end="00:58:33.280" style="s2">real way they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.960" end="00:58:34.480" style="s2">they&#39;ve led to the loss of more life</p>

<p begin="00:58:34.480" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">by a factor of 10 than the virus itself</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.400" end="00:58:42.559" style="s2">and you know i encourage people to go</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">look at it it&#39;s very rigorous it&#39;s or</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.559" end="00:58:47.440" style="s2">the methodology is quite plain</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:47.839" style="s2">but just conceptually what your readers</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.440" end="00:58:50.960" style="s2">or</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.839" end="00:58:53.520" style="s2">your listeners should know is this idea</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.960" end="00:58:53.920" style="s2">of disaggregating the economy from</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.520" end="00:58:56.880" style="s2">health</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.920" end="00:58:57.760" style="s2">is totally false it&#39;s totally false</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.880" end="00:59:00.799" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.760" end="00:59:05.040" style="s2">economic devastation</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.799" end="00:59:07.200" style="s2">leads necessarily to health consequences</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.040" end="00:59:08.960" style="s2">there&#39;s an established economic</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.200" end="00:59:11.680" style="s2">literature out there</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.960" end="00:59:12.960" style="s2">showing quite conclusively that any</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.680" end="00:59:16.000" style="s2">marginal increase</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.960" end="00:59:18.319" style="s2">in say unemployment leads to marginal</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.000" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">increases in health effects either from</p>
<p begin="00:59:18.319" end="00:59:23.280" style="s2">suicide either from not having the money</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:26.480" style="s2">to get necessary medical treatment</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.280" end="00:59:28.400" style="s2">and so forth so there&#39;s no such thing as</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.480" end="00:59:30.960" style="s2">damage to mere economy</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.400" end="00:59:31.760" style="s2">or prioritizing people&#39;s health over the</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.960" end="00:59:34.559" style="s2">economy</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.760" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">the economy is people&#39;s health you</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.559" end="00:59:40.720" style="s2">cannot disaggregate</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:43.760" style="s2">people&#39;s lives from their livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.720" end="00:59:45.599" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s just very it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.760" end="00:59:47.839" style="s2">simple important thing that you would</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.599" end="00:59:50.319" style="s2">think if we were a serious country</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.839" end="00:59:51.920" style="s2">we would employ serious kind of public</p>
<p begin="00:59:50.319" end="00:59:54.880" style="s2">policy analysis</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.920" end="00:59:55.640" style="s2">but and and it just a like a a</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.880" end="00:59:58.480" style="s2">politically</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.640" end="00:59:58.960" style="s2">uncontroversial example that uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.480" end="01:00:01.200" style="s2">given</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.960" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">in the revolver.news report is in</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.200" end="01:00:06.240" style="s2">transportation policy</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:08.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s say that you know you</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.240" end="01:00:10.400" style="s2">you just like we&#39;re basically shutting</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.400" end="01:00:13.200" style="s2">down the entire economy to pro</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.400" end="01:00:13.839" style="s2">you know to prevent you know any nine</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.200" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">year</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.839" end="01:00:18.000" style="s2">90 year old with seven comorbidities</p>
<p begin="01:00:16.319" end="01:00:20.640" style="s2">from you know to prolong his life for</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.000" end="01:00:22.799" style="s2">another week</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.640" end="01:00:24.240" style="s2">let&#39;s just assume that that&#39;s you know</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.799" end="01:00:27.040" style="s2">the right policy so</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.240" end="01:00:28.240" style="s2">let&#39;s look at air travel and say we want</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.040" end="01:00:31.200" style="s2">to make sure we&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.240" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">everything we can to ensure that you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.200" end="01:00:34.880" style="s2">know there are no</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:36.960" style="s2">air accidents we&#39;re willing to impose</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.880" end="01:00:38.559" style="s2">any regulation imaginable</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.960" end="01:00:40.480" style="s2">and so you say okay we&#39;re going to we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.559" end="01:00:42.240" style="s2">going to do all these regulations this</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.480" end="01:00:44.960" style="s2">is from a real case</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.240" end="01:00:46.880" style="s2">we can do all these regulations but</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.960" end="01:00:49.839" style="s2">regulations are not</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.880" end="01:00:51.440" style="s2">uh free they translate into higher costs</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.839" end="01:00:54.720" style="s2">for air travel</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.440" end="01:00:56.559" style="s2">so now air travel is prohibitively</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.720" end="01:00:58.079" style="s2">expensive for most people</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.559" end="01:01:00.319" style="s2">and so a bunch of people take</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.079" end="01:01:02.960" style="s2">alternative forms of transportation</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.319" end="01:01:03.760" style="s2">that are far more dangerous than air</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.960" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">travel was</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.760" end="01:01:11.520" style="s2">before the regulations were instated so</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:14.480" style="s2">whereas you may have saved life years</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.520" end="01:01:17.920" style="s2">looking simply at air travel the</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.480" end="01:01:22.240" style="s2">transportation industry at large</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.920" end="01:01:24.240" style="s2">you&#39;re leading to a lot more deaths yeah</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.240" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">yeah i think i think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.240" end="01:01:27.440" style="s2">major deficit of second order thinking</p>

<p begin="01:01:27.440" end="01:01:30.720" style="s2">all over the country and uh you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.079" end="01:01:32.559" style="s2">back in</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.720" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">february when this was starting to break</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.559" end="01:01:35.359" style="s2">you know i i was very active on twitter</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:38.160" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.359" end="01:01:39.839" style="s2">and you know i i saw the shutdowns</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.160" end="01:01:41.280" style="s2">coming i didn&#39;t know if it was the right</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.839" end="01:01:42.720" style="s2">thing or the wrong thing and i still</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.280" end="01:01:43.280" style="s2">don&#39;t necessarily have a position on the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.720" end="01:01:45.280" style="s2">virus</p>
<p begin="01:01:43.280" end="01:01:47.040" style="s2">i&#39;ve always been focused more on like</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.280" end="01:01:49.200" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen to us like</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.040" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">logistically speaking and it&#39;s clear</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.200" end="01:01:52.000" style="s2">that we&#39;re living through a national</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:54.799" style="s2">tragedy of some kind right</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.000" end="01:01:55.280" style="s2">now one for the history books for sure</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.799" end="01:01:57.760" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.280" end="01:01:59.200" style="s2">certainly it has second or a failure</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.760" end="01:02:02.400" style="s2">second-order thinking</p>
<p begin="01:01:59.200" end="01:02:04.079" style="s2">to it but what i find fascinating also</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.400" end="01:02:06.079" style="s2">in the context of this larger</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.079" end="01:02:07.039" style="s2">conversation we&#39;re having about the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:06.079" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">insurgency</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.039" end="01:02:11.359" style="s2">trump&#39;s insurgency that the counter</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:13.200" style="s2">insurgency from the deep state</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.359" end="01:02:14.720" style="s2">uh this this sort of who&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.200" end="01:02:16.240" style="s2">revolutionary here</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.720" end="01:02:17.599" style="s2">there there has been a lot of first</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.240" end="01:02:20.000" style="s2">second and third order thinking that</p>
<p begin="01:02:17.599" end="01:02:23.359" style="s2">goes into the preparation and planning</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.000" end="01:02:24.160" style="s2">for the resistance to trump so by that i</p>
<p begin="01:02:23.359" end="01:02:26.160" style="s2">mean</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.160" end="01:02:27.920" style="s2">there has been a conditioning right</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.160" end="01:02:30.000" style="s2">where to take away</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.920" end="01:02:31.680" style="s2">uh you know some liberties start</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.000" end="01:02:33.599" style="s2">infringing on free speech</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.680" end="01:02:35.599" style="s2">start training and guiding people to</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.599" end="01:02:37.920" style="s2">think that they don&#39;t have the right to</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.599" end="01:02:40.000" style="s2">just speak up or have their own thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.920" end="01:02:41.839" style="s2">or even start training people to think</p>
<p begin="01:02:40.000" end="01:02:43.440" style="s2">that your internal alarm</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.839" end="01:02:44.960" style="s2">instincts of when you&#39;re in a negative</p>
<p begin="01:02:43.440" end="01:02:46.000" style="s2">or just uncomfortable situation is</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.960" end="01:02:47.440" style="s2">something that should be listened and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.000" end="01:02:50.480" style="s2">honored right like that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:47.440" end="01:02:52.960" style="s2">element of anti-racist philosophy</p>
<p begin="01:02:50.480" end="01:02:53.680" style="s2">and whatnot or ideology religion</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.960" end="01:02:54.960" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.680" end="01:02:57.119" style="s2">uh where they tell you if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.960" end="01:02:59.520" style="s2">uncomfortable just ignore that your</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.119" end="01:03:00.559" style="s2">internal alarm bells are are wrong you</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.520" end="01:03:02.079" style="s2">shouldn&#39;t listen to it</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.559" end="01:03:04.400" style="s2">so i think that there&#39;s actually a lot</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.079" end="01:03:06.240" style="s2">of deeper uh second and third order</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.400" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">thinking going on here as people are</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.240" end="01:03:09.039" style="s2">trying to manipulate our country and to</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:12.160" style="s2">manipulate</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.039" end="01:03:15.200" style="s2">and and and basically control us so that</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.160" end="01:03:18.160" style="s2">this trump revolution uh is is</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.200" end="01:03:20.000" style="s2">unsuccessful and fails and i want to tie</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.160" end="01:03:22.799" style="s2">this all back together because</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.000" end="01:03:23.520" style="s2">you were saying that they before there</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.799" end="01:03:26.319" style="s2">was even</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.520" end="01:03:27.359" style="s2">a notion of an impeachable uh offense</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.319" end="01:03:29.039" style="s2">that they were already</p>
<p begin="01:03:27.359" end="01:03:30.799" style="s2">just planning how they were going to</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.039" end="01:03:33.839" style="s2">impeach him right like this is</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.799" end="01:03:37.200" style="s2">this is a systematic approach</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.839" end="01:03:40.559" style="s2">to reversing the electoral will</p>
<p begin="01:03:37.200" end="01:03:43.839" style="s2">of the people and they have the support</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.559" end="01:03:44.240" style="s2">of uh the the deep state the democratic</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.839" end="01:03:46.720" style="s2">party</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.240" end="01:03:48.559" style="s2">the leading candidates the corporations</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.720" end="01:03:50.720" style="s2">the foot soldiers on the ground</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.559" end="01:03:52.160" style="s2">academics that are pushing critical race</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.720" end="01:03:54.160" style="s2">theory and have been pushing</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.160" end="01:03:56.319" style="s2">radical feminism and intersectionality</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.160" end="01:03:57.280" style="s2">for for for years and years and years</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.319" end="01:04:01.359" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="01:03:57.280" end="01:04:04.640" style="s2">and so all this appears to be cohesive</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.359" end="01:04:08.079" style="s2">and comprehensive um do you</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.640" end="01:04:10.160" style="s2">think and let&#39;s not get too out there</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.079" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">you know if you&#39;ve got evidence or or or</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.160" end="01:04:12.319" style="s2">well thought out positions but do you do</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:15.440" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.319" end="01:04:18.240" style="s2">think is there a central source</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.440" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">of this coordinated effort against the</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.240" end="01:04:21.920" style="s2">trump revolution</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:23.760" style="s2">or is it just the spontaneous reaction</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.920" end="01:04:24.319" style="s2">of people who are in power being afraid</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.760" end="01:04:26.480" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.319" end="01:04:28.240" style="s2">losing power like how does this work is</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.480" end="01:04:30.880" style="s2">it directed is it emergent</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.240" end="01:04:32.960" style="s2">like it seems so thoughtful but is it</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.880" end="01:04:33.599" style="s2">all accidental like how does it work</p>
<p begin="01:04:32.960" end="01:04:36.559" style="s2">darren</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.599" end="01:04:37.520" style="s2">well i mean you know obviously i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.559" end="01:04:40.880" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.520" end="01:04:42.960" style="s2">you know i i don&#39;t have any videotapes</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.880" end="01:04:43.359" style="s2">of their secret meetings at least not</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.960" end="01:04:46.079" style="s2">yet</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.359" end="01:04:47.520" style="s2">but i but i think that we can engage in</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.079" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:47.520" end="01:04:51.119" style="s2">informed speculation as to how this</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:53.839" style="s2">going on first of all</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.119" end="01:04:55.280" style="s2">i think the color revolution thesis one</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.839" end="01:04:57.280" style="s2">of its advantages</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.280" end="01:04:59.599" style="s2">is it shows that there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.280" end="01:05:02.240" style="s2">built-in network of people who are used</p>
<p begin="01:04:59.599" end="01:05:05.760" style="s2">to operating in a particular way</p>
<p begin="01:05:02.240" end="01:05:08.160" style="s2">namely you know this nexus of</p>
<p begin="01:05:05.760" end="01:05:08.799" style="s2">so-called atlantis it involves like the</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.160" end="01:05:11.920" style="s2">atlantic</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.799" end="01:05:12.319" style="s2">council there are many many ngos many of</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.920" end="01:05:14.720" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.319" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">have democracy in the title so for</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.720" end="01:05:19.280" style="s2">instance one of the ngos</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:20.319" style="s2">is called the transatlantic democracy</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.280" end="01:05:22.240" style="s2">working group</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.319" end="01:05:24.640" style="s2">sort of an umbrella group for all of</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.240" end="01:05:26.240" style="s2">these kind of color revolution regime</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.640" end="01:05:30.000" style="s2">change organizations</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.240" end="01:05:32.559" style="s2">it&#39;s run believe it or not by normizen</p>
<p begin="01:05:30.000" end="01:05:34.720" style="s2">and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a group that&#39;s been very</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.559" end="01:05:36.400" style="s2">active in promoting the color revolution</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.720" end="01:05:38.000" style="s2">in belarus</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.400" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">you know and the so-called peaceful</p>
<p begin="01:05:38.000" end="01:05:42.720" style="s2">protesters in belarus</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:44.880" style="s2">and one twitter commenter said hey i it</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.720" end="01:05:46.960" style="s2">sounds like you&#39;re talking about america</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.880" end="01:05:48.319" style="s2">and the the twitter account for this</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.960" end="01:05:50.559" style="s2">organization said oh</p>
<p begin="01:05:48.319" end="01:05:53.359" style="s2">let&#39;s hope we&#39;re not talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.559" end="01:05:55.520" style="s2">the ghost of america&#39;s future</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.359" end="01:05:56.799" style="s2">and so very explicitly making this</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.520" end="01:06:00.480" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.799" end="01:06:02.319" style="s2">um so i think that there&#39;s a relevant</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.480" end="01:06:06.079" style="s2">point that there&#39;s already a</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.319" end="01:06:08.799" style="s2">network an infrastructure and a playbook</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.079" end="01:06:11.039" style="s2">in place so you don&#39;t really and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.799" end="01:06:13.440" style="s2">know a particular stake that they hold</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.039" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">in power structure in the united states</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.440" end="01:06:17.280" style="s2">so you have</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:19.280" style="s2">a lot of elements there and maybe in</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.280" end="01:06:21.359" style="s2">fact the color revolution model wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:06:19.280" end="01:06:22.400" style="s2">be the optimal model even to go against</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.359" end="01:06:25.520" style="s2">trump it&#39;s just that</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.400" end="01:06:28.319" style="s2">what they know and what they&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.520" end="01:06:28.640" style="s2">and so you so so what you have and you</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.319" end="01:06:30.880" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.640" end="01:06:32.079" style="s2">i&#39;m not suggesting that this is the only</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.880" end="01:06:35.280" style="s2">faction the american</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.079" end="01:06:37.119" style="s2">power structure is not you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.280" end="01:06:38.480" style="s2">it&#39;s i think you can think of it</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.119" end="01:06:40.720" style="s2">profitably</p>
<p begin="01:06:38.480" end="01:06:42.160" style="s2">as a kind of mafia and just like the</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.720" end="01:06:44.319" style="s2">mafia there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.160" end="01:06:45.440" style="s2">you know there are different mafia</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.319" end="01:06:48.319" style="s2">families there are different</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.440" end="01:06:50.400" style="s2">factions now they don&#39;t always agree</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.319" end="01:06:52.960" style="s2">with each other sometimes they disagree</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.400" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">vehemently sometimes they even go to</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.960" end="01:06:56.720" style="s2">you know into some kind of metaphorical</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">war but they&#39;re all kind of</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.720" end="01:07:01.119" style="s2">they coordinate for certain purposes and</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:02.079" style="s2">particularly when they have a common</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.119" end="01:07:04.240" style="s2">enemy</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.079" end="01:07:05.680" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not monolithic they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:08.400" style="s2">different factions</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.680" end="01:07:10.480" style="s2">one of the factions is the faction</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.400" end="01:07:12.799" style="s2">that&#39;s this atlanticist</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.480" end="01:07:14.559" style="s2">group and is all the constellation of</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.799" end="01:07:17.440" style="s2">ngos that are kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.559" end="01:07:18.079" style="s2">color revolution oriented the atlantic</p>

<p begin="01:07:29.760" end="01:07:33.520" style="s2">use all this weird russia stuff against</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.000" end="01:07:34.880" style="s2">trump that in fact there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.520" end="01:07:36.799" style="s2">like you could use a lot of other</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.880" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">countries if you wanted to tarnish trump</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.799" end="01:07:41.280" style="s2">why russia does it seems weird</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.039" end="01:07:42.960" style="s2">that&#39;s the playbook they&#39;re used to</p>
<p begin="01:07:41.280" end="01:07:44.880" style="s2">because they&#39;re used to doing this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.960" end="01:07:45.839" style="s2">in eastern europe and using russia as</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.880" end="01:07:48.240" style="s2">part of their model</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.839" end="01:07:49.760" style="s2">propaganda model so they&#39;re just using</p>
<p begin="01:07:48.240" end="01:07:52.720" style="s2">what they&#39;re used to so it</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.760" end="01:07:54.079" style="s2">it&#39;s like a copy paste almost copy paste</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.720" end="01:07:55.680" style="s2">color revolution</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.079" end="01:07:57.119" style="s2">from all the stuff that they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:07:55.680" end="01:07:59.520" style="s2">doing in eastern europe</p>
<p begin="01:07:57.119" end="01:08:01.760" style="s2">that they use oh this particular eastern</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.520" end="01:08:04.160" style="s2">european leader is a russian stooge</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.760" end="01:08:06.079" style="s2">oh this person&#39;s in cahoots with putin</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.160" end="01:08:07.280" style="s2">it&#39;s literally a copy and paste into</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.079" end="01:08:10.559" style="s2">trump where it makes</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.280" end="01:08:12.480" style="s2">absolutely no sense and so i think the</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.559" end="01:08:14.319" style="s2">the color revolution explains</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.480" end="01:08:16.480" style="s2">part of it and of course there&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.319" end="01:08:19.520" style="s2">broader power structure it involves</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.480" end="01:08:22.319" style="s2">you know the media it involves um</p>
<p begin="01:08:19.520" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">you know just large economic interests</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.319" end="01:08:25.600" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:28.080" style="s2">you know might be threatened by you know</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.600" end="01:08:29.679" style="s2">or maybe tied economically with china</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.080" end="01:08:30.159" style="s2">and so they don&#39;t like trump&#39;s china</p>
<p begin="01:08:29.679" end="01:08:31.920" style="s2">stuff</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.159" end="01:08:34.319" style="s2">like there are different components to</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.920" end="01:08:36.560" style="s2">it but i think you can kind of get an</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.319" end="01:08:39.199" style="s2">intuitive sense for how it would exist</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.560" end="01:08:40.480" style="s2">simply by noting that you know trump</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.199" end="01:08:44.239" style="s2">came into power with</p>
<p begin="01:08:40.480" end="01:08:46.880" style="s2">really kind of no elite constituency no</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.239" end="01:08:50.719" style="s2">faction really kind of on his side</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.880" end="01:08:53.040" style="s2">and so um just the idea that someone</p>
<p begin="01:08:50.719" end="01:08:54.880" style="s2">could come in kind of out of nowhere and</p>
<p begin="01:08:53.040" end="01:08:56.799" style="s2">disrupt things like that</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.880" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">is worrisome to the whole power</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.799" end="01:09:00.880" style="s2">structure every faction even if</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:02.080" style="s2">the factions themselves don&#39;t get along</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.880" end="01:09:04.640" style="s2">on everything</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.080" end="01:09:06.640" style="s2">and in the case of the color revolution</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.640" end="01:09:08.080" style="s2">you have the playbook in place you have</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.640" end="01:09:10.480" style="s2">the network in place</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.080" end="01:09:12.480" style="s2">and you have the institutions in place</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.480" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">and of course a friendly media</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.480" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">ready to converge on any narrative that</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:18.839" style="s2">that they pick up on so</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:20.000" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t have to even be</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.839" end="01:09:22.799" style="s2">conspiratorial</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.000" end="01:09:23.759" style="s2">in that kind of smoke-filled room type</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.799" end="01:09:26.080" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.759" end="01:09:27.279" style="s2">yeah so i get confused when i start</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.080" end="01:09:30.640" style="s2">trying to think about</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.279" end="01:09:32.560" style="s2">uh who is the revolutionary right now</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.640" end="01:09:35.199" style="s2">right so on one hand critical race</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.560" end="01:09:38.480" style="s2">theories clearly anti-founding</p>
<p begin="01:09:35.199" end="01:09:40.480" style="s2">clearly anti-american tradition it has a</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.480" end="01:09:43.199" style="s2">contrary view of justice</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.480" end="01:09:44.560" style="s2">uh one of taking from others rather than</p>
<p begin="01:09:43.199" end="01:09:45.520" style="s2">considering everybody to be an</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.560" end="01:09:47.279" style="s2">individual</p>
<p begin="01:09:45.520" end="01:09:49.440" style="s2">and a whole there&#39;s a distribution</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.279" end="01:09:52.719" style="s2">distributive element of it</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.440" end="01:09:56.239" style="s2">and and it certainly uh is not uh</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.719" end="01:09:56.800" style="s2">in the same spirit of uh equality under</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.239" end="01:09:58.480" style="s2">the law</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.800" end="01:10:00.560" style="s2">and so i can see how critical race</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.480" end="01:10:01.600" style="s2">theory intersectionality social justice</p>
<p begin="01:10:00.560" end="01:10:03.440" style="s2">warriors whatever</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.600" end="01:10:05.199" style="s2">the woke walkers that people have called</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.440" end="01:10:08.320" style="s2">them if that they</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.199" end="01:10:09.040" style="s2">are are revolutionary to the idea of</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.320" end="01:10:12.960" style="s2">america</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.040" end="01:10:16.000" style="s2">but but in this case</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.960" end="01:10:17.040" style="s2">uh it feels as though they may be foot</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.000" end="01:10:20.080" style="s2">soldiers</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.040" end="01:10:22.960" style="s2">or at least co-opted to be in this case</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.080" end="01:10:24.640" style="s2">uh of a counter revolution of a counter</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.960" end="01:10:28.480" style="s2">insurgency which is targeted at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:24.640" end="01:10:29.199" style="s2">trump maga you know faction which is the</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.480" end="01:10:31.920" style="s2">actual</p>
<p begin="01:10:29.199" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">sort of revolutionaries against this</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.920" end="01:10:34.800" style="s2">mono</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.640" end="01:10:36.880" style="s2">party and the deep state and the</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.800" end="01:10:39.280" style="s2">converged institutions so</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.880" end="01:10:41.520" style="s2">is it is it really as confusing as it is</p>
<p begin="01:10:39.280" end="01:10:43.520" style="s2">to me as to like who&#39;s in power</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.520" end="01:10:44.960" style="s2">but who&#39;s in charge and who are who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:43.520" end="01:10:47.679" style="s2">revolting and who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.960" end="01:10:48.480" style="s2">fighting a revolution it seems so muddy</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.679" end="01:10:51.120" style="s2">to me</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.480" end="01:10:52.880" style="s2">well i mean i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know how if</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.120" end="01:10:54.800" style="s2">it&#39;s even that muddy i mean because</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.880" end="01:10:55.199" style="s2">because you can look at these groups</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.800" end="01:10:58.480" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.199" end="01:10:59.760" style="s2">antifa black lives matter who in some</p>
<p begin="01:10:58.480" end="01:11:03.440" style="s2">way might</p>

<p begin="01:12:59.440" end="01:13:02.640" style="s2">even say like the white middle class but</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.080" end="01:13:05.520" style="s2">maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.640" end="01:13:06.320" style="s2">middle class more broadly is the only</p>

<p begin="01:13:08.400" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">standing behind</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.239" end="01:13:14.000" style="s2">standing between the kind of the</p>

<p begin="01:13:14.000" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">and consolidated power system and</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.080" end="01:13:20.400" style="s2">complete control</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:21.280" style="s2">so uh that&#39;s you know pretty plainly</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.400" end="01:13:23.520" style="s2">what it is</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.280" end="01:13:24.640" style="s2">and it&#39;s it is a development it wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:13:23.520" end="01:13:26.719" style="s2">always this way</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.640" end="01:13:28.000" style="s2">i mean i think these organizations have</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.719" end="01:13:30.640" style="s2">always been</p>
<p begin="01:13:28.000" end="01:13:31.280" style="s2">um you know disgusting and destructive</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.640" end="01:13:34.000" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.280" end="01:13:36.159" style="s2">as you know recently as you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:34.000" end="01:13:39.360" style="s2">remember the seattle</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.159" end="01:13:40.560" style="s2">issue and and that was uh you know a lot</p>
<p begin="01:13:39.360" end="01:13:42.560" style="s2">of the same you know</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.560" end="01:13:45.280" style="s2">the groups have the same provenance of</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.560" end="01:13:49.040" style="s2">you know the antifa type groups</p>
<p begin="01:13:45.280" end="01:13:52.480" style="s2">um protesting the wto meeting</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.040" end="01:13:57.120" style="s2">uh in in seattle so they were actually</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.480" end="01:14:00.320" style="s2">engaging in violent protests to protest</p>
<p begin="01:13:57.120" end="01:14:01.440" style="s2">basically globalist free free trade</p>
<p begin="01:14:00.320" end="01:14:06.400" style="s2">policies</p>
<p begin="01:14:01.440" end="01:14:10.320" style="s2">and as recently as um you know the obama</p>
<p begin="01:14:06.400" end="01:14:13.360" style="s2">era you had something similar</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.320" end="01:14:15.360" style="s2">organized in the occupy wall street and</p>
<p begin="01:14:13.360" end="01:14:18.560" style="s2">they were challenging you know i</p>
<p begin="01:14:15.360" end="01:14:20.960" style="s2">i don&#39;t agree with their approach but</p>
<p begin="01:14:18.560" end="01:14:23.120" style="s2">at least in that case you can say that</p>
<p begin="01:14:20.960" end="01:14:25.840" style="s2">they were going up against a real</p>
<p begin="01:14:23.120" end="01:14:26.840" style="s2">kind of power faction whereas now</p>
<p begin="01:14:25.840" end="01:14:30.080" style="s2">they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="01:14:26.840" end="01:14:31.760" style="s2">completely uh</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.080" end="01:14:34.080" style="s2">neutered they&#39;ve they&#39;ve they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:14:31.760" end="01:14:36.350" style="s2">undergone a kind of</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.080" end="01:14:38.159" style="s2">reassignment surgery as it were</p>
<p begin="01:14:36.350" end="01:14:39.920" style="s2">[Laughter]</p>
<p begin="01:14:38.159" end="01:14:41.600" style="s2">well what&#39;s what strikes me from this</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.920" end="01:14:44.400" style="s2">conversation you see most</p>
<p begin="01:14:41.600" end="01:14:45.520" style="s2">of those like the the antifa people are</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.400" end="01:14:47.199" style="s2">you know there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.520" end="01:14:48.719" style="s2">transsexuals i&#39;m not saying there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:47.199" end="01:14:50.000" style="s2">anything wrong with that but there are a</p>
<p begin="01:14:48.719" end="01:14:52.320" style="s2">lot of transsexuals</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.000" end="01:14:53.199" style="s2">and i think like even metaphorically</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.320" end="01:14:56.400" style="s2">they&#39;ve you know</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.199" end="01:14:57.280" style="s2">the antifa is a post-op organization</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.400" end="01:14:59.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="01:14:57.280" end="01:15:00.719" style="s2">they they used to they&#39;ve always been</p>
<p begin="01:14:59.360" end="01:15:02.960" style="s2">bad but they used to</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.719" end="01:15:04.560" style="s2">you know actually go against powerful</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.960" end="01:15:06.159" style="s2">institutions and now they&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.560" end="01:15:09.840" style="s2">completely the instrument</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.159" end="01:15:11.679" style="s2">of you know broad swaths of the american</p>
<p begin="01:15:09.840" end="01:15:14.480" style="s2">ruling class</p>
<p begin="01:15:11.679" end="01:15:15.360" style="s2">what&#39;s fascinating about this framing is</p>
<p begin="01:15:14.480" end="01:15:17.840" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:15:15.360" end="01:15:19.600" style="s2">the implication here is that the white</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.840" end="01:15:21.120" style="s2">middle class or the middle class more</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.600" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">broadly as you say</p>
<p begin="01:15:21.120" end="01:15:27.840" style="s2">has already lost we lost at some point</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:31.360" style="s2">years ago oh yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s not gone</p>
<p begin="01:15:27.840" end="01:15:34.880" style="s2">yeah yeah we lost big time yeah and</p>
<p begin="01:15:31.360" end="01:15:37.520" style="s2">and we lost years ago and it&#39;s only now</p>
<p begin="01:15:34.880" end="01:15:38.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re actually able to mount a</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.520" end="01:15:41.600" style="s2">serious</p>
<p begin="01:15:38.560" end="01:15:43.520" style="s2">uh you know fight back against what has</p>
<p begin="01:15:41.600" end="01:15:44.960" style="s2">been happening basically since what like</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.520" end="01:15:49.199" style="s2">the mid 80s or so</p>
<p begin="01:15:44.960" end="01:15:51.280" style="s2">or going back to the 60s even and so</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.199" end="01:15:53.199" style="s2">it&#39;s fascinating like you said earlier</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.280" end="01:15:54.880" style="s2">that whenever they say</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.199" end="01:15:56.719" style="s2">you know the democracy handbook it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.880" end="01:15:58.320" style="s2">actually the anti-democracy handbook</p>
<p begin="01:15:56.719" end="01:16:00.080" style="s2">and in this case we&#39;re talking they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:58.320" end="01:16:01.199" style="s2">saying that they&#39;re revolutionaries on</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.080" end="01:16:03.199" style="s2">the street</p>
<p begin="01:16:01.199" end="01:16:06.280" style="s2">uh black lives matter antifa chanting</p>
<p begin="01:16:03.199" end="01:16:07.679" style="s2">about being revolutionaries and</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.280" end="01:16:09.760" style="s2">anti-anti-fascism</p>
<p begin="01:16:07.679" end="01:16:10.800" style="s2">and anti-big corporatist power and</p>
<p begin="01:16:09.760" end="01:16:13.120" style="s2">whatever</p>
<p begin="01:16:10.800" end="01:16:15.280" style="s2">um but at the same time man you like</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.120" end="01:16:18.480" style="s2">dude i&#39;ve been down at lafayette square</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.280" end="01:16:19.600" style="s2">right where mayor mayor uh bowser</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.480" end="01:16:23.600" style="s2">bloomberg&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:16:19.600" end="01:16:25.760" style="s2">dog named it black lives matter plaza</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.600" end="01:16:27.600" style="s2">and then the street name says black</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.760" end="01:16:28.960" style="s2">lives matter they wrote black lives</p>
<p begin="01:16:27.600" end="01:16:30.960" style="s2">matter on the street</p>
<p begin="01:16:28.960" end="01:16:33.520" style="s2">in letters you can see from outer space</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.960" end="01:16:34.800" style="s2">and then all the buildings around it are</p>
<p begin="01:16:33.520" end="01:16:37.920" style="s2">draped</p>
<p begin="01:16:34.800" end="01:16:40.400" style="s2">in you know first class first rate</p>
<p begin="01:16:37.920" end="01:16:41.280" style="s2">graphic design corporate sponsored black</p>
<p begin="01:16:40.400" end="01:16:45.120" style="s2">lives matter</p>
<p begin="01:16:41.280" end="01:16:45.920" style="s2">flags and banners and then they&#39;re on</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.120" end="01:16:48.400" style="s2">the street</p>
<p begin="01:16:45.920" end="01:16:49.679" style="s2">in like an organized military formation</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.400" end="01:16:52.320" style="s2">fighting against</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.679" end="01:16:53.920" style="s2">the police there banging their war drums</p>
<p begin="01:16:52.320" end="01:16:55.040" style="s2">with their banners flown on the</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.920" end="01:16:57.360" style="s2">buildings on the street</p>
<p begin="01:16:55.040" end="01:16:59.040" style="s2">named after them with this their name</p>
<p begin="01:16:57.360" end="01:17:00.840" style="s2">written right on the street</p>
<p begin="01:16:59.040" end="01:17:03.120" style="s2">and yet they&#39;re saying that they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.840" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">revolutionaries and so when we put it in</p>
<p begin="01:17:03.120" end="01:17:07.760" style="s2">this context it becomes</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:10.239" style="s2">absolutely absurd yeah</p>
<p begin="01:17:07.760" end="01:17:11.199" style="s2">and and it makes them even more uh</p>
<p begin="01:17:10.239" end="01:17:14.080" style="s2">hypocritic</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.199" end="01:17:16.159" style="s2">uh hypocritical but also stooges many of</p>
<p begin="01:17:14.080" end="01:17:18.080" style="s2">them are just stooges i believe</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.159" end="01:17:19.840" style="s2">uh whipped up you know the average guy</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.080" end="01:17:20.400" style="s2">on the street protesting this stuff</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.840" end="01:17:23.360" style="s2">doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.400" end="01:17:25.440" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have any of the knowledge about</p>
<p begin="01:17:23.360" end="01:17:27.040" style="s2">what&#39;s really going on or the background</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.440" end="01:17:28.159" style="s2">or the history or who&#39;s pulling the</p>
<p begin="01:17:27.040" end="01:17:30.800" style="s2">strings or whatever they&#39;ve just been</p>
<p begin="01:17:28.159" end="01:17:34.080" style="s2">agitated you know they&#39;ve been agitated</p>
<p begin="01:17:30.800" end="01:17:35.760" style="s2">and so the real uh revolutionaries here</p>
<p begin="01:17:34.080" end="01:17:36.960" style="s2">are the ones that are talking about the</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.760" end="01:17:38.960" style="s2">founders vision</p>
<p begin="01:17:36.960" end="01:17:40.080" style="s2">and free speech and justice and the</p>
<p begin="01:17:38.960" end="01:17:43.040" style="s2">constitution</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.080" end="01:17:45.280" style="s2">and and very much in the same vein as</p>
<p begin="01:17:43.040" end="01:17:46.239" style="s2">claremont institute in their academic</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.280" end="01:17:48.640" style="s2">thrust</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.239" end="01:17:50.320" style="s2">uh somehow we&#39;re now the revolutionaries</p>
<p begin="01:17:48.640" end="01:17:53.120" style="s2">we lost the war</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.320" end="01:17:53.760" style="s2">uh the institutions have been taken over</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.120" end="01:17:56.560" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.760" end="01:17:57.440" style="s2">donald trump was somebody that they</p>
<p begin="01:17:56.560" end="01:18:00.320" style="s2">poop-hooed</p>
<p begin="01:17:57.440" end="01:18:00.880" style="s2">and discounted and we voted him into</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.320" end="01:18:03.520" style="s2">office</p>
<p begin="01:18:00.880" end="01:18:04.640" style="s2">to blow all this up and to take take</p>
<p begin="01:18:03.520" end="01:18:08.239" style="s2">back the country</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.640" end="01:18:09.760" style="s2">make america great again perfect right</p>
<p begin="01:18:08.239" end="01:18:11.600" style="s2">and so as soon as that happened they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.760" end="01:18:12.880" style="s2">been running this playbook and what i</p>
<p begin="01:18:11.600" end="01:18:16.080" style="s2">want to talk about now</p>
<p begin="01:18:12.880" end="01:18:17.440" style="s2">is what do we here the two things i want</p>
<p begin="01:18:16.080" end="01:18:19.120" style="s2">to talk about on the way out here in the</p>
<p begin="01:18:17.440" end="01:18:22.880" style="s2">next half hour so</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.120" end="01:18:27.920" style="s2">what can we expect moving forward</p>
<p begin="01:18:22.880" end="01:18:31.199" style="s2">then what do we do to combat it</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.920" end="01:18:33.679" style="s2">yeah um well what can we expect</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.199" end="01:18:36.480" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s difficult to say i mean i</p>
<p begin="01:18:33.679" end="01:18:40.239" style="s2">think in the next</p>
<p begin="01:18:36.480" end="01:18:43.760" style="s2">several months are going to be extremely</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.239" end="01:18:46.640" style="s2">uh chaotic i think we can</p>
<p begin="01:18:43.760" end="01:18:48.000" style="s2">probably expect some kind of contested</p>
<p begin="01:18:46.640" end="01:18:49.760" style="s2">election scenario like</p>
<p begin="01:18:48.000" end="01:18:52.080" style="s2">you know what they&#39;re engineering like</p>
<p begin="01:18:49.760" end="01:18:53.600" style="s2">how can imagine that that they</p>

<p begin="01:22:52.320" end="01:22:55.440" style="s2">come up with some kind of best strategy</p>
<p begin="01:22:54.000" end="01:22:58.159" style="s2">as to what you&#39;re going to do about it</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.440" end="01:23:01.360" style="s2">and ideally kind of get ahead of it</p>

<p begin="01:23:11.120" end="01:23:14.960" style="s2">because he&#39;s probably just gonna you</p>
<p begin="01:23:13.199" end="01:23:16.320" style="s2">know collapse the next day and then we</p>
<p begin="01:23:14.960" end="01:23:18.719" style="s2">have president kamala</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.320" end="01:23:19.600" style="s2">then god help us it&#39;s gonna be horrible</p>

<p begin="01:23:25.760" end="01:23:32.840" style="s2">would be a real disaster</p>
<p begin="01:23:28.159" end="01:23:36.159" style="s2">um but um in any case i think</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.840" end="01:23:37.520" style="s2">um you know we do need to start thinking</p>
<p begin="01:23:36.159" end="01:23:40.960" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.520" end="01:23:41.760" style="s2">also the limits to populism because this</p>
<p begin="01:23:40.960" end="01:23:45.040" style="s2">game of</p>
<p begin="01:23:41.760" end="01:23:47.920" style="s2">just having the people and not having</p>

<p begin="01:24:13.040" end="01:24:16.719" style="s2">to something worse than a joke and so i</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.239" end="01:24:19.760" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.719" end="01:24:22.800" style="s2">there we need to start thinking about</p>

<p begin="01:24:22.800" end="01:24:28.480" style="s2">and you know kind of uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:26.080" end="01:24:30.480" style="s2">political organization and political</p>
<p begin="01:24:28.480" end="01:24:33.600" style="s2">mode of communication and just</p>

<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:53.600" style="s2">there&#39;s been a lot of this going on you</p>
<p begin="01:24:52.960" end="01:24:55.520" style="s2">know it</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.600" end="01:24:57.280" style="s2">hasn&#39;t been a lot of time you know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.520" end="01:24:58.639" style="s2">it&#39;s only been like you know less than</p>
<p begin="01:24:57.280" end="01:25:00.800" style="s2">four years since</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.639" end="01:25:02.159" style="s2">2016 and so all this stuff is in the</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.800" end="01:25:04.560" style="s2">works but</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.159" end="01:25:05.679" style="s2">um that is you know i think what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.560" end="01:25:09.120" style="s2">necessary to</p>
<p begin="01:25:05.679" end="01:25:11.679" style="s2">kind of a longer term um strategy</p>
<p begin="01:25:09.120" end="01:25:13.360" style="s2">of winning is that you know you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:25:11.679" end="01:25:16.560" style="s2">you it&#39;s it&#39;s great to have</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.360" end="01:25:18.239" style="s2">the people um you know the people as in</p>
<p begin="01:25:16.560" end="01:25:19.920" style="s2">you know kind of the masses popular</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.239" end="01:25:23.199" style="s2">support but</p>
<p begin="01:25:19.920" end="01:25:24.239" style="s2">um uh you know for better or worse the</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.199" end="01:25:27.760" style="s2">reality is that</p>
<p begin="01:25:24.239" end="01:25:31.199" style="s2">so much of winning is is the inside game</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.760" end="01:25:32.639" style="s2">no and uh yeah yeah so a couple of</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.199" end="01:25:33.360" style="s2">things come to mind as you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.639" end="01:25:37.280" style="s2">that um</p>
<p begin="01:25:33.360" end="01:25:39.440" style="s2">one is that i always had the feeling in</p>
<p begin="01:25:37.280" end="01:25:42.639" style="s2">2015 that trump</p>
<p begin="01:25:39.440" end="01:25:46.000" style="s2">was perfectly suited to the moment um</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.639" end="01:25:49.679" style="s2">and sort of rode a wave uh</p>
<p begin="01:25:46.000" end="01:25:53.360" style="s2">it it remains to me to be seen</p>
<p begin="01:25:49.679" end="01:25:57.280" style="s2">if he is capable of creating the wave</p>
<p begin="01:25:53.360" end="01:26:00.239" style="s2">or being very proactive</p>
<p begin="01:25:57.280" end="01:26:00.960" style="s2">in shaping the reality as it needs to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.239" end="01:26:02.719" style="s2">rather than</p>
<p begin="01:26:00.960" end="01:26:04.320" style="s2">being the right man the right place the</p>
<p begin="01:26:02.719" end="01:26:06.000" style="s2">right time with the right message and</p>
<p begin="01:26:04.320" end="01:26:07.360" style="s2">the right social media power and the</p>
<p begin="01:26:06.000" end="01:26:10.480" style="s2">right everything</p>
<p begin="01:26:07.360" end="01:26:11.840" style="s2">whereas now like we need him to be an</p>
<p begin="01:26:10.480" end="01:26:14.560" style="s2">institution builder</p>
<p begin="01:26:11.840" end="01:26:15.840" style="s2">and a strategist and a bureaucrat in</p>
<p begin="01:26:14.560" end="01:26:20.000" style="s2">some ways</p>
<p begin="01:26:15.840" end="01:26:23.280" style="s2">and i i wonder about an emerging</p>
<p begin="01:26:20.000" end="01:26:24.800" style="s2">elite class funny to say that in the</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.280" end="01:26:26.239" style="s2">context of populism but i hear what</p>
<p begin="01:26:24.800" end="01:26:27.360" style="s2">you&#39;re saying and i totally understand</p>
<p begin="01:26:26.239" end="01:26:29.199" style="s2">it&#39;s the people that are actually</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.360" end="01:26:31.360" style="s2">doing things to replace the other people</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.199" end="01:26:34.960" style="s2">that are doing things</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.360" end="01:26:38.239" style="s2">there&#39;s a great risk right now in</p>
<p begin="01:26:34.960" end="01:26:39.920" style="s2">as you know and as i know in being a</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.239" end="01:26:41.120" style="s2">public supporter of the president how</p>
<p begin="01:26:39.920" end="01:26:43.360" style="s2">crazy that is</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.120" end="01:26:45.920" style="s2">right but there&#39;s a great risk for that</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.360" end="01:26:47.679" style="s2">and uh i would like to have seen</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.920" end="01:26:49.199" style="s2">a little bit more signaling from the</p>
<p begin="01:26:47.679" end="01:26:50.800" style="s2">administration that they&#39;re going to be</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.199" end="01:26:52.080" style="s2">willing to support people who are</p>
<p begin="01:26:50.800" end="01:26:54.480" style="s2">willing to take risks</p>
<p begin="01:26:52.080" end="01:26:56.960" style="s2">on their behalf which is on behalf of</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.480" end="01:27:01.679" style="s2">the mission of the country</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.960" end="01:27:03.360" style="s2">and so i wonder if that is going to</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.679" end="01:27:06.320" style="s2">if people are going to be willing to</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.360" end="01:27:07.360" style="s2">take the risks necessary in order to go</p>
<p begin="01:27:06.320" end="01:27:09.679" style="s2">out on that</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.360" end="01:27:11.600" style="s2">that limb in order to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="01:27:09.679" end="01:27:12.080" style="s2">and so that ties me to my next question</p>
<p begin="01:27:11.600" end="01:27:14.960" style="s2">which is</p>
<p begin="01:27:12.080" end="01:27:16.880" style="s2">who is handling all this for the</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.960" end="01:27:19.760" style="s2">president right now he has got</p>
<p begin="01:27:16.880" end="01:27:20.719" style="s2">a lot of things on his plate aside from</p>
<p begin="01:27:19.760" end="01:27:21.920" style="s2">this particular</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.719" end="01:27:23.840" style="s2">issue which to me is the most</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.920" end="01:27:26.320" style="s2">fundamental one but like</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.840" end="01:27:27.520" style="s2">who is game planning this who is</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.320" end="01:27:31.760" style="s2">strategizing this</p>
<p begin="01:27:27.520" end="01:27:34.400" style="s2">who is in charge who&#39;s been delegated to</p>
<p begin="01:27:31.760" end="01:27:36.080" style="s2">to to fight back against the scholar of</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.400" end="01:27:36.800" style="s2">revolution the insurgency that we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.080" end="01:27:38.800" style="s2">seeing</p>
<p begin="01:27:36.800" end="01:27:40.560" style="s2">and to make sure that we don&#39;t not only</p>
<p begin="01:27:38.800" end="01:27:42.880" style="s2">hopefully win this election but like</p>
<p begin="01:27:40.560" end="01:27:44.960" style="s2">not have the country fall apart in the</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.880" end="01:27:47.040" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:27:44.960" end="01:27:49.120" style="s2">right well that&#39;s a good question and i</p>
<p begin="01:27:47.040" end="01:27:52.960" style="s2">think you know like any with anything</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.120" end="01:27:54.560" style="s2">um any response to this would have to</p>
<p begin="01:27:52.960" end="01:27:57.679" style="s2">come at the direction</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.560" end="01:27:59.840" style="s2">of the president so you know i know</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.679" end="01:28:00.719" style="s2">you know the president is a regular</p>
<p begin="01:27:59.840" end="01:28:02.480" style="s2">reader</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.719" end="01:28:04.560" style="s2">of revolver and he&#39;s tweeted out at</p>

<p begin="01:28:04.560" end="01:28:08.560" style="s2">endorsement</p>
<p begin="01:28:05.360" end="01:28:12.800" style="s2">but um i really hope that he</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.560" end="01:28:16.400" style="s2">takes to heart um the color revolution</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.800" end="01:28:16.800" style="s2">thesis that we&#39;re promoting and um take</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.400" end="01:28:20.159" style="s2">some</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.800" end="01:28:22.880" style="s2">actions to um counter it and</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.159" end="01:28:24.000" style="s2">some of the actions i&#39;ve described and</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.880" end="01:28:27.120" style="s2">other actions</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.000" end="01:28:28.080" style="s2">you know could it could be undertaken</p>
<p begin="01:28:27.120" end="01:28:31.360" style="s2">but maybe not</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.080" end="01:28:33.199" style="s2">kind of publicly given away but there uh</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.360" end="01:28:34.719" style="s2">you know there there is stuff that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.199" end="01:28:37.679" style="s2">can do but</p>
<p begin="01:28:34.719" end="01:28:38.400" style="s2">it&#39;s not an optimal situation you know</p>
<p begin="01:28:37.679" end="01:28:40.880" style="s2">it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.400" end="01:28:42.800" style="s2">if anyone plays chess you know that you</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.880" end="01:28:46.159" style="s2">know you can get yourself</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.800" end="01:28:47.679" style="s2">mired in a strategically disadvantageous</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.159" end="01:28:50.159" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="01:28:47.679" end="01:28:52.080" style="s2">and even if you play perfectly you&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="01:28:50.159" end="01:28:53.440" style="s2">trouble depending on the skill level of</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.080" end="01:28:56.560" style="s2">your opponent</p>
<p begin="01:28:53.440" end="01:29:00.000" style="s2">and what had to have been done really is</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.560" end="01:29:01.120" style="s2">from day one taken years to put the</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.000" end="01:29:04.080" style="s2">pieces in place</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.120" end="01:29:05.520" style="s2">in the department of justice in the</p>

<p begin="01:29:08.719" end="01:29:12.719" style="s2">confronted with a situation like this</p>
<p begin="01:29:11.679" end="01:29:15.280" style="s2">you have</p>

<p begin="01:34:30.560" end="01:34:34.480" style="s2">an issue of how effective you are</p>
<p begin="01:34:32.719" end="01:34:37.360" style="s2">it has nothing to do with how offensive</p>

<p begin="01:44:48.320" end="01:44:51.040" style="s2">they live in</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.440" end="01:44:52.639" style="s2">yeah all these issues that we&#39;ve talked</p>
<p begin="01:44:51.040" end="01:44:53.840" style="s2">about getting your head chopped off on</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.639" end="01:44:55.600" style="s2">social media</p>
<p begin="01:44:53.840" end="01:44:57.040" style="s2">not having good access to information</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.600" end="01:44:59.360" style="s2">through google getting a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.040" end="01:45:00.719" style="s2">propaganda misinformation etc</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.360" end="01:45:02.320" style="s2">this is something that we&#39;ve picked up</p>
<p begin="01:45:00.719" end="01:45:04.000" style="s2">on in the liminal order and this is part</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.320" end="01:45:07.600" style="s2">of the reason why we got together</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.000" end="01:45:09.679" style="s2">is we have raised a info militia</p>
<p begin="01:45:07.600" end="01:45:12.080" style="s2">that&#39;s what we call it an info militia</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.679" end="01:45:13.760" style="s2">militias come up at a time at which</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.080" end="01:45:15.360" style="s2">the government isn&#39;t providing for your</p>
<p begin="01:45:13.760" end="01:45:16.719" style="s2">safety and security need to defend</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.360" end="01:45:18.080" style="s2">yourself well in this case it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="01:45:16.719" end="01:45:19.679" style="s2">information war</p>
<p begin="01:45:18.080" end="01:45:20.880" style="s2">and so we&#39;ve come together hundreds of</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.679" end="01:45:22.320" style="s2">men from all around the world come</p>
<p begin="01:45:20.880" end="01:45:24.480" style="s2">together to form what we&#39;ve called an</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.320" end="01:45:26.159" style="s2">infant militia among other things</p>
<p begin="01:45:24.480" end="01:45:27.360" style="s2">and we&#39;re dedicated to making sense of</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.159" end="01:45:29.520" style="s2">the world and finding the right</p>
<p begin="01:45:27.360" end="01:45:31.440" style="s2">information and becoming informed people</p>
<p begin="01:45:29.520" end="01:45:33.280" style="s2">so that we can maintain our sovereignty</p>
<p begin="01:45:31.440" end="01:45:35.520" style="s2">which is what this is about</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.280" end="01:45:37.679" style="s2">access to information knowledge the</p>
<p begin="01:45:35.520" end="01:45:39.840" style="s2">truth understanding of the world</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.679" end="01:45:41.600" style="s2">that is about personal sovereignty and</p>
<p begin="01:45:39.840" end="01:45:44.480" style="s2">that is what is at risk here</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.600" end="01:45:46.560" style="s2">is our personal sovereignty and our</p>
<p begin="01:45:44.480" end="01:45:49.600" style="s2">ability to be an individual</p>
<p begin="01:45:46.560" end="01:45:51.199" style="s2">in the world and our ability to protect</p>

<p begin="01:45:51.199" end="01:45:54.639" style="s2">and all that is at stake in this</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.960" end="01:45:57.440" style="s2">election and so</p>
<p begin="01:45:54.639" end="01:45:58.159" style="s2">i really appreciated uh all of this</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.440" end="01:46:00.480" style="s2">conversation</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.159" end="01:46:02.239" style="s2">here because it&#39;s also salient and it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:46:02.239" end="01:46:05.840" style="s2">and it explains what we&#39;ve seen over the</p>

<p begin="01:46:05.840" end="01:46:12.080" style="s2">and we&#39;ve now have also uh a map</p>
