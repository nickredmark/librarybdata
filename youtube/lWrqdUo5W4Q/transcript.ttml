<p begin="00:04:08.579" end="00:04:14.609" style="s2">the book after God by Mark Taylor a</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.260" end="00:04:17.519" style="s2">tremendous influence on my thinking and</p>

<p begin="00:04:17.519" end="00:04:22.830" style="s2">I&#39;m going to be talking about in a very</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.139" end="00:04:25.099" style="s2">clear and precipitations manner but some</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.830" end="00:04:29.220" style="s2">things are happening there&#39;s immediate</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.099" end="00:04:31.110" style="s2">consequences of people picking up on</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.220" end="00:04:33.810" style="s2">Aquinas and responding to it and we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.110" end="00:04:37.259" style="s2">see it in sort of two figures deeply</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.810" end="00:04:41.729" style="s2">influenced by Aquinas and they represent</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.259" end="00:04:44.039" style="s2">two particular lines of development that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.729" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">are going to influence each other one is</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.039" end="00:04:51.720" style="s2">Meister Eckhart</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:54.900" style="s2">and the other is William of Occam was</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.720" end="00:04:56.789" style="s2">where we get Occam&#39;s razor from a thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.900" end="00:04:58.830" style="s2">that is often invoked by various kept</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.789" end="00:05:00.510" style="s2">ARDS without a full understanding of</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.830" end="00:05:04.260" style="s2">what I meant by it</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.510" end="00:05:06.599" style="s2">akhom certainly didn&#39;t mean it to be how</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.260" end="00:05:12.509" style="s2">it&#39;s often used by people in a</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.599" end="00:05:16.680" style="s2">dismissive fashion so Eckhart represents</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.509" end="00:05:20.490" style="s2">a pivotal exemplary maybe even a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.680" end="00:05:23.099" style="s2">culminating figure of a group of people</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.490" end="00:05:24.780" style="s2">within Germany and Germany is going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.099" end="00:05:27.750" style="s2">be central to all of this from now on</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.780" end="00:05:30.949" style="s2">and that is of course going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.750" end="00:05:34.860" style="s2">dangerous precedent to set for Germany</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.949" end="00:05:38.009" style="s2">but Eckhart represents a group that are</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.860" end="00:05:42.840" style="s2">called the Rhineland Mystics and others</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.009" end="00:05:48.029" style="s2">who bring about a transformation in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.840" end="00:05:50.010" style="s2">understanding of human spirituality they</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.029" end="00:05:51.940" style="s2">bring about a change in the normative</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.010" end="00:05:55.669" style="s2">order so</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.940" end="00:05:57.319" style="s2">Aquinas basically changes the normal</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.669" end="00:05:58.789" style="s2">logical order he separates it into these</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.319" end="00:06:00.560" style="s2">two worlds and now there&#39;s a chasm</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.789" end="00:06:01.550" style="s2">between them alright there&#39;s a chasm</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.560" end="00:06:04.490" style="s2">between these world</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.550" end="00:06:07.789" style="s2">they&#39;re right you can&#39;t write love can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.490" end="00:06:14.509" style="s2">lift reason up to here the reason has no</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.789" end="00:06:17.419" style="s2">home here right so a different meaning</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.509" end="00:06:20.440" style="s2">of spirituality now tends to be</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.419" end="00:06:22.550" style="s2">emphasized in the rhineland mystics now</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.440" end="00:06:25.069" style="s2">they&#39;re deeply influenced by</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.550" end="00:06:27.139" style="s2">Neoplatonism that cart I think is</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.069" end="00:06:28.789" style="s2">influenced in some way by the whole</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.139" end="00:06:31.580" style="s2">Neoplatonic undercurrent within</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.789" end="00:06:34.759" style="s2">Christianity there&#39;s of course the the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.580" end="00:06:39.590" style="s2">the background history and still there</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.759" end="00:06:43.250" style="s2">of of the Gnostics there has been a the</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.590" end="00:06:45.740" style="s2">Last Crusade is actually not against the</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.250" end="00:06:48.650" style="s2">Arabs in the Middle East it is against</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.740" end="00:06:55.789" style="s2">the Cathars in southern France and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.650" end="00:06:57.259" style="s2">Cathars ri-right they are I well I would</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.789" end="00:06:58.159" style="s2">say it some people would argue but many</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.259" end="00:07:00.710" style="s2">people would agree with me</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.159" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">the Cathars are a gnostic revival a huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.710" end="00:07:06.740" style="s2">revival of Gnosticism so there&#39;s a huge</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:08.690" style="s2">gnostic revival and of course there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.740" end="00:07:10.940" style="s2">neo platonic tradition Eckhart picks</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.690" end="00:07:13.430" style="s2">this up and others the other Rheinland</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.940" end="00:07:16.370" style="s2">mystics and what they do is they bring</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.430" end="00:07:19.099" style="s2">about a we understanding of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.370" end="00:07:21.710" style="s2">normative order and it changes from</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.099" end="00:07:23.900" style="s2">being the Neoplatonic and agog a it</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.710" end="00:07:28.969" style="s2">changes from being that whole conformity</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.900" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">that whole ascent in self transcendence</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.969" end="00:07:35.960" style="s2">self transcendence disappears from</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:38.659" style="s2">spirituality and it does the connection</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.960" end="00:07:40.699" style="s2">between spirituality and wisdom where</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.659" end="00:07:44.330" style="s2">wisdom is understood as your capacity</p>

<p begin="00:08:26.110" end="00:08:31.060" style="s2">rhineland mystics right they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.690" end="00:08:34.720" style="s2">replace this ascent spirituality with a</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.060" end="00:08:35.770" style="s2">descent spirituality and what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.720" end="00:08:38.830" style="s2">gonna do is they&#39;re going to say look</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.770" end="00:08:40.900" style="s2">what what what love is it&#39;s not that</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.830" end="00:08:43.300" style="s2">love moves the will love is a way in</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.900" end="00:08:44.680" style="s2">which the will moves it&#39;s that&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.300" end="00:08:48.310" style="s2">important change okay</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.680" end="00:08:52.030" style="s2">it&#39;s not that love moves the will is</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.310" end="00:08:52.660" style="s2">that the way the will moves right is</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.030" end="00:08:54.670" style="s2">love</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.660" end="00:08:59.380" style="s2">specifically when the will negates</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.670" end="00:09:02.320" style="s2">itself that&#39;s love so they pick up on</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.380" end="00:09:05.200" style="s2">and that&#39;s why I emphasized it earlier</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.320" end="00:09:09.040" style="s2">on in their series they pick up on the</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.200" end="00:09:15.490" style="s2">sacrificial aspect of love that to love</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.040" end="00:09:19.840" style="s2">is to sacrifice yourself so how is right</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.490" end="00:09:23.140" style="s2">how is the will moving in order to be</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.840" end="00:09:28.060" style="s2">loving well the will is negating itself</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.140" end="00:09:30.760" style="s2">you see when my will is self-centered</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.060" end="00:09:32.590" style="s2">and it&#39;s egocentric that of course is</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.760" end="00:09:34.480" style="s2">the opposite of agape I have to</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.590" end="00:09:38.140" style="s2">sacrifice this and we talked about this</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.480" end="00:09:40.690" style="s2">I have to sacrifice I have to negate my</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.140" end="00:09:43.810" style="s2">willful self assertion in order to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.690" end="00:09:46.690" style="s2">become a conduit for agape or as a cart</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.810" end="00:09:49.390" style="s2">would say to make a space so that God</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.690" end="00:09:53.950" style="s2">can come to dwell within me so the idea</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.390" end="00:09:56.800" style="s2">is that what spirituality is about is</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.950" end="00:10:00.870" style="s2">about the will negating its own self</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.800" end="00:10:06.070" style="s2">assertion and making a space in which</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.870" end="00:10:10.570" style="s2">God will is not being resisted so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.070" end="00:10:16.250" style="s2">the idea God&#39;s will is this a gothic</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.570" end="00:10:18.470" style="s2">love and right we are resisting that</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.250" end="00:10:24.530" style="s2">and what we need to do is we have to</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.470" end="00:10:27.320" style="s2">stop resisting we have to negate our own</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.530" end="00:10:29.720" style="s2">self assertion the way we&#39;re expressing</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.320" end="00:10:32.680" style="s2">ourselves to press outward and we have</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.720" end="00:10:38.120" style="s2">to make a space so that God can flow in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.680" end="00:10:44.720" style="s2">now what this does right is it makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.120" end="00:10:47.300" style="s2">self negation and this right it makes</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.720" end="00:10:51.100" style="s2">self negation and inner conflict central</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.300" end="00:10:54.140" style="s2">to spirituality so what had been</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.100" end="00:10:56.750" style="s2">incidental and contingent in Paul and</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.140" end="00:11:00.110" style="s2">Augustine the fact that they have inner</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.750" end="00:11:03.590" style="s2">conflict it becomes much more valerie&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.110" end="00:11:05.750" style="s2">in this new spirituality right I have to</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.590" end="00:11:08.090" style="s2">sort of be in perpetual conflict with</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.750" end="00:11:11.660" style="s2">myself I have to be negating this self</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.090" end="00:11:15.400" style="s2">so that eventually I empty myself now</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.660" end="00:11:17.420" style="s2">there are I don&#39;t want to misrepresent</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.400" end="00:11:20.840" style="s2">Eckhart is one of my favorite authors</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.420" end="00:11:25.070" style="s2">there there&#39;s beautiful wisdom about</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.840" end="00:11:27.260" style="s2">right how to overcome one&#39;s attachment</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.070" end="00:11:29.240" style="s2">to one&#39;s thinking and one&#39;s self image</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.260" end="00:11:31.970" style="s2">that are drawn from the Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.240" end="00:11:36.790" style="s2">heritage and of great value in ecker but</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.970" end="00:11:39.920" style="s2">nevertheless this model of right</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.790" end="00:11:42.410" style="s2">spirituality being ultimately a battle</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.920" end="00:11:45.080" style="s2">of wills your will against itself and so</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.410" end="00:11:52.040" style="s2">it&#39;s not against God&#39;s will becomes a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.080" end="00:11:53.540" style="s2">central idea for what&#39;s going on in the</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.040" end="00:12:00.310" style="s2">spirituality of the time now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.540" end="00:12:10.430" style="s2">overlapping with a new a new emerging</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.310" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">worldview so Ockham sees God&#39;s will as</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.430" end="00:12:15.650" style="s2">his primary faculty now some of you may</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:18.200" style="s2">be saying well why do we have to talk</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.650" end="00:12:21.880" style="s2">all this God talk look you have to</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.200" end="00:12:26.840" style="s2">understand how this God grammar</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.880" end="00:12:28.140" style="s2">developed and how it has woven its way</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.840" end="00:12:30.500" style="s2">into the very</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.140" end="00:12:33.210" style="s2">grammar of our culture and our cognition</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.500" end="00:12:36.510" style="s2">whether or not you believe in a God or</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.210" end="00:12:39.300" style="s2">not is actually quite irrelevant to what</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.510" end="00:12:42.990" style="s2">I&#39;m talking about right now the fact is</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.300" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">people have and they have so on ways of</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.990" end="00:12:48.170" style="s2">thinking and being into your heritage</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.500" end="00:12:58.230" style="s2">so for Occam unlike for Augustine and I</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.180" end="00:13:02.610" style="s2">would say the whole Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.230" end="00:13:05.460" style="s2">tradition it&#39;s not God&#39;s reason his</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.610" end="00:13:10.070" style="s2">intelligibility that is the source of</p>
<p begin="00:13:05.460" end="00:13:13.080" style="s2">his being for all commits his will and</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.070" end="00:13:16.980" style="s2">you can see how this lines up these two</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.080" end="00:13:22.650" style="s2">these two sides because Aquinas has made</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.980" end="00:13:26.700" style="s2">will the Faculty of access to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.650" end="00:13:30.360" style="s2">supernatural right the Faculty of will</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.700" end="00:13:34.620" style="s2">becomes central to spirituality and to</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.360" end="00:13:37.080" style="s2">God here now what does that mean why</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.620" end="00:13:39.540" style="s2">does that matter why would he say that</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.080" end="00:13:43.380" style="s2">because he sees see again here&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.540" end="00:13:46.920" style="s2">change it&#39;s not God&#39;s topic love that is</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.380" end="00:13:49.830" style="s2">his creativity God&#39;s will is the source</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.920" end="00:13:52.140" style="s2">of his ability God speaks the world into</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.830" end="00:13:54.780" style="s2">existence this as an act of assertion</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.140" end="00:13:58.500" style="s2">thought asserts the world when he</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.780" end="00:14:00.510" style="s2">creates it and you say okay so what so</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:02.190" style="s2">remember your model of God whether or</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.510" end="00:14:03.870" style="s2">not you believe in God&#39;s irrelevant your</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.190" end="00:14:05.820" style="s2">model of God has a tremendous influence</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.870" end="00:14:13.970" style="s2">on how you understand yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.820" end="00:14:20.550" style="s2">reality God&#39;s will supersedes his reason</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.970" end="00:14:23.490" style="s2">now that&#39;s very very important it means</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.550" end="00:14:29.460" style="s2">that God is not bound by rationality</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.490" end="00:14:34.100" style="s2">he&#39;s not bound by how things who hear in</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.460" end="00:14:34.100" style="s2">a rational fashion</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.990" end="00:14:40.899" style="s2">reason is not in any way central to God</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.360" end="00:14:49.520" style="s2">that&#39;s why the rational the ascent</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.899" end="00:14:56.709" style="s2">through reason is gone that means that</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.520" end="00:14:59.839" style="s2">any order that we find in existence is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.709" end="00:15:09.649" style="s2">arbitrarily imposed on it by God&#39;s will</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.839" end="00:15:13.580" style="s2">right God speaks it he it&#39;s an act of</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.649" end="00:15:16.399" style="s2">will he&#39;s not bound by any rational</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.580" end="00:15:23.680" style="s2">principles of organization it is just</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.399" end="00:15:26.209" style="s2">raw power and Fiat on his part you say</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.680" end="00:15:30.680" style="s2">okay so what what does that have to do</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.209" end="00:15:34.279" style="s2">well as I forewarned your model of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.680" end="00:15:36.950" style="s2">God is is a paradigmatic model of how</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.279" end="00:15:40.010" style="s2">you understand yourself to be again this</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.950" end="00:15:45.400" style="s2">is regardless of whether or not you</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.010" end="00:15:52.010" style="s2">believe in God right now so akhom</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.400" end="00:15:54.500" style="s2">concludes that we are like God we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.010" end="00:15:55.970" style="s2">find an order in that look you look at</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.500" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">here&#39;s my desk here&#39;s a book here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.970" end="00:15:59.060" style="s2">book here&#39;s a book is a book these are</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:16:01.430" style="s2">all books they all belong to the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.060" end="00:16:03.920" style="s2">category of books right that&#39;s part of</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.430" end="00:16:10.339" style="s2">what they are they&#39;re books and akhom</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.920" end="00:16:13.430" style="s2">says no they&#39;re not whatever order or</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.339" end="00:16:15.770" style="s2">pattern you find in there you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.430" end="00:16:17.900" style="s2">it by how you&#39;re speaking about it this</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.770" end="00:16:21.230" style="s2">is called nominalism the way God speaks</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.900" end="00:16:24.829" style="s2">and wills whatever order there is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.230" end="00:16:26.630" style="s2">making whatever patterns we find by how</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.829" end="00:16:32.260" style="s2">we&#39;re speaking about them they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.630" end="00:16:35.360" style="s2">actually there this isn&#39;t really a book</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.260" end="00:16:38.060" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in reality that groups</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.360" end="00:16:40.520" style="s2">these together it is only my mind</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.060" end="00:16:44.360" style="s2">by using the term that groups them</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.520" end="00:16:46.370" style="s2">together now because it&#39;s automatic for</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.360" end="00:16:47.410" style="s2">me in it I can&#39;t help but see this as a</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.370" end="00:16:49.899" style="s2">book but</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.410" end="00:16:55.420" style="s2">problem is there is no universal book</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.899" end="00:16:59.410" style="s2">ness forgive the language I&#39;m speaking</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.420" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">and by using language language gathers</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.410" end="00:17:03.610" style="s2">things together in the mind forms these</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:10.179" style="s2">patterns in the order but all that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.610" end="00:17:12.100" style="s2">really out there are raw individuals all</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.179" end="00:17:14.620" style="s2">that&#39;s really there are raw individuals</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.100" end="00:17:20.110" style="s2">and perhaps causal relations between</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.620" end="00:17:21.850" style="s2">them so notice what&#39;s happening I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.110" end="00:17:24.760" style="s2">reading and I&#39;m not reading inside my</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.850" end="00:17:26.740" style="s2">head knowledge is just how all the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.760" end="00:17:29.710" style="s2">different signs of language go here</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.740" end="00:17:32.530" style="s2">together and whatever order there is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.710" end="00:17:35.260" style="s2">only in here it&#39;s in here it&#39;s in how</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.799" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">and then what we&#39;ll start to do is put</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.409" end="00:27:09.720" style="s2">pressure on the government the state to</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:12.000" style="s2">not just be working for the church and</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.720" end="00:27:13.590" style="s2">for the aristocracy one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.000" end="00:27:16.830" style="s2">the state is going to start doing is</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.590" end="00:27:20.850" style="s2">it&#39;s going to start protecting contracts</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.830" end="00:27:24.330" style="s2">and enforcing rules on these social</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.850" end="00:27:27.750" style="s2">institutions and you get the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.330" end="00:27:31.110" style="s2">of corporate capitalism and the</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.750" end="00:27:32.730" style="s2">corporate state now that&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.110" end="00:27:35.640" style="s2">because it means that now people have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.730" end="00:27:38.700" style="s2">place in which they can look for power</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.640" end="00:27:40.919" style="s2">the ability to change their life and for</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.700" end="00:27:42.780" style="s2">norms to govern their behavior that have</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.919" end="00:27:45.260" style="s2">nothing to do with the church or the</p>

<p begin="00:27:46.280" end="00:27:49.539" style="s2">now that&#39;s very important already</p>

<p begin="00:27:49.539" end="00:27:57.340" style="s2">what that means is people are creating a</p>

<p begin="00:27:57.340" end="00:28:03.149" style="s2">setting out to do that but that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.039" end="00:28:05.649" style="s2">they&#39;re doing they&#39;re creating a secular</p>

<p begin="00:28:05.649" end="00:28:10.330" style="s2">and wealth and prestige and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.049" end="00:28:14.859" style="s2">beginning to secularize the state in</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.330" end="00:28:20.799" style="s2">order to safeguard those secular</p>

<p begin="00:28:22.979" end="00:28:27.749" style="s2">to all of these secular projects</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.119" end="00:28:36.179" style="s2">now this commercialism and trade also</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.460" end="00:28:38.019" style="s2">means something else really important I</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.179" end="00:28:42.429" style="s2">got to get better at my psycho</p>

<p begin="00:28:42.429" end="00:28:46.570" style="s2">information a lot better so what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.590" end="00:28:48.970" style="s2">gonna do is I&#39;m gonna import a new</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.570" end="00:28:52.720" style="s2">psycho technology always the new secular</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.970" end="00:28:55.479" style="s2">technologies look for it what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.720" end="00:28:58.090" style="s2">people are replacing Roman numerals with</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.479" end="00:29:03.460" style="s2">the hindu-arabic numerals you know these</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.090" end="00:29:08.669" style="s2">right you take it like one two three</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.460" end="00:29:11.259" style="s2">four five six seven eight nine zero</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.669" end="00:29:13.659" style="s2">right the hindu-arabic numerals</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.259" end="00:29:16.570" style="s2">if you ever done calculations with Roman</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.659" end="00:29:20.019" style="s2">numerals it&#39;s cumbersome and long and</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.570" end="00:29:21.789" style="s2">slow and stupid this speeds up it</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.019" end="00:29:23.559" style="s2">empowers you it&#39;s a cyclic technology</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.789" end="00:29:25.749" style="s2">that makes your ability to process and</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.559" end="00:29:28.899" style="s2">calculate information way faster and of</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.749" end="00:29:33.039" style="s2">course comes through right the Arab</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.899" end="00:29:35.619" style="s2">world because of increased trade but</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.039" end="00:29:37.989" style="s2">also because of the Crusades etc what</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.619" end="00:29:41.739" style="s2">also comes in is algebra the use of</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.989" end="00:29:45.960" style="s2">letters to represent variables rather</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.739" end="00:29:48.820" style="s2">than numbers what comes in is this zero</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.960" end="00:29:50.649" style="s2">and with that almost immediately the</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.820" end="00:29:52.269" style="s2">ability to use negative numbers because</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.649" end="00:29:54.340" style="s2">sometimes when you&#39;re running your</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.490" end="00:30:32.980" style="s2">Stars and I&#39;m going to apply this new</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.370" end="00:30:35.890" style="s2">way of thinking this Aristotelian</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.980" end="00:30:37.480" style="s2">logical coherent propositional way of</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.890" end="00:30:39.820" style="s2">thinking and I&#39;m going to use the new</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.480" end="00:30:41.380" style="s2">math and the new algebra so I got this</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.820" end="00:30:43.270" style="s2">new way of thinking I&#39;ve got the new</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.380" end="00:30:45.490" style="s2">psychic technology I&#39;m going to put them</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.270" end="00:30:52.330" style="s2">together and observe the heavens way</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.490" end="00:30:53.470" style="s2">more carefully and something that had</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.330" end="00:30:56.290" style="s2">been known for a while it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.470" end="00:30:57.730" style="s2">become much more prominent the heavens</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.290" end="00:30:59.799" style="s2">don&#39;t behave in this nice orderly</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.730" end="00:31:02.080" style="s2">fashion the way Aristotle and Ptolemy</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.799" end="00:31:04.270" style="s2">said they do for example if you look at</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.080" end="00:31:08.290" style="s2">Mars in the heavens right Mars will do</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.270" end="00:31:10.299" style="s2">this over time it goes really it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.290" end="00:31:12.669" style="s2">called the retrograde of Mars it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.299" end="00:31:15.370" style="s2">because of where the the Martian and</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.669" end="00:31:17.350" style="s2">Charon orbits intersect and don&#39;t like</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.370" end="00:31:19.240" style="s2">as you they don&#39;t intersect but like</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.350" end="00:31:25.299" style="s2">when the Earth passes by Mars that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.240" end="00:31:28.559" style="s2">what I meant and as you get this way</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.299" end="00:31:31.240" style="s2">more careful observation this</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.559" end="00:31:33.760" style="s2">Aristotelian propositional inferential</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.240" end="00:31:35.530" style="s2">way of thinking trying to get clear</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.760" end="00:31:38.320" style="s2">definitions and that&#39;s allied to this</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.530" end="00:31:42.340" style="s2">new math mathematical sacred technology</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.320" end="00:31:45.270" style="s2">people start to discover how chaotic the</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.340" end="00:31:45.270" style="s2">heavens actually are</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.000" end="00:31:51.570" style="s2">and of course what they try to do is</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.470" end="00:31:53.850" style="s2">they they start trying to fiddle with</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.570" end="00:31:55.320" style="s2">the system right okay so the Earth&#39;s at</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.850" end="00:31:57.450" style="s2">the center and stuffs going around it</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.320" end="00:31:58.830" style="s2">but on these spheres there&#39;s other</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.450" end="00:32:01.020" style="s2">things spinning in opposite directions</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.830" end="00:32:03.630" style="s2">and you get all this epicycles and it</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.020" end="00:32:06.690" style="s2">gets convoluted and complex and then</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.630" end="00:32:08.100" style="s2">Copernicus comes along and says and this</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.690" end="00:32:10.350" style="s2">is really crucial what he actually the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.100" end="00:32:13.110" style="s2">way he actually says it he says the math</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.350" end="00:32:19.560" style="s2">is better if you put the Sun at the</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.110" end="00:32:20.400" style="s2">center right now notice we talked about</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.560" end="00:32:22.470" style="s2">this before</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.400" end="00:32:23.580" style="s2">Aristarchus had said the Sun could be at</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.470" end="00:32:25.770" style="s2">the center and there was all these</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.580" end="00:32:27.300" style="s2">arguments against it and Galileo sorry</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.770" end="00:32:29.310" style="s2">Copernicus doesn&#39;t have any answer to</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.300" end="00:32:31.380" style="s2">any of those arguments but he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.310" end="00:32:32.850" style="s2">need them now because people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.380" end="00:32:34.590" style="s2">committed to this new way of thinking</p>

<p begin="00:32:38.100" end="00:32:46.200" style="s2">of thinking and if it makes the math</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.960" end="00:32:47.760" style="s2">better that&#39;s good enough and we all</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.200" end="00:32:49.890" style="s2">talked about this oh yeah it&#39;s the</p>

<p begin="00:32:49.890" end="00:32:54.830" style="s2">and we titter over our coffee and tea</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.580" end="00:33:02.610" style="s2">look you have to understand what this</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.900" end="00:33:05.430" style="s2">means you have to really get it let&#39;s go</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.610" end="00:33:08.700" style="s2">back you&#39;re using this Aristotelian way</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.430" end="00:33:11.340" style="s2">of thinking right remember what was</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.700" end="00:33:14.160" style="s2">Aristotle&#39;s marks of how you determine</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.340" end="00:33:19.320" style="s2">if things were real okay is the organ</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.160" end="00:33:21.870" style="s2">relevant organ functioning yes is the</p>

<p begin="00:37:28.329" end="00:37:32.980" style="s2">disconnected from the world you can see</p>

<p begin="00:37:36.009" end="00:37:42.059" style="s2">just something that we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.799" end="00:37:45.640" style="s2">but it&#39;s not what really is the case now</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.059" end="00:37:48.720" style="s2">galileo comes along and says ah but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.640" end="00:37:50.769" style="s2">got an answer to Arkham this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.720" end="00:37:53.650" style="s2">Copernicus is showing it this is what</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.769" end="00:37:55.900" style="s2">this new scientific way where I put</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.650" end="00:37:57.759" style="s2">Aristotelian logic and I put the new</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.900" end="00:37:59.410" style="s2">math together and I put careful</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.759" end="00:38:02.650" style="s2">observation together what it&#39;s telling</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.410" end="00:38:04.869" style="s2">me is that the math yeah spoken language</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.650" end="00:38:07.329" style="s2">and Sense experience can&#39;t trust those</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.869" end="00:38:08.589" style="s2">that the math mathematics is the</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.329" end="00:38:10.569" style="s2">language of the universe</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.589" end="00:38:13.509" style="s2">he&#39;s very influenced by that old</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.569" end="00:38:18.789" style="s2">Platonic view about abstract</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.509" end="00:38:22.119" style="s2">the medical things being what&#39;s real now</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.789" end="00:38:25.239" style="s2">what Galileo does is he starts to put</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.119" end="00:38:28.179" style="s2">that new way of thinking about math that</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.239" end="00:38:31.539" style="s2">new way of observing that new way of</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.179" end="00:38:34.019" style="s2">reasoning into practice he does</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.539" end="00:38:38.499" style="s2">something really unusual</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.019" end="00:38:41.649" style="s2">so of course math up until that time had</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.499" end="00:38:44.919" style="s2">been and still primarily was understood</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.649" end="00:38:47.679" style="s2">via geometry so the quintessential math</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.919" end="00:38:50.729" style="s2">text is Euclid&#39;s elements right math and</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.679" end="00:38:53.259" style="s2">geometry are pretty much synonymous</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.729" end="00:38:54.489" style="s2">now there&#39;s arithmetic in calculation we</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.259" end="00:38:56.919" style="s2">already talked about those new</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.489" end="00:38:59.109" style="s2">mathematical tools but Galileo does</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.919" end="00:39:01.209" style="s2">something really really interesting he</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.109" end="00:39:03.969" style="s2">starts using the geometry in a</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.209" end="00:39:06.699" style="s2">completely abstract fashion because look</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.969" end="00:39:11.409" style="s2">my sense experiences can&#39;t be trusted</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.699" end="00:39:12.669" style="s2">right the way I&#39;m the way I am thinking</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.409" end="00:39:14.979" style="s2">of things doesn&#39;t have to in any way</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.669" end="00:39:17.199" style="s2">look like what it&#39;s representing there</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.979" end="00:39:20.139" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have to be any sensual no</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.199" end="00:39:25.719" style="s2">sensual no experiential similarity</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.139" end="00:39:28.689" style="s2">between my thoughts and and the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.719" end="00:39:31.299" style="s2">let me show you what I mean here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.689" end="00:39:33.099" style="s2">triangle I&#39;m gonna use geometry and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.299" end="00:39:36.309" style="s2">using it to represent the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.099" end="00:39:39.339" style="s2">between you know distance and time and</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.309" end="00:39:44.619" style="s2">that gives me speed now there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.339" end="00:39:47.729" style="s2">triangular about speed he&#39;s using the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.619" end="00:39:50.380" style="s2">geometry to represent abstract</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.729" end="00:39:52.679" style="s2">mathematical relations these have</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.380" end="00:39:54.509" style="s2">nothing to do with how I&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.679" end="00:39:59.499" style="s2">experiencing the world</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.509" end="00:40:04.389" style="s2">there&#39;s no conformity between this and</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.499" end="00:40:07.329" style="s2">the way the world is in my experience so</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.389" end="00:40:14.319" style="s2">he starts to use math in a purely</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.329" end="00:40:16.630" style="s2">abstract symbolic way so he starts to</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.319" end="00:40:20.439" style="s2">observe things like he sees a chandelier</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.630" end="00:40:23.380" style="s2">swinging in a church and he measures it</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.439" end="00:40:26.480" style="s2">by tracking with his Paltz he&#39;s rolling</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.380" end="00:40:28.490" style="s2">balls down inclined planes</p>
<p begin="00:40:26.480" end="00:40:32.050" style="s2">and what is he what is what comes out of</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.490" end="00:40:37.790" style="s2">all of this well</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.050" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">Galileo kills the universe because what</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.790" end="00:40:47.000" style="s2">Galileo realizes is inertial motion</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:48.829" style="s2">things don&#39;t move because there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.000" end="00:40:49.940" style="s2">inner drive and they&#39;re trying to get</p>
<p begin="00:40:48.829" end="00:40:52.550" style="s2">where they belong</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.940" end="00:40:54.260" style="s2">that&#39;s a purposeful narrative way of</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.550" end="00:40:57.730" style="s2">understanding the world things don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.260" end="00:41:00.470" style="s2">move for that reason things move because</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.730" end="00:41:03.140" style="s2">they&#39;ve been hit by a purely random</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.470" end="00:41:05.420" style="s2">arbitrary external force and they will</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.140" end="00:41:08.410" style="s2">continue moving like that until another</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.420" end="00:41:10.910" style="s2">random external force before Galileo</p>

<p begin="00:41:12.800" end="00:41:17.390" style="s2">where it belongs to make the universe a</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.079" end="00:41:21.560" style="s2">more beautiful ordered place after</p>

<p begin="00:41:24.170" end="00:41:31.609" style="s2">on purpose at all now that is really</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.359" end="00:41:33.140" style="s2">important because before Galileo you</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.609" end="00:41:34.910" style="s2">were like everything else because you</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.140" end="00:41:37.670" style="s2">act on purpose and so does everything</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.910" end="00:41:41.810" style="s2">else when Galileo kills the universe</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.670" end="00:41:47.750" style="s2">you&#39;re now a little island of purpose in</p>

<p begin="00:42:29.410" end="00:42:37.010" style="s2">and what happens is Galileo starts to</p>
<p begin="00:42:32.960" end="00:42:39.589" style="s2">understand matter differently in the old</p>

<p begin="00:42:43.099" end="00:42:51.589" style="s2">now matter goes to being that which</p>
