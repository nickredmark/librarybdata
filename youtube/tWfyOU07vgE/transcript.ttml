<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:37.599" style="s2">more i have pretty good reason that when</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.440" end="00:08:39.200" style="s2">people believe there is it is usually</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.599" end="00:08:41.680" style="s2">an easy place for those people to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.200" end="00:08:44.159" style="s2">messed up</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.680" end="00:08:45.839" style="s2">i have found some people who take</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.159" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">seriously the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.839" end="00:08:49.120" style="s2">demons and devils and whatever and some</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:51.120" style="s2">good comes of it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.120" end="00:08:53.200" style="s2">very easy to go down directions that i</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.120" end="00:08:55.120" style="s2">would consider net not positive from</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.200" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">that belief</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:09:00.080" style="s2">which is different than saying from that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:02.080" style="s2">as a symbolic psychological process</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.080" end="00:09:04.240" style="s2">i think it can be quite valuable if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.080" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">held as a symbolic psychological process</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.240" end="00:09:06.399" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.120" end="00:09:10.800" style="s2">you&#39;re on a heavy dose of mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.880" end="00:09:14.959" style="s2">doing a mushroom journey</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.800" end="00:09:18.720" style="s2">and you see some demons coming after you</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.959" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">and it&#39;s possible see like even</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.720" end="00:09:24.880" style="s2">the cognitive frame of how to hold that</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.480" end="00:09:27.120" style="s2">if someone holds it as the mushrooms are</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.880" end="00:09:28.720" style="s2">helping them see into the astral realms</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.120" end="00:09:30.800" style="s2">and the demons are actually there and</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.720" end="00:09:32.240" style="s2">they have to like</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.800" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">protect themselves from the demons in</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.240" end="00:09:35.200" style="s2">that realm because there&#39;s some reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.519" style="s2">to it</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.200" end="00:09:39.040" style="s2">i have seen people become traumatized</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.519" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">from journeys</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.040" end="00:09:43.279" style="s2">in that way because now they are scared</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">of what&#39;s happening in the astral realm</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.279" end="00:09:46.720" style="s2">they&#39;re scared to go to sleep</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:48.880" style="s2">they need protection with them things</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.720" end="00:09:50.959" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.880" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">if you hold these are phenomena arising</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.959" end="00:09:54.320" style="s2">in my experience arising in my mind and</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.399" style="s2">my phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.320" end="00:09:58.160" style="s2">and that can&#39;t actually hurt me</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.399" end="00:09:59.440" style="s2">something arising in my mind can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.160" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">actually hurt my</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.440" end="00:10:03.200" style="s2">other part of my mind or my body the</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:04.959" style="s2">fear of it maybe can</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.200" end="00:10:06.480" style="s2">so i go towards it as opposed to go away</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.959" end="00:10:07.839" style="s2">from him the same would be say in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.480" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">dream we talked about this some last</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.839" end="00:10:12.640" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:15.839" style="s2">and you know i had this experience</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.640" end="00:10:18.880" style="s2">when i first turned towards the demons</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.839" end="00:10:21.519" style="s2">and they</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.880" end="00:10:22.959" style="s2">were gonna come eat me and i&#39;m like this</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.519" end="00:10:25.440" style="s2">is a [ __ ]</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.959" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">dream this is a trip great eat me like i</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.440" end="00:10:29.760" style="s2">can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.399" style="s2">die here go ahead and so then the fear</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.760" end="00:10:32.079" style="s2">dissolved</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.399" end="00:10:33.519" style="s2">because it couldn&#39;t actually really hurt</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.079" end="00:10:35.440" style="s2">me and i&#39;m like please eat me and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.519" end="00:10:36.480" style="s2">so it tried to become something scary or</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.440" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">some nasty like</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.480" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">cockroach monster that was going to eat</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:40.399" style="s2">my eyes out and there was a moment of</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">fear and i&#39;m like no go</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.399" end="00:10:44.000" style="s2">go for it and so then that fear can</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:45.200" style="s2">dissolve so then it became like a black</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.000" end="00:10:46.800" style="s2">hole that was going to swell up the</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.200" end="00:10:48.160" style="s2">universe and like go for it</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.800" end="00:10:49.760" style="s2">and then it was like a devil that was</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.160" end="00:10:50.399" style="s2">going to eat my soul and like go for it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.760" end="00:10:53.360" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.399" end="00:10:53.920" style="s2">it all just turned into light right</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.360" end="00:10:55.760" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.920" end="00:10:58.480" style="s2">because there was no more fear there was</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.760" end="00:11:00.560" style="s2">nothing that was going to get me to</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.480" end="00:11:01.519" style="s2">go into reaction with another part of</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.560" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">myself</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.519" end="00:11:07.760" style="s2">in that way um</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:08.880" style="s2">so that was relating to demons in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.760" end="00:11:10.720" style="s2">symbolic</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.880" end="00:11:14.160" style="s2">way that created psychological</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.720" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">integration of parts of self</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.160" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">i think that can be very helpful</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:25.360" style="s2">in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.959" end="00:11:33.920" style="s2">psychology of sadism what makes people</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.519" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">like the psychology of sociopathy is or</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.920" end="00:11:37.279" style="s2">psychopathy is one thing how does</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">someone have their empathy decoupled</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.279" end="00:11:40.079" style="s2">from other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:42.640" style="s2">where someone else can be feeling</p>

<p begin="00:11:42.640" end="00:11:46.160" style="s2">but then how does someone get to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:48.079" style="s2">place where it&#39;s flipped right where</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.160" end="00:11:50.480" style="s2">they actually feel</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.079" end="00:11:52.000" style="s2">positive emotional valence on somebody</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.480" end="00:11:54.320" style="s2">else&#39;s negative emotional</p>

<p begin="00:11:55.279" end="00:12:00.000" style="s2">i wrestled to understand this because i</p>

<p begin="00:12:12.079" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">suffered at the hands of other people a</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.760" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">lot</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:19.440" style="s2">felt controlled felt like they were in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:21.120" style="s2">suffering and felt very alone in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.440" end="00:12:23.040" style="s2">when they go on the other side and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.120" end="00:12:25.600" style="s2">induce someone else to be in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.040" end="00:12:26.959" style="s2">in that state there&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.600" end="00:12:28.560" style="s2">connection that occurs</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.959" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">someone else&#39;s experience what they</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.560" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">experience i have witnessed that as</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:33.760" style="s2">one of the phenomena</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.839" end="00:12:37.519" style="s2">also where someone had a profound lack</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.920" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">of control and they felt a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.519" end="00:12:42.079" style="s2">uncertainty and fear and insecurity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">the answer was gain control</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.079" end="00:12:46.240" style="s2">sometimes people who are sadists really</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:47.920" style="s2">actually will take joy in bringing other</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.240" end="00:12:48.560" style="s2">people excitement and bringing them hope</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.920" end="00:12:50.240" style="s2">and then</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.560" end="00:12:51.680" style="s2">and bringing them sexual arousal and</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.240" end="00:12:53.600" style="s2">then also crushing them</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.680" end="00:12:54.880" style="s2">and then bringing them back because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.600" end="00:12:56.320" style="s2">not just in</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.880" end="00:12:58.639" style="s2">anti-coupling that they&#39;re happy when</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.320" end="00:12:59.760" style="s2">the other person is miserable it&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.639" end="00:13:01.760" style="s2">they&#39;re happy when they get to</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.760" end="00:13:04.000" style="s2">experience their own control</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.760" end="00:13:06.079" style="s2">over reality and particularly the</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.000" end="00:13:09.360" style="s2">subjective reality of somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.079" end="00:13:13.120" style="s2">so those would both be examples of</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.360" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">evil as a result of a compensation</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.120" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">pattern for trauma</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:17.839" style="s2">right the thing that we would call evil</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:20.880" style="s2">or malevolence and people as a</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.839" end="00:13:22.800" style="s2">particular kind of trauma response</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.880" end="00:13:24.720" style="s2">that&#39;s mostly how i hold it on an</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.800" end="00:13:26.160" style="s2">individual level and then collectively</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.720" end="00:13:29.519" style="s2">there are whole cultures that are</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.160" end="00:13:31.040" style="s2">basically auto poetic traumatizers</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.519" end="00:13:34.320" style="s2">you know that are traumatizing people</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.040" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">systemically and then those which is</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.320" end="00:13:36.720" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">conditioning people to propagate those</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.720" end="00:13:39.120" style="s2">traumas</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.480" end="00:13:45.199" style="s2">and so then you start to say like okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.440" end="00:13:47.040" style="s2">well if it is autopoetic there&#39;s almost</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.199" end="00:13:49.760" style="s2">like a being to it right like let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.040" end="00:13:52.600" style="s2">we take capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.760" end="00:13:54.800" style="s2">capitalism is this auto-poetic</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.600" end="00:13:58.160" style="s2">self-propagating self-evolving thing</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.800" end="00:14:01.440" style="s2">right self-evolving because it goes from</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.160" end="00:14:03.279" style="s2">barter to some people wouldn&#39;t even call</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.440" end="00:14:06.959" style="s2">that capitalism yet but the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.279" end="00:14:09.760" style="s2">owning of capital property um</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.959" end="00:14:11.760" style="s2">from barter to currency to fiat currency</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.760" end="00:14:14.480" style="s2">to fractional reserve fiat currency</p>
<p begin="00:14:11.760" end="00:14:16.480" style="s2">to algorithmic high-speed trading on</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.480" end="00:14:19.360" style="s2">fraction reserve fiat currency it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.480" end="00:14:20.560" style="s2">like an ai it&#39;s evolving its algorithm</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.360" end="00:14:21.600" style="s2">for how it does that right so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.560" end="00:14:24.000" style="s2">like okay</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.600" end="00:14:25.760" style="s2">who did that well nobody did that take</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.000" end="00:14:26.720" style="s2">the person who figured out algo trading</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.760" end="00:14:29.279" style="s2">out of the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.720" end="00:14:30.720" style="s2">in history and somebody else would have</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.279" end="00:14:33.199" style="s2">and so you&#39;re like there is some</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.720" end="00:14:34.480" style="s2">auto-poetic self-propagating thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.199" end="00:14:36.240" style="s2">that&#39;s happening there</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.480" end="00:14:38.320" style="s2">is there almost like a spirit of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.240" end="00:14:41.680" style="s2">thing an entity of that thing that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.320" end="00:14:43.839" style="s2">i really love that article on slate star</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.680" end="00:14:45.839" style="s2">codex meditations on molok</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.839" end="00:14:47.519" style="s2">because you know he&#39;s describing the</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.839" end="00:14:50.480" style="s2">autopoetic property of</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.519" end="00:14:51.920" style="s2">arms races and then kind of describing</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.480" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">what the spirit of that thing</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.920" end="00:14:54.560" style="s2">seems like</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.440" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">and it is really tricky when you get the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.440" end="00:15:00.399" style="s2">sense of like okay</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.480" end="00:15:04.560" style="s2">those who seem to do the bidding of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.440" end="00:15:06.480" style="s2">game of power</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.560" end="00:15:08.240" style="s2">those who seem to do well at the game of</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.480" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">power get more power in the system and</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.240" end="00:15:10.399" style="s2">in turn</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:13.279" style="s2">keep modifying the system to be better</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.399" end="00:15:15.040" style="s2">for people like them</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.279" end="00:15:17.440" style="s2">those who oppose the game of power</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.040" end="00:15:19.360" style="s2">including the worst evils and injustices</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.440" end="00:15:21.040" style="s2">of it are also opposing the people who</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.360" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">are doing well at it so then those</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.040" end="00:15:24.320" style="s2">people work to</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:26.560" style="s2">get rid of the other people and so there</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.320" end="00:15:29.279" style="s2">is the self-reinforcing dynamic</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.560" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">and you&#39;re like that&#39;s a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.279" end="00:15:32.560" style="s2">collective intelligence what the [ __ ] do</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.320" style="s2">we do to keep that thing from just</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.560" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">running to zenith which is a paperclip</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.320" end="00:15:37.040" style="s2">maximizer</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.600" end="00:15:41.920" style="s2">and this is i mean i think it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:44.399" style="s2">intuiting that</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.920" end="00:15:45.199" style="s2">after the you know world war one and</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.399" end="00:15:47.440" style="s2">then world war</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.199" end="00:15:48.880" style="s2">ii that led to lord of the rings and</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.440" end="00:15:52.560" style="s2">star wars as these great</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.880" end="00:15:55.040" style="s2">modern mythos right of sauron and the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.560" end="00:15:56.959" style="s2">orcs or uh</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.040" end="00:15:58.160" style="s2">the death star and the empire that were</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.959" end="00:16:00.399" style="s2">like this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.160" end="00:16:02.560" style="s2">seemingly undefeatable self-propagating</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.399" end="00:16:05.839" style="s2">paperclip maximizer type thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.560" end="00:16:08.480" style="s2">and how was it that a small</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.839" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">rebel alliance or fellowship of a ring</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.480" end="00:16:12.160" style="s2">could actually do something about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.000" end="00:16:17.440" style="s2">i think the energy of hopelessness that</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.880" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.440" end="00:16:19.920" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.440" end="00:16:24.880" style="s2">is something that one needs to feel and</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.360" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">not pretend that they don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.880" end="00:16:27.440" style="s2">otherwise they&#39;ll kind of fragment</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:29.199" style="s2">inside</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.440" end="00:16:30.880" style="s2">but then recognize whoa that</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.199" end="00:16:32.720" style="s2">hopelessness</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.880" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">is actually an expression of the depth</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.720" end="00:16:37.839" style="s2">of desire for hope in me which is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:39.120" style="s2">which is a result of the depth of love</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.839" end="00:16:40.959" style="s2">and care in me</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.120" end="00:16:43.199" style="s2">and let me reconnect to the love and</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.959" end="00:16:45.440" style="s2">care and then reconnect to my sense of</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.199" end="00:16:47.279" style="s2">agency my sense of agency is overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.440" end="00:16:48.240" style="s2">so i care more than i feel like i can do</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.279" end="00:16:49.920" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.240" end="00:16:51.680" style="s2">so how do i come back to the care and</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.920" end="00:16:53.360" style="s2">then how do i look to grow or increase</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.680" end="00:16:55.519" style="s2">my agency in steps</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.360" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">rather than be able to say okay my</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.519" end="00:16:58.720" style="s2">agency&#39;s here</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:16:59.839" style="s2">here&#39;s this whole set of issues i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.720" end="00:17:02.320" style="s2">address all of them so i&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.839" end="00:17:03.440" style="s2">overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.320" end="00:17:05.280" style="s2">someone needs to take a more</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.440" end="00:17:07.199" style="s2">developmental approach to how to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.280" end="00:17:09.919" style="s2">increase their agency</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.199" end="00:17:11.520" style="s2">uh with that because otherwise i think</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.919" end="00:17:13.360" style="s2">one of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.520" end="00:17:14.880" style="s2">evil gets to self-propagate is by</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.360" end="00:17:16.480" style="s2">causing overwhelm in those that would</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.880" end="00:17:18.959" style="s2">oppose it</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.480" end="00:17:21.199" style="s2">right or basically decreasing will or</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.959" end="00:17:23.039" style="s2">agency except where it has sociopathic</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.199" end="00:17:24.240" style="s2">or sadistic expressions</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.039" end="00:17:26.160" style="s2">because typically anyone who has</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.240" end="00:17:27.839" style="s2">sociopathic or sadistic orientation</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.160" end="00:17:28.559" style="s2">towards power doesn&#39;t get overwhelmed</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.839" end="00:17:31.039" style="s2">and lose power</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.559" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">right they keep seeking how do i hold</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.039" end="00:17:33.840" style="s2">empowerment more</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.120" end="00:17:41.760" style="s2">so of course</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.160" end="00:17:47.200" style="s2">okay two more things i&#39;ll say about it</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.919" end="00:17:50.640" style="s2">when we ask what is</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.200" end="00:17:52.240" style="s2">choice i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.640" end="00:17:54.559" style="s2">the whole question about will and</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.240" end="00:17:58.240" style="s2">determinism is</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.559" end="00:18:00.400" style="s2">like foundational existential question</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.240" end="00:18:02.160" style="s2">but if we were to define choice as being</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.400" end="00:18:02.720" style="s2">anything that is worthy of calling</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.160" end="00:18:05.039" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.720" end="00:18:06.720" style="s2">then it&#39;s distinct from just causation</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.039" end="00:18:09.919" style="s2">or summed up causation otherwise there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.720" end="00:18:12.720" style="s2">no basis to call a choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.919" end="00:18:15.280" style="s2">and then we say what is a good choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.720" end="00:18:16.799" style="s2">the fundamental question of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.280" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">we can say to the degree there is a</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.799" end="00:18:20.080" style="s2">reality of choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.280" end="00:18:24.640" style="s2">a good choice furthers the field of</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.919" end="00:18:26.480" style="s2">choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.640" end="00:18:28.320" style="s2">it expands the phase space of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.480" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">possibilities to keep choosing</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.320" end="00:18:33.919" style="s2">so choice is reifying itself</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:36.000" style="s2">whereas a choice that debases the</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.919" end="00:18:37.440" style="s2">possibility for future choice is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:40.720" style="s2">self-terminating choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.440" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">so if i am if i&#39;m making a choice that</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.720" end="00:18:45.679" style="s2">decreases my own agency and sovereignty</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.840" end="00:18:47.280" style="s2">we can say pretty straightforwardly</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.679" end="00:18:50.320" style="s2">that&#39;s not a good choice it ends up</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.280" end="00:18:52.480" style="s2">debasing the possibility for choice</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.320" end="00:18:53.440" style="s2">if i make choices decrease the agency of</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.480" end="00:18:55.919" style="s2">others that</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.440" end="00:18:57.760" style="s2">and i am not decreasing the phase space</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.919" end="00:18:59.600" style="s2">of choice for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.760" end="00:19:01.440" style="s2">that&#39;s also then the next level of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:59.600" end="00:19:02.960" style="s2">question a good choice increases the</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.440" end="00:19:04.880" style="s2">face space of choice for the whole</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.960" end="00:19:06.320" style="s2">which also means the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.880" end="00:19:09.360" style="s2">choices that would</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.320" end="00:19:11.520" style="s2">suck so you don&#39;t ever get an</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.360" end="00:19:12.559" style="s2">absolute law or binding on no choice</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.520" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">that sucks without</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.559" end="00:19:16.240" style="s2">actually debasing choice itself</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.960" end="00:19:21.200" style="s2">um maybe you guys will have forrest on</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.799" end="00:19:23.120" style="s2">some time to speak about that</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.200" end="00:19:25.039" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of the beginning of how he</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.120" end="00:19:26.799" style="s2">talks about choice and then he defines</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.039" end="00:19:28.559" style="s2">evil as that which does not further that</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.799" end="00:19:29.360" style="s2">which shuts down the possibility to</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.559" end="00:19:33.120" style="s2">further</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.360" end="00:19:36.640" style="s2">the reality of experience and choice</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.120" end="00:19:38.320" style="s2">i have a rabbi friend who describes evil</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.640" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">as always being the result of a</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.320" end="00:19:44.559" style="s2">breakdown in intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:47.120" style="s2">and that i can&#39;t hurt somebody</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.559" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">if i feel really connected to them and</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.120" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">if there is a sense of us</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:52.160" style="s2">as part of the web of life if there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.400" end="00:19:54.400" style="s2">sense of intimacy with each other in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.160" end="00:19:57.120" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.400" end="00:19:58.000" style="s2">evil can&#39;t really arise in that presence</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.120" end="00:20:00.559" style="s2">so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.000" end="00:20:02.400" style="s2">basically disconnectedness a breakdown</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.559" end="00:20:02.720" style="s2">in the authentic intimacy of reality</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.400" end="00:20:05.280" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.720" end="00:20:07.600" style="s2">because there is authentic connectedness</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.280" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">becomes the niche in which evil can</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.600" end="00:20:10.000" style="s2">arise</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.640" end="00:20:13.760" style="s2">probably just opened up more questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.559" end="00:20:16.640" style="s2">than answered but those are the first</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.760" end="00:20:19.039" style="s2">thoughts that come to mind</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.640" end="00:20:20.320" style="s2">all right and and um forrest landry is</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.039" end="00:20:22.240" style="s2">coming to the stoa on</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.320" end="00:20:24.880" style="s2">october 27th for those of you who are</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.240" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">interested um</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.880" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">what&#39;s it called so keith yeah keith you</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.360" end="00:20:30.240" style="s2">had a follow-up question</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.919" end="00:20:38.720" style="s2">um so i had two sort of follow-ups</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.440" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">it&#39;s good to see you again um and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.720" end="00:20:43.280" style="s2">the first follow-up is uh it can you</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:45.440" style="s2">speak to the way</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.280" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">cultures select for institutionalized</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.440" end="00:20:49.039" style="s2">sociopathy</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:50.480" style="s2">and then the second one is and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.039" end="00:20:52.720" style="s2">thinking about that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.480" end="00:20:54.480" style="s2">the pushing to the margins of perception</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.720" end="00:20:55.840" style="s2">that you might see in media where</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.480" end="00:20:57.520" style="s2">certain things are highlighted and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.840" end="00:21:00.159" style="s2">certain things aren&#39;t in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.520" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">allows the culture to ignore things that</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.159" end="00:21:04.400" style="s2">uh might stop it</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">or make it second guess itself um and</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.400" end="00:21:07.600" style="s2">then the second one is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:09.360" style="s2">uh kind of related to that how do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.600" end="00:21:11.280" style="s2">set up your personal empathy stack</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.360" end="00:21:14.000" style="s2">like what emotionally valent content do</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.280" end="00:21:17.039" style="s2">you bring into your life intentionally</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.000" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">um to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.039" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">relate to the world</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.600" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">the first topic i&#39;ve talked about on a</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.480" end="00:21:37.600" style="s2">lot of podcasts of how</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:40.720" style="s2">um how arms races work</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.600" end="00:21:42.320" style="s2">and the cultures that do the more uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.720" end="00:21:45.039" style="s2">effectively game theoretic things get</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.320" end="00:21:46.240" style="s2">selected so i won&#39;t say too much on that</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.039" end="00:21:48.880" style="s2">i think one thing i&#39;ll say</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.240" end="00:21:51.039" style="s2">is because you brought up media</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.880" end="00:21:54.080" style="s2">specifically</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.039" end="00:21:55.840" style="s2">one very easy way to do one of the</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.080" end="00:21:57.840" style="s2">easiest ways</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.840" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">for a whole culture to buy into evil is</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.840" end="00:22:01.039" style="s2">to believe that it&#39;s righteous</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.760" end="00:22:06.799" style="s2">and all you have to do to commit an act</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.440" end="00:22:07.760" style="s2">of evil and believe it&#39;s righteous is</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.799" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">believe the other to</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.760" end="00:22:10.320" style="s2">to be evil</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.799" end="00:22:17.280" style="s2">and so it&#39;s easy to take other subjects</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.480" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">who have subjective experience and put a</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.280" end="00:22:21.120" style="s2">label on all of them together that makes</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.880" end="00:22:24.840" style="s2">them an object and actually makes them</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.120" end="00:22:26.480" style="s2">a nasty terrible object right they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.840" end="00:22:29.039" style="s2">terrorists</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.480" end="00:22:31.120" style="s2">they&#39;re racists they&#39;re whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.039" end="00:22:33.600" style="s2">and now i&#39;m not actually relating</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.120" end="00:22:35.440" style="s2">to a being with feelings i&#39;m relating to</p>
<p begin="00:22:33.600" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">some bad entity that needs stopped or</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.440" end="00:22:37.919" style="s2">hurt</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:41.039" style="s2">now to the degree that i heard it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.919" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">actually doing a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.039" end="00:22:44.559" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.880" end="00:22:48.080" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s this ted talk everybody</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.520" end="00:22:51.280" style="s2">should</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.080" end="00:22:52.960" style="s2">watch uh it&#39;s called something like on</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.280" end="00:22:56.080" style="s2">being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.960" end="00:22:57.679" style="s2">and um it&#39;s this lady who</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.080" end="00:22:59.280" style="s2">wrote a book and did this whole analysis</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.679" end="00:23:00.559" style="s2">on people&#39;s psychological experience of</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.280" end="00:23:03.039" style="s2">being wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.559" end="00:23:04.640" style="s2">um and in the beginning she asked the</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.039" end="00:23:06.960" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.640" end="00:23:08.080" style="s2">what does it feel like to be wrong and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.960" end="00:23:10.000" style="s2">people say well it feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.080" end="00:23:11.520" style="s2">embarrassing and shameful and stupid and</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.000" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">she goes no no that&#39;s what it feels like</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.520" end="00:23:13.760" style="s2">to find out you were wrong after the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:15.200" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.760" end="00:23:16.640" style="s2">but you were wrong for a while first</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.200" end="00:23:17.280" style="s2">what did it feel like before you found</p>
<p begin="00:23:16.640" end="00:23:19.679" style="s2">out well it</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.280" end="00:23:20.880" style="s2">usually felt like being right um because</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.679" end="00:23:22.240" style="s2">you were usually pretty certain that you</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.880" end="00:23:25.520" style="s2">you&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.240" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">and in the same way what does it feel</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.520" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">like to do evil well it usually feels</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:30.320" style="s2">like righteousness</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.559" end="00:23:37.919" style="s2">right that&#39;s the holy war um</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.080" end="00:23:39.520" style="s2">so in the name of i&#39;m sure my side is</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.919" end="00:23:40.960" style="s2">right and i&#39;m sure their site is wrong</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.520" end="00:23:42.480" style="s2">even though i haven&#39;t spent real time</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.960" end="00:23:45.039" style="s2">with them and can&#39;t empathize with them</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.480" end="00:23:47.120" style="s2">and only have straw man versions of them</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.039" end="00:23:51.679" style="s2">i feel right in attacking them because</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.120" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">i&#39;m on the right side of history uh</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.679" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">so anything that otherizes in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">disconnects our empathy which breaks the</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:00.960" style="s2">intimacy</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:04.000" style="s2">ends up making evil easy to propagate</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.960" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">and be hidden</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.000" end="00:24:07.520" style="s2">that&#39;s one thing i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.120" end="00:24:19.840" style="s2">and on the second question</p>

<p begin="00:26:26.240" end="00:26:34.320" style="s2">i guess uh if i had a follow-up um</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.159" end="00:26:37.600" style="s2">i am kind of curious i definitely feel</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.320" end="00:26:40.720" style="s2">daniel uh what you&#39;re talking about with</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.600" end="00:26:44.400" style="s2">just the getting turned off emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.720" end="00:26:46.720" style="s2">by you know like i think anyone who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.400" end="00:26:48.240" style="s2">engaging with highly cognitive you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:46.720" end="00:26:50.840" style="s2">trying to save the world kind of content</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.240" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">is going to run into that barrier</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.840" end="00:26:53.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.080" end="00:26:57.440" style="s2">and then it&#39;s like okay i guess like my</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.720" end="00:26:59.600" style="s2">initial</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.440" end="00:27:00.880" style="s2">thought is like okay well maybe i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.600" end="00:27:03.039" style="s2">just try to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.880" end="00:27:04.320" style="s2">figure out like where my agency is and</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.039" end="00:27:05.600" style="s2">then emotionally</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:08.080" style="s2">relate to the things that i actually</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.600" end="00:27:10.000" style="s2">have agency over and then</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.080" end="00:27:12.320" style="s2">but then there&#39;s this question of like</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.000" end="00:27:14.240" style="s2">is that fundamentally limiting my like</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.320" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">i&#39;m limiting my scope</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.240" end="00:27:18.799" style="s2">and do i just like turn on world food</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.559" style="s2">maps and see</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.799" end="00:27:23.760" style="s2">everywhere that&#39;s starving and then like</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.559" end="00:27:26.720" style="s2">try to reorient with this more objective</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.760" end="00:27:28.480" style="s2">overview i i don&#39;t know what you do um</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.720" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">so i&#39;m kind of curious how you break it</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.480" end="00:27:35.840" style="s2">down yourself</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.000" end="00:27:46.000" style="s2">um this is a very crude example but</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.159" end="00:27:47.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not worthless let&#39;s say you have an</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.000" end="00:27:50.640" style="s2">athletic goal that&#39;s very far from where</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.840" end="00:27:53.679" style="s2">you&#39;re currently at</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.640" end="00:27:59.279" style="s2">so for fun let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.679" end="00:28:01.200" style="s2">you want to binge press 500 pounds</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.279" end="00:28:03.200" style="s2">there&#39;s actually no amount of trying to</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.200" end="00:28:06.559" style="s2">bench press 500 pounds it will ever</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.200" end="00:28:08.880" style="s2">let you get it you&#39;ll just hurt yourself</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.559" end="00:28:10.720" style="s2">because you your muscles can&#39;t actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.880" end="00:28:12.960" style="s2">develop in that direction without bench</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.720" end="00:28:14.320" style="s2">pressing 180 pounds and then 200 and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.960" end="00:28:17.520" style="s2">then 220 and</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.320" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">so you can keep tuning into it you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.520" end="00:28:20.880" style="s2">keep watching the person who can for</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.200" end="00:28:22.320" style="s2">inspiration you can keep being aware</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.880" end="00:28:23.120" style="s2">that it&#39;s a direction you&#39;re wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.320" end="00:28:24.480" style="s2">trend</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.120" end="00:28:25.840" style="s2">but then you also have to come back to</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.480" end="00:28:27.760" style="s2">actually work at the edge of where your</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.840" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">current capacity is</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.760" end="00:28:30.880" style="s2">if you want to grow your capacity</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:32.159" style="s2">because if you just keep trying to bench</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.880" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">press the 500</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.159" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">you can do that for years and never</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:36.880" style="s2">actually make any progress</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:41.440" style="s2">there&#39;s a similar thing where most of</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.640" end="00:28:43.520" style="s2">your time</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.440" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">having your study be associated with</p>
<p begin="00:28:43.520" end="00:28:47.039" style="s2">things you can do stuff about so you</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:48.960" style="s2">also get closed feedback loops on am i</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.039" end="00:28:51.279" style="s2">getting this right is it working right</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.960" end="00:28:52.799" style="s2">i get some empiricism actually helps you</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.279" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">understand it better and grow your</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.799" end="00:28:55.520" style="s2">agency</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:57.039" style="s2">well having some attention on the bigger</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.520" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">problems to know emma</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.039" end="00:29:01.600" style="s2">of all the directions i could develop</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:04.159" style="s2">what direction do i want to develop in</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.600" end="00:29:05.520" style="s2">um but they&#39;re in the same way that you</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.159" end="00:29:07.039" style="s2">want to have a relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.520" end="00:29:08.480" style="s2">cognitive knowledge and the feeling you</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.039" end="00:29:10.320" style="s2">want to have a relationship between the</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.480" end="00:29:12.480" style="s2">cognitive knowledge of the big picture</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.320" end="00:29:15.039" style="s2">and the sense of what you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.480" end="00:29:17.679" style="s2">do about it agentically and that there</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.039" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">is a growth in your agency that could</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.679" end="00:29:21.440" style="s2">converge</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:22.559" style="s2">towards the things that you&#39;re studying</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.440" end="00:29:23.919" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t mean you have to know all</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.559" end="00:29:24.880" style="s2">the steps of how it converges you</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.919" end="00:29:27.279" style="s2">actually have to let go</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.880" end="00:29:28.799" style="s2">of knowing that but you have to have a</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.279" end="00:29:30.640" style="s2">sense that your agency&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.799" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">increasing from the nature of your</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.640" end="00:29:33.120" style="s2">endeavors</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.720" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">okay um so many good questions</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.559" end="00:29:44.880" style="s2">uh ryan you&#39;re up next</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.480" end="00:29:52.559" style="s2">hey daniel thanks so much for being here</p>

<p begin="00:29:55.679" end="00:30:00.080" style="s2">so yeah just curious how you personally</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.720" end="00:30:04.880" style="s2">parse those things apart how you</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.919" end="00:30:08.559" style="s2">personally</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.880" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">avoid limbic hijacking in the ecosystem</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.559" end="00:30:12.000" style="s2">of media as it is today</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.720" end="00:30:17.840" style="s2">i don&#39;t avoid it</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.960" end="00:30:26.240" style="s2">uh i would be i would be lying if i said</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.000" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">i could avoid it it&#39;s like saying</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.240" end="00:30:30.159" style="s2">that i could smell pizza and avoid</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:31.919" style="s2">having a physiologic response</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.159" end="00:30:35.200" style="s2">hunger response like i might choose not</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.919" end="00:30:38.480" style="s2">to eat it but a response is gonna occur</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.200" end="00:30:41.679" style="s2">right and because there is a those</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.480" end="00:30:44.080" style="s2">those molecules in the air have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.679" end="00:30:46.480" style="s2">real response and the same is true with</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.080" end="00:30:50.159" style="s2">those bits on the screen</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.480" end="00:30:53.200" style="s2">and so when i see the framing of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.159" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">um whatever right</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.200" end="00:30:56.799" style="s2">cops attack a bunch of protesters and i</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">see that thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.799" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">i&#39;m like i feel a fired up thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.240" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">so then the question is how do i process</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.720" end="00:31:06.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.399" end="00:31:14.399" style="s2">since i know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.440" end="00:31:16.240" style="s2">it has an effect and since i know that</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.399" end="00:31:18.559" style="s2">it&#39;s all bias</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.240" end="00:31:20.720" style="s2">i don&#39;t let myself share the piece or</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.559" end="00:31:23.760" style="s2">believe it or act on it</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.720" end="00:31:24.240" style="s2">before i do the rest of my sense making</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.760" end="00:31:27.360" style="s2">work</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.240" end="00:31:30.240" style="s2">right so i</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.360" end="00:31:31.840" style="s2">then go look to see okay is there</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.240" end="00:31:33.360" style="s2">another side to this story that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.840" end="00:31:35.120" style="s2">reporting a different way and it usually</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.360" end="00:31:36.720" style="s2">limbically hijacks me the opposite oh</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.120" end="00:31:38.000" style="s2">those cops came after these people</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.720" end="00:31:40.320" style="s2">attacked them</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.000" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">um and whatever and i see like a nearly</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.320" end="00:31:46.000" style="s2">opposite limbic hijack</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:48.159" style="s2">and so i can&#39;t say we&#39;ll have no</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.000" end="00:31:49.519" style="s2">bias i can say we&#39;ll try to take more</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.159" end="00:31:52.159" style="s2">different biases</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.519" end="00:31:54.080" style="s2">that are in dialectic so that i&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.159" end="00:31:55.840" style="s2">just controlled by some of them so</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.080" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">rather than say unbiased i&#39;d say bias</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.840" end="00:31:58.399" style="s2">corrected</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.840" end="00:32:04.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.360" end="00:32:08.000" style="s2">so simply identifying</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.640" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">whenever there is a view whether it</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.000" end="00:32:12.480" style="s2">comes down to what is true</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:13.919" style="s2">or a value statement that is polarized i</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.480" end="00:32:15.440" style="s2">want to make sure that i actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.919" end="00:32:17.840" style="s2">understand and</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.440" end="00:32:19.039" style="s2">have felt and could argue both sides of</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.840" end="00:32:20.399" style="s2">it well</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.039" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">before i share anything or take a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.399" end="00:32:22.799" style="s2">position</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.880" end="00:32:26.720" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s not just two things in</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.559" end="00:32:28.799" style="s2">dialectic sometimes there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.720" end="00:32:30.399" style="s2">a few perspectives that are really</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.799" end="00:32:31.919" style="s2">different and trending i call that the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.399" end="00:32:34.240" style="s2">narrative landscape so i want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.919" end="00:32:36.640" style="s2">understand the narrative landscape</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.240" end="00:32:38.320" style="s2">um once i can kind of put myself in the</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.640" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">position of how different people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.320" end="00:32:43.120" style="s2">seeing and feeling this</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:45.440" style="s2">then i can kind of not just empathize</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.120" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">with them but also get some parallax</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.440" end="00:32:48.000" style="s2">beyond it</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">all right um let&#39;s go with harry harry</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.039" end="00:32:57.840" style="s2">you had a question</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.159" end="00:33:01.360" style="s2">hey daniel um i just want to say i</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:02.960" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.360" end="00:33:04.480" style="s2">love listening to all your stuff so this</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.960" end="00:33:06.880" style="s2">is really cool uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.480" end="00:33:07.760" style="s2">my question is actually what you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.880" end="00:33:09.440" style="s2">finished on</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.760" end="00:33:11.360" style="s2">last time which is something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.440" end="00:33:15.440" style="s2">interested in around</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.360" end="00:33:18.080" style="s2">how do we create</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.440" end="00:33:19.840" style="s2">systems where we can best see where</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:20.960" style="s2">people at different developmental stages</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.840" end="00:33:23.039" style="s2">can develop</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.960" end="00:33:24.559" style="s2">at what rates so my question is is on</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.039" end="00:33:25.919" style="s2">the topic of that</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.559" end="00:33:27.760" style="s2">how do we take into account the</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.919" end="00:33:29.360" style="s2">different stages and i&#39;m using the</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.760" end="00:33:32.480" style="s2">integral model here</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.360" end="00:33:34.240" style="s2">as we map out heading into game b and do</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.480" end="00:33:35.440" style="s2">you have any insight into creating a</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.240" end="00:33:37.360" style="s2">methodology that takes</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.440" end="00:33:38.480" style="s2">each stage whether it&#39;s the ethnocentric</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.360" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">ecocentric</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.480" end="00:33:43.840" style="s2">or the global centric stages into</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:46.320" style="s2">account to bring us collectively</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.840" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">into the ability to hold that globalized</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.320" end="00:33:53.840" style="s2">empathy or perspective</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.679" end="00:33:59.440" style="s2">i actually think historically i&#39;m bad at</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:02.480" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.440" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">um have zach stein come on and talk</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.480" end="00:34:05.440" style="s2">about it he knows this much better than</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">i do</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.440" end="00:34:07.840" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.960" end="00:34:13.280" style="s2">i find that i can do a decent job with</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.119" end="00:34:15.359" style="s2">this one-on-one where i&#39;m getting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.280" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">ask a lot of questions and really get a</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.359" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">sense of</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.159" style="s2">how someone is modeling something and</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:23.200" style="s2">how they&#39;re responding</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.159" end="00:34:25.359" style="s2">but as far as the generalizations of</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.200" end="00:34:27.359" style="s2">different one-on-one learners into a</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.359" end="00:34:28.000" style="s2">group that we call a developmental level</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.359" end="00:34:29.599" style="s2">and how to</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.000" end="00:34:31.440" style="s2">appeal to that developmental level</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.599" end="00:34:33.040" style="s2">differently than other ones</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.440" end="00:34:35.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t think that&#39;s something that i</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.040" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">understand well or i&#39;m great at</p>
<p begin="00:34:35.520" end="00:34:39.040" style="s2">uh i think it&#39;s important</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.520" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">which is why i would encourage you</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.639" end="00:34:44.000" style="s2">having zach on uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.480" end="00:34:50.399" style="s2">i think i can if i&#39;m not talking to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.119" end="00:34:51.760" style="s2">single person where i&#39;m getting to</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.399" end="00:34:54.000" style="s2">calibrate</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.760" end="00:34:55.679" style="s2">i think i err on the side of assuming</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.000" end="00:34:58.000" style="s2">people can hold more complexity than</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.679" end="00:34:59.839" style="s2">they actually can</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.000" end="00:35:02.079" style="s2">pretty often and then sharing things</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.839" end="00:35:04.960" style="s2">that are actually not that useful</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.079" end="00:35:05.920" style="s2">uh so i usually rely on other people who</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.960" end="00:35:08.800" style="s2">are better at that</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.920" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">to help make sure that&#39;s being rightly</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.800" end="00:35:11.359" style="s2">translated</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.640" end="00:35:16.000" style="s2">and zach is coming back to the stoa this</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.320" end="00:35:17.280" style="s2">thursday is going to be a guest star</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.000" end="00:35:20.079" style="s2">with greg henriquez and they&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.280" end="00:35:21.920" style="s2">have like meta system sex so maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.079" end="00:35:25.040" style="s2">can sneak that question there</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.920" end="00:35:29.760" style="s2">um all right i think uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.040" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">who said this one uh regarding proto-b&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.760" end="00:35:33.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t copy and paste your name</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.880" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">if you&#39;re going to mute yourself if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">know who you are</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:41.839" style="s2">oh nathan that&#39;s you</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.920" end="00:35:45.839" style="s2">you&#39;re going to mute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.720" end="00:35:53.520" style="s2">okay i&#39;ll read on your behalf nathan uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.400" end="00:35:58.160" style="s2">regarding proto-b&#39;s i&#39;ve been studying</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.320" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">aspects of proto-b structures that can</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.160" end="00:36:02.000" style="s2">help transfer over to game b</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:03.599" style="s2">how can we prevent them from becoming a</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.000" end="00:36:05.040" style="s2">cult-like structure us versus the</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.599" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">mentality</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.040" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">would being physically decentralized</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">grouping help prevent some of this</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:13.839" style="s2">uprooting not necessary</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.280" end="00:36:42.720" style="s2">so it&#39;s a hard it&#39;s a hard topic</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.880" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">um i don&#39;t know the answer</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.720" end="00:36:45.920" style="s2">because we haven&#39;t had proto-b&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:49.040" style="s2">are successful to</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.920" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">like i don&#39;t have enough empirical</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.040" end="00:36:54.480" style="s2">background on that in general</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:56.079" style="s2">if a community wants to prototype a way</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.480" end="00:36:58.000" style="s2">of living that&#39;s very different than the</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.079" end="00:37:00.880" style="s2">rest of the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.000" end="00:37:03.920" style="s2">they usually want a certain degree of</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.880" end="00:37:06.240" style="s2">autonomy from the world to build that</p>
<p begin="00:37:03.920" end="00:37:08.960" style="s2">culture and not have dominant culture</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.240" end="00:37:10.400" style="s2">keep pulling it back into other norms</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.960" end="00:37:11.680" style="s2">and usually they&#39;re doing that because</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.400" end="00:37:13.040" style="s2">they think that there is some way of</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.680" end="00:37:16.880" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.040" end="00:37:19.599" style="s2">uh and behaving together</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.880" end="00:37:21.440" style="s2">that is better than the current social</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.599" end="00:37:22.000" style="s2">structure so then it&#39;s hard not to have</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.440" end="00:37:25.440" style="s2">a sense</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.000" end="00:37:27.359" style="s2">of separation and better than and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.440" end="00:37:28.800" style="s2">even assessment of real</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.359" end="00:37:30.480" style="s2">like if you assess that current</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.800" end="00:37:32.240" style="s2">civilization is a self-terminating</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.480" end="00:37:34.800" style="s2">paperclip maximizer and most of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.240" end="00:37:36.560" style="s2">aspects of culture probably part of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.800" end="00:37:38.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very easy to do that thing again</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.560" end="00:37:40.320" style="s2">where you</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.000" end="00:37:41.280" style="s2">convert the subjects in it to part of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.320" end="00:37:44.640" style="s2">that object</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.280" end="00:37:47.760" style="s2">structure um and you know feel</p>

<p begin="00:37:51.760" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">and so to say well the goal of having it</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:37:58.800" style="s2">be able to include everyone</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.119" end="00:38:03.920" style="s2">well that&#39;s not enough because the</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.000" end="00:38:05.920" style="s2">crusades had the goal of christendom</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.920" end="00:38:08.240" style="s2">being able to include everyone right</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.920" end="00:38:10.320" style="s2">um but in a way that didn&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:38:08.240" end="00:38:12.320" style="s2">include</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.320" end="00:38:14.160" style="s2">the actual intelligence of others that</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.320" end="00:38:15.200" style="s2">might be different it just included that</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.160" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">everybody should think</p>
<p begin="00:38:15.200" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">the superior [ __ ] that we think</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.680" end="00:38:26.960" style="s2">it&#39;s almost like there is a certain kind</p>

<p begin="00:38:26.960" end="00:38:30.800" style="s2">in collective intelligence that is</p>

<p begin="00:38:30.800" end="00:38:34.480" style="s2">where i have a sense that other people</p>

<p begin="00:38:34.480" end="00:38:39.200" style="s2">engage in good faith that i would trust</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.440" end="00:38:42.240" style="s2">the quality of the output of that</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.200" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">dialectic more than i trust myself</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.240" end="00:38:46.079" style="s2">because possibly they&#39;ll surface things</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:48.400" style="s2">i&#39;m not seeing right like there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.079" end="00:38:49.760" style="s2">this was almost like the the spirit of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.400" end="00:38:51.680" style="s2">democracy that was held almost</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.760" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">religiously that there&#39;s this idea</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.680" end="00:38:56.560" style="s2">of a collective intelligence that is</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:58.320" style="s2">trusted where someone is willing to</p>

<p begin="00:39:01.440" end="00:39:04.560" style="s2">and the thought that it could act is</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.119" end="00:39:07.839" style="s2">actually has</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.560" end="00:39:10.640" style="s2">higher potential for good</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.839" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">insight and sense making than them or</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.640" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">their</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:16.320" style="s2">subgroup that shares the same bias as</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.920" end="00:39:24.320" style="s2">you know i lived in this uh i went to</p>
<p begin="00:39:22.079" end="00:39:27.440" style="s2">this university undergrad</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.320" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">uh called maharishi university and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.440" end="00:39:32.160" style="s2">was a really funny place that maybe the</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:34.079" style="s2">most extreme town gown</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.160" end="00:39:35.760" style="s2">division that i have witnessed anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.079" end="00:39:37.839" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.760" end="00:39:39.440" style="s2">uh there was a college in the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.839" end="00:39:41.520" style="s2">the corn fields of iowa in this little</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.440" end="00:39:43.599" style="s2">town called parsons college been like an</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.520" end="00:39:47.280" style="s2">old beautiful kind of victorian campus</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.599" end="00:39:48.720" style="s2">and uh there was this kind of vedic</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.280" end="00:39:50.160" style="s2">hindu teacher who wanted to bring</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.720" end="00:39:52.960" style="s2">meditation over to the west and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.160" end="00:39:55.760" style="s2">actually have it be the basis of a whole</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.960" end="00:39:56.000" style="s2">educational system and they were looking</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.760" end="00:39:58.240" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.000" end="00:39:59.920" style="s2">university and they got this good deal</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.240" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">on parsons college so you end up getting</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.920" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">this like</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.560" end="00:40:07.520" style="s2">university of higher education largely</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.599" end="00:40:10.079" style="s2">based on eastern thought in the middle</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.520" end="00:40:13.200" style="s2">of the corn and pig fields of iowa</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.079" end="00:40:15.200" style="s2">and so so you&#39;ve got like a</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.200" end="00:40:17.040" style="s2">you know basically an intersection</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.200" end="00:40:18.240" style="s2">between physics consciousness studies</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.040" end="00:40:21.200" style="s2">and a hindu temple</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.240" end="00:40:23.280" style="s2">and then you know a bunch of farmers and</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.200" end="00:40:28.720" style="s2">it was very easy</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.280" end="00:40:30.720" style="s2">to feel a certain sense of like</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.720" end="00:40:32.240" style="s2">the better understanding and eliteness</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.720" end="00:40:33.119" style="s2">of the people in the university</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.240" end="00:40:36.960" style="s2">environment</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.119" end="00:40:40.240" style="s2">and see the corn farmers as some</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.960" end="00:40:41.520" style="s2">simpletons but it was only easy to do</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.240" end="00:40:42.480" style="s2">that if you didn&#39;t interact with them</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.520" end="00:40:43.839" style="s2">deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:42.480" end="00:40:45.760" style="s2">but then you interact with them deeply</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.839" end="00:40:47.680" style="s2">and you find out that they actually</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.760" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">spend a lot more time on the earth and</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.680" end="00:40:50.240" style="s2">under the sky and connecting to the</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:51.200" style="s2">plants</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.240" end="00:40:53.119" style="s2">than the people who are in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.200" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">university do and that there&#39;s a certain</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.119" end="00:40:56.319" style="s2">kind of connectedness to nature and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:59.119" style="s2">wisdom and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.319" end="00:41:00.960" style="s2">reliability and integrity that they have</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.119" end="00:41:02.160" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.960" end="00:41:04.400" style="s2">that the people in the other place</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.160" end="00:41:08.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t didn&#39;t have the same way</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.400" end="00:41:10.960" style="s2">and so i think if the proto-b is</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.640" end="00:41:14.240" style="s2">connecting with people outside deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.960" end="00:41:16.720" style="s2">enough to actually stay connected to the</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.240" end="00:41:17.440" style="s2">the humanness of them so it doesn&#39;t go</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.720" end="00:41:20.480" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.440" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">kind of um separatist</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.480" end="00:41:24.960" style="s2">superiority that&#39;s one helpful thing</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.400" end="00:41:33.599" style="s2">all right um man i don&#39;t know a question</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.839" end="00:41:37.280" style="s2">to choose</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.599" end="00:41:40.400" style="s2">david sweadlow uh if you can</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.280" end="00:41:41.680" style="s2">find yourself yeah thanks um i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:41:40.400" end="00:41:44.000" style="s2">what you&#39;re learning</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.680" end="00:41:44.800" style="s2">um from your entitlement inquiry on</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.000" end="00:41:47.599" style="s2">facebook</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.800" end="00:41:49.040" style="s2">um we had we had a glassbeat game last</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.599" end="00:41:51.040" style="s2">week and it came up and there was a</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.040" end="00:41:52.560" style="s2">really robust discussion but i&#39;m curious</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.040" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">what you&#39;re taking from the</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.560" end="00:41:56.319" style="s2">comments there or your thoughts on that</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:02.160" style="s2">uh premature i just posted that i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.040" end="00:42:04.160" style="s2">two days ago and</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.160" end="00:42:05.440" style="s2">have only had a chance to read about</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.160" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">half the comments and not</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.440" end="00:42:09.599" style="s2">really sit with and reflect on them i</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:12.400" style="s2">was i was actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.599" end="00:42:13.599" style="s2">positively surprised that there were a</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.400" end="00:42:15.599" style="s2">lot of quite</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.599" end="00:42:18.079" style="s2">insightful thoughtful things from</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.599" end="00:42:21.920" style="s2">different perspectives being shared</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.079" end="00:42:23.680" style="s2">it was actually a higher quality</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.920" end="00:42:25.440" style="s2">collective intelligence input for a</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.680" end="00:42:26.800" style="s2">facebook thread than i</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.440" end="00:42:28.560" style="s2">have experienced on a lot of other</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.800" end="00:42:30.160" style="s2">questions i put out there</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.560" end="00:42:33.839" style="s2">and so i&#39;m kind of curious as to why</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.160" end="00:42:35.440" style="s2">that is why that question in particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.839" end="00:42:37.680" style="s2">posted a question of what do you feel</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.440" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">entitled to and why</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.680" end="00:42:44.319" style="s2">uh and so of course people got into the</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:46.400" style="s2">semantics of what does entitlements mean</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.319" end="00:42:47.359" style="s2">are we saying entitled by law because we</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.400" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">all agreed</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.359" end="00:42:53.359" style="s2">in law or entitled by um a cultural set</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.079" style="s2">of norms or entitled by universe in some</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.359" end="00:42:57.119" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.079" end="00:43:00.240" style="s2">absolute sense or um</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.119" end="00:43:03.280" style="s2">and it is entitled as a court of law</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.240" end="00:43:06.240" style="s2">would support versus feel entitled</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.280" end="00:43:08.560" style="s2">um and then there&#39;s a big difference</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.240" end="00:43:10.240" style="s2">between i am entitled to this versus i</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.560" end="00:43:12.160" style="s2">value this and would work hard to</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.240" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">protect it but don&#39;t assume</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.160" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">that it is just a given um i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:19.040" style="s2">one of the things that a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.640" style="s2">surface it was valuable is</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.040" end="00:43:22.800" style="s2">there are human rights that i really</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.640" end="00:43:24.240" style="s2">appreciate there&#39;s rule of law that i</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.800" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">appreciate but if i</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.240" end="00:43:27.440" style="s2">feel entitled to it and everybody feels</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:29.200" style="s2">entitled to it nobody takes the</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.440" end="00:43:30.160" style="s2">responsibility to maintain it then it</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.200" end="00:43:32.640" style="s2">will break down</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.160" end="00:43:33.599" style="s2">turn into you know tyranny so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.640" end="00:43:35.359" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.599" end="00:43:37.200" style="s2">critical to value it and not feel</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.359" end="00:43:38.839" style="s2">entitled to continue to do the work and</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.200" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">maintenance</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.839" end="00:43:41.839" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.000" end="00:43:45.839" style="s2">and so saying i don&#39;t feel entitled</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.760" end="00:43:46.160" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean a kind of nihilism of that</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.839" end="00:43:47.920" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.160" end="00:43:49.839" style="s2">that we don&#39;t want a society that does a</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.920" end="00:43:51.839" style="s2">better job of rights it means</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.839" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">that we have to bind the responsibility</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.839" end="00:43:55.359" style="s2">to do the work to ensure that thing</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.880" end="00:44:05.920" style="s2">one of the things that i noticed is i</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.119" end="00:44:08.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t ask the question</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.920" end="00:44:10.240" style="s2">what does your behavior demonstrate that</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.640" end="00:44:12.000" style="s2">you feel entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.240" end="00:44:13.680" style="s2">in your day-to-day interactions that you</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.000" end="00:44:16.880" style="s2">aren&#39;t admitting</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.680" end="00:44:18.000" style="s2">like if you thought more about it</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.880" end="00:44:19.680" style="s2">because a lot of people took it to the</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.000" end="00:44:21.280" style="s2">macro level of what do i feel entitled</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.680" end="00:44:23.839" style="s2">to by the state or by</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.280" end="00:44:25.200" style="s2">the market or by law or you know by god</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.839" end="00:44:27.200" style="s2">or something like that</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.200" end="00:44:28.880" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting how often we just</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.200" end="00:44:30.400" style="s2">get pissed off at someone else because</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.880" end="00:44:32.000" style="s2">they didn&#39;t do the dishes or whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.400" end="00:44:33.680" style="s2">was or they didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.000" end="00:44:35.839" style="s2">you know tell me the thing or</p>
<p begin="00:44:33.680" end="00:44:37.200" style="s2">acknowledge me or and it&#39;s very clear i</p>
<p begin="00:44:35.839" end="00:44:39.680" style="s2">felt entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.200" end="00:44:42.240" style="s2">like i i felt that they were supposed to</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.680" end="00:44:46.079" style="s2">do that thing and i got disappointed and</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.240" end="00:44:47.599" style="s2">upset when they didn&#39;t and so</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.079" end="00:44:49.520" style="s2">it was very interesting to see how many</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.599" end="00:44:50.640" style="s2">people said i don&#39;t feel entitled to</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.520" end="00:44:52.560" style="s2">anything which means when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.640" end="00:44:54.000" style="s2">cognitively reflecting they acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:44:52.560" end="00:44:56.720" style="s2">that that is the like</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.000" end="00:44:58.079" style="s2">formally true thing but then to take the</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.720" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">next step of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.079" end="00:45:00.720" style="s2">but where are all the places where that</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:01.440" style="s2">actually is in your experience and what</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.720" end="00:45:04.880" style="s2">do you do</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.440" end="00:45:06.319" style="s2">about that differential so those</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.880" end="00:45:08.000" style="s2">first few insights but i&#39;m actually</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.319" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">looking forward to having some more time</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.000" end="00:45:10.319" style="s2">with it</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.280" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">all right uh kelly you are up</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.400" end="00:45:19.839" style="s2">hi uh can you hear me okay</p>
<p begin="00:45:19.920" end="00:45:25.119" style="s2">so thanks uh first i want to thank you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.640" end="00:45:26.880" style="s2">daniel and contextualize this</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.119" end="00:45:28.720" style="s2">through one of your past appearances</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.880" end="00:45:30.839" style="s2">here where someone asked you about</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.720" end="00:45:32.079" style="s2">something you connected with right</p>
<p begin="00:45:30.839" end="00:45:34.720" style="s2">livelihood</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.079" end="00:45:36.400" style="s2">and you basically propose that we can</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.720" end="00:45:37.440" style="s2">think of livelihood outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.400" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.440" end="00:45:44.000" style="s2">of income and what it is that is</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:44.960" style="s2">mean what matters to us and then pursue</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.000" end="00:45:46.480" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.960" end="00:45:48.240" style="s2">so that kind of like unlocked me to</p>
<p begin="00:45:46.480" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">think about what matters to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:48.240" end="00:45:54.960" style="s2">and i found a thing that matters to me</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.920" end="00:45:57.119" style="s2">and i&#39;ve been beginning to work on it</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.960" end="00:45:59.359" style="s2">for me that thing is homelessness and</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.119" end="00:46:03.359" style="s2">i&#39;m working on contextualizing it</p>
<p begin="00:45:59.359" end="00:46:06.400" style="s2">i&#39;m aware my work is like pointing out</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.359" end="00:46:06.960" style="s2">what we here probably all know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.400" end="00:46:11.040" style="s2">rooted</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.960" end="00:46:14.160" style="s2">in these systemic issues systematic</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.040" end="00:46:15.040" style="s2">issues like the game a world right so</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.160" end="00:46:16.400" style="s2">all my work</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.040" end="00:46:18.640" style="s2">in trying to conceptualize it i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.400" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">getting stuck because i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.640" end="00:46:25.680" style="s2">i can&#39;t see the new vision the new story</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:27.440" style="s2">of homelessness so my question for you</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.680" end="00:46:28.960" style="s2">is what do we do when we know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.440" end="00:46:31.520" style="s2">matters to us</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.960" end="00:46:33.760" style="s2">and we understand why it matters and</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.520" end="00:46:35.599" style="s2">like what the barriers are</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.760" end="00:46:37.280" style="s2">but we&#39;re in need of frame breaking in</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.599" end="00:46:39.839" style="s2">order to unlock</p>
<p begin="00:46:37.280" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">this the new problem space so to speak</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.839" end="00:46:43.839" style="s2">if that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.160" end="00:46:49.920" style="s2">one thing i try to do is to see if</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.920" end="00:46:51.520" style="s2">anyone has actually</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.920" end="00:46:53.200" style="s2">figured key parts of it out that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.520" end="00:46:55.280" style="s2">just not aware of</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.200" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">um i like to know where the boundary of</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.280" end="00:46:57.920" style="s2">the best thought is because i</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:46:59.359" style="s2">acknowledge that there&#39;s a lot of smart</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.920" end="00:47:01.440" style="s2">people that have spent a lot of time</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.359" end="00:47:03.599" style="s2">on a lot of these things and it might</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.440" end="00:47:07.359" style="s2">not be like common knowledge but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.599" end="00:47:08.079" style="s2">knowledge um then if nobody has worked</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.359" end="00:47:10.160" style="s2">on something</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.079" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">knowing that is really valuable and then</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.160" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">i say okay well what is the process for</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:15.680" style="s2">to get other thoughtful people and kind</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:17.040" style="s2">of work on this thing together and</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.680" end="00:47:19.839" style="s2">figure it out</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.040" end="00:47:20.480" style="s2">but uh as far as homelessness goes like</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.839" end="00:47:22.160" style="s2">i think the</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.480" end="00:47:23.599" style="s2">the first process that comes to mind for</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.160" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">me is i would</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.599" end="00:47:27.119" style="s2">i would look at</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:31.599" style="s2">examples of places that don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.920" end="00:47:33.280" style="s2">homelessness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.599" end="00:47:35.440" style="s2">what they did right i would do a</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.280" end="00:47:37.359" style="s2">positive deviant analysis</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.440" end="00:47:38.800" style="s2">positive deviant on any problem is where</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.359" end="00:47:40.160" style="s2">you have a distribution and you look for</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.800" end="00:47:41.760" style="s2">who&#39;s doing best with that thing to</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.160" end="00:47:43.280" style="s2">understand the mechanics in common of</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.760" end="00:47:44.720" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.280" end="00:47:46.480" style="s2">i would look for any places that have</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.720" end="00:47:47.040" style="s2">had relatively good homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.480" end="00:47:49.520" style="s2">solutions</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.040" end="00:47:51.119" style="s2">they had homelessness and now they have</p>
<p begin="00:47:49.520" end="00:47:53.920" style="s2">much less or much less</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.119" end="00:47:57.280" style="s2">you know consequential homelessness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.920" end="00:48:01.040" style="s2">see what interventions have worked well</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.280" end="00:48:04.960" style="s2">and then similarly what are the projects</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.040" end="00:48:06.559" style="s2">that are in process that seem best</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.960" end="00:48:10.880" style="s2">informed</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.559" end="00:48:11.520" style="s2">uh so you know i know of a few on this</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.880" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">topic</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.520" end="00:48:15.839" style="s2">mimi silbert and the delancey street</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.760" end="00:48:19.040" style="s2">foundation did really good work</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.839" end="00:48:24.160" style="s2">on um reform</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.040" end="00:48:26.400" style="s2">of uh drug-addicted violent felons</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.160" end="00:48:27.680" style="s2">um usually multi-generation drug</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.400" end="00:48:29.520" style="s2">addicted violent felons so they were</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.680" end="00:48:31.599" style="s2">born into gang families or whatever</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.520" end="00:48:33.520" style="s2">and getting them to be able to hold a</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.599" end="00:48:35.040" style="s2">job and hold a home and stay out of</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.520" end="00:48:38.640" style="s2">prison so it was homelessness but</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.040" end="00:48:39.839" style="s2">a deeper set of things and they</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.640" end="00:48:43.040" style="s2">ended up figuring out some things that</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.839" end="00:48:47.280" style="s2">worked really quite well and lastingly</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.040" end="00:48:48.480" style="s2">um i have a friend named nelson del rio</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.280" end="00:48:50.960" style="s2">that i think has one of the best</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.480" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">homelessness solutions that i&#39;m aware of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.960" end="00:48:55.680" style="s2">that uses mostly market solutions</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.160" end="00:49:00.000" style="s2">where he can make affordable places</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.160" end="00:49:01.520" style="s2">where people pay rent that are is</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.000" end="00:49:02.000" style="s2">actually rent that is going towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.520" end="00:49:04.559" style="s2">ownership</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.000" end="00:49:05.440" style="s2">and a co-op model that is goes along</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.559" end="00:49:07.599" style="s2">with teaching</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.440" end="00:49:10.000" style="s2">people financial literacy and job</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.599" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">literacy and those types of things so</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.000" end="00:49:14.079" style="s2">the homeless people go from homeless to</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:16.079" style="s2">having a place to be to eventually</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.079" end="00:49:17.839" style="s2">gainfully employed homeowners and the</p>
<p begin="00:49:16.079" end="00:49:18.880" style="s2">kind of responsibility of ownership that</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.839" end="00:49:22.000" style="s2">comes</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.880" end="00:49:23.920" style="s2">um and he put together a financial model</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.000" end="00:49:25.760" style="s2">for a real estate play that makes that</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.920" end="00:49:27.280" style="s2">possible i think that&#39;s probably one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.760" end="00:49:30.319" style="s2">the most promising things</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.280" end="00:49:32.319" style="s2">um there&#39;s obviously the like make tiny</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.319" end="00:49:33.920" style="s2">homes and put them somewhere and put the</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.319" end="00:49:35.200" style="s2">people in them and it&#39;s cheaper than</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.920" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">what it costs to keep putting them in</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.200" end="00:49:37.520" style="s2">jail</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:42.000" style="s2">and having them not on the street not in</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.920" end="00:49:43.680" style="s2">jail is probably better but if it</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.000" end="00:49:45.760" style="s2">doesn&#39;t offer some</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.680" end="00:49:47.440" style="s2">like developmental direction where they</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.760" end="00:49:51.119" style="s2">become more self-authoring</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.440" end="00:49:52.880" style="s2">that&#39;s still pretty limited and uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.119" end="00:49:54.640" style="s2">so the direction where people are not</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.880" end="00:49:56.839" style="s2">just living on a handout or not just</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.640" end="00:50:00.240" style="s2">renting but moving towards</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.839" end="00:50:02.800" style="s2">uh a sense of something like ownership</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.240" end="00:50:04.319" style="s2">um with as long as we&#39;re within a frame</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.800" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">like capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.319" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">uh is quite helpful</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.040" end="00:50:14.880" style="s2">uh kelly looks like you have to follow</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.880" end="00:50:17.200" style="s2">up if you want to jump in</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.880" end="00:50:18.400" style="s2">well i so that&#39;s i really appreciate</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.200" end="00:50:20.880" style="s2">everything you said</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.400" end="00:50:21.920" style="s2">and it makes me reconsider if i was like</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.880" end="00:50:25.119" style="s2">thinking too big</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.920" end="00:50:26.640" style="s2">but maybe i want to press you and and</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.119" end="00:50:28.640" style="s2">my thinking is that all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.640" end="00:50:30.960" style="s2">you described</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.640" end="00:50:33.280" style="s2">similar to like all the like silly sort</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.960" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">of toy ideas i thought of</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.280" end="00:50:37.119" style="s2">are still kind of framed in</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.200" end="00:50:40.800" style="s2">working which i guess we have to work</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.559" end="00:50:43.040" style="s2">within the systems that exist so but</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.800" end="00:50:44.960" style="s2">i&#39;m more like curious and maybe it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.040" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">just an impossibility like</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.960" end="00:50:48.480" style="s2">to how do you like i want to think of</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:51.440" style="s2">like or like work with other people</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.480" end="00:50:53.520" style="s2">to discover like a new vision or like</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.440" end="00:50:55.280" style="s2">rediscover an old vision</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.520" end="00:50:56.880" style="s2">like how do we like to me when i see</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.280" end="00:50:59.119" style="s2">homeless people</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.880" end="00:51:00.640" style="s2">i recognize that they are like trapped</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.119" end="00:51:02.480" style="s2">in a space</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.640" end="00:51:05.359" style="s2">and i feel a certain way towards them</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.480" end="00:51:07.520" style="s2">that i know like other people don&#39;t feel</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.359" end="00:51:09.119" style="s2">so i want to figure out a way where</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.520" end="00:51:10.640" style="s2">people we don&#39;t have to try to do</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.119" end="00:51:12.400" style="s2">anything</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.640" end="00:51:14.240" style="s2">to make it so that like homeless isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.400" end="00:51:15.200" style="s2">problem but so that people have a new</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.240" end="00:51:16.480" style="s2">sense of what</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.200" end="00:51:17.920" style="s2">you know what i don&#39;t know i might be</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.480" end="00:51:18.880" style="s2">thinking too big and maybe i just need</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.920" end="00:51:22.559" style="s2">to start</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.880" end="00:51:24.079" style="s2">in a more practical way say again</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.559" end="00:51:26.480" style="s2">you were starting to say that you you</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.079" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">want people to have a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.480" end="00:51:32.000" style="s2">so oh i like i i think the like ideal</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:36.319" style="s2">solution</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.000" end="00:51:38.000" style="s2">is that people have a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:51:36.319" end="00:51:39.359" style="s2">or maybe i&#39;m just trying to reconnect</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.000" end="00:51:40.720" style="s2">the dots but the thought i was going</p>
<p begin="00:51:39.359" end="00:51:44.640" style="s2">with was</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.720" end="00:51:47.839" style="s2">like if you have to create a program</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.640" end="00:51:49.680" style="s2">to remediate homelessness then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.839" end="00:51:52.880" style="s2">not re-envisioning homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.680" end="00:51:53.760" style="s2">you know if if homelessness if the way</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.880" end="00:51:56.240" style="s2">that we envision</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.760" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">the thing like the this the contributors</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.240" end="00:52:00.160" style="s2">to homelessness</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:02.160" style="s2">were truly changed then you wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.160" end="00:52:03.520" style="s2">have to try</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.160" end="00:52:04.880" style="s2">which i think so the point that you made</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.520" end="00:52:06.160" style="s2">about looking where homelessness isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.880" end="00:52:08.559" style="s2">problem i think that&#39;s actually a really</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.160" end="00:52:09.760" style="s2">good idea i didn&#39;t think of but um</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.559" end="00:52:11.839" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that gives you anything</p>
<p begin="00:52:09.760" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">more to think about or if i&#39;m again like</p>
<p begin="00:52:11.839" end="00:52:14.720" style="s2">kind of pushing too hard</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.960" end="00:52:18.000" style="s2">yeah so i mean if you want practical</p>
<p begin="00:52:17.520" end="00:52:19.440" style="s2">examples</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.000" end="00:52:20.880" style="s2">you look at place where places where</p>
<p begin="00:52:19.440" end="00:52:22.559" style="s2">there isn&#39;t much homelessness or where</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.880" end="00:52:24.319" style="s2">they&#39;ve solved homelessness problems</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.559" end="00:52:26.240" style="s2">and you see what they did because then</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.319" end="00:52:27.839" style="s2">you know it actually works maybe that</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.240" end="00:52:29.040" style="s2">maybe their situation doesn&#39;t work for</p>
<p begin="00:52:27.839" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">all other situations but</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.040" end="00:52:32.480" style="s2">at least in some context works then you</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.160" style="s2">need to make sure you understand the</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.480" end="00:52:35.520" style="s2">context well enough</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.160" end="00:52:36.960" style="s2">was it a country that has a big</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.520" end="00:52:38.480" style="s2">sovereign wealth fund that was able to</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.960" end="00:52:40.319" style="s2">afford it and other countries couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:52:38.480" end="00:52:42.079" style="s2">or was it a small country that had a</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.319" end="00:52:43.680" style="s2">very strong religious homogeneous</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.079" end="00:52:45.839" style="s2">culture that had a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.680" end="00:52:46.880" style="s2">you know charity like because if you try</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.839" end="00:52:49.280" style="s2">to apply something</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.880" end="00:52:50.559" style="s2">that was unique to a context outside of</p>
<p begin="00:52:49.280" end="00:52:51.200" style="s2">that context you might be missing</p>
<p begin="00:52:50.559" end="00:52:53.119" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.200" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">but you can at least start to see some</p>
<p begin="00:52:53.119" end="00:52:57.839" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:59.440" style="s2">there are other ways to reimagine</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.839" end="00:53:01.359" style="s2">homelessness so you can</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.440" end="00:53:02.960" style="s2">there are some future oriented projects</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.359" end="00:53:05.200" style="s2">that don&#39;t assume capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.960" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">or don&#39;t assume you know private</p>
<p begin="00:53:05.200" end="00:53:07.920" style="s2">property ownership of homes or something</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:09.359" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:53:07.920" end="00:53:11.920" style="s2">they&#39;d have thought about re-envisioning</p>
<p begin="00:53:09.359" end="00:53:15.280" style="s2">homelessness like the venus project</p>
<p begin="00:53:11.920" end="00:53:15.599" style="s2">um jacques fresco of the venus project</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.280" end="00:53:17.200" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:53:15.599" end="00:53:19.040" style="s2">actually very influential for me early</p>
<p begin="00:53:17.200" end="00:53:22.559" style="s2">on um</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.040" end="00:53:25.040" style="s2">and you know he&#39;s passed now but</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.559" end="00:53:26.319" style="s2">uh the venus project continues and peter</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.040" end="00:53:30.400" style="s2">joseph is extending</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.319" end="00:53:33.440" style="s2">some of that work and so they</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.400" end="00:53:37.040" style="s2">propose a kind of commons-based</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.440" end="00:53:38.480" style="s2">cybernetic society in which most</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.040" end="00:53:41.520" style="s2">property is not based on private</p>
<p begin="00:53:38.480" end="00:53:43.680" style="s2">property ownership but generative access</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.520" end="00:53:45.119" style="s2">and so you can look at something like</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.680" end="00:53:47.440" style="s2">that from the point of view of like</p>
<p begin="00:53:45.119" end="00:53:49.680" style="s2">reimagining at a whole global</p>
<p begin="00:53:47.440" end="00:53:51.280" style="s2">level though of course there&#39;s a couple</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.680" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">questions you have to ask one is it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.280" end="00:53:53.520" style="s2">never been</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:55.359" style="s2">implemented and you have no idea if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.520" end="00:53:58.000" style="s2">actually going to work</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.359" end="00:53:59.440" style="s2">and two you have to ask in order to get</p>
<p begin="00:53:58.000" end="00:54:00.319" style="s2">it implemented and to have it work what</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.440" end="00:54:02.480" style="s2">does it take</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.319" end="00:54:03.440" style="s2">and one of you know peter thiel&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.480" end="00:54:04.800" style="s2">question of</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.440" end="00:54:06.240" style="s2">you have an idea that you think is</p>
<p begin="00:54:04.800" end="00:54:07.839" style="s2">better there&#39;s some people who really</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.240" end="00:54:09.760" style="s2">don&#39;t like that idea what level of</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.839" end="00:54:10.000" style="s2">violence do you need to employ to get</p>
<p begin="00:54:09.760" end="00:54:11.839" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.000" end="00:54:13.440" style="s2">idea put in place and is it still a good</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.839" end="00:54:15.040" style="s2">idea factoring the amount of violence it</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.440" end="00:54:16.160" style="s2">takes to make happen factoring counter</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.040" end="00:54:18.400" style="s2">pressures</p>
<p begin="00:54:16.160" end="00:54:19.200" style="s2">which is kind of a classic libertarian</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.400" end="00:54:22.240" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.200" end="00:54:25.599" style="s2">right which is since i&#39;m not god or</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.240" end="00:54:27.839" style="s2">king and get to just decree it be so</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.599" end="00:54:29.119" style="s2">the kind of omniscient question of what</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.839" end="00:54:30.480" style="s2">can&#39;t we all just get along what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.119" end="00:54:31.680" style="s2">best way that we could just make it all</p>

<p begin="00:54:31.680" end="00:54:37.200" style="s2">okay there&#39;s a pretty big gap</p>

<p begin="00:54:50.799" end="00:54:54.240" style="s2">and the world can&#39;t be okay until it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:55:06.000" end="00:55:10.480" style="s2">move this thing forward so it&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.160" end="00:55:13.280" style="s2">to imagine what it could be</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.480" end="00:55:15.040" style="s2">but then the path there ends up being</p>

<p begin="00:55:18.240" end="00:55:21.760" style="s2">meaningful so this is why i have much</p>
<p begin="00:55:20.319" end="00:55:24.000" style="s2">more appreciation for the things like</p>

<p begin="00:55:29.359" end="00:55:32.559" style="s2">and actually put them on a path towards</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.440" end="00:55:35.119" style="s2">more self-authorship</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.559" end="00:55:36.880" style="s2">in the current world effectively without</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.119" end="00:55:39.200" style="s2">needing violence</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.880" end="00:55:40.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m like oh that&#39;s actually quite</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.200" end="00:55:44.559" style="s2">meaningful is it</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.720" end="00:55:46.640" style="s2">and and can it continue to advance</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.559" end="00:55:48.319" style="s2">itself can it develop capacities that</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.640" end="00:55:49.599" style="s2">can be reinvested to develop more</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.319" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">capacities</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.599" end="00:55:53.359" style="s2">so that it eventually converges</p>
<p begin="00:55:55.920" end="00:55:58.799" style="s2">as far as other things where you can</p>
<p begin="00:55:57.280" end="00:56:00.079" style="s2">think about reimagining homelessness you</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.799" end="00:56:03.440" style="s2">can go backwards</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.079" end="00:56:06.480" style="s2">and look at indigenous cultures where</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.440" end="00:56:08.400" style="s2">there&#39;s some sense okay nobody there was</p>
<p begin="00:56:06.480" end="00:56:11.520" style="s2">homeless they were all kind of</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.400" end="00:56:14.839" style="s2">communally cared for but then you can</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.520" end="00:56:16.400" style="s2">then you have to ask why did that thing</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.839" end="00:56:18.799" style="s2">stop</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.400" end="00:56:20.480" style="s2">and is that commensurate with the ideas</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.799" end="00:56:23.760" style="s2">of classical liberalism</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.480" end="00:56:24.720" style="s2">um and kind of nation liberal nation</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.760" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">states</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.720" end="00:56:28.160" style="s2">which it&#39;s obviously not and so then you</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:30.799" style="s2">say well from</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.160" end="00:56:32.079" style="s2">the nation-state liberalism capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.799" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">point of view where people</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.079" end="00:56:36.240" style="s2">are wanting where there&#39;s a system</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:38.480" style="s2">that&#39;s wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.240" end="00:56:40.400" style="s2">at least in theory maximize individual</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.480" end="00:56:42.079" style="s2">independence and sovereignty and not be</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.400" end="00:56:43.280" style="s2">controlled by some top-down state that</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.079" end="00:56:47.040" style="s2">we don&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:56:43.280" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">or some top-down organization then</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.040" end="00:56:50.880" style="s2">that also means people can [ __ ] their</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:51.440" style="s2">lives up and what responsibility do they</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.880" end="00:56:53.040" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.440" end="00:56:55.040" style="s2">for themselves and how do you solve the</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.040" end="00:56:58.240" style="s2">free writer problem of if the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.040" end="00:57:00.640" style="s2">if some other group is then</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.240" end="00:57:02.480" style="s2">obligated to wealth redistribute how are</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.640" end="00:57:04.079" style="s2">they obligated is there some</p>

<p begin="00:57:06.079" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">so these are</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.599" end="00:57:14.160" style="s2">these are tricky problems a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.280" end="00:57:15.599" style="s2">people have thought about these things</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.160" end="00:57:17.440" style="s2">maybe you will come up with some very</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.599" end="00:57:19.440" style="s2">meaningful breakthroughs that nobody has</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.440" end="00:57:22.319" style="s2">and i would say if you&#39;re willing to</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.440" end="00:57:24.960" style="s2">dedicate some</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.319" end="00:57:26.240" style="s2">real earnestness to it you probably can</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.960" end="00:57:28.880" style="s2">and enough people have done</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.240" end="00:57:29.760" style="s2">enough good thinking it&#39;s probably worth</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.880" end="00:57:32.799" style="s2">understanding</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.760" end="00:57:33.839" style="s2">both the success examples and the</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.799" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">problem space</p>
<p begin="00:57:33.839" end="00:57:36.319" style="s2">pretty well</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.680" end="00:57:42.000" style="s2">and then there&#39;s that saying the master</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.200" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">has failed more times than the</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.000" end="00:57:45.200" style="s2">average person has tried</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.920" end="00:57:49.040" style="s2">for you to make real innovation in the</p>

<p begin="00:57:49.040" end="00:57:53.520" style="s2">will require not getting disheartened</p>
<p begin="00:57:52.000" end="00:57:55.520" style="s2">when it&#39;s really when</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.520" end="00:57:58.079" style="s2">almost all of your answers are wrong for</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.520" end="00:57:58.079" style="s2">a long time</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.200" end="00:58:05.359" style="s2">all right uh christian you just popped</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.920" end="00:58:08.480" style="s2">in a question that&#39;s interesting if you</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.359" end="00:58:11.520" style="s2">can unmute yourself</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.480" end="00:58:14.880" style="s2">yeah sure daniel</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.520" end="00:58:16.559" style="s2">my question is what are the aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.880" end="00:58:18.079" style="s2">personal development and personal</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.559" end="00:58:19.599" style="s2">practice that you&#39;ve been thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.079" end="00:58:23.440" style="s2">the most lately</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.599" end="00:58:25.440" style="s2">um also where do you think</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.440" end="00:58:26.480" style="s2">in terms of personal practice and</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.440" end="00:58:28.640" style="s2">development</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.480" end="00:58:29.920" style="s2">we need to pay generally speaking the</p>
<p begin="00:58:28.640" end="00:58:31.440" style="s2">most attention to like where are we</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.920" end="00:58:34.319" style="s2">lacking the most</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.440" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">and what&#39;s getting um looked past and</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.319" end="00:58:36.960" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.000" style="s2">what are any like recent developments</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.960" end="00:58:40.400" style="s2">you&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.000" end="00:58:42.319" style="s2">uh in these areas like maybe in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.400" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">new psycho technologies that are popping</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.319" end="00:58:44.640" style="s2">up</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">that would be useful for people to</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.640" end="00:58:47.040" style="s2">explore</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.839" end="00:58:51.839" style="s2">thanks</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.000" end="00:59:05.520" style="s2">i really like the bildung concept</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.599" end="00:59:07.119" style="s2">that thomas bjorkman has been talking</p>
<p begin="00:59:05.520" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">about peter v</p>
<p begin="00:59:07.119" end="00:59:11.520" style="s2">thomason good</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.079" end="00:59:20.319" style="s2">because it transcends the</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.359" end="00:59:22.079" style="s2">agency communion or individual and</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.319" end="00:59:23.040" style="s2">collective divide which is how do i</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.079" end="00:59:26.640" style="s2">develop myself</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.040" end="00:59:28.160" style="s2">as an individual in service to bettering</p>
<p begin="00:59:26.640" end="00:59:31.040" style="s2">not just my life as an individual but</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.160" end="00:59:35.200" style="s2">the collective um</p>
<p begin="00:59:31.040" end="00:59:37.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s personal development of</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.200" end="00:59:38.640" style="s2">effective citizens not just effective</p>
<p begin="00:59:37.599" end="00:59:42.240" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.640" end="00:59:44.240" style="s2">uh i think those ideas are very often</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.240" end="00:59:45.599" style="s2">decoupled where there&#39;s personal</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.240" end="00:59:48.240" style="s2">development for</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.599" end="00:59:49.760" style="s2">like most people&#39;s vision boards when</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.240" end="00:59:53.040" style="s2">they&#39;re doing personal development</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.760" end="00:59:56.160" style="s2">is like a dope life for them um</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.040" end="00:59:57.920" style="s2">and pretty individualistic and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.160" end="00:59:59.359" style="s2">doing good to the degree that that makes</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.920" end="01:00:00.480" style="s2">them feel good and it&#39;s a dope life for</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.359" end="01:00:05.520" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:00:00.480" end="01:00:07.040" style="s2">um or someone is willing to</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.520" end="01:00:09.280" style="s2">work for the collective at great</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.040" end="01:00:11.359" style="s2">sacrifice so they&#39;ll go be a soldier</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.280" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">or they&#39;ll be a frontline non-profit</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.359" end="01:00:16.319" style="s2">activist worker whatever but they</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.280" end="01:00:21.680" style="s2">are developing themselves to a limited</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.200" end="01:00:23.680" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.680" end="01:00:25.680" style="s2">to start to use themselves and not</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.680" end="01:00:28.960" style="s2">continuing to develop themselves to be</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.680" end="01:00:31.680" style="s2">in greater and greater service</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.960" end="01:00:32.319" style="s2">so the idea of an ongoing development of</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.680" end="01:00:36.079" style="s2">self</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.319" end="01:00:39.520" style="s2">to be ongoingly useful to all</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.079" end="01:00:42.000" style="s2">other selves uh i think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.520" end="01:00:43.839" style="s2">important that those two are bound</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.000" end="01:00:45.040" style="s2">so that&#39;s one thing i would say and so i</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.839" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">i really like the</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.040" end="01:00:49.200" style="s2">the build-on kind of model for that</p>
<p begin="01:00:50.480" end="01:00:54.319" style="s2">and then with regard to specific</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.839" end="01:01:00.000" style="s2">psychotechnologies</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:02.400" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s kind of categorize them</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.000" end="01:01:06.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve got things like cbt</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.400" end="01:01:08.240" style="s2">and the lefco method</p>
<p begin="01:01:06.160" end="01:01:10.000" style="s2">and byron katie&#39;s the work and basically</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.240" end="01:01:13.119" style="s2">cognitive models</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.000" end="01:01:15.280" style="s2">where you&#39;re doing you&#39;re looking at</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.119" end="01:01:17.040" style="s2">experiences that have you create a</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.280" end="01:01:19.359" style="s2">generalized belief or meaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:17.040" end="01:01:20.720" style="s2">structure and then working on seeing the</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.359" end="01:01:22.720" style="s2">effect of that belief or meaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.720" end="01:01:24.319" style="s2">structure overlaid on other environments</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.720" end="01:01:25.520" style="s2">has it&#39;s not effective in working on</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.319" end="01:01:27.599" style="s2">changing that belief or meaning</p>
<p begin="01:01:25.520" end="01:01:31.520" style="s2">structure</p>
<p begin="01:01:27.599" end="01:01:35.839" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got uh</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.520" end="01:01:39.119" style="s2">emotional work like um</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.839" end="01:01:41.040" style="s2">gestalt and catharsis work and</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.119" end="01:01:42.640" style="s2">emotional release and primal screaming</p>
<p begin="01:01:41.040" end="01:01:44.640" style="s2">and things that are around</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.640" end="01:01:45.839" style="s2">where emotion was experienced and there</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.640" end="01:01:47.599" style="s2">was kind of physiologic</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.839" end="01:01:49.599" style="s2">sensation emotional sensation and it</p>
<p begin="01:01:47.599" end="01:01:50.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t get to move how do we actually</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.599" end="01:01:54.160" style="s2">allow it to</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.640" end="01:01:56.240" style="s2">move through us and out</p>
<p begin="01:01:54.160" end="01:01:58.160" style="s2">and then you&#39;ve got somatic work like is</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.240" end="01:01:58.640" style="s2">there a way that this is connected to my</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.160" end="01:02:01.680" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.640" end="01:02:02.799" style="s2">of the kind of embodied cognition the</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.680" end="01:02:04.559" style="s2">brain is not the only</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.799" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">part that has consciousness related to</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.559" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">it so you have</p>
<p begin="01:02:08.799" end="01:02:12.240" style="s2">trigger point work and heller work and</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.640" end="01:02:13.680" style="s2">somatic experiencing and all these</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.240" end="01:02:15.839" style="s2">things that are working on connecting to</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.680" end="01:02:19.039" style="s2">emotions in connection to the body and</p>
<p begin="01:02:15.839" end="01:02:22.640" style="s2">moving them or unwinding there</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.039" end="01:02:25.680" style="s2">then you have like sensory stuff like</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.640" end="01:02:26.640" style="s2">where someone is triggered whenever they</p>
<p begin="01:02:25.680" end="01:02:28.880" style="s2">hear a loud</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.640" end="01:02:30.079" style="s2">sound because the gunshot sound that</p>
<p begin="01:02:28.880" end="01:02:31.920" style="s2">happened in vietnam</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.079" end="01:02:33.520" style="s2">or they&#39;re bothered by yellow because</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.920" end="01:02:34.640" style="s2">that was the color of the</p>
<p begin="01:02:33.520" end="01:02:36.319" style="s2">room that they were beaten when they</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.640" end="01:02:37.440" style="s2">were a kid or whenever they see a man</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.319" end="01:02:38.960" style="s2">that looks like a certain thing that</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.440" end="01:02:41.200" style="s2">there were sensory</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.960" end="01:02:42.240" style="s2">images that were pavlovian associated</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.200" end="01:02:44.000" style="s2">with traumas</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.240" end="01:02:45.520" style="s2">and they want to change those sensory</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.000" end="01:02:46.480" style="s2">conditions that are the triggers and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.520" end="01:02:49.119" style="s2">you&#39;ll see things like</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.480" end="01:02:51.200" style="s2">nlp techniques that are designed to pull</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.119" end="01:02:53.920" style="s2">up sensory images</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.200" end="01:02:54.880" style="s2">and or some psychedelic assistant</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.920" end="01:02:57.839" style="s2">psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:02:54.880" end="01:03:01.119" style="s2">and change the pavlovian association</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.839" end="01:03:01.119" style="s2">with those sensory images</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.200" end="01:03:07.039" style="s2">i would say that those are not</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.240" end="01:03:08.079" style="s2">fungible the those all do different</p>
<p begin="01:03:07.039" end="01:03:09.599" style="s2">valuable things</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.079" end="01:03:11.119" style="s2">and they don&#39;t do the same valuable</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.599" end="01:03:14.559" style="s2">things</p>
<p begin="01:03:11.119" end="01:03:17.039" style="s2">and so</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.559" end="01:03:18.720" style="s2">i&#39;m i&#39;m as far as psycho technologies</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.039" end="01:03:20.400" style="s2">i&#39;m less interested in like here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.720" end="01:03:21.599" style="s2">favorite psychotechnology and more</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.400" end="01:03:23.200" style="s2">saying</p>
<p begin="01:03:21.599" end="01:03:25.359" style="s2">it&#39;s valuable to be aware of the</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.200" end="01:03:26.640" style="s2">different spaces and levels in which</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.359" end="01:03:29.280" style="s2">they act</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.640" end="01:03:30.720" style="s2">and the partial value that they each</p>
<p begin="01:03:29.280" end="01:03:31.520" style="s2">have and the synergies that can be there</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.720" end="01:03:33.760" style="s2">between them</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.520" end="01:03:36.000" style="s2">so that someone kind of pays attention</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.760" end="01:03:38.400" style="s2">to working across those spaces</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.000" end="01:03:40.559" style="s2">i had experience of going through a</p>
<p begin="01:03:38.400" end="01:03:42.240" style="s2">particular psychotherapeutic process</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.559" end="01:03:43.680" style="s2">and going through my whole childhood all</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.240" end="01:03:45.359" style="s2">the events linearly</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.680" end="01:03:46.319" style="s2">and having healing around all kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.359" end="01:03:47.680" style="s2">things and then going through a</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.319" end="01:03:48.799" style="s2">different psychotherapeutic process they</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.680" end="01:03:49.920" style="s2">work from a totally different angle</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.799" end="01:03:51.440" style="s2">going back to the things and having</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.920" end="01:03:52.799" style="s2">totally different insights that related</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.440" end="01:03:55.039" style="s2">to increased</p>
<p begin="01:03:52.799" end="01:03:58.240" style="s2">freedom and happiness and capacity you</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.039" end="01:04:01.520" style="s2">know many times</p>
<p begin="01:03:58.240" end="01:04:03.760" style="s2">um and i think that&#39;s where things like</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.520" end="01:04:05.920" style="s2">the integral model come in that are</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.760" end="01:04:07.680" style="s2">saying how do we take multiple different</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.920" end="01:04:09.119" style="s2">valuable things see which ones are best</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.680" end="01:04:11.520" style="s2">for us at a given time</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.119" end="01:04:12.240" style="s2">and how to not become a fundamentalist</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.520" end="01:04:14.960" style="s2">to one</p>
<p begin="01:04:12.240" end="01:04:16.240" style="s2">technique but to be able to see what</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.960" end="01:04:19.839" style="s2">actually seems meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:04:16.240" end="01:04:20.319" style="s2">and useful so i would say the binding of</p>
<p begin="01:04:19.839" end="01:04:22.480" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.319" end="01:04:26.000" style="s2">development of the individual to their</p>
<p begin="01:04:22.480" end="01:04:29.280" style="s2">dharma and the contribution to the whole</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.000" end="01:04:31.920" style="s2">and the binding of the different parts</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.280" end="01:04:34.079" style="s2">of self work to each other</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.920" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">uh are a couple things that come to mind</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.079" end="01:04:36.400" style="s2">for me</p>
<p begin="01:04:36.480" end="01:04:39.520" style="s2">so i have a follow-up question uh with</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.880" end="01:04:41.119" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:04:39.520" end="01:04:42.319" style="s2">so christian who who just spoke he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:04:46.799" end="01:04:49.680" style="s2">and kind of</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.000" end="01:04:51.760" style="s2">empowers us to figure out how to create</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.680" end="01:04:52.480" style="s2">our own uh and and as you know we have a</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.760" end="01:04:53.680" style="s2">wisdom gym</p>
<p begin="01:04:52.480" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">here at the stoa where we have</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.680" end="01:04:55.680" style="s2">reoccurring events like collective</p>

<p begin="01:05:04.319" end="01:05:08.319" style="s2">type r d projects where</p>
<p begin="01:05:06.000" end="01:05:09.839" style="s2">like margaret the lady who spoke last</p>
<p begin="01:05:08.319" end="01:05:11.200" style="s2">week we did communitas club where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.839" end="01:05:12.480" style="s2">investigating all these different</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.200" end="01:05:14.160" style="s2">intersubjective and conversational</p>
<p begin="01:05:12.480" end="01:05:15.599" style="s2">modalities and if they work we can</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.160" end="01:05:16.400" style="s2">import it in the wisdom gym</p>
<p begin="01:05:15.599" end="01:05:18.960" style="s2">we&#39;re going to have something like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.400" end="01:05:20.400" style="s2">psychotherapy cafe where we do the same</p>
<p begin="01:05:18.960" end="01:05:23.280" style="s2">with all these modalities</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.400" end="01:05:24.960" style="s2">a sovereignty society and the idea is to</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.280" end="01:05:27.359" style="s2">have sort of like a</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.960" end="01:05:29.119" style="s2">robust wisdom gym maybe like a metasanga</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.359" end="01:05:31.280" style="s2">that has all these different kind of</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.119" end="01:05:32.720" style="s2">practices and maybe wisdom trainers can</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.280" end="01:05:34.160" style="s2">kind of guide people and all that</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.720" end="01:05:36.000" style="s2">other than that i have no idea what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.160" end="01:05:37.680" style="s2">doing but um given</p>
<p begin="01:05:36.000" end="01:05:39.039" style="s2">all that that framework i just said do</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.680" end="01:05:40.000" style="s2">you think there&#39;s any potential there</p>
<p begin="01:05:39.039" end="01:05:42.079" style="s2">and how would</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.000" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">what would you uh say to guide that</p>
<p begin="01:05:42.079" end="01:05:44.559" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.079" end="01:05:55.599" style="s2">a couple of thoughts that come up is uh</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.440" end="01:05:57.200" style="s2">there&#39;s some kind of developmental work</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.599" end="01:05:58.960" style="s2">that makes shifts that once they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:05:57.200" end="01:06:01.599" style="s2">happened they can&#39;t be undone</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.960" end="01:06:02.640" style="s2">right they&#39;re really kind of directional</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.599" end="01:06:04.000" style="s2">shifts</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.640" end="01:06:06.559" style="s2">and then there&#39;s other kind of work that</p>
<p begin="01:06:04.000" end="01:06:08.400" style="s2">is really more like exercise like</p>
<p begin="01:06:06.559" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">you can be very buff and stop exercising</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.400" end="01:06:11.760" style="s2">and lose it and it really requires</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:13.359" style="s2">maintenance and it&#39;s valuable to know</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.760" end="01:06:15.359" style="s2">which is which</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.359" end="01:06:16.799" style="s2">um because one of the things that can</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.359" end="01:06:18.400" style="s2">happen is someone takes a period where</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.799" end="01:06:20.640" style="s2">they&#39;re doing a lot of study or a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.400" end="01:06:22.960" style="s2">developmental work</p>
<p begin="01:06:20.640" end="01:06:24.640" style="s2">they reach a certain level of clarity</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.960" end="01:06:26.160" style="s2">and feeling of empowerment where they</p>
<p begin="01:06:24.640" end="01:06:27.599" style="s2">start saying okay now i can go build</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.160" end="01:06:28.960" style="s2">stuff in the world based on this</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.599" end="01:06:30.400" style="s2">but it&#39;s some stuff that requires</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.960" end="01:06:32.480" style="s2">maintenance they drop the maintenance</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.400" end="01:06:34.319" style="s2">and they&#39;re like taking it for granted</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.480" end="01:06:35.839" style="s2">and then lose the the foundation with</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.319" end="01:06:39.119" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.839" end="01:06:41.200" style="s2">um so it&#39;s valuable to know</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.119" end="01:06:42.799" style="s2">what kinds of things are like oh i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.200" end="01:06:44.480" style="s2">i&#39;ve had that insight</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.799" end="01:06:46.559" style="s2">and now i can never see it the same way</p>
<p begin="01:06:44.480" end="01:06:48.960" style="s2">again versus</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.559" end="01:06:50.160" style="s2">um this is a kind of muscle that has to</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.960" end="01:06:52.079" style="s2">be ongoingly</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.160" end="01:06:53.760" style="s2">it might not take as much work to</p>
<p begin="01:06:52.079" end="01:06:54.960" style="s2">maintain it just like muscles as it does</p>
<p begin="01:06:53.760" end="01:06:57.039" style="s2">to develop them</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.960" end="01:06:59.119" style="s2">and then what is an ongoing development</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.039" end="01:07:01.440" style="s2">routine i think maintenance is super</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.119" end="01:07:05.359" style="s2">unsexy for the most part</p>
<p begin="01:07:01.440" end="01:07:08.880" style="s2">i think like new [ __ ] is has its own</p>
<p begin="01:07:05.359" end="01:07:12.720" style="s2">novelty uh dopamine hit to it</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.880" end="01:07:14.799" style="s2">and in general like</p>
<p begin="01:07:12.720" end="01:07:16.240" style="s2">it&#39;s more fun to build a house and get</p>
<p begin="01:07:14.799" end="01:07:17.599" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="01:07:16.240" end="01:07:19.200" style="s2">there&#39;s a house and there wasn&#39;t a house</p>
<p begin="01:07:17.599" end="01:07:19.839" style="s2">than it is to like wash the dishes</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.200" end="01:07:22.720" style="s2">forever</p>
<p begin="01:07:19.839" end="01:07:23.839" style="s2">and all i get to show for it is forever</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.720" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.839" end="01:07:28.319" style="s2">it&#39;s the same as opposed to that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:31.520" style="s2">different in a finite period of time</p>
<p begin="01:07:28.319" end="01:07:33.200" style="s2">um and yet the house is not very good if</p>
<p begin="01:07:31.520" end="01:07:36.559" style="s2">i don&#39;t do the maintenance stuff right</p>
<p begin="01:07:33.200" end="01:07:38.960" style="s2">um and so i think one of the things</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.559" end="01:07:40.960" style="s2">that&#39;s super valuable is to actually</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.960" end="01:07:42.960" style="s2">culture a very high value around the</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.960" end="01:07:44.720" style="s2">maintenance</p>
<p begin="01:07:42.960" end="01:07:46.400" style="s2">because otherwise there&#39;s a whole lot of</p>
<p begin="01:07:44.720" end="01:07:47.680" style="s2">take two steps forward and then take two</p>
<p begin="01:07:46.400" end="01:07:49.680" style="s2">steps back and</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.680" end="01:07:51.119" style="s2">it&#39;s all very exciting and that net in</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.680" end="01:07:52.960" style="s2">ten years you actually didn&#39;t change</p>
<p begin="01:07:51.119" end="01:07:54.880" style="s2">your life very much</p>
<p begin="01:07:52.960" end="01:07:56.000" style="s2">versus if i can make a small bit of</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.880" end="01:07:58.079" style="s2">progress but maintain</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.000" end="01:07:59.359" style="s2">it and this progress i made in my</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.079" end="01:08:00.240" style="s2">relationships when i was putting a lot</p>
<p begin="01:07:59.359" end="01:08:01.920" style="s2">of attention there</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.240" end="01:08:03.920" style="s2">now when i go to put movement in my</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:06.640" style="s2">business i don&#39;t lose the relationship</p>
<p begin="01:08:03.920" end="01:08:08.240" style="s2">focus because i&#39;m doing the maintenance</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.640" end="01:08:10.000" style="s2">even if i&#39;m only making a small bit of</p>
<p begin="01:08:08.240" end="01:08:11.440" style="s2">progress in an area at a time but then</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.000" end="01:08:13.440" style="s2">i&#39;m maintaining the areas that i</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.440" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">developed over the course of a decade i</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.440" end="01:08:16.960" style="s2">might have actually moved a lot</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.080" end="01:08:21.279" style="s2">so i think actually creating a high</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.159" end="01:08:22.640" style="s2">value around</p>
<p begin="01:08:21.279" end="01:08:24.560" style="s2">the maintenance of things that are</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.640" end="01:08:27.279" style="s2">meaningful and that require it</p>
<p begin="01:08:24.560" end="01:08:27.279" style="s2">is very helpful</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.560" end="01:08:33.600" style="s2">and then another thing when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.759" end="01:08:38.080" style="s2">talking about uh</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.600" end="01:08:41.359" style="s2">you know a wisdom gem is</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.080" end="01:08:42.080" style="s2">when i shared that there were processes</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.359" end="01:08:45.359" style="s2">i went through</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.080" end="01:08:47.600" style="s2">that were very powerful and then</p>
<p begin="01:08:45.359" end="01:08:49.679" style="s2">later on different processes or</p>
<p begin="01:08:47.600" end="01:08:51.520" style="s2">sometimes even the same process just</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.679" end="01:08:54.560" style="s2">later with more emotional majority that</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.520" end="01:08:57.679" style="s2">had whole other layers of insight</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.560" end="01:08:58.239" style="s2">i think there&#39;s a benefit to settling</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.679" end="01:09:00.960" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.239" end="01:09:01.679" style="s2">the personal growth happens forever</p>
<p begin="01:09:00.960" end="01:09:03.920" style="s2">there is not</p>
<p begin="01:09:01.679" end="01:09:05.600" style="s2">like uh i&#39;m going to push real hard and</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.920" end="01:09:07.279" style="s2">get there and then once i&#39;m there then</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.600" end="01:09:08.640" style="s2">i&#39;ll be able to do my work in the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.279" end="01:09:11.120" style="s2">then i&#39;ll be able to have a relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.640" end="01:09:12.799" style="s2">or be fulfilled it may be</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.120" end="01:09:14.640" style="s2">that there is a particular place i want</p>
<p begin="01:09:12.799" end="01:09:16.640" style="s2">to get to before i move attention</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.640" end="01:09:18.159" style="s2">to like just not be depressed all the</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.640" end="01:09:19.279" style="s2">time or to feel like i can communicate</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.159" end="01:09:20.400" style="s2">well enough to have a decent</p>
<p begin="01:09:19.279" end="01:09:22.239" style="s2">relationship</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.400" end="01:09:24.080" style="s2">but i&#39;m still going to be working on my</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.239" end="01:09:26.799" style="s2">own evolution as a person forever</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.080" end="01:09:30.080" style="s2">in layers and so there&#39;s a certain kind</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.799" end="01:09:33.520" style="s2">of settling into that</p>
<p begin="01:09:30.080" end="01:09:36.000" style="s2">that is willing to</p>
<p begin="01:09:33.520" end="01:09:37.679" style="s2">and takes delight in continuing to put</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.000" end="01:09:40.640" style="s2">effort in</p>
<p begin="01:09:37.679" end="01:09:41.520" style="s2">without the impatience of when do i get</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.640" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">there</p>
<p begin="01:09:41.520" end="01:09:46.000" style="s2">that&#39;s uh that&#39;s helpful</p>
<p begin="01:09:47.600" end="01:09:51.440" style="s2">yeah we&#39;ll keep the mind is uh like</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.759" end="01:09:53.040" style="s2">similar to spiritual bypassing maybe</p>
<p begin="01:09:51.440" end="01:09:54.320" style="s2">there&#39;s like spiritual distraction where</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.040" end="01:09:56.560" style="s2">like oh i have to</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.320" end="01:09:58.800" style="s2">you know level up before i actually like</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.560" end="01:10:03.679" style="s2">engage in my dharma in the world</p>
<p begin="01:09:58.800" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">um you see that as a phenomenon</p>
<p begin="01:10:03.679" end="01:10:06.480" style="s2">yeah i remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:09.040" end="01:10:13.360" style="s2">i mean it was so important for me and it</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.440" end="01:10:17.360" style="s2">sounds so immature and it was</p>
<p begin="01:10:13.360" end="01:10:19.600" style="s2">but uh</p>
<p begin="01:10:17.360" end="01:10:21.120" style="s2">it&#39;s usually hard to see ourselves as</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.600" end="01:10:22.400" style="s2">really immature in the moment because</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.120" end="01:10:25.120" style="s2">we&#39;re looking through the lens</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.400" end="01:10:26.560" style="s2">that we have um in retrospect it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.120" end="01:10:30.320" style="s2">usually quite easy</p>
<p begin="01:10:26.560" end="01:10:33.440" style="s2">uh i remember</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.320" end="01:10:34.719" style="s2">i had this very strong when i was young</p>
<p begin="01:10:33.440" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">monastic impulse</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.719" end="01:10:37.840" style="s2">and a very strong</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.400" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">um romantic poetic lover impulse</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.440" end="01:10:44.719" style="s2">and they were very torn</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.880" end="01:10:49.920" style="s2">the monastic impulse was both in terms</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.920" end="01:10:50.719" style="s2">of like depth of meditation and practice</p>
<p begin="01:10:49.920" end="01:10:52.400" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.719" end="01:10:53.920" style="s2">dharma work that i wanted to do that i</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.400" end="01:10:55.440" style="s2">thought would be so consuming that i</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.920" end="01:10:57.280" style="s2">couldn&#39;t possibly be a good partner and</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.440" end="01:11:00.080" style="s2">i didn&#39;t want to be a shitty partner</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.280" end="01:11:01.600" style="s2">but i also had this sense that the</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.080" end="01:11:03.120" style="s2">foundation of the meaningfulness of</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.600" end="01:11:03.920" style="s2">everything is love and there&#39;s a way in</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.120" end="01:11:05.120" style="s2">which that</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.920" end="01:11:07.520" style="s2">expressed itself an intimate</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.120" end="01:11:08.719" style="s2">relationship that was so meaningful one</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.520" end="01:11:10.159" style="s2">to be honored</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.719" end="01:11:13.280" style="s2">this was like a huge source of inner</p>
<p begin="01:11:10.159" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">conflict in my early</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.280" end="01:11:15.520" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.800" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">and so at one point i had to uh</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:23.840" style="s2">say okay i&#39;m gonna give the monastic</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:25.199" style="s2">thing full rain so it stops pulling me</p>
<p begin="01:11:23.840" end="01:11:27.040" style="s2">out of not being able to be in my</p>
<p begin="01:11:25.199" end="01:11:29.120" style="s2">relationships fully</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.040" end="01:11:30.640" style="s2">so ended a relationship with someone who</p>
<p begin="01:11:29.120" end="01:11:33.040" style="s2">was really incredible who i really loved</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.640" end="01:11:36.480" style="s2">i was maybe 20</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.040" end="01:11:38.640" style="s2">and took a one-way plane ticket to peru</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.480" end="01:11:40.880" style="s2">to go off in the</p>
<p begin="01:11:38.640" end="01:11:42.800" style="s2">jungle by myself and however long it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.880" end="01:11:44.560" style="s2">going to take to be with myself</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.800" end="01:11:46.080" style="s2">and do the things that i needed to do</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.560" end="01:11:47.440" style="s2">and it was really important that it was</p>
<p begin="01:11:46.080" end="01:11:49.600" style="s2">a one-way plane ticket</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.440" end="01:11:50.960" style="s2">and that i said goodbye to everybody and</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.600" end="01:11:54.080" style="s2">that i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.960" end="01:11:55.440" style="s2">bind it and one of the there were a lot</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.080" end="01:11:56.560" style="s2">of very powerful things that happened it</p>
<p begin="01:11:55.440" end="01:11:59.920" style="s2">was very good that i</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.560" end="01:12:00.640" style="s2">gave myself that not everybody needs</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.920" end="01:12:03.920" style="s2">that at all i</p>
<p begin="01:12:00.640" end="01:12:06.239" style="s2">i did because i had a lot of heroes</p>
<p begin="01:12:03.920" end="01:12:08.640" style="s2">that were monastic when i was young or</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.239" end="01:12:11.840" style="s2">you know something like that</p>
<p begin="01:12:08.640" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">but one of the major things that i saw</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.840" end="01:12:16.000" style="s2">that brought me out of it was</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:21.360" style="s2">that life had really made this perfect</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.120" end="01:12:23.360" style="s2">personal development ashram for me and i</p>
<p begin="01:12:21.360" end="01:12:24.560" style="s2">was just rejecting it because i had this</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.360" end="01:12:26.480" style="s2">idea that i was supposed to do this</p>
<p begin="01:12:24.560" end="01:12:28.880" style="s2">monastic thing and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:12:26.480" end="01:12:30.400" style="s2">actually when i was in relationship and</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.880" end="01:12:31.760" style="s2">when i was in work i was getting</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.400" end="01:12:33.600" style="s2">confronted by my triggers all the</p>
<p begin="01:12:31.760" end="01:12:35.280" style="s2">goddamn time which were my own lack of</p>
<p begin="01:12:33.600" end="01:12:36.400" style="s2">wholeness which is exactly what i needed</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.280" end="01:12:38.320" style="s2">to work on</p>
<p begin="01:12:36.400" end="01:12:39.920" style="s2">but rather than embrace that as my</p>
<p begin="01:12:38.320" end="01:12:42.159" style="s2">development i had some idea of no</p>
<p begin="01:12:39.920" end="01:12:43.920" style="s2">no spiritual looks like this other thing</p>
<p begin="01:12:42.159" end="01:12:45.600" style="s2">and i need to go do this and i&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.920" end="01:12:46.960" style="s2">actually it&#39;s kind of easier to not be</p>
<p begin="01:12:45.600" end="01:12:48.320" style="s2">triggered out here and it&#39;s also kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.960" end="01:12:50.719" style="s2">meaningless and there&#39;s certain kinds of</p>
<p begin="01:12:48.320" end="01:12:54.159" style="s2">growth that i just can&#39;t get out here</p>
<p begin="01:12:50.719" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">and there was a deeper embracing of</p>
<p begin="01:12:54.159" end="01:12:57.679" style="s2">uh kind of</p>
<p begin="01:12:58.400" end="01:13:06.080" style="s2">all of life as a developmental path</p>
<p begin="01:13:02.560" end="01:13:09.120" style="s2">uh rather than being separate so</p>
<p begin="01:13:06.080" end="01:13:10.800" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah i was gonna um like</p>
<p begin="01:13:09.120" end="01:13:12.239" style="s2">mention like the monastery is your world</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.800" end="01:13:13.920" style="s2">type thing or the world&#39;s your monastery</p>
<p begin="01:13:12.239" end="01:13:14.719" style="s2">and then each thing is a forcing</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.920" end="01:13:17.600" style="s2">function to</p>
<p begin="01:13:14.719" end="01:13:18.159" style="s2">to improve and develop i i want to sneak</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.600" end="01:13:20.480" style="s2">in another</p>
<p begin="01:13:18.159" end="01:13:22.880" style="s2">question in regards to the um the wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.480" end="01:13:24.080" style="s2">gym uh</p>
<p begin="01:13:22.880" end="01:13:25.280" style="s2">margaret and i were kind of like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:24.080" end="01:13:26.159" style="s2">collecting all these different practices</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.280" end="01:13:27.600" style="s2">and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:13:26.159" end="01:13:29.440" style="s2">thinking of having like multiple</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.600" end="01:13:30.840" style="s2">taxonomies or meta systems to kind of</p>
<p begin="01:13:29.440" end="01:13:33.840" style="s2">organize them</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.840" end="01:13:35.040" style="s2">um and and for the psychology of</p>
<p begin="01:13:33.840" end="01:13:38.159" style="s2">practice that might form</p>
<p begin="01:13:35.040" end="01:13:40.239" style="s2">in the wisdom gym do you have</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.159" end="01:13:42.000" style="s2">any you personally use or any recommend</p>
<p begin="01:13:40.239" end="01:13:44.560" style="s2">maybe descriptive</p>
<p begin="01:13:42.000" end="01:13:46.159" style="s2">like meta systems or frameworks maybe</p>
<p begin="01:13:44.560" end="01:13:49.679" style="s2">like ken wilbur wilpers like growing up</p>
<p begin="01:13:46.159" end="01:13:50.400" style="s2">showing up cleaning up um and ones that</p>
<p begin="01:13:49.679" end="01:13:52.640" style="s2">might</p>
<p begin="01:13:50.400" end="01:13:54.320" style="s2">like systems that might help negotiate</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.640" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">what practices to do</p>
<p begin="01:13:54.320" end="01:14:01.840" style="s2">uh at any given time</p>
<p begin="01:14:05.679" end="01:14:08.480" style="s2">yeah i think the</p>
<p begin="01:14:08.719" end="01:14:12.840" style="s2">wake up grow up show up cleanup model is</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.960" end="01:14:15.840" style="s2">a nice model</p>
<p begin="01:14:12.840" end="01:14:15.840" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:14:24.960" end="01:14:30.960" style="s2">i found that this specific type of</p>
<p begin="01:14:28.239" end="01:14:32.400" style="s2">methodology matters less than someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:14:30.960" end="01:14:34.640" style="s2">connection to the therapist if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:32.400" end="01:14:39.600" style="s2">working with someone</p>
<p begin="01:14:34.640" end="01:14:42.320" style="s2">um if your therapist says they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:14:39.600" end="01:14:44.000" style="s2">gestalt or cbt or jungian work they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:42.320" end="01:14:45.840" style="s2">really just a person that has a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:14:44.000" end="01:14:49.120" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="01:14:45.840" end="01:14:50.800" style="s2">and if you feel like they have an</p>
<p begin="01:14:49.120" end="01:14:52.400" style="s2">embodied wisdom around things you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:14:50.800" end="01:14:53.360" style="s2">working on and you feel like they grok</p>
<p begin="01:14:52.400" end="01:14:55.520" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="01:14:53.360" end="01:14:56.719" style="s2">then what happens there will be beyond</p>
<p begin="01:14:55.520" end="01:15:00.159" style="s2">whatever the method</p>
<p begin="01:14:56.719" end="01:15:02.239" style="s2">that they claim they primarily do is so</p>
<p begin="01:15:00.159" end="01:15:04.480" style="s2">uh as far as working with somebody goes</p>
<p begin="01:15:02.239" end="01:15:06.400" style="s2">i think the feeling of</p>
<p begin="01:15:04.480" end="01:15:07.679" style="s2">right connection is pretty important</p>
<p begin="01:15:06.400" end="01:15:11.840" style="s2">more important than</p>
<p begin="01:15:07.679" end="01:15:11.840" style="s2">a model idea of appropriate method</p>
<p begin="01:15:12.640" end="01:15:17.840" style="s2">and then one</p>
<p begin="01:15:16.080" end="01:15:19.840" style="s2">person that you&#39;re working with might be</p>
<p begin="01:15:17.840" end="01:15:22.480" style="s2">relevant for a while until whatever that</p>
<p begin="01:15:19.840" end="01:15:24.560" style="s2">is completes and then something else is</p>
<p begin="01:15:22.480" end="01:15:26.000" style="s2">you just have to be careful when you</p>
<p begin="01:15:24.560" end="01:15:29.520" style="s2">feel a sense of completion</p>
<p begin="01:15:26.000" end="01:15:30.880" style="s2">is it actually completion or is it now</p>
<p begin="01:15:29.520" end="01:15:32.239" style="s2">we&#39;re getting to the stuff where they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:15:30.880" end="01:15:32.880" style="s2">pushing on something i really don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.239" end="01:15:36.000" style="s2">to see</p>
<p begin="01:15:32.880" end="01:15:37.760" style="s2">and so i&#39;m trying to get rid of them um</p>
<p begin="01:15:36.000" end="01:15:40.640" style="s2">so you know that&#39;s just the depth of</p>
<p begin="01:15:37.760" end="01:15:43.760" style="s2">earnestness in our own inquiry</p>
<p begin="01:15:40.640" end="01:15:45.920" style="s2">um and similar to that i would say</p>
<p begin="01:15:43.760" end="01:15:47.760" style="s2">there&#39;s one can have a model of okay</p>
<p begin="01:15:45.920" end="01:15:49.280" style="s2">well i did this lectical assessment on</p>
<p begin="01:15:47.760" end="01:15:51.120" style="s2">myself and i&#39;m in this level of</p>
<p begin="01:15:49.280" end="01:15:53.120" style="s2">complexity of development therefore</p>
<p begin="01:15:51.120" end="01:15:54.159" style="s2">these types of models are the most</p>
<p begin="01:15:53.120" end="01:15:55.840" style="s2">appropriate</p>
<p begin="01:15:54.159" end="01:15:57.600" style="s2">meditation or psychotherapeutic process</p>
<p begin="01:15:55.840" end="01:16:00.880" style="s2">so i&#39;ll do it i&#39;m not saying those</p>
<p begin="01:15:57.600" end="01:16:02.880" style="s2">considerations are worthless but</p>
<p begin="01:16:00.880" end="01:16:04.480" style="s2">paying attention to what your experience</p>
<p begin="01:16:02.880" end="01:16:06.159" style="s2">and a different practice is and doing</p>
<p begin="01:16:04.480" end="01:16:08.480" style="s2">the ones you feel called to is also</p>
<p begin="01:16:06.159" end="01:16:11.040" style="s2">pretty important</p>
<p begin="01:16:08.480" end="01:16:11.840" style="s2">um i think if you&#39;re doing a practice</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.040" end="01:16:13.280" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:11.840" end="01:16:15.920" style="s2">feel resonant it doesn&#39;t feel like</p>
<p begin="01:16:13.280" end="01:16:17.600" style="s2">anything&#39;s moving</p>
<p begin="01:16:15.920" end="01:16:18.880" style="s2">you can give it if if you&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:16:17.600" end="01:16:20.239" style="s2">really good things about it you can give</p>
<p begin="01:16:18.880" end="01:16:22.080" style="s2">it good face</p>
<p begin="01:16:20.239" end="01:16:23.440" style="s2">attempt for a long enough time to see if</p>
<p begin="01:16:22.080" end="01:16:25.040" style="s2">it clicks but it</p>
<p begin="01:16:23.440" end="01:16:26.640" style="s2">you&#39;re also going to get more movement</p>
<p begin="01:16:25.040" end="01:16:29.520" style="s2">out of something that you do because you</p>
<p begin="01:16:26.640" end="01:16:29.520" style="s2">feel resonance with it</p>
<p begin="01:16:30.159" end="01:16:35.199" style="s2">so basically i&#39;m saying i wouldn&#39;t try</p>
<p begin="01:16:32.159" end="01:16:38.640" style="s2">to formalize it too much</p>
<p begin="01:16:35.199" end="01:16:42.159" style="s2">right yeah that&#39;s been my intuition</p>
<p begin="01:16:38.640" end="01:16:44.080" style="s2">as well and sometimes it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="01:16:42.159" end="01:16:46.159" style="s2">critical</p>
<p begin="01:16:44.080" end="01:16:48.239" style="s2">to pay attention to something that is</p>
<p begin="01:16:46.159" end="01:16:49.600" style="s2">experientially meaningful that you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:16:48.239" end="01:16:51.280" style="s2">cognitively understand</p>
<p begin="01:16:49.600" end="01:16:53.040" style="s2">and where it&#39;s actually critical to not</p>
<p begin="01:16:51.280" end="01:16:56.320" style="s2">cognitively understand it</p>
<p begin="01:16:53.040" end="01:16:58.320" style="s2">you&#39;re somebody does a session with you</p>
<p begin="01:16:56.320" end="01:17:00.159" style="s2">with crystals or chakras and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:16:58.320" end="01:17:01.840" style="s2">actually profound and you notice that</p>
<p begin="01:17:00.159" end="01:17:02.960" style="s2">you&#39;re not triggered by [ __ ] anymore</p>
<p begin="01:17:01.840" end="01:17:04.560" style="s2">you&#39;re like but i don&#39;t necessarily</p>
<p begin="01:17:02.960" end="01:17:07.120" style="s2">believe in crystals</p>
<p begin="01:17:04.560" end="01:17:07.120" style="s2">you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:08.800" end="01:17:13.360" style="s2">like it&#39;s easy to say okay well for</p>
<p begin="01:17:11.760" end="01:17:15.120" style="s2">crystals to work it either means that</p>
<p begin="01:17:13.360" end="01:17:16.880" style="s2">it&#39;s a placebo or it means that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:17:15.120" end="01:17:18.480" style="s2">some electromagnetic effect based on the</p>
<p begin="01:17:16.880" end="01:17:19.360" style="s2">crystalline structure of the molecules</p>
<p begin="01:17:18.480" end="01:17:20.960" style="s2">in the lattice</p>
<p begin="01:17:19.360" end="01:17:22.320" style="s2">well maybe not maybe it&#39;s a whole other</p>
<p begin="01:17:20.960" end="01:17:24.000" style="s2">set of [ __ ] that you&#39;re not that&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="01:17:22.320" end="01:17:25.840" style="s2">your unknown unknown set that you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:17:24.000" end="01:17:29.120" style="s2">conceive of properly</p>
<p begin="01:17:25.840" end="01:17:31.600" style="s2">so it&#39;s okay to say</p>
<p begin="01:17:29.120" end="01:17:33.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t necessarily believe in a</p>
<p begin="01:17:31.600" end="01:17:35.520" style="s2">specific proposition of how crystals</p>
<p begin="01:17:33.520" end="01:17:37.280" style="s2">work but i believe in a meaningfulness</p>
<p begin="01:17:35.520" end="01:17:39.040" style="s2">of my experience that i&#39;m letting myself</p>
<p begin="01:17:37.280" end="01:17:40.640" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:17:39.040" end="01:17:42.480" style="s2">and so i don&#39;t have to become across the</p>
<p begin="01:17:40.640" end="01:17:44.080" style="s2">light of a specific way of describing it</p>
<p begin="01:17:42.480" end="01:17:45.679" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t make sense to me but</p>
<p begin="01:17:44.080" end="01:17:46.880" style="s2">because it doesn&#39;t make sense to me i</p>
<p begin="01:17:45.679" end="01:17:49.199" style="s2">also</p>
<p begin="01:17:46.880" end="01:17:50.800" style="s2">don&#39;t have to reject the experience</p>
<p begin="01:17:49.199" end="01:17:53.520" style="s2">sometimes it&#39;s important to let yourself</p>
<p begin="01:17:50.800" end="01:17:55.679" style="s2">have an experience that feels meaningful</p>
<p begin="01:17:53.520" end="01:17:59.679" style="s2">and you&#39;ll understand it progressively</p>
<p begin="01:17:55.679" end="01:18:02.400" style="s2">more later</p>
<p begin="01:17:59.679" end="01:18:04.080" style="s2">i like that a lot someone joe&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="01:18:02.400" end="01:18:07.280" style="s2">chats uh you don&#39;t get to choose</p>
<p begin="01:18:04.080" end="01:18:09.600" style="s2">what ends up working um</p>
<p begin="01:18:07.280" end="01:18:10.960" style="s2">all right so let&#39;s uh sneak in one more</p>
<p begin="01:18:09.600" end="01:18:14.719" style="s2">question before the hour</p>
<p begin="01:18:10.960" end="01:18:14.719" style="s2">uh hannah you had a question</p>
<p begin="01:18:15.600" end="01:18:23.360" style="s2">i do thank you thank you for teasing me</p>
<p begin="01:18:19.600" end="01:18:25.920" style="s2">um so i would very much</p>
<p begin="01:18:23.360" end="01:18:27.600" style="s2">like to start bringing some of the tools</p>
<p begin="01:18:25.920" end="01:18:30.320" style="s2">that i&#39;m learning here</p>
<p begin="01:18:27.600" end="01:18:31.920" style="s2">to some of my other communities and</p>
<p begin="01:18:30.320" end="01:18:35.840" style="s2">relationships</p>
<p begin="01:18:31.920" end="01:18:38.840" style="s2">and so i&#39;m wondering uh</p>
<p begin="01:18:35.840" end="01:18:40.280" style="s2">what what skills can i work on</p>
<p begin="01:18:38.840" end="01:18:44.120" style="s2">interpersonally</p>
<p begin="01:18:40.280" end="01:18:47.600" style="s2">interpersonally to start</p>
<p begin="01:18:44.120" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">facilitating or moving towards</p>
<p begin="01:18:47.600" end="01:18:55.840" style="s2">meaningful conversations between tribes</p>
<p begin="01:19:05.520" end="01:19:09.120" style="s2">so something else are a meta thing i&#39;ll</p>

<p begin="01:19:44.400" end="01:19:48.320" style="s2">growth with meaningful topics in the</p>
<p begin="01:19:46.400" end="01:19:49.120" style="s2">world a chance to like just talk about</p>
<p begin="01:19:48.320" end="01:19:50.560" style="s2">what&#39;s alive</p>
<p begin="01:19:49.120" end="01:19:52.880" style="s2">on the personal growth side would be</p>
<p begin="01:19:50.560" end="01:19:54.080" style="s2">interesting but the like one-to-many</p>
<p begin="01:19:52.880" end="01:19:55.440" style="s2">structure is strange because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:19:54.080" end="01:19:57.040" style="s2">plenty of people on the call who have</p>
<p begin="01:19:55.440" end="01:19:58.239" style="s2">wisdom on these topics that i don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="01:19:57.040" end="01:20:01.760" style="s2">and yet we have an hour</p>
<p begin="01:19:58.239" end="01:20:04.800" style="s2">here together whatever it is um</p>
<p begin="01:20:01.760" end="01:20:06.800" style="s2">i&#39;m glad that there are many other uh</p>
<p begin="01:20:04.800" end="01:20:09.520" style="s2">people that are contributing to this</p>
<p begin="01:20:06.800" end="01:20:11.040" style="s2">place and i i imagine</p>
<p begin="01:20:09.520" end="01:20:13.440" style="s2">i hope that you guys have people like</p>
<p begin="01:20:11.040" end="01:20:16.480" style="s2">diane hamilton and</p>
<p begin="01:20:13.440" end="01:20:17.360" style="s2">zach and um maybe verveiki and other</p>
<p begin="01:20:16.480" end="01:20:19.040" style="s2">people that have</p>
<p begin="01:20:17.360" end="01:20:21.120" style="s2">worked with people for a long time have</p>
<p begin="01:20:19.040" end="01:20:22.800" style="s2">a lot of depth of experience that are</p>
<p begin="01:20:21.120" end="01:20:25.040" style="s2">part of an advisory council that is</p>
<p begin="01:20:22.800" end="01:20:28.159" style="s2">ongoingly contributing</p>
<p begin="01:20:25.040" end="01:20:29.520" style="s2">i imagine that&#39;s the case but normally</p>
<p begin="01:20:28.159" end="01:20:31.440" style="s2">if i was having a conversation with</p>
<p begin="01:20:29.520" end="01:20:33.520" style="s2">anybody here one on one</p>
<p begin="01:20:31.440" end="01:20:35.199" style="s2">i wouldn&#39;t answer questions typically</p>
<p begin="01:20:33.520" end="01:20:36.639" style="s2">like the question having you just asked</p>
<p begin="01:20:35.199" end="01:20:37.840" style="s2">me the first thing i would do is ask you</p>
<p begin="01:20:36.639" end="01:20:39.120" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="01:20:37.840" end="01:20:40.560" style="s2">what is your sense on that what are you</p>
<p begin="01:20:39.120" end="01:20:41.520" style="s2">working on where do you find that you</p>
<p begin="01:20:40.560" end="01:20:44.639" style="s2">have</p>
<p begin="01:20:41.520" end="01:20:46.320" style="s2">limitations in that currently and yet</p>
<p begin="01:20:44.639" end="01:20:47.760" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t scale to being able to talk</p>
<p begin="01:20:46.320" end="01:20:49.440" style="s2">to when there&#39;s hundreds of people and</p>
<p begin="01:20:47.760" end="01:20:51.679" style="s2">trying to say what about this question</p>
<p begin="01:20:49.440" end="01:20:55.040" style="s2">might be relevant to everybody so</p>
<p begin="01:20:51.679" end="01:20:55.040" style="s2">just even as a meta point</p>
<p begin="01:20:55.360" end="01:20:59.840" style="s2">um a question straight to an answer is</p>
<p begin="01:20:58.080" end="01:21:02.000" style="s2">usually not the best method of either</p>
<p begin="01:20:59.840" end="01:21:04.880" style="s2">learning or healing</p>
<p begin="01:21:02.000" end="01:21:07.280" style="s2">but the it&#39;s nate the nature of the</p>
<p begin="01:21:04.880" end="01:21:07.280" style="s2">format</p>
<p begin="01:21:08.080" end="01:21:11.600" style="s2">if you&#39;re interested in actually</p>
<p begin="01:21:09.600" end="01:21:14.000" style="s2">facilitating i would say pay attention</p>
<p begin="01:21:11.600" end="01:21:16.320" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="01:21:14.000" end="01:21:18.080" style="s2">methods you&#39;re going deepest with and</p>
<p begin="01:21:16.320" end="01:21:20.239" style="s2">getting the most benefit from</p>
<p begin="01:21:18.080" end="01:21:21.199" style="s2">and actually see if they have programs</p>
<p begin="01:21:20.239" end="01:21:22.639" style="s2">where you can learn how to be a</p>
<p begin="01:21:21.199" end="01:21:24.719" style="s2">facilitator</p>
<p begin="01:21:22.639" end="01:21:26.000" style="s2">many people learn at a certain point in</p>
<p begin="01:21:24.719" end="01:21:27.600" style="s2">their life how to be a</p>
<p begin="01:21:26.000" end="01:21:29.360" style="s2">therapist of a particular kind not</p>
<p begin="01:21:27.600" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">because it&#39;s their dharma to do therapy</p>
<p begin="01:21:29.360" end="01:21:32.320" style="s2">forever but because</p>
<p begin="01:21:32.560" end="01:21:36.239" style="s2">they&#39;re deepening their own knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:21:35.199" end="01:21:38.320" style="s2">and practice of it</p>
<p begin="01:21:36.239" end="01:21:39.840" style="s2">and oftentimes if there&#39;s a pattern</p>
<p begin="01:21:38.320" end="01:21:41.520" style="s2">that&#39;s really deep for you and you</p>
<p begin="01:21:39.840" end="01:21:44.000" style="s2">work with a lot of other people who have</p>
<p begin="01:21:41.520" end="01:21:45.760" style="s2">it and seeing clearly and objectively</p>
<p begin="01:21:44.000" end="01:21:47.520" style="s2">the way it shows up in them</p>
<p begin="01:21:45.760" end="01:21:49.600" style="s2">you get deeper and deeper insights into</p>
<p begin="01:21:47.520" end="01:21:53.600" style="s2">it um</p>
<p begin="01:21:49.600" end="01:21:57.280" style="s2">so yeah you might actually decide to</p>
<p begin="01:21:53.600" end="01:22:00.239" style="s2">take practitioner training</p>
<p begin="01:21:57.280" end="01:22:00.880" style="s2">and then as far as bringing it to</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.239" end="01:22:03.040" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:22:00.880" end="01:22:04.719" style="s2">communities and what skills you would</p>
<p begin="01:22:03.040" end="01:22:06.639" style="s2">develop other than just the practitioner</p>
<p begin="01:22:04.719" end="01:22:09.840" style="s2">ones</p>
<p begin="01:22:06.639" end="01:22:11.920" style="s2">the ability to translate reality tunnels</p>
<p begin="01:22:09.840" end="01:22:12.800" style="s2">or translate ontologies can be very</p>
<p begin="01:22:11.920" end="01:22:15.360" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:22:12.800" end="01:22:16.960" style="s2">now it&#39;s just a kind of like cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:22:15.360" end="01:22:18.960" style="s2">philosophic thing that is not</p>
<p begin="01:22:16.960" end="01:22:20.880" style="s2">necessarily always relevant but if</p>
<p begin="01:22:18.960" end="01:22:23.360" style="s2">you&#39;re wanting to bring some</p>
<p begin="01:22:20.880" end="01:22:24.239" style="s2">experiential phenomenological thing to a</p>
<p begin="01:22:23.360" end="01:22:27.040" style="s2">rationalist</p>
<p begin="01:22:24.239" end="01:22:28.480" style="s2">community that maybe doesn&#39;t have a</p>
<p begin="01:22:27.040" end="01:22:33.120" style="s2">doesn&#39;t even have antique</p>
<p begin="01:22:28.480" end="01:22:33.120" style="s2">entities for those things right like um</p>
<p begin="01:22:36.960" end="01:22:41.840" style="s2">then being able to translate it in a way</p>
<p begin="01:22:40.320" end="01:22:44.639" style="s2">that can relate to something they do</p>
<p begin="01:22:41.840" end="01:22:47.360" style="s2">have a relationship to</p>
<p begin="01:22:44.639" end="01:22:49.120" style="s2">uh and then kind of on board just the</p>
<p begin="01:22:47.360" end="01:22:51.280" style="s2">willingness to explore</p>
<p begin="01:22:49.120" end="01:22:52.719" style="s2">um that can be very helpful and so this</p>
<p begin="01:22:51.280" end="01:22:53.280" style="s2">is like the skills i would say are</p>
<p begin="01:22:52.719" end="01:22:55.199" style="s2">twofold</p>
<p begin="01:22:53.280" end="01:22:56.880" style="s2">one is the ability to say okay well what</p>
<p begin="01:22:55.199" end="01:22:59.120" style="s2">is this kind of ontologic</p>
<p begin="01:22:56.880" end="01:23:00.880" style="s2">worldview what is this one and how would</p>
<p begin="01:22:59.120" end="01:23:02.000" style="s2">i translate them and that&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="01:23:00.880" end="01:23:05.520" style="s2">a communication</p>
<p begin="01:23:02.000" end="01:23:08.239" style="s2">clarity process the other is an empathy</p>
<p begin="01:23:05.520" end="01:23:10.719" style="s2">process of being able to see what are</p>
<p begin="01:23:08.239" end="01:23:12.639" style="s2">the people here actually interested in</p>
<p begin="01:23:10.719" end="01:23:15.440" style="s2">and what are they open to and how do i</p>
<p begin="01:23:12.639" end="01:23:15.440" style="s2">connect there</p>
<p begin="01:23:16.800" end="01:23:20.719" style="s2">i don&#39;t know if that answers at all what</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.000" end="01:23:24.400" style="s2">you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:23:20.719" end="01:23:27.120" style="s2">asking would like to</p>
<p begin="01:23:24.400" end="01:23:27.120" style="s2">follow up hannah</p>
<p begin="01:23:30.000" end="01:23:33.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t think it does answer it but i</p>
<p begin="01:23:32.880" end="01:23:37.440" style="s2">think</p>
<p begin="01:23:33.520" end="01:23:38.320" style="s2">you&#39;ve stated why and some methods for</p>
<p begin="01:23:37.440" end="01:23:43.600" style="s2">moving forwards</p>
<p begin="01:23:38.320" end="01:23:43.600" style="s2">anyways and i am satisfied by that</p>
<p begin="01:23:46.840" end="01:23:51.600" style="s2">fairness</p>
<p begin="01:23:48.000" end="01:23:52.639" style="s2">and i believe that is uh the time here</p>
<p begin="01:23:51.600" end="01:23:55.600" style="s2">right peter</p>
<p begin="01:23:52.639" end="01:23:57.040" style="s2">yep uh we&#39;re gonna land the plane now uh</p>
<p begin="01:23:55.600" end="01:24:00.080" style="s2">any any closing thoughts</p>
<p begin="01:23:57.040" end="01:24:01.920" style="s2">uh for us daniel i&#39;m also curious uh</p>
<p begin="01:24:00.080" end="01:24:03.840" style="s2">maybe something you can mention later</p>
<p begin="01:24:01.920" end="01:24:05.280" style="s2">but anything you&#39;re interested about</p>
<p begin="01:24:03.840" end="01:24:08.320" style="s2">this community in particular</p>
<p begin="01:24:05.280" end="01:24:10.159" style="s2">these sessions um that might inspire</p>
<p begin="01:24:08.320" end="01:24:16.560" style="s2">some questions for us</p>
<p begin="01:24:10.159" end="01:24:18.639" style="s2">for next time</p>
<p begin="01:24:16.560" end="01:24:20.080" style="s2">yeah i think i&#39;m particularly interested</p>
<p begin="01:24:18.639" end="01:24:24.400" style="s2">in</p>
<p begin="01:24:20.080" end="01:24:25.840" style="s2">the people who are called to reimagine</p>
<p begin="01:24:24.400" end="01:24:27.600" style="s2">the future whether it&#39;s the future of</p>
<p begin="01:24:25.840" end="01:24:30.639" style="s2">homelessness or agriculture</p>
<p begin="01:24:27.600" end="01:24:33.040" style="s2">or economics or law or whatever it is or</p>
<p begin="01:24:30.639" end="01:24:34.320" style="s2">all of them together you know game b</p>
<p begin="01:24:33.040" end="01:24:36.639" style="s2">some kind of</p>
<p begin="01:24:34.320" end="01:24:38.320" style="s2">new world the people who really care</p>
<p begin="01:24:36.639" end="01:24:39.199" style="s2">about that and want to think about it</p>
<p begin="01:24:38.320" end="01:24:41.280" style="s2">and work on it</p>
<p begin="01:24:39.199" end="01:24:42.800" style="s2">and find community of other people who</p>
<p begin="01:24:41.280" end="01:24:45.440" style="s2">do</p>
<p begin="01:24:42.800" end="01:24:47.440" style="s2">and who recognize that not just their</p>
<p begin="01:24:45.440" end="01:24:48.880" style="s2">cognitive learning but their development</p>
<p begin="01:24:47.440" end="01:24:49.199" style="s2">in other ways is part of that because</p>
<p begin="01:24:48.880" end="01:24:50.960" style="s2">they</p>
<p begin="01:24:49.199" end="01:24:53.280" style="s2">they want to already become citizens of</p>
<p begin="01:24:50.960" end="01:24:55.600" style="s2">that world right they want to notice the</p>
<p begin="01:24:53.280" end="01:24:56.480" style="s2">the non-game b resonant things in</p>
<p begin="01:24:55.600" end="01:24:58.080" style="s2">themselves</p>
<p begin="01:24:56.480" end="01:25:00.639" style="s2">having been conditioned in this world</p>
<p begin="01:24:58.080" end="01:25:02.480" style="s2">and work to like become inhabitants of</p>
<p begin="01:25:00.639" end="01:25:04.400" style="s2">that world so they can sense it better</p>
<p begin="01:25:02.480" end="01:25:08.080" style="s2">and help bring it about</p>
<p begin="01:25:04.400" end="01:25:10.800" style="s2">um i think that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:25:08.080" end="01:25:13.600" style="s2">that&#39;s a necessary and particularly</p>
<p begin="01:25:10.800" end="01:25:15.440" style="s2">beautiful intersection</p>
<p begin="01:25:13.600" end="01:25:17.040" style="s2">and so what i was interested in here is</p>
<p begin="01:25:15.440" end="01:25:18.560" style="s2">people who are considering the big</p>
<p begin="01:25:17.040" end="01:25:20.880" style="s2">picture and considering some of the</p>
<p begin="01:25:18.560" end="01:25:23.840" style="s2">difficulties of how do we transition</p>
<p begin="01:25:20.880" end="01:25:27.840" style="s2">with multipolar traps and with whatever</p>
<p begin="01:25:23.840" end="01:25:30.000" style="s2">and then what happens in me that</p>
<p begin="01:25:27.840" end="01:25:31.600" style="s2">decreases my capacity to be effective</p>
<p begin="01:25:30.000" end="01:25:32.880" style="s2">with that or that could increase my</p>
<p begin="01:25:31.600" end="01:25:35.360" style="s2">capacity</p>
<p begin="01:25:32.880" end="01:25:38.080" style="s2">the intersection of the like what do i</p>
<p begin="01:25:35.360" end="01:25:42.159" style="s2">work on in myself</p>
<p begin="01:25:38.080" end="01:25:43.920" style="s2">to increase my effectiveness in my</p>
<p begin="01:25:42.159" end="01:25:45.440" style="s2">being of service to this larger thing</p>
