<p begin="00:03:42.890" end="00:03:49.069" style="s2">also a biased participant in this</p>

<p begin="00:03:49.069" end="00:03:57.350" style="s2">that&#39;s all over okay so I thought we</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.790" end="00:03:59.330" style="s2">would start things off with this I</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.350" end="00:04:02.060" style="s2">assume that many in the audience are</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.330" end="00:04:04.340" style="s2">curious but relatively unfamiliar with</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.060" end="00:04:06.319" style="s2">you or have heard a lot about you</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.340" end="00:04:08.510" style="s2">without ever reading or listening to you</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.319" end="00:04:10.519" style="s2">so I thought we might start with you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.510" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">introducing yourself to the audience and</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.519" end="00:04:14.630" style="s2">maybe telling them some of the main</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:25.210" style="s2">things that you think they might be</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.630" end="00:04:30.350" style="s2">interested in knowing about you well I</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:37.880" style="s2">guess the most relevant detail is that I</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.350" end="00:04:40.990" style="s2">spent about 15 years writing this and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.880" end="00:04:45.400" style="s2">worked on it about three hours a day</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.990" end="00:04:48.470" style="s2">every day during that period of time and</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.400" end="00:04:51.380" style="s2">at at the same time I was finishing off</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.470" end="00:04:54.560" style="s2">my doctorate and I started lecturing at</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.380" end="00:04:57.400" style="s2">Harvard but I was doing that continually</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.560" end="00:05:00.020" style="s2">and thinking about it continually and</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.400" end="00:05:01.570" style="s2">reading the material that I needed to</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.020" end="00:05:05.810" style="s2">read in order to write the book</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.570" end="00:05:08.900" style="s2">continually as well and I didn&#39;t realize</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.810" end="00:05:13.010" style="s2">until more recently that what I was</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.900" end="00:05:17.539" style="s2">doing was at the heart of the postmodern</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.010" end="00:05:20.000" style="s2">conundrum I would say I was very much</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.539" end="00:05:22.970" style="s2">obsessed by the events of the Cold War</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.000" end="00:05:24.380" style="s2">for reasons I don&#39;t exactly understand I</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.970" end="00:05:26.750" style="s2">had a lot of dreams about nuclear</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.380" end="00:05:28.670" style="s2">annihilation for years on end</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.750" end="00:05:31.190" style="s2">I mean it wasn&#39;t that uncommon to be</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.670" end="00:05:33.050" style="s2">obsessed by that when I grew up I mean</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.190" end="00:05:35.930" style="s2">because it was a preoccupation of</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.050" end="00:05:38.390" style="s2">everyone who was my age I suppose there</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.930" end="00:05:41.510" style="s2">there were lots of years probably</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.390" end="00:05:44.330" style="s2">between 1962 I would say probably in</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.510" end="00:05:46.820" style="s2">1985 where people were pretty convinced</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.330" end="00:05:50.710" style="s2">that the probability of a nuclear war</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.820" end="00:05:55.790" style="s2">was high much higher now than people</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.710" end="00:05:58.100" style="s2">considered now and I was curious about</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.790" end="00:05:59.540" style="s2">this I was curious about why everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.100" end="00:06:01.220" style="s2">wasn&#39;t obsessed about this all the time</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.540" end="00:06:04.700" style="s2">first of all because it seemed like the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.220" end="00:06:07.270" style="s2">fundamental issue that two armed camps</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.700" end="00:06:10.630" style="s2">were pointing something in excess of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.270" end="00:06:13.310" style="s2">25,000 hydrogen bombs each at each other</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.630" end="00:06:14.870" style="s2">I couldn&#39;t understand how anybody could</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.310" end="00:06:20.030" style="s2">concentrate on anything other than that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.870" end="00:06:26.680" style="s2">since it seems so utterly insane and I</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.030" end="00:06:29.660" style="s2">was curious what was going on exactly</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.680" end="00:06:31.460" style="s2">was this one leaked the explanation was</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.660" end="00:06:32.900" style="s2">that there&#39;s a very large number of ways</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.460" end="00:06:34.790" style="s2">that human beings could organize</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.900" end="00:06:36.050" style="s2">themselves in society like a large</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.790" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">number of games that we could</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.050" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">hypothetically play and they&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:42.350" style="s2">equally arbitrary in an in an equally</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:44.270" style="s2">arbitrary universe and that the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.350" end="00:06:46.880" style="s2">Communists had decided to play one kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.270" end="00:06:49.700" style="s2">of game and the West and the Western</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.880" end="00:06:51.260" style="s2">free-market Democratic types have had</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.700" end="00:06:54.620" style="s2">decided to play another game and it was</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.260" end="00:06:56.450" style="s2">all arbitrary in some sense and so</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.620" end="00:06:58.970" style="s2">that&#39;s what I was trying to figure out</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.450" end="00:07:01.940" style="s2">was what the hell was going on with this</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.970" end="00:07:05.290" style="s2">conflict and was it merely a battle</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.940" end="00:07:07.460" style="s2">between two hypothetically equally valid</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.290" end="00:07:10.210" style="s2">interpretations of the world drawn from</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.460" end="00:07:12.410" style="s2">a set of extraordinary large potential</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.210" end="00:07:14.690" style="s2">interpretations which I think would be</p>

<p begin="00:08:44.699" end="00:08:50.610" style="s2">reading constantly during this time and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.290" end="00:08:55.230" style="s2">I realized some things that I think are</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.230" end="00:08:59.040" style="s2">weren&#39;t and not just a little bit wrong</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.820" end="00:09:00.630" style="s2">and not wrong in some arbitrary way they</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.040" end="00:09:03.540" style="s2">were playing a game that human beings</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.630" end="00:09:06.240" style="s2">cannot play without descending into a</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.540" end="00:09:07.769" style="s2">murderous catastrophe and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.240" end="00:09:09.449" style="s2">something about what we&#39;ve done in the</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.769" end="00:09:12.269" style="s2">West that&#39;s correct</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.449" end="00:09:16.019" style="s2">and I it&#39;s hearts complicated because</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.269" end="00:09:17.310" style="s2">our our cognitive structures that&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:09:17.310" end="00:09:21.630" style="s2">socio-political arrangements they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.350" end="00:09:24.149" style="s2">actually they actually parallel one</p>

<p begin="00:09:24.149" end="00:09:31.290" style="s2">grounded in a you know strange set of</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.470" end="00:09:33.690" style="s2">axioms and the axioms aren&#39;t rational</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.290" end="00:09:37.140" style="s2">precisely it&#39;s more like their narrative</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.690" end="00:09:38.940" style="s2">their narrative axioms their stories and</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.140" end="00:09:40.709" style="s2">the story of the West is that the</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.940" end="00:09:43.050" style="s2">individual is sovereign over the group</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.709" end="00:09:46.350" style="s2">and that that&#39;s the solution to</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.050" end="00:09:48.829" style="s2">tribalism and I think that&#39;s the correct</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.350" end="00:09:51.300" style="s2">solution now what that means</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.829" end="00:09:52.949" style="s2">metaphysically because it&#39;s it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.300" end="00:09:54.120" style="s2">embedded in our religious doctrines</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.949" end="00:09:55.950" style="s2">right because</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.120" end="00:09:58.110" style="s2">especially in Christianity although not</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.950" end="00:10:00.029" style="s2">exclusively to Christianity the</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.110" end="00:10:02.370" style="s2">individual is sovereign the suffering</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.029" end="00:10:04.080" style="s2">individual is sovereign and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.370" end="00:10:06.450" style="s2">something about that that&#39;s true at</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.080" end="00:10:08.330" style="s2">least psychologically and I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.450" end="00:10:10.529" style="s2">what that might mean metaphysically</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.330" end="00:10:12.540" style="s2">because who the hell knows what anything</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.529" end="00:10:15.210" style="s2">means metaphysically right I mean your</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.540" end="00:10:18.690" style="s2">your knowledge runs out at some point</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.210" end="00:10:20.970" style="s2">anyways I worked all these ideas out and</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.690" end="00:10:22.650" style="s2">then I taught for a long time courses</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.970" end="00:10:25.380" style="s2">that were based on the ideas and the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.650" end="00:10:26.850" style="s2">courses were very impactful I would say</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.380" end="00:10:29.339" style="s2">they had the same impact on the people</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.850" end="00:10:33.660" style="s2">that I was teaching as walking through</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.339" end="00:10:36.650" style="s2">the material had on me and well it was</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.660" end="00:10:40.820" style="s2">out of that that all of this political</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.650" end="00:10:44.010" style="s2">controversy arose I mean I was never</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.820" end="00:10:45.660" style="s2">focused on political controversy even</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.010" end="00:10:47.490" style="s2">though I&#39;m interested in politics and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.660" end="00:10:50.070" style="s2">thought it many points in my life about</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.490" end="00:10:52.529" style="s2">a political career I always put it aside</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.070" end="00:10:57.810" style="s2">for a psychological and philosophical</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.529" end="00:11:00.330" style="s2">career I would say and but but things</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.810" end="00:11:02.640" style="s2">started to shift badly in Canada over</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.330" end="00:11:06.959" style="s2">the last five years and our government</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.640" end="00:11:08.730" style="s2">dared to implement legislation that</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.959" end="00:11:10.290" style="s2">compelled speech and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.730" end="00:11:12.089" style="s2">that I had learned when I was doing all</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.290" end="00:11:15.180" style="s2">this background investigation was that</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.089" end="00:11:17.730" style="s2">there isn&#39;t a higher value than free</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.180" end="00:11:18.990" style="s2">speech it isn&#39;t free speech it&#39;s not the</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.730" end="00:11:20.940" style="s2">right way of thinking about it because</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.990" end="00:11:22.140" style="s2">it&#39;s free thought and even that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.940" end="00:11:24.959" style="s2">the right way of thinking about it</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.140" end="00:11:27.540" style="s2">because thought is the precursor to</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.959" end="00:11:30.779" style="s2">action and life so there&#39;s no difference</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.540" end="00:11:33.589" style="s2">between free speech and free life and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.779" end="00:11:37.200" style="s2">was just not willing to put up with</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.589" end="00:11:39.959" style="s2">restrictions on my free life and so I</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.200" end="00:11:42.150" style="s2">made some videos pointing out the</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.959" end="00:11:43.400" style="s2">pathology of this doctrine and the fact</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.150" end="00:11:46.860" style="s2">that the government had radically</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.400" end="00:11:50.550" style="s2">overreached its its appropriate limits</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.860" end="00:11:52.500" style="s2">and well then you know well and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.550" end="00:11:56.370" style="s2">you don&#39;t know but I&#39;ve been enveloped</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.500" end="00:11:58.920" style="s2">in continual scandal since for 18 months</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.370" end="00:12:01.890" style="s2">as a consequence which to me as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.920" end="00:12:04.530" style="s2">clinician indicates that I got my damn</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.890" end="00:12:08.070" style="s2">diagnosis right right it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.530" end="00:12:10.740" style="s2">pronouns it&#39;s about something</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.070" end="00:12:12.780" style="s2">deeper than that and I stand by that I</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.740" end="00:12:14.010" style="s2">believe that it&#39;s the case and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.780" end="00:12:19.410" style="s2">think that we would all be here tonight</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.010" end="00:12:23.400" style="s2">if that wasn&#39;t the situation so so I</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.410" end="00:12:26.460" style="s2">wanted my first or my next question to</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.400" end="00:12:30.210" style="s2">be about Lafayette and so I thought I</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.460" end="00:12:32.190" style="s2">would read a couple of Facebook posts</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.210" end="00:12:34.500" style="s2">that certain students who are critical</p>

<p begin="00:12:34.500" end="00:12:40.230" style="s2">and just ask you to respond to them okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.490" end="00:12:42.270" style="s2">so this is a student writing Lafayette</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.230" end="00:12:43.710" style="s2">College I&#39;m utterly disappointed that</p>

<p begin="00:16:30.960" end="00:16:34.380" style="s2">learned this mostly from sold from</p>

<p begin="00:16:46.440" end="00:16:50.670" style="s2">and noted very clearly that it was like</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.110" end="00:16:52.079" style="s2">there was a crank in some sense on the</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.670" end="00:16:54.300" style="s2">side of their head and you could just</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.079" end="00:16:57.959" style="s2">crank the crank and out would come the</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.300" end="00:17:00.089" style="s2">ideological dogma and it&#39;s all entirely</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.959" end="00:17:01.740" style="s2">predictable and people who are in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.089" end="00:17:03.930" style="s2">situation like that don&#39;t understand</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.740" end="00:17:06.150" style="s2">that they&#39;re possessed by an idea rights</p>

<p begin="00:17:14.760" end="00:17:18.270" style="s2">then there&#39;s a deeper issue - and this</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:20.760" style="s2">is one that I think has bedeviled me</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.270" end="00:17:24.959" style="s2">ever since I made my initial videos</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.760" end="00:17:27.419" style="s2">which is the rally it&#39;s impossible for</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.959" end="00:17:29.429" style="s2">those on the radical left to admit that</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.419" end="00:17:32.070" style="s2">anyone who opposes what they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.429" end="00:17:33.540" style="s2">might be reasonable because what that</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.070" end="00:17:35.280" style="s2">would mean would be that you could be</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.540" end="00:17:37.169" style="s2">reasonable and opposed the radical left</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.280" end="00:17:39.330" style="s2">and that would imply that what the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.169" end="00:17:41.790" style="s2">radical left was doing wasn&#39;t reasonable</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.330" end="00:17:43.470" style="s2">and so instead of dealing with the fact</p>
<p begin="00:17:41.790" end="00:17:47.510" style="s2">that I actually happened to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.470" end="00:17:50.760" style="s2">reasonable the attempt is to assume that</p>

<p begin="00:17:54.140" end="00:17:58.380" style="s2">there&#39;s lots of space between the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.640" end="00:18:01.020" style="s2">radical left and the radical right</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.380" end="00:18:02.970" style="s2">there&#39;s the moderate reasonable left for</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.020" end="00:18:04.740" style="s2">example and you and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.970" end="00:18:06.330" style="s2">center and then there&#39;s the moderate</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.740" end="00:18:07.980" style="s2">reasonable right and then there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.330" end="00:18:10.020" style="s2">far right and then there&#39;s the extreme</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.980" end="00:18:11.910" style="s2">right all of that exists in opposition</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.020" end="00:18:13.679" style="s2">to the radical left but it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.910" end="00:18:16.020" style="s2">convenient for the radicals on the left</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.679" end="00:18:19.980" style="s2">to say oh well you don&#39;t buy our</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.020" end="00:18:22.049" style="s2">doctrine and and and then to immediately</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.980" end="00:18:24.570" style="s2">make the presupposition that you must be</p>
<p begin="00:18:22.049" end="00:18:27.240" style="s2">the most Highness example of that entire</p>

<p begin="00:18:30.270" end="00:18:39.150" style="s2">not a viable stance and so but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.370" end="00:18:41.640" style="s2">convenient and it it it it&#39;s a bad thing</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.970" end="00:19:12.290" style="s2">because you can&#39;t lay it at the feet of</p>

<p begin="00:19:17.010" end="00:19:20.430" style="s2">because inequality is a problem you need</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.920" end="00:19:38.760" style="s2">speaks for hierarchy and the left speaks</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.080" end="00:19:41.210" style="s2">on behalf of those who are oppressed by</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.210" end="00:19:48.450" style="s2">the radical left okay we know from 20th</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.140" end="00:19:50.400" style="s2">century history that things can go too</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.450" end="00:19:52.410" style="s2">far on the right no one disputes that</p>

<p begin="00:20:00.540" end="00:20:04.380" style="s2">then we had 120 million people died in</p>

<p begin="00:20:04.380" end="00:20:08.310" style="s2">went too far on the left</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.700" end="00:20:10.500" style="s2">we had god only knows how many people</p>

<p begin="00:20:19.680" end="00:20:25.050" style="s2">so that&#39;s the consequence all right so</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.740" end="00:20:26.670" style="s2">now in the aftermath of world war two</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.050" end="00:20:28.650" style="s2">let&#39;s say we&#39;ve come to some sort of</p>
<p begin="00:20:26.670" end="00:20:30.180" style="s2">sociological agreement I would say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.650" end="00:20:32.460" style="s2">you can identify the radical right</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.180" end="00:20:35.100" style="s2">wingers when people make claims of</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.460" end="00:20:36.480" style="s2">racial superiority you put them in a box</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.100" end="00:20:39.150" style="s2">and you say well you&#39;re outside of</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.480" end="00:20:40.710" style="s2">acceptable political discourse and so</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.150" end="00:20:42.330" style="s2">you saw that with will William F Buckley</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.710" end="00:20:44.310" style="s2">in the 60s when he started his</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.330" end="00:20:45.870" style="s2">conservative review he dissociated</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.310" end="00:20:47.670" style="s2">himself from the David Duke types and</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.870" end="00:20:49.320" style="s2">you saw it more recently with people for</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.670" end="00:20:50.670" style="s2">example like ben shapiro who immediately</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.320" end="00:20:53.610" style="s2">distanced himself from the</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.670" end="00:20:55.380" style="s2">Charlottesville types okay so now we we</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.610" end="00:20:57.540" style="s2">kind of have a sense of where you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.380" end="00:21:00.060" style="s2">crossed the damn line in your</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.540" end="00:21:02.070" style="s2">ethno-nationalism right as soon as you</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.060" end="00:21:02.520" style="s2">move into the racial superiority domain</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.070" end="00:21:05.670" style="s2">at the</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.520" end="00:21:07.500" style="s2">superiority domain it&#39;s like no you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.670" end="00:21:09.990" style="s2">got to be dangerous all right</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.500" end="00:21:14.480" style="s2">here&#39;s a question where the hell do you</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.990" end="00:21:17.610" style="s2">cross the line on the left exactly well</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.480" end="00:21:19.080" style="s2">the answer is who knows well that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.610" end="00:21:21.960" style="s2">a very good answer I would say it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.080" end="00:21:24.600" style="s2">incumbent it&#39;s incumbent on people in</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.960" end="00:21:28.920" style="s2">the center and in the moderate left to</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.600" end="00:21:30.960" style="s2">say look things can go too far on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.920" end="00:21:33.540" style="s2">left and here&#39;s how we know that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.960" end="00:21:35.970" style="s2">happened and that hasn&#39;t happened at all</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.540" end="00:21:38.040" style="s2">now I think there&#39;s a reason for that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:35.970" end="00:21:40.440" style="s2">think there&#39;s a technical reason as well</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.040" end="00:21:42.630" style="s2">as a motivational reason too technical</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.440" end="00:21:45.180" style="s2">reasons it&#39;s harder for people on the</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.630" end="00:21:47.010" style="s2">left to draw boundaries because people</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.180" end="00:21:49.830" style="s2">on the left aren&#39;t boundary drawing</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.010" end="00:21:51.540" style="s2">types their boundary dissolving types</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.830" end="00:21:53.790" style="s2">temper mentally speaking so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.540" end="00:21:55.170" style="s2">problem the second problem is is it</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.790" end="00:21:57.540" style="s2">doesn&#39;t look to me like there is a</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.170" end="00:21:59.820" style="s2">smoking pistol on the Left that&#39;s as</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.540" end="00:22:02.280" style="s2">obvious as racial superiority doctrines</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.820" end="00:22:03.630" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like there in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.280" end="00:22:06.600" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of push for this</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.630" end="00:22:09.450" style="s2">triumvirate of radical ideas diversity</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.600" end="00:22:11.220" style="s2">inclusivity and equity which diversity</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.450" end="00:22:13.170" style="s2">it&#39;s like well who&#39;s against that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.220" end="00:22:15.390" style="s2">like being against poverty inclusivity</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.170" end="00:22:19.350" style="s2">well yes of course we want people</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.390" end="00:22:21.240" style="s2">included equity that&#39;s a more bitter</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.350" end="00:22:23.070" style="s2">pill to swallow because that&#39;s equality</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.240" end="00:22:24.150" style="s2">of outcome and for me that&#39;s a marker</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.070" end="00:22:27.450" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.150" end="00:22:29.820" style="s2">equality of outcome you&#39;ve gone too far</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.450" end="00:22:32.640" style="s2">and if you&#39;re talking about diversity</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.820" end="00:22:35.400" style="s2">inclusivity and equality of outcome</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.640" end="00:22:37.350" style="s2">equity then you&#39;ve gone too far and you</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.400" end="00:22:40.140" style="s2">might disagree you might disagree that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.350" end="00:22:43.820" style="s2">fine disagree if that isn&#39;t the marker</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.140" end="00:22:46.770" style="s2">for going too far then what&#39;s the marker</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.820" end="00:22:49.980" style="s2">because obviously you can go too far and</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.770" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">obviously that&#39;s not good and to close</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.980" end="00:22:54.420" style="s2">on that I would also say to the people</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:57.660" style="s2">on the moderate left if you want your</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.420" end="00:23:00.420" style="s2">doctrines to have purchase and to</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.660" end="00:23:02.580" style="s2">continue to speak for the for those who</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.420" end="00:23:05.310" style="s2">stack up at the bottom of inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.580" end="00:23:07.410" style="s2">hierarchies then you owe it to yourself</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.310" end="00:23:09.330" style="s2">to dissociate yourself from the</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.410" end="00:23:12.300" style="s2">dangerous radicals because otherwise</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.330" end="00:23:13.920" style="s2">they invalidate your ideas and that</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.300" end="00:23:15.450" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be you&#39;d think the</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.920" end="00:23:16.320" style="s2">Democrats might have learned that in the</p>

<p begin="00:23:16.320" end="00:23:23.700" style="s2">but they haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t learned</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.299" end="00:23:29.639" style="s2">that so well so that&#39;s my spiel about</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.700" end="00:23:31.649" style="s2">those comments I guess ok so you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.639" end="00:23:33.389" style="s2">changed the lives of many young people</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.649" end="00:23:36.000" style="s2">and adults in this country in the</p>

<p begin="00:23:45.419" end="00:23:50.370" style="s2">as we&#39;ve just seen because of your power</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.059" end="00:23:52.980" style="s2">and also your frontal attack on a lot of</p>

<p begin="00:23:52.980" end="00:23:57.330" style="s2">caricature you then there are these</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.500" end="00:23:59.610" style="s2">other figures like Jonathan Hite and</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.330" end="00:24:01.830" style="s2">Robbie George they have a lot in common</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.610" end="00:24:03.779" style="s2">with you they are respected academics</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.830" end="00:24:06.389" style="s2">they are at least relatively well known</p>

<p begin="00:24:28.799" end="00:24:32.669" style="s2">agree with much of what you say but</p>

<p begin="00:24:38.840" end="00:24:44.159" style="s2">people approach so my questions are</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.879" end="00:24:46.860" style="s2">first do you agree with this dichotomy</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.159" end="00:24:51.149" style="s2">second did you consciously choose one</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.860" end="00:24:54.090" style="s2">path over the other and if so why well I</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.149" end="00:24:55.889" style="s2">mean with height for example was more</p>
<p begin="00:24:54.090" end="00:24:57.960" style="s2">power to him as far as I&#39;m concerned you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.889" end="00:25:02.070" style="s2">know he has a different temperament than</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.960" end="00:25:04.740" style="s2">me he&#39;s he&#39;s more introverted he&#39;s less</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.070" end="00:25:08.730" style="s2">volatile I would say he&#39;s probably more</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.740" end="00:25:10.320" style="s2">agreeable or more polite anyways and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.730" end="00:25:11.850" style="s2">think that what he&#39;s doing is extremely</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.320" end="00:25:14.370" style="s2">effective especially from the</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.850" end="00:25:17.000" style="s2">perspective of very carefully</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.370" end="00:25:23.190" style="s2">documenting the empirical facts about</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.000" end="00:25:25.139" style="s2">the ideological what the ideological a</p>

<p begin="00:25:25.139" end="00:25:31.009" style="s2">campuses which is something that needs</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.639" end="00:25:33.690" style="s2">to be explored on empirical ground so</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.009" end="00:25:34.860" style="s2">so like I said more power to him and</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.690" end="00:25:40.039" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing wrong with being</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.860" end="00:25:42.840" style="s2">reasonable I guess and then you asked</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.039" end="00:25:50.159" style="s2">well is that the right pathway for me</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.840" end="00:25:51.899" style="s2">it&#39;s like well apparently not what</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.159" end="00:25:56.580" style="s2">happened when I made my initial videos</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.899" end="00:25:58.769" style="s2">was that you know I had I had spoke I</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.580" end="00:26:01.409" style="s2">talked to people a lot I&#39;ve worked with</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.769" end="00:26:03.269" style="s2">people a lot about negotiation it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.409" end="00:26:04.799" style="s2">of the things that I specialized in I</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.269" end="00:26:06.149" style="s2">would say in my clinical and consulting</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.799" end="00:26:08.309" style="s2">practice was teaching people how to</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.149" end="00:26:09.899" style="s2">negotiate and I can tell you some things</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.309" end="00:26:12.360" style="s2">about negotiating that you might find</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.899" end="00:26:14.190" style="s2">interesting and useful the first is you</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.360" end="00:26:15.840" style="s2">can&#39;t negotiate from a position of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.190" end="00:26:17.549" style="s2">weakness so all of you who are going to</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.840" end="00:26:19.529" style="s2">be developing your careers in the future</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.549" end="00:26:21.690" style="s2">you need to understand that if you want</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.529" end="00:26:23.940" style="s2">to push your career forward well first</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.690" end="00:26:26.669" style="s2">of all that you do in fact have to push</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.940" end="00:26:30.899" style="s2">it forward because if you&#39;re competent</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.669" end="00:26:32.850" style="s2">and silent you will be ignored and and</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.899" end="00:26:34.500" style="s2">you know that&#39;s rough because you might</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.850" end="00:26:36.299" style="s2">think well people should reward you</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.500" end="00:26:38.129" style="s2">because you&#39;re confident and yes of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.299" end="00:26:40.049" style="s2">course they should but if you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.090" end="00:26:58.500" style="s2">strategic when you negotiate for a new</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.279" end="00:27:01.169" style="s2">position or for a new salary you have to</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.500" end="00:27:03.960" style="s2">be able to say if you don&#39;t give me what</p>

<p begin="00:27:38.970" end="00:27:43.860" style="s2">order let&#39;s say what you need to do that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.850" end="00:27:46.170" style="s2">with them is to tell them a story</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.860" end="00:27:49.799" style="s2">they can tell to their boss to make you</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.170" end="00:27:51.000" style="s2">not a problem and one good story is look</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.799" end="00:27:52.320" style="s2">we really need this person because</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.000" end="00:27:54.330" style="s2">they&#39;re hyper competent and they have a</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.320" end="00:27:56.520" style="s2">better offer it&#39;s like well then you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.330" end="00:27:59.790" style="s2">gonna win the negotiation but if you go</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.520" end="00:28:03.780" style="s2">in there with no power well you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.790" end="00:28:04.679" style="s2">lose obviously so the first thing that</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.780" end="00:28:06.450" style="s2">you need to know if you&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.679" end="00:28:10.590" style="s2">negotiate is that you have to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.450" end="00:28:13.559" style="s2">say no and what no means is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.590" end="00:28:17.190" style="s2">not going to do it and when I made the</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.559" end="00:28:19.650" style="s2">videos about Bill c16 I thought it</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.190" end="00:28:21.960" style="s2">through and I thought there&#39;s no damn</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.650" end="00:28:23.880" style="s2">way I&#39;m following this law I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.960" end="00:28:25.679" style="s2">what happens and I didn&#39;t say that</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.880" end="00:28:28.650" style="s2">lightly I thought it through I thought</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.679" end="00:28:30.780" style="s2">okay well let&#39;s assume the worst case</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.650" end="00:28:32.490" style="s2">scenario in the worst case scenario</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.780" end="00:28:34.169" style="s2">would be that a student would report me</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.490" end="00:28:35.669" style="s2">to the Ontario Human Rights Commission</p>
<p begin="00:28:34.169" end="00:28:37.679" style="s2">and then they would do an investigation</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.669" end="00:28:39.299" style="s2">and they would find me guilty because</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.679" end="00:28:42.450" style="s2">the Ontario Human Rights Commission</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.299" end="00:28:45.000" style="s2">finds 99% of the people brought to it</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.450" end="00:28:47.460" style="s2">guilty because that&#39;s what totalitarians</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.000" end="00:28:49.350" style="s2">do and then I would refuse to pay the</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.460" end="00:28:51.030" style="s2">fine or cooperate with whatever the</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.350" end="00:28:52.770" style="s2">reeducation they would put me through</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.030" end="00:28:54.360" style="s2">would be and then that would move to</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.770" end="00:28:56.370" style="s2">civil court and then I would be fine for</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.360" end="00:28:58.410" style="s2">contempt and then it would you know then</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.370" end="00:29:00.540" style="s2">the whole legal capacity would unfold</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.410" end="00:29:03.120" style="s2">and I thought well I could either do</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.540" end="00:29:05.850" style="s2">that or I could allow the government to</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.120" end="00:29:09.090" style="s2">regulate my speech it&#39;s like nope that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.850" end="00:29:11.429" style="s2">not happening so you might think about</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.090" end="00:29:14.190" style="s2">that as confrontational and it is</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.429" end="00:29:17.520" style="s2">confrontational it&#39;s like there isn&#39;t a</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.190" end="00:29:20.010" style="s2">goddamn thing that can be done to me to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.520" end="00:29:23.160" style="s2">make me allow the government to compel</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.010" end="00:29:25.049" style="s2">my speech that&#39;s not happening and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.160" end="00:29:29.390" style="s2">reason for that I believe the reason for</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.049" end="00:29:33.750" style="s2">that is because I spent decades studying</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.390" end="00:29:36.090" style="s2">totalitarianism it&#39;s not good and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.750" end="00:29:38.549" style="s2">way the totalitarian states develop is</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.090" end="00:29:41.490" style="s2">that people give up their right to be</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.549" end="00:29:44.340" style="s2">their right to to exist with their own</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.490" end="00:29:46.770" style="s2">thoughts they lie they that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.340" end="00:29:50.160" style="s2">happens is that individuals the</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.770" end="00:29:52.470" style="s2">individual sacrifice their own souls to</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.160" end="00:29:55.590" style="s2">the dictates of the state and then</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.470" end="00:29:57.600" style="s2">everything goes badly sideways it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.590" end="00:30:00.179" style="s2">and you think well how much evidence for</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.600" end="00:30:02.370" style="s2">that do we need you know you&#39;re looking</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.179" end="00:30:05.610" style="s2">at a quarter of a billion deaths</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.370" end="00:30:07.410" style="s2">it&#39;s like isn&#39;t that enough well the</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.610" end="00:30:09.480" style="s2">people that I read who were profound</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.410" end="00:30:11.130" style="s2">Viktor Frankl is a good example for</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.480" end="00:30:12.510" style="s2">beginners if you want to read about this</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.130" end="00:30:15.570" style="s2">sort of thing he wrote a book called</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.510" end="00:30:18.240" style="s2">man&#39;s search for meaning and Frankel and</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.570" end="00:30:20.070" style="s2">also Solzhenitsyn and a variety of other</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.240" end="00:30:23.309" style="s2">commentators as well who really looked</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.070" end="00:30:25.380" style="s2">into what happened in in in both in Nazi</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.309" end="00:30:28.440" style="s2">Germany and and in the in the communist</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.380" end="00:30:31.260" style="s2">States their conclusion was universal is</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.440" end="00:30:33.179" style="s2">that the lies of this state the lies and</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.260" end="00:30:36.030" style="s2">tyranny of the state are aided and</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.179" end="00:30:40.559" style="s2">abetted by the moral sacrifice of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.030" end="00:30:41.970" style="s2">individual it&#39;s not top-down the Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.559" end="00:30:44.429" style="s2">are telling you what to do and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.970" end="00:30:48.630" style="s2">all innocent and obeying that&#39;s not how</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.429" end="00:30:53.580" style="s2">it works is you you falsify your your</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.630" end="00:30:55.950" style="s2">being bit by bit and you end up where</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.580" end="00:30:56.730" style="s2">you don&#39;t want to be and that&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.950" end="00:30:58.440" style="s2">idea</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.730" end="00:31:02.070" style="s2">and if you&#39;re interested in that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.440" end="00:31:03.450" style="s2">a great book but called ordinary man you</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.070" end="00:31:05.429" style="s2">read that and you won&#39;t be the same</p>
<p begin="00:31:03.450" end="00:31:07.860" style="s2">person afterwards so I would beware of</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.429" end="00:31:09.539" style="s2">reading it but it&#39;s a story about these</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.860" end="00:31:11.100" style="s2">policemen in Germany so they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.539" end="00:31:13.610" style="s2">middle-aged guys you know and they</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.100" end="00:31:15.809" style="s2">they&#39;d been they grew up and were</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.610" end="00:31:17.159" style="s2">socialized before the Nazis came to</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.809" end="00:31:20.610" style="s2">power so they&#39;re just your typical</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.159" end="00:31:22.530" style="s2">middle-class policemen and they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.610" end="00:31:25.980" style="s2">brought into Poland after the Nazis had</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.530" end="00:31:29.270" style="s2">marched through and and charged with</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.980" end="00:31:33.120" style="s2">keeping order in the occupied state and</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.270" end="00:31:35.700" style="s2">they knew their commander knew that it</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.120" end="00:31:38.070" style="s2">was going to be brutal because they were</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.700" end="00:31:39.990" style="s2">in war a war time and they regard the</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.070" end="00:31:41.610" style="s2">Jews for example as enemies and so there</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.990" end="00:31:43.770" style="s2">was going to be a fair bit of rounding</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.610" end="00:31:45.690" style="s2">up with all that with all of what that</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.770" end="00:31:47.280" style="s2">implied and the commander told the</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.690" end="00:31:48.840" style="s2">policemen that they could go home if</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.280" end="00:31:51.210" style="s2">they wanted to that they didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.840" end="00:31:53.850" style="s2">participate in this and then what</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.210" end="00:31:56.270" style="s2">ordinary men does is document document</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.850" end="00:31:58.620" style="s2">their transformation from ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.270" end="00:32:00.600" style="s2">policemen the sort of people that you</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.620" end="00:32:02.220" style="s2">know two guys who were taking naked</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.600" end="00:32:03.659" style="s2">pregnant women out into the middle of</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.220" end="00:32:06.809" style="s2">fields and shooting them in the back of</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.659" end="00:32:10.049" style="s2">the head and it documents one step at a</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.809" end="00:32:11.430" style="s2">time how an ordinary person turns into</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.049" end="00:32:13.440" style="s2">someone like that</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.430" end="00:32:16.230" style="s2">you think well we don&#39;t want that sort</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.440" end="00:32:17.550" style="s2">of thing to happen anymore well then you</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.230" end="00:32:20.430" style="s2">don&#39;t want to be that sort of person</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.550" end="00:32:21.780" style="s2">that&#39;s how it&#39;s fixed and if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.430" end="00:32:25.350" style="s2">gonna be that sort of person then you</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.780" end="00:32:27.420" style="s2">don&#39;t take the first steps because the</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.350" end="00:32:29.370" style="s2">first steps lead you down a pathway that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.420" end="00:32:33.030" style="s2">at least in principle you don&#39;t want to</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.370" end="00:32:34.800" style="s2">go so well I think part of what makes me</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.030" end="00:32:38.610" style="s2">combat himse compared to someone like</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.800" end="00:32:40.830" style="s2">height is that I spent years looking at</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.610" end="00:32:43.200" style="s2">the worst things there are to look at</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.830" end="00:32:44.670" style="s2">and I&#39;ve learned from that and I&#39;ve</p>

<p begin="00:46:37.700" end="00:46:42.200" style="s2">if it&#39;s the ethno nationalist saan the</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.009" end="00:46:44.690" style="s2">right or if it&#39;s the radical leftists on</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.200" end="00:46:46.279" style="s2">the left who knows right I I suspect to</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.690" end="00:46:48.289" style="s2">some degree that&#39;s a matter of</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.279" end="00:46:50.150" style="s2">happenstance I mean that&#39;s what you&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.289" end="00:46:53.539" style="s2">expect if you looked at 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.150" end="00:46:55.819" style="s2">history but I emerged out of the Academy</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.539" end="00:46:58.160" style="s2">and the Academy like there aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.819" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">right-wing people in the Academy not to</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.160" end="00:47:03.650" style="s2">speak of that&#39;s completely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:04.940" style="s2">thoroughly documented and it&#39;s certainly</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.650" end="00:47:07.940" style="s2">not the case in a country like Canada</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.940" end="00:47:10.609" style="s2">there&#39;s no threat whatsoever in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.940" end="00:47:12.140" style="s2">from from the radical right it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.609" end="00:47:13.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know if you rounded up everybody</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.140" end="00:47:16.009" style="s2">who was in the radical right in Canada</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.910" end="00:47:18.140" style="s2">you might be able to scrape up like what</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.009" end="00:47:20.150" style="s2">three or four thousand people if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.140" end="00:47:23.390" style="s2">really like if you really worked at it</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.150" end="00:47:25.130" style="s2">you know so I just don&#39;t see that at</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.390" end="00:47:28.339" style="s2">least in my own country that&#39;s just a</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.130" end="00:47:30.410" style="s2">non-issue it&#39;s it&#39;s a non-starter I mean</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.339" end="00:47:32.150" style="s2">the last time there was any kind of</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.410" end="00:47:34.430" style="s2">radical right-wingers in Canada was</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.150" end="00:47:37.369" style="s2">probably in Quebec in the 1950s and</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.430" end="00:47:38.989" style="s2">maybe from the 1930s to the 1950s but</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.369" end="00:47:42.000" style="s2">it&#39;s never been a political issue what</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.989" end="00:47:43.760" style="s2">about the AFD or the Italian I</p>
<p begin="00:47:42.000" end="00:47:46.590" style="s2">remember the name of the Italian party</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.760" end="00:47:48.480" style="s2">the National Front in France where would</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.590" end="00:47:50.900" style="s2">you put would you oh well I mean you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.480" end="00:47:52.650" style="s2">in Europe it&#39;s more there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.900" end="00:47:54.270" style="s2">polarization I would say but the</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.650" end="00:47:56.940" style="s2">Europeans also have problems that we</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.270" end="00:47:59.280" style="s2">don&#39;t have you know they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.940" end="00:48:01.290" style="s2">been struggling with the consequences of</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.280" end="00:48:03.840" style="s2">non ending violence in the Middle East</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.290" end="00:48:05.640" style="s2">and the wave of refugees that has</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.840" end="00:48:07.950" style="s2">emerged as a consequence of that and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.640" end="00:48:10.500" style="s2">the situation in Europe is different and</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.950" end="00:48:15.870" style="s2">I would say there is more movement and</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.500" end="00:48:20.040" style="s2">activity on the right so but and you</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.870" end="00:48:21.750" style="s2">know I&#39;m not a admirer of identity</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.040" end="00:48:23.460" style="s2">politics well and that&#39;s for the reasons</p>
<p begin="00:48:21.750" end="00:48:28.520" style="s2">I brought up to begin with think that</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.460" end="00:48:32.660" style="s2">you have to decide conceptually</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.520" end="00:48:35.760" style="s2">psychologically familiarly and socially</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.660" end="00:48:37.140" style="s2">what your vision of a human being is and</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.760" end="00:48:39.240" style="s2">if your vision of a human being is</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.140" end="00:48:41.160" style="s2">essentially tribal so that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.240" end="00:48:43.470" style="s2">defined by your collective identity in</p>
<p begin="00:48:41.160" end="00:48:45.210" style="s2">some manner then you&#39;re going to play</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.470" end="00:48:46.830" style="s2">identity politics on the Left you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.210" end="00:48:48.600" style="s2">gonna play identity politics on the</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.830" end="00:48:50.760" style="s2">right it&#39;s like well I think the</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.600" end="00:48:52.920" style="s2">identity politics types on the Left pose</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.760" end="00:48:55.530" style="s2">a bigger threat in my country it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:48:52.920" end="00:48:57.540" style="s2">so obvious in your country because you</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.530" end="00:48:59.910" style="s2">guys you&#39;re your political landscape is</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.540" end="00:49:01.860" style="s2">more balanced I would say than ours</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.910" end="00:49:04.710" style="s2">if the radical right posed a threat to</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.860" end="00:49:07.020" style="s2">the Academy which they most decidedly do</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.710" end="00:49:11.160" style="s2">not then I would be just as upset about</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.020" end="00:49:13.470" style="s2">that and so I think again it&#39;s it&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.160" end="00:49:15.480" style="s2">and parcel of the radical left failure</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.470" end="00:49:17.400" style="s2">to take or the left&#39;s in general failure</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.480" end="00:49:18.570" style="s2">to take responsibility for the radicals</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.400" end="00:49:21.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like oh well why aren&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.570" end="00:49:25.200" style="s2">criticizing equally on both sides well</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.620" end="00:49:30.150" style="s2">that the threat doesn&#39;t exist equally on</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.200" end="00:49:32.430" style="s2">both sides not in my country so I think</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.150" end="00:49:34.050" style="s2">identity politics is murderous game no</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.430" end="00:49:36.360" style="s2">matter who plays it you know and on the</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.050" end="00:49:38.100" style="s2">Left it&#39;s well we&#39;ve already talked</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.360" end="00:49:40.800" style="s2">about that so what&#39;s wrong on the right</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.100" end="00:49:42.480" style="s2">well you stand up and wave your flag and</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.800" end="00:49:44.280" style="s2">talk about your ethnic identity or your</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.480" end="00:49:45.480" style="s2">racial identity and you take pride in</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.280" end="00:49:48.020" style="s2">that it&#39;s like what the hell did that</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.480" end="00:49:50.640" style="s2">have to do with you yeah god damn loser</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.020" end="00:49:52.230" style="s2">you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re you&#39;re one of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.640" end="00:49:53.580" style="s2">the great heroes of the past are you</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.230" end="00:49:55.710" style="s2">that&#39;s why you&#39;re standing up and waving</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.580" end="00:49:56.369" style="s2">your flag it&#39;s no you&#39;re not you&#39;re your</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.710" end="00:49:57.719" style="s2">identify</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.369" end="00:50:00.150" style="s2">with your group because you don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.719" end="00:50:02.430" style="s2">anything of your own to offer and so</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.150" end="00:50:04.589" style="s2">it&#39;s pathetic and I&#39;ve said that many</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.430" end="00:50:06.569" style="s2">times and in my lectures too and people</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.589" end="00:50:09.359" style="s2">know this if they&#39;ve actually watched my</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.569" end="00:50:12.049" style="s2">University lectures I spend tremendous</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.359" end="00:50:14.339" style="s2">amount of time and have for 30 years</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.049" end="00:50:16.200" style="s2">convincing my students that if they had</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.339" end="00:50:18.239" style="s2">been in Nazi Germany there was a very</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.200" end="00:50:20.789" style="s2">high probability that rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.239" end="00:50:22.979" style="s2">Oskar Shindler and rescuing the Jews</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.789" end="00:50:25.349" style="s2">they would have been a Nazi persecutor</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.979" end="00:50:28.410" style="s2">because there&#39;s like five oscar</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.349" end="00:50:30.989" style="s2">schindler&#39;s and like many million Nazis</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.410" end="00:50:32.759" style="s2">so you can do the math for yourself and</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.989" end="00:50:34.380" style="s2">if you don&#39;t think that if you think</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.759" end="00:50:37.499" style="s2">that you would have been one of the few</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.380" end="00:50:41.249" style="s2">heroes then you&#39;re either someone truly</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.499" end="00:50:44.339" style="s2">remarkable or you&#39;re unbelievably</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.249" end="00:50:46.529" style="s2">deluded and so I would suspect that</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.339" end="00:50:48.660" style="s2">you&#39;re in the unbelievably deluded camp</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.529" end="00:50:50.940" style="s2">because truly remarkable people are rare</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.660" end="00:50:52.619" style="s2">and I&#39;ve really I&#39;ve really seen this in</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.940" end="00:50:54.269" style="s2">the last year or two because one of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.619" end="00:50:56.729" style="s2">things I have noted like I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.269" end="00:50:58.710" style="s2">people were timid you know and I knew</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.729" end="00:51:00.839" style="s2">why it&#39;s dangerous to stick your head up</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.710" end="00:51:02.579" style="s2">above the rest I mean it&#39;s predator</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.839" end="00:51:05.039" style="s2">avoidance strategy to keep your head</p>
<p begin="00:51:02.579" end="00:51:07.319" style="s2">down and I mean that technically it</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.039" end="00:51:09.569" style="s2">truly is to blend in with the crowd is a</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.319" end="00:51:12.390" style="s2">predatory avoidance strategy that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:51:09.569" end="00:51:14.609" style="s2">fish do in schools of fish like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.390" end="00:51:16.200" style="s2">very low-level behavior and if you stick</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.609" end="00:51:18.359" style="s2">your head up there&#39;s some real danger</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.200" end="00:51:20.009" style="s2">and the advantage to that is that people</p>
<p begin="00:51:18.359" end="00:51:21.749" style="s2">are pretty civilized and they go along</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.009" end="00:51:23.039" style="s2">with the group and that&#39;s that&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.749" end="00:51:24.539" style="s2">thing because you know we should be</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.039" end="00:51:26.069" style="s2">civilized and go along with the group</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.539" end="00:51:28.890" style="s2">but it&#39;s a really bad thing when the</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.069" end="00:51:30.900" style="s2">group goes sideways and I&#39;ve had many</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.890" end="00:51:33.660" style="s2">people colleagues and but many other</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.900" end="00:51:35.279" style="s2">people to say wow really we agree with</p>
<p begin="00:51:33.660" end="00:51:37.319" style="s2">what you&#39;re doing but we can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.279" end="00:51:40.229" style="s2">take the risk of standing up and saying</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.319" end="00:51:41.999" style="s2">so it&#39;s like well now and then so most</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.229" end="00:51:44.190" style="s2">people fall into that camp when I went</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.999" end="00:51:46.289" style="s2">to Queen&#39;s University a month ago and</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.190" end="00:51:48.259" style="s2">was subject to that chilling</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.289" end="00:51:50.609" style="s2">demonstration I would say we&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.259" end="00:51:53.400" style="s2">radicals climbed up into the</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.609" end="00:51:56.249" style="s2">stained-glass window window wells and</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.400" end="00:51:58.559" style="s2">pounded you know unendingly for ninety</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.249" end="00:52:00.239" style="s2">minutes well we were all inside I had a</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.559" end="00:52:02.549" style="s2">professor write me the day before and</p>
<p begin="00:52:00.239" end="00:52:04.499" style="s2">say look my wife and I work at the</p>
<p begin="00:52:02.549" end="00:52:06.269" style="s2">University we really support what what</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.499" end="00:52:08.729" style="s2">you&#39;re doing but we can&#39;t even risk</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.269" end="00:52:10.040" style="s2">coming to the talk because what if the</p>
<p begin="00:52:08.729" end="00:52:12.020" style="s2">students see</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.040" end="00:52:14.060" style="s2">complain it&#39;s like well yeah there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.020" end="00:52:16.610" style="s2">courage for you man there&#39;s courage for</p>
<p begin="00:52:14.060" end="00:52:18.770" style="s2">you you know and so but that&#39;s par for</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.610" end="00:52:22.790" style="s2">the course and it&#39;s it&#39;s unsurprising to</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.770" end="00:52:27.830" style="s2">some degree but well but anyways on the</p>
<p begin="00:52:22.790" end="00:52:30.410" style="s2">right it&#39;s like it&#39;s an excuse by people</p>

<p begin="00:55:10.540" end="00:55:18.430" style="s2">I came from McGill and I had spent a lot</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.980" end="00:55:21.250" style="s2">of time with my advisor there and a</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.430" end="00:55:23.230" style="s2">research team that he had trying to</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.250" end="00:55:28.450" style="s2">understand the genesis of antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:55:23.230" end="00:55:30.220" style="s2">behavior and among adolescents mostly so</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.450" end="00:55:32.320" style="s2">well as kids as well</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.220" end="00:55:33.940" style="s2">antisocial behavior is very persistent</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.320" end="00:55:37.240" style="s2">so if you have a child whose conduct</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.940" end="00:55:39.130" style="s2">disordered at the age of four the</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.240" end="00:55:40.990" style="s2">probability that they will be criminal</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.130" end="00:55:44.080" style="s2">at the age of fifteen or twenty is</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.990" end="00:55:46.000" style="s2">extremely high it&#39;s unbelievably stable</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.080" end="00:55:48.490" style="s2">it&#39;s a very dismal literature because</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.000" end="00:55:52.330" style="s2">you see these early onset aggressive</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.490" end="00:55:53.770" style="s2">kids and and it&#39;s persistent and then</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.330" end="00:55:56.500" style="s2">you look at the intervention literature</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.770" end="00:55:58.330" style="s2">and you throw up your hands because no</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.500" end="00:56:00.070" style="s2">interventions work and believe me</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.330" end="00:56:01.960" style="s2">psychologists have tried everything you</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.070" end="00:56:03.790" style="s2">could possibly imagine and a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:56:01.960" end="00:56:05.650" style="s2">things that you can&#39;t in order to</p>
<p begin="00:56:03.790" end="00:56:07.990" style="s2">ameliorate that so we&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.650" end="00:56:10.720" style="s2">interested in trying to understand for</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.990" end="00:56:13.360" style="s2">example if you&#39;re antisocial by the age</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.720" end="00:56:16.630" style="s2">of four then there isn&#39;t an intervention</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.360" end="00:56:18.640" style="s2">that seems to be effective so and the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.630" end="00:56:20.710" style="s2">standard penological theory is really</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.640" end="00:56:22.660" style="s2">quite horrifying in this regard because</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.710" end="00:56:24.700" style="s2">what you see is that male aggression</p>
<p begin="00:56:22.660" end="00:56:27.280" style="s2">Peaks around the age of 15 and then it</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.700" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">declines fairly precipitously and and</p>
<p begin="00:56:27.280" end="00:56:32.260" style="s2">and sort of normalizes again by the age</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:34.480" style="s2">of 27 and standard phenological Theory</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.260" end="00:56:35.950" style="s2">essentially is this cold-hearted it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.480" end="00:56:37.599" style="s2">like if you have a</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.950" end="00:56:38.859" style="s2">if you have someone who&#39;s a multiple</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.599" end="00:56:41.470" style="s2">offender you just throw them in prison</p>
<p begin="00:56:38.859" end="00:56:44.079" style="s2">till they&#39;re 27 then they age out of it</p>
<p begin="00:56:41.470" end="00:56:46.780" style="s2">and that&#39;s all there is to it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:56:44.079" end="00:56:48.160" style="s2">that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got now there&#39;s some</p>
<p begin="00:56:46.780" end="00:56:49.960" style="s2">downside to that because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.160" end="00:56:51.280" style="s2">corollary literature that suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.960" end="00:56:52.839" style="s2">the worst thing that you can do with</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.280" end="00:56:55.119" style="s2">antisocial people is to group them</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.839" end="00:56:58.720" style="s2">together which is what we do in prisons</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.119" end="00:57:00.130" style="s2">so so that&#39;s a whole mess anyways one of</p>
<p begin="00:56:58.720" end="00:57:01.650" style="s2">the things we were doing was trying to</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.130" end="00:57:04.300" style="s2">see if there might be cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.650" end="00:57:06.010" style="s2">predictors of antisocial behavior and so</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.300" end="00:57:07.900" style="s2">we used this battery of</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.010" end="00:57:09.040" style="s2">neuropsychological tests that was put</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.900" end="00:57:11.440" style="s2">together at the Montreal Neurological</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.040" end="00:57:13.599" style="s2">Institute took about 11 hours to</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.440" end="00:57:16.240" style="s2">administer and hypothetically assess</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.599" end="00:57:18.550" style="s2">prefrontal cortical function and we</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.240" end="00:57:21.780" style="s2">computerized out reduced it to about 90</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.550" end="00:57:24.339" style="s2">minutes and then assessed antisocial</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.780" end="00:57:26.260" style="s2">adolescents in in Montreal and found out</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.339" end="00:57:27.940" style="s2">that they did show deficits in the</p>
<p begin="00:57:26.260" end="00:57:32.550" style="s2">problem-solving ability that we</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.940" end="00:57:34.810" style="s2">associated with with prefrontal ability</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.550" end="00:57:37.300" style="s2">when I got to Harvard I thought well</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.810" end="00:57:40.119" style="s2">that&#39;s interesting we could use the</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.300" end="00:57:42.940" style="s2">neuro psych battery to predict negative</p>
<p begin="00:57:40.119" end="00:57:44.920" style="s2">behavior perhaps we could use it to</p>
<p begin="00:57:42.940" end="00:57:46.630" style="s2">predict positive behavior so I thought</p>
<p begin="00:57:44.920" end="00:57:49.900" style="s2">well what if we turned the neuro psych</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.630" end="00:57:51.910" style="s2">battery and over and thought well can we</p>
<p begin="00:57:49.900" end="00:57:53.680" style="s2">predict grades for example because you</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.910" end="00:57:56.560" style="s2">know that&#39;s a decent thing to predict so</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.680" end="00:57:58.750" style="s2">we ran a study we ran a study that</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.560" end="00:58:01.329" style="s2">looked at Harvard kids University of</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.750" end="00:58:04.390" style="s2">Toronto kids line workers at a Milwaukee</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.329" end="00:58:06.190" style="s2">Factory and managers and executives at</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.390" end="00:58:10.000" style="s2">the same Factory and what we found was</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.190" end="00:58:11.770" style="s2">that the average score across these</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.000" end="00:58:13.630" style="s2">neuropsychological tests they were kind</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.770" end="00:58:16.720" style="s2">of like games they were game-like you</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.630" end="00:58:18.250" style="s2">know so in one in one test you had there</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.720" end="00:58:20.589" style="s2">were five lights in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.250" end="00:58:22.690" style="s2">screen and a box was associated with</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.589" end="00:58:24.609" style="s2">each light and you had to learn by trial</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.690" end="00:58:26.200" style="s2">and error which box was associated with</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.609" end="00:58:31.540" style="s2">with each light that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.200" end="00:58:33.339" style="s2">tests so we took people&#39;s average score</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.540" end="00:58:36.099" style="s2">across the tests because they seemed to</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.339" end="00:58:37.599" style="s2">clump together into a single structure</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.099" end="00:58:39.160" style="s2">you can do you can find that out</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.599" end="00:58:41.170" style="s2">statistically if you take a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:58:39.160" end="00:58:42.849" style="s2">tests you can find out how they clump</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.170" end="00:58:44.230" style="s2">together statistically by looking at</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.849" end="00:58:46.150" style="s2">their patterns of correlations and you</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.230" end="00:58:47.829" style="s2">might get multiple clumps which is what</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.150" end="00:58:49.780" style="s2">happens with personality research where</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.829" end="00:58:52.030" style="s2">you get five or you might get a sing</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.780" end="00:58:54.250" style="s2">clomp which is what happens in cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.030" end="00:58:56.890" style="s2">research and we got a single clump</p>
<p begin="00:58:54.250" end="00:58:59.410" style="s2">essentially and then we were trying to</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.890" end="00:59:00.910" style="s2">figure out if at the same time I was</p>
<p begin="00:58:59.410" end="00:59:03.190" style="s2">reading the literature on performance</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.910" end="00:59:04.690" style="s2">prediction and there&#39;s an extensive</p>

<p begin="00:59:04.690" end="00:59:09.610" style="s2">lot of it generated by the Armed Forces</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.010" end="00:59:11.350" style="s2">by the way indicating that IQ is a very</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.610" end="00:59:13.630" style="s2">good predictor of long-term life success</p>
<p begin="00:59:11.350" end="00:59:17.590" style="s2">and so here&#39;s the here&#39;s the general</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.630" end="00:59:19.180" style="s2">rule if your job is simple which means</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.590" end="00:59:21.280" style="s2">you do the same thing every day</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.180" end="00:59:23.140" style="s2">then IQ predicts how fast you&#39;ll learn</p>
<p begin="00:59:21.280" end="00:59:25.840" style="s2">the job but not how well you you do it</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.140" end="00:59:27.640" style="s2">but if your job is complex which means</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.840" end="00:59:29.680" style="s2">that the demands change on an ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.640" end="00:59:33.880" style="s2">basis then the best predictor of success</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.680" end="00:59:35.020" style="s2">is general cognitive ability and and I</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.880" end="00:59:36.970" style="s2">learned that the general cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.020" end="00:59:38.560" style="s2">ability test clumped together into a</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.970" end="00:59:41.440" style="s2">single factor that&#39;s fluid intelligence</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.560" end="00:59:43.480" style="s2">or IQ and then we didn&#39;t know if the</p>
<p begin="00:59:41.440" end="00:59:46.780" style="s2">factor that we had found was the same</p>
<p begin="00:59:43.480" end="00:59:47.890" style="s2">factor as IQ and and we still haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.780" end="00:59:49.540" style="s2">really figured out whether or not that</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.890" end="00:59:51.640" style="s2">was the case because it kind of depends</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.540" end="00:59:53.770" style="s2">on how you do the analysis but anyways I</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.640" end="00:59:55.300" style="s2">I got deeply into the performance</p>
<p begin="00:59:53.770" end="00:59:56.710" style="s2">prediction literature and I found oh</p>
<p begin="00:59:55.300" end="00:59:58.720" style="s2">well if you wanted to predict people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.710" end="00:59:59.860" style="s2">performance in life there&#39;s there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.720" end="01:00:01.090" style="s2">couple of things you need to know you</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.860" end="01:00:02.920" style="s2">need to know their general cognitive</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.090" end="01:00:05.230" style="s2">ability if they&#39;re going to do a complex</p>
<p begin="01:00:02.920" end="01:00:07.720" style="s2">job you need to know their trait</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.230" end="01:00:10.210" style="s2">conscientiousness some of you might have</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.720" end="01:00:13.300" style="s2">heard that rebranded as grit in a very</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.210" end="01:00:15.750" style="s2">corrupt act by the way because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:00:13.300" end="01:00:18.190" style="s2">good predictor of long-term life success</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.750" end="01:00:20.050" style="s2">freedom from negative emotion low</p>
<p begin="01:00:18.190" end="01:00:22.240" style="s2">neuroticism is another predictor but</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.050" end="01:00:24.370" style="s2">it&#39;s sort of third on the hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="01:00:22.240" end="01:00:26.110" style="s2">then openness to experience which is a</p>
<p begin="01:00:24.370" end="01:00:29.200" style="s2">personality trait is associated with</p>
<p begin="01:00:26.110" end="01:00:31.090" style="s2">with expertise in creative domains the</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.200" end="01:00:33.250" style="s2">evidence that now I should tell you</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.090" end="01:00:34.780" style="s2">there&#39;s such a complicated question I</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.250" end="01:00:37.570" style="s2">should tell you how to make an IQ test</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.780" end="01:00:39.220" style="s2">is actually really easy and you need to</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.570" end="01:00:43.030" style="s2">know this to actually understand what IQ</p>
<p begin="01:00:39.220" end="01:00:46.180" style="s2">is so imagine that you generated a set</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.030" end="01:00:48.700" style="s2">of 10,000 questions okay about anything</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.180" end="01:00:49.870" style="s2">it could be math problems they could be</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.700" end="01:00:51.340" style="s2">general knowledge they could be</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.870" end="01:00:52.840" style="s2">vocabulary they could be multiple choice</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.340" end="01:00:54.040" style="s2">it really doesn&#39;t matter what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.840" end="01:00:56.080" style="s2">about as long as they require</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.040" end="01:00:58.150" style="s2">abstraction to solve so they&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.080" end="01:01:00.790" style="s2">formulated linguistically but</p>
<p begin="01:00:58.150" end="01:01:03.280" style="s2">mathematically would also apply and then</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.790" end="01:01:03.680" style="s2">you have those 10,000 questions now you</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.280" end="01:01:05.690" style="s2">take</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.680" end="01:01:07.880" style="s2">random set of a hundred of those</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.690" end="01:01:10.069" style="s2">questions and you&#39;ve give them to a</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.880" end="01:01:12.380" style="s2">thousand people and all you do is sum up</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.069" end="01:01:13.400" style="s2">the answers right from so some people</p>
<p begin="01:01:12.380" end="01:01:15.020" style="s2">are gonna get most of them right and</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.400" end="01:01:16.520" style="s2">some some of them are gonna get most of</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.020" end="01:01:19.520" style="s2">them wrong you just rank order the</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.520" end="01:01:22.040" style="s2">people in terms of their score correct</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.520" end="01:01:24.290" style="s2">that for age and you have IQ that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.040" end="01:01:26.359" style="s2">there is to it and what you&#39;ll find is</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.290" end="01:01:28.550" style="s2">that no matter which random set of a</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.359" end="01:01:30.680" style="s2">hundred questions you take the people at</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.550" end="01:01:33.260" style="s2">the top of one random set will be at the</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.680" end="01:01:35.900" style="s2">top of all the others and in with very</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.260" end="01:01:38.510" style="s2">very very high consistency so one thing</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.900" end="01:01:42.369" style="s2">you need to know is that if any social</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.510" end="01:01:46.069" style="s2">science claims whatsoever are correct</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.369" end="01:01:48.170" style="s2">then the IQ claims are correct because</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.069" end="01:01:50.540" style="s2">the IQ claims are more psychometrically</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.170" end="01:01:52.579" style="s2">rigorous than any other phenomena</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.540" end="01:01:55.250" style="s2">phenomenon that&#39;s been discovered by</p>
<p begin="01:01:52.579" end="01:01:57.530" style="s2">social scientists now the IQ literature</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.250" end="01:02:00.079" style="s2">is a dismal literature no one likes it</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.530" end="01:02:02.480" style="s2">here&#39;s why here&#39;s an example so here&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.079" end="01:02:04.339" style="s2">little here&#39;s a fun little fact for you</p>
<p begin="01:02:02.480" end="01:02:05.809" style="s2">for liberals and conservatives alike</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.339" end="01:02:07.490" style="s2">because conservatives think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:05.809" end="01:02:09.589" style="s2">job for everyone if people just get off</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.490" end="01:02:11.150" style="s2">their asses and get to work and liberals</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.589" end="01:02:13.640" style="s2">think while you can train anyone to do</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.150" end="01:02:16.069" style="s2">anything it&#39;s like no there isn&#39;t a job</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.640" end="01:02:18.079" style="s2">for everyone and no you can&#39;t train</p>
<p begin="01:02:16.069" end="01:02:20.420" style="s2">everyone to do everything that&#39;s wrong</p>
<p begin="01:02:18.079" end="01:02:22.760" style="s2">and here&#39;s one of the consequences of</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.420" end="01:02:24.980" style="s2">that so as I mentioned the Armed Forces</p>
<p begin="01:02:22.760" end="01:02:27.650" style="s2">has done a lot of work on IQ and they</p>
<p begin="01:02:24.980" end="01:02:30.020" style="s2">started back in 1919 and the reason they</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.650" end="01:02:32.359" style="s2">did that was because well for obvious</p>
<p begin="01:02:30.020" end="01:02:35.089" style="s2">reasons say let&#39;s say there&#39;s a war and</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.359" end="01:02:36.770" style="s2">you want to get qualified people into</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.089" end="01:02:39.319" style="s2">the officer positions as rapidly as</p>
<p begin="01:02:36.770" end="01:02:42.170" style="s2">possible or you&#39;ll lose so that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:02:39.319" end="01:02:45.650" style="s2">reason and now the Armed Forces has</p>
<p begin="01:02:42.170" end="01:02:49.640" style="s2">experimented with IQ test since 1919 and</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.650" end="01:02:51.680" style="s2">in the last 20 years a law was passed as</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.640" end="01:02:53.630" style="s2">a consequence of that analysis which was</p>
<p begin="01:02:51.680" end="01:02:55.430" style="s2">that it was illegal to induct anyone</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.630" end="01:02:59.450" style="s2">into the Armed Forces who had an IQ of</p>
<p begin="01:02:55.430" end="01:03:02.720" style="s2">less than 83 now the question is why and</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.450" end="01:03:04.520" style="s2">the answer was all of that effort put in</p>
<p begin="01:03:02.720" end="01:03:06.500" style="s2">by the armed forces indicated that if</p>
<p begin="01:03:04.520" end="01:03:08.030" style="s2">you had an IQ of 83 or less there wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:03:06.500" end="01:03:09.859" style="s2">anything that you could be trained to do</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.030" end="01:03:12.049" style="s2">in the military that wasn&#39;t positively</p>
<p begin="01:03:09.859" end="01:03:14.599" style="s2">counterproductive now you got to think</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.049" end="01:03:17.390" style="s2">about that a because the military is</p>
<p begin="01:03:14.599" end="01:03:18.740" style="s2">chronically desperate for people right</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.390" end="01:03:20.420" style="s2">it&#39;s not like they&#39;re it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="01:03:18.740" end="01:03:22.700" style="s2">people are lining up to be inducted</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.420" end="01:03:24.440" style="s2">right they have to go out and recruit</p>
<p begin="01:03:22.700" end="01:03:25.940" style="s2">and it&#39;s not easy and so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:03:24.440" end="01:03:28.430" style="s2">desperate to get their hands on every</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.940" end="01:03:30.950" style="s2">body they can possibly manage and then</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.430" end="01:03:31.940" style="s2">especially in wartime but also in</p>
<p begin="01:03:30.950" end="01:03:33.950" style="s2">peacetime but then there was another</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.940" end="01:03:36.560" style="s2">reason to which was the Armed Forces was</p>
<p begin="01:03:33.950" end="01:03:39.260" style="s2">also set up from a policy perspective to</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.560" end="01:03:41.390" style="s2">take people in the underclass let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:03:39.260" end="01:03:42.980" style="s2">and train them and move them up at least</p>
<p begin="01:03:41.390" end="01:03:44.750" style="s2">into the working class or maybe the</p>
<p begin="01:03:42.980" end="01:03:46.250" style="s2">middle class so there&#39;s a policy element</p>
<p begin="01:03:44.750" end="01:03:47.900" style="s2">to it too and so even from that</p>
<p begin="01:03:46.250" end="01:03:50.090" style="s2">perspective you could see that the</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.900" end="01:03:53.270" style="s2">military is desperate to bring people in</p>
<p begin="01:03:50.090" end="01:03:56.180" style="s2">but well with an IQ of 83 or less it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.270" end="01:04:02.600" style="s2">not happening okay so how many people</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.180" end="01:04:07.460" style="s2">have an IQ of 83 or less 10 percent now</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.600" end="01:04:10.120" style="s2">if that doesn&#39;t if that doesn&#39;t hurt you</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.460" end="01:04:13.310" style="s2">to here then you didn&#39;t hear it properly</p>
<p begin="01:04:10.120" end="01:04:15.590" style="s2">because what it implies is that in a</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.310" end="01:04:17.630" style="s2">complex society like ours and one that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.590" end="01:04:20.000" style="s2">becoming increasingly complex there</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.630" end="01:04:23.330" style="s2">isn&#39;t anything for 10 percent of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.000" end="01:04:24.620" style="s2">population to do all right well what are</p>
<p begin="01:04:23.330" end="01:04:26.780" style="s2">we gonna do we&#39;re gonna ignore that</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.620" end="01:04:29.060" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna run away from that and</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.780" end="01:04:30.860" style="s2">believe me we have every reason to or</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.060" end="01:04:33.770" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna contend with the fact that</p>
<p begin="01:04:30.860" end="01:04:37.760" style="s2">we need to figure out how it is how it</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.770" end="01:04:40.010" style="s2">is how it might be possible to find a</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.760" end="01:04:42.290" style="s2">place for people on the lower end of the</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.010" end="01:04:44.660" style="s2">general cognitive distribution to take</p>
<p begin="01:04:42.290" end="01:04:46.760" style="s2">their productive and and worthwhile</p>
<p begin="01:04:44.660" end="01:04:48.980" style="s2">place in society and that isn&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.760" end="01:04:51.590" style="s2">gonna be a matter of dumping money down</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.980" end="01:04:53.600" style="s2">the hierarchy because giving people who</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.590" end="01:04:56.890" style="s2">have nothing to do money isn&#39;t helpful</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.600" end="01:05:00.140" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t work it&#39;s not that simple</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.890" end="01:05:01.250" style="s2">well so that&#39;s kind of an answer to the</p>
<p begin="01:05:00.140" end="01:05:04.220" style="s2">question of whether or not we should</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.250" end="01:05:07.250" style="s2">deal with uh with IQ forthrightly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.220" end="01:05:09.170" style="s2">like if you can find a flaw in that</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.250" end="01:05:11.030" style="s2">logic like just go right ahead it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.170" end="01:05:13.160" style="s2">like I was thrilled to death to discover</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.030" end="01:05:17.840" style="s2">all of this by nose by no stretch of the</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.160" end="01:05:21.470" style="s2">imagination was that the case so so what</p>
<p begin="01:05:17.840" end="01:05:23.060" style="s2">so IQ is reliable invalid that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:05:21.470" end="01:05:25.460" style="s2">first thing it&#39;s more reliable and valid</p>
<p begin="01:05:23.060" end="01:05:27.680" style="s2">than any other psychometric test ever</p>
<p begin="01:05:25.460" end="01:05:31.430" style="s2">designed by social scientists by a</p>
<p begin="01:05:27.680" end="01:05:34.190" style="s2">factor of about three that&#39;s fact number</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.430" end="01:05:37.849" style="s2">one fact number two is it predicts</p>
<p begin="01:05:34.190" end="01:05:40.789" style="s2">long-term life outcome at about 0.3 0.4</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.849" end="01:05:43.279" style="s2">which leaves about 85 percent 70 to 85</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.789" end="01:05:44.859" style="s2">percent of the story unexplained but</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.279" end="01:05:47.539" style="s2">it&#39;s still the best thing that we have</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.859" end="01:05:50.390" style="s2">well it&#39;s also the case that in places</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.539" end="01:05:52.430" style="s2">like Great Britain when IQ tests were</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.390" end="01:05:54.950" style="s2">first introduced they were actually used</p>
<p begin="01:05:52.430" end="01:05:58.760" style="s2">by the Socialists and they were used to</p>
<p begin="01:05:54.950" end="01:06:00.829" style="s2">identify poor people who had potential</p>
<p begin="01:05:58.760" end="01:06:02.809" style="s2">cognitive potential and to move them</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.829" end="01:06:05.569" style="s2">into higher into Institutes of higher</p>
<p begin="01:06:02.809" end="01:06:07.869" style="s2">education so there&#39;s an upside you know</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.569" end="01:06:12.980" style="s2">a social upside as well</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.869" end="01:06:15.230" style="s2">ethnic differences this is something you</p>
<p begin="01:06:12.980" end="01:06:18.589" style="s2">can&#39;t say anything about without without</p>
<p begin="01:06:15.230" end="01:06:21.319" style="s2">immediately being killed so I&#39;m hesitant</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.589" end="01:06:23.240" style="s2">to broach the topic but I&#39;ll tell you</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.319" end="01:06:25.609" style="s2">one thing that I did in the last week</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.240" end="01:06:27.470" style="s2">that&#39;s relevant to this so though and</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.609" end="01:06:29.329" style="s2">this just shows you how complex the</p>
<p begin="01:06:27.470" end="01:06:31.039" style="s2">problem is first of all we should point</p>
<p begin="01:06:29.329" end="01:06:32.510" style="s2">out that race is a very difficult thing</p>
<p begin="01:06:31.039" end="01:06:35.809" style="s2">to define because racial boundaries</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.510" end="01:06:37.789" style="s2">aren&#39;t tight right so and so when you</p>
<p begin="01:06:35.809" end="01:06:39.680" style="s2">talk about racial differences in IQ you</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.789" end="01:06:41.510" style="s2">you&#39;re faced with the thorny problem of</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.680" end="01:06:43.549" style="s2">defining race and that&#39;s a big problem</p>
<p begin="01:06:41.510" end="01:06:46.520" style="s2">from a scientific perspective but we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.549" end="01:06:50.510" style="s2">leave that aside and I wrote an article</p>
<p begin="01:06:46.520" end="01:06:54.020" style="s2">this week somebody stood up at one point</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.510" end="01:06:56.990" style="s2">one of my talks and vice bless their</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.020" end="01:06:59.089" style="s2">hearts took this particular question and</p>
<p begin="01:06:56.990" end="01:07:00.529" style="s2">used it as an indication of the quality</p>
<p begin="01:06:59.089" end="01:07:02.960" style="s2">of the people who are my so-called</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.529" end="01:07:04.760" style="s2">followers and by the way the quality of</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.960" end="01:07:07.369" style="s2">my so-called followers is pretty damn</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.760" end="01:07:09.020" style="s2">high and you can find that out quite</p>
<p begin="01:07:07.369" end="01:07:10.849" style="s2">rapidly just by going looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:07:09.020" end="01:07:13.010" style="s2">YouTube comments which are head and</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.849" end="01:07:15.099" style="s2">shoulders above what the standards said</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.010" end="01:07:18.049" style="s2">of YouTube comments I can tell you that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.099" end="01:07:20.960" style="s2">so someone asked me they&#39;re both the</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.049" end="01:07:22.910" style="s2">Jewish Question right and the the</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.960" end="01:07:25.910" style="s2">implication it was actually someone</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.910" end="01:07:27.950" style="s2">Jewish and the implication was that Jews</p>
<p begin="01:07:25.910" end="01:07:32.630" style="s2">are over-represented in positions of</p>
<p begin="01:07:27.950" end="01:07:34.549" style="s2">authority and power and and I was had</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.630" end="01:07:36.500" style="s2">just spoken for like an hour and a half</p>
<p begin="01:07:34.549" end="01:07:38.150" style="s2">and you know this guy had an axe to</p>
<p begin="01:07:36.500" end="01:07:39.980" style="s2">grind and I thought there&#39;s no goddamn</p>
<p begin="01:07:38.150" end="01:07:43.069" style="s2">way I&#39;m getting into this at the moment</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.980" end="01:07:43.980" style="s2">and so I I said I I said I can&#39;t answer</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.069" end="01:07:45.869" style="s2">that question</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.980" end="01:07:47.640" style="s2">but that&#39;s not a very good answer so I</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.869" end="01:07:49.440" style="s2">wrote a blog post this week and I said</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.640" end="01:07:50.869" style="s2">look here&#39;s that here&#39;s the situation</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.440" end="01:07:53.609" style="s2">all right</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.869" end="01:07:56.070" style="s2">Jews are over-represented in positions</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.609" end="01:07:58.290" style="s2">of power and authority but then let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.070" end="01:08:00.150" style="s2">open our eyes a little bit and think for</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.290" end="01:08:02.250" style="s2">like two or three seconds and think hey</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.150" end="01:08:04.680" style="s2">guess what they&#39;re also over-represented</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.250" end="01:08:06.990" style="s2">in positions of competence and it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.680" end="01:08:09.330" style="s2">like we have more geniuses than we know</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.990" end="01:08:11.100" style="s2">what to do with and if the Jews happen</p>
<p begin="01:08:09.330" end="01:08:13.320" style="s2">to be producing more of them which they</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.100" end="01:08:15.240" style="s2">are by the way then that&#39;s a pretty good</p>
<p begin="01:08:13.320" end="01:08:17.220" style="s2">thing for the rest of us so let&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:08:15.240" end="01:08:18.630" style="s2">confuse competence with power and</p>
<p begin="01:08:17.220" end="01:08:20.790" style="s2">authority even though that&#39;s a favorite</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.630" end="01:08:23.520" style="s2">trick of the radical leftists who always</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.790" end="01:08:25.950" style="s2">failed to make that distinction well why</p>
<p begin="01:08:23.520" end="01:08:28.739" style="s2">does this over representation occur</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.950" end="01:08:31.140" style="s2">because it does it also there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.739" end="01:08:33.029" style="s2">over representation in political</p>
<p begin="01:08:31.140" end="01:08:34.920" style="s2">movements including radical political</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.029" end="01:08:38.730" style="s2">movements okay why</p>
<p begin="01:08:34.920" end="01:08:41.040" style="s2">well answer one Jewish conspiracy okay</p>
<p begin="01:08:38.730" end="01:08:43.739" style="s2">that&#39;s not a very good answer we&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.040" end="01:08:46.230" style="s2">we&#39;ve used that answer before all right</p>
<p begin="01:08:43.739" end="01:08:48.870" style="s2">but but do we have an alternative well</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.230" end="01:08:49.799" style="s2">here&#39;s an alternative the average</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.870" end="01:08:52.470" style="s2">Ashkenazi</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.799" end="01:08:54.480" style="s2">IQ is somewhere between 110 and 150</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.470" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">which is about one standard deviation</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.480" end="01:08:59.900" style="s2">above the population average and so what</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.359" end="01:09:03.180" style="s2">that means is that the average Ashkenazi</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.900" end="01:09:08.220" style="s2">/ European Jew has an IQ that&#39;s higher</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.180" end="01:09:10.440" style="s2">than 85% of the population that&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="01:09:08.220" end="01:09:11.880" style="s2">higher now that doesn&#39;t make that much</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.440" end="01:09:14.400" style="s2">difference in the middle of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:11.880" end="01:09:16.259" style="s2">distribution okay but geniuses don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:09:14.400" end="01:09:18.060" style="s2">exist at the middle of the distribution</p>
<p begin="01:09:16.259" end="01:09:20.040" style="s2">they exist at the tails of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.060" end="01:09:23.759" style="s2">distribution and you don&#39;t need much of</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.040" end="01:09:26.040" style="s2">a move at the mean to produce walloping</p>
<p begin="01:09:23.759" end="01:09:28.350" style="s2">differences at the tails and the tails</p>
<p begin="01:09:26.040" end="01:09:31.350" style="s2">are important because a lot of where we</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.350" end="01:09:34.950" style="s2">draw we draw exceptional people from the</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.350" end="01:09:38.810" style="s2">exceptions right so here&#39;s an example of</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.950" end="01:09:42.390" style="s2">the same thing most engineers are male</p>
<p begin="01:09:38.810" end="01:09:44.580" style="s2">why because men are more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:09:42.390" end="01:09:46.400" style="s2">things and women are more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:09:44.580" end="01:09:49.470" style="s2">people and you might say well that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.400" end="01:09:52.080" style="s2">socio-cultural it&#39;s like no it&#39;s not and</p>
<p begin="01:09:49.470" end="01:09:54.960" style="s2">we know that because if you stack up</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.080" end="01:09:57.510" style="s2">countries by their by their egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:09:54.960" end="01:09:57.780" style="s2">social policies which you can do quite</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.510" end="01:09:59.570" style="s2">if</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.780" end="01:10:02.070" style="s2">effectively and then you look at the</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.570" end="01:10:05.309" style="s2">over-representation of men in STEM</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.070" end="01:10:07.940" style="s2">fields the over-representation increases</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.309" end="01:10:12.780" style="s2">as the country&#39;s become more egalitarian</p>
<p begin="01:10:07.940" end="01:10:14.940" style="s2">so it&#39;s not socio-cultural okay now men</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.780" end="01:10:16.710" style="s2">aren&#39;t that much more interested in</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.940" end="01:10:18.119" style="s2">things than women it&#39;s one standard</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.710" end="01:10:19.770" style="s2">deviation which is about the same</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.119" end="01:10:21.420" style="s2">difference by the way between the</p>
<p begin="01:10:19.770" end="01:10:22.980" style="s2">population norm and they ask you now Zhi</p>
<p begin="01:10:21.420" end="01:10:25.920" style="s2">Zhu&#39;s but if you&#39;re looking at the</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.980" end="01:10:28.739" style="s2">person the one person in 20 or the one</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.920" end="01:10:31.530" style="s2">person in 50 who&#39;s most who&#39;s hyper</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.739" end="01:10:34.110" style="s2">interested in things and that&#39;s likely</p>
<p begin="01:10:31.530" end="01:10:36.480" style="s2">to become an engineer then most of them</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.110" end="01:10:37.219" style="s2">are men here&#39;s another example of the</p>
<p begin="01:10:36.480" end="01:10:41.340" style="s2">same thing</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.219" end="01:10:44.489" style="s2">men are more aggressive than women now</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.340" end="01:10:46.320" style="s2">you might ask how much and answer that</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.489" end="01:10:48.360" style="s2">is best place to look at that is in</p>
<p begin="01:10:46.320" end="01:10:50.219" style="s2">Sweden where the Galit Aryan policies</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.360" end="01:10:52.170" style="s2">have been laid out for a long period of</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.219" end="01:10:54.599" style="s2">time and you can you can get a more</p>
<p begin="01:10:52.170" end="01:10:56.550" style="s2">direct inference about biology if you</p>
<p begin="01:10:54.599" end="01:10:59.099" style="s2">took a random man and around and woman</p>
<p begin="01:10:56.550" end="01:11:01.050" style="s2">out of the population and you had to bet</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.099" end="01:11:03.000" style="s2">on who was more aggressive and you bet</p>
<p begin="01:11:01.050" end="01:11:05.219" style="s2">on the man you&#39;d be right 60 percent of</p>
<p begin="01:11:03.000" end="01:11:07.469" style="s2">the time so that&#39;s not that much right</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.219" end="01:11:12.090" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s deviates from 50/50 but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:07.469" end="01:11:14.760" style="s2">not like ninety ten it&#39;s 60/40 okay so</p>
<p begin="01:11:12.090" end="01:11:16.650" style="s2">so what does that mean well we got a</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.760" end="01:11:18.420" style="s2">tail problem here again let&#39;s say that</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.650" end="01:11:20.429" style="s2">now you decide to go out on to the</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.420" end="01:11:22.949" style="s2">extremes of aggression and you identify</p>
<p begin="01:11:20.429" end="01:11:27.630" style="s2">the most aggressive one in a hundred</p>

<p begin="01:11:34.559" end="01:11:39.000" style="s2">is elementary part of the problem in our</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.110" end="01:11:41.369" style="s2">society is that we don&#39;t understand</p>

<p begin="01:11:48.510" end="01:11:58.320" style="s2">the distribution okay so back to IQ one</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.300" end="01:12:01.110" style="s2">final thing to say about IQ the ethnic</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.320" end="01:12:04.260" style="s2">differences are difficult to dispense</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.110" end="01:12:06.570" style="s2">with it&#39;s not easy to make them go away</p>
<p begin="01:12:04.260" end="01:12:09.000" style="s2">you can say well the tests aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:12:06.570" end="01:12:11.639" style="s2">culture fair well here&#39;s a test of that</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.000" end="01:12:13.649" style="s2">so imagine you you test group a we</p>
<p begin="01:12:11.639" end="01:12:16.019" style="s2">an IQ test and you test Group B with an</p>
<p begin="01:12:13.649" end="01:12:18.179" style="s2">IQ test and then you look at their</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.019" end="01:12:20.639" style="s2">actual performance in whatever you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:12:18.179" end="01:12:23.099" style="s2">predicting if the test was biased</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.639" end="01:12:25.949" style="s2">against ethnic group a then it would</p>

<p begin="01:12:25.949" end="01:12:30.329" style="s2">doesn&#39;t happen now you could say well</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.439" end="01:12:32.909" style="s2">there&#39;s systemic bias in the performance</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.329" end="01:12:37.409" style="s2">measures and the potential measures and</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.909" end="01:12:40.499" style="s2">that&#39;s a possibility all right now one</p>
<p begin="01:12:37.409" end="01:12:43.409" style="s2">other thing about that there&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="01:12:40.499" end="01:12:46.380" style="s2">danger in the ethnicity IQ debate and</p>
<p begin="01:12:43.409" end="01:12:49.800" style="s2">the the danger is that we confuse</p>
<p begin="01:12:46.380" end="01:12:53.159" style="s2">intelligence with value or that we</p>
<p begin="01:12:49.800" end="01:12:55.199" style="s2">include we we confused intelligence with</p>
<p begin="01:12:53.159" end="01:12:57.780" style="s2">yet with human value that&#39;s a better way</p>
<p begin="01:12:55.199" end="01:12:59.249" style="s2">of thinking about it and one of the</p>
<p begin="01:12:57.780" end="01:13:01.050" style="s2">things that we&#39;re going to have to</p>
<p begin="01:12:59.249" end="01:13:03.599" style="s2">understand here is that that&#39;s a mistake</p>
<p begin="01:13:01.050" end="01:13:06.209" style="s2">is that being more intelligent doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:13:06.209" end="01:13:10.800" style="s2">case it makes me you more useful for</p>
<p begin="01:13:08.159" end="01:13:13.949" style="s2">complex cognitive operations but you can</p>
<p begin="01:13:10.800" end="01:13:16.260" style="s2">be pretty damn horrific as a genius son</p>
<p begin="01:13:13.949" end="01:13:17.760" style="s2">of a [ __ ] right it&#39;s morally neutral</p>
<p begin="01:13:16.260" end="01:13:19.169" style="s2">and we also know that from the</p>
<p begin="01:13:17.760" end="01:13:20.399" style="s2">psychometric data by the way there</p>
<p begin="01:13:19.169" end="01:13:21.959" style="s2">doesn&#39;t seem to be any relationship</p>
<p begin="01:13:20.399" end="01:13:25.070" style="s2">whatsoever between intelligence and</p>
<p begin="01:13:21.959" end="01:13:27.749" style="s2">virtue and so if it does turn out that</p>
<p begin="01:13:25.070" end="01:13:30.269" style="s2">nature and the fates do not align with</p>
<p begin="01:13:27.749" end="01:13:31.229" style="s2">our egalitarian presuppositions which is</p>
<p begin="01:13:30.269" end="01:13:32.939" style="s2">highly probable</p>
<p begin="01:13:31.229" end="01:13:36.389" style="s2">we shouldn&#39;t therefore make the mistake</p>
<p begin="01:13:32.939" end="01:13:38.729" style="s2">of assuming that if group a or person a</p>
<p begin="01:13:36.389" end="01:13:41.340" style="s2">is lower on one of these attributes than</p>
<p begin="01:13:38.729" end="01:13:43.349" style="s2">group B or person B that that is somehow</p>
<p begin="01:13:41.340" end="01:13:51.059" style="s2">reflective of their intrinsic value as</p>
<p begin="01:13:43.349" end="01:13:52.919" style="s2">human beings that&#39;s a big mistake now</p>
<p begin="01:13:51.059" end="01:13:58.590" style="s2">that&#39;s I don&#39;t have anything else to say</p>
<p begin="01:13:52.919" end="01:14:02.010" style="s2">about that okay so I had three more</p>
<p begin="01:13:58.590" end="01:14:03.780" style="s2">questions and so maybe slightly shorter</p>
<p begin="01:14:02.010" end="01:14:07.099" style="s2">answers to these three like maybe around</p>
<p begin="01:14:03.780" end="01:14:10.619" style="s2">hopefully there&#39;s simpler questions</p>
<p begin="01:14:07.099" end="01:14:14.280" style="s2">Avra average five minutes okay and then</p>
<p begin="01:14:10.619" end="01:14:19.519" style="s2">and then we will open it up so another</p>

<p begin="01:26:21.090" end="01:26:25.829" style="s2">barriers at the moment but the first</p>
<p begin="01:26:23.519" end="01:26:27.599" style="s2">thing we wanted to do was to find out</p>
<p begin="01:26:25.829" end="01:26:29.610" style="s2">whether there was actually such a thing</p>
<p begin="01:26:27.599" end="01:26:31.440" style="s2">as political correctness you can</p>
<p begin="01:26:29.610" end="01:26:33.360" style="s2">actually do that technically as a social</p>
<p begin="01:26:31.440" end="01:26:35.190" style="s2">scientist so what you do is this is what</p>
<p begin="01:26:33.360" end="01:26:36.869" style="s2">we did is we got a group of people</p>
<p begin="01:26:35.190" end="01:26:38.579" style="s2">together and we collected a whole bunch</p>
<p begin="01:26:36.869" end="01:26:40.320" style="s2">of statements that seem to be vaguely</p>
<p begin="01:26:38.579" end="01:26:41.940" style="s2">associated with the idea of political</p>
<p begin="01:26:40.320" end="01:26:43.559" style="s2">correctness so maybe you could think</p>
<p begin="01:26:41.940" end="01:26:45.300" style="s2">well it&#39;s a media construct and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:26:43.559" end="01:26:46.650" style="s2">fine you can go to analyze media</p>
<p begin="01:26:45.300" end="01:26:49.079" style="s2">statements and then you can collect</p>
<p begin="01:26:46.650" end="01:26:51.570" style="s2">ideas that seem to be associated with</p>
<p begin="01:26:49.079" end="01:26:54.269" style="s2">whatever political correctness is we</p>
<p begin="01:26:51.570" end="01:26:56.309" style="s2">collected about 400 of those and then we</p>
<p begin="01:26:54.269" end="01:26:57.809" style="s2">asked we turned them into questions and</p>
<p begin="01:26:56.309" end="01:26:59.599" style="s2">we asked a thousand people for their</p>
<p begin="01:26:57.809" end="01:27:01.800" style="s2">opinions then you can do this</p>
<p begin="01:26:59.599" end="01:27:03.570" style="s2">statistical process called a factor</p>
<p begin="01:27:01.800" end="01:27:05.639" style="s2">analysis and it&#39;s the same thing that</p>
<p begin="01:27:03.570" end="01:27:07.139" style="s2">pulls out a single factor of IQ from a</p>
<p begin="01:27:05.639" end="01:27:08.519" style="s2">group of questions for example it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:07.139" end="01:27:10.920" style="s2">same thing that produced the Big Five</p>
<p begin="01:27:08.519" end="01:27:14.190" style="s2">personality model what the factor</p>
<p begin="01:27:10.920" end="01:27:17.340" style="s2">analysis does is tell you which quest if</p>
<p begin="01:27:14.190" end="01:27:20.070" style="s2">questions group together so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="01:27:17.340" end="01:27:21.570" style="s2">you have opinion a well if you have</p>
<p begin="01:27:20.070" end="01:27:23.249" style="s2">opinion a if there&#39;s a hundred of you</p>
<p begin="01:27:21.570" end="01:27:26.429" style="s2">everyone who has opinion a also has</p>
<p begin="01:27:23.249" end="01:27:28.320" style="s2">opinion B an opinion C and if that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:27:26.429" end="01:27:30.690" style="s2">case then those clumped together there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:27:28.320" end="01:27:32.519" style="s2">something about them that&#39;s the same now</p>
<p begin="01:27:30.690" end="01:27:34.530" style="s2">what we could have found was that when</p>
<p begin="01:27:32.519" end="01:27:37.289" style="s2">we analyzed these 400 questions there</p>
<p begin="01:27:34.530" end="01:27:39.510" style="s2">was like 50 clumps and so that would</p>
<p begin="01:27:37.289" end="01:27:41.550" style="s2">have blown there&#39;s such a thing as</p>
<p begin="01:27:39.510" end="01:27:42.119" style="s2">political correctness hypothesis out of</p>
<p begin="01:27:41.550" end="01:27:43.650" style="s2">the water</p>
<p begin="01:27:42.119" end="01:27:45.630" style="s2">but that isn&#39;t what happened we found</p>
<p begin="01:27:43.650" end="01:27:48.150" style="s2">two clumps one of which looked like</p>
<p begin="01:27:45.630" end="01:27:49.670" style="s2">something like moderate leftism and the</p>
<p begin="01:27:48.150" end="01:27:51.900" style="s2">other that looked very much like</p>
<p begin="01:27:49.670" end="01:27:54.929" style="s2">totalitarian political correctness and</p>
<p begin="01:27:51.900" end="01:27:57.420" style="s2">it was very very robust finding and and</p>
<p begin="01:27:54.929" end="01:28:00.150" style="s2">we replicated it as well she did this</p>
<p begin="01:27:57.420" end="01:28:02.699" style="s2">for her master&#39;s thesis by the way and</p>
<p begin="01:28:00.150" end="01:28:04.739" style="s2">then we looked at what predicted these</p>
<p begin="01:28:02.699" end="01:28:06.900" style="s2">beliefs first of all that the</p>
<p begin="01:28:04.739" end="01:28:08.880" style="s2">correlation between the moderate leftist</p>
<p begin="01:28:06.900" end="01:28:10.199" style="s2">clump of questions and the radical</p>
<p begin="01:28:08.880" end="01:28:12.360" style="s2">leftist clump of questions actually</p>
<p begin="01:28:10.199" end="01:28:14.249" style="s2">wasn&#39;t very high and so one of the</p>
<p begin="01:28:12.360" end="01:28:16.019" style="s2">things that we surmise is that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:14.249" end="01:28:17.639" style="s2">an actual division on the left between</p>
<p begin="01:28:16.019" end="01:28:20.489" style="s2">the moderates and the radicals and</p>
<p begin="01:28:17.639" end="01:28:21.630" style="s2">that&#39;s just not played itself out and I</p>
<p begin="01:28:20.489" end="01:28:22.290" style="s2">think you can actually see that</p>
<p begin="01:28:21.630" end="01:28:24.210" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="01:28:22.290" end="01:28:26.790" style="s2">the proclivity of the radical leftists</p>
<p begin="01:28:24.210" end="01:28:28.770" style="s2">to devour themselves right so which</p>
<p begin="01:28:26.790" end="01:28:31.650" style="s2">happens on a very regular basis or</p>
<p begin="01:28:28.770" end="01:28:33.630" style="s2">perhaps you can see it in the proclivity</p>
<p begin="01:28:31.650" end="01:28:35.640" style="s2">of the radical leftists to go after the</p>
<p begin="01:28:33.630" end="01:28:38.250" style="s2">moderates when the martyrs criticize the</p>
<p begin="01:28:35.640" end="01:28:40.890" style="s2">radicals whatever so there&#39;s two clumps</p>
<p begin="01:28:38.250" end="01:28:42.800" style="s2">to political correctness both of them</p>
<p begin="01:28:40.890" end="01:28:45.210" style="s2">were predicted by trade agreeableness</p>
<p begin="01:28:42.800" end="01:28:46.710" style="s2">which is one of the traits that women</p>
<p begin="01:28:45.210" end="01:28:48.870" style="s2">score higher on than men it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:28:46.710" end="01:28:52.500" style="s2">antithesis of aggression by the way and</p>
<p begin="01:28:48.870" end="01:28:54.660" style="s2">by also by being female which was a real</p>
<p begin="01:28:52.500" end="01:28:56.370" style="s2">shock to us because most of the so let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:28:54.660" end="01:28:57.870" style="s2">say females and males differ with</p>
<p begin="01:28:56.370" end="01:29:00.180" style="s2">regards to some outcome you try to</p>
<p begin="01:28:57.870" end="01:29:01.410" style="s2">figure out why that is it might be just</p>
<p begin="01:29:00.180" end="01:29:02.970" style="s2">because they&#39;re female but there&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:29:01.410" end="01:29:04.590" style="s2">sorts of things associated with being</p>
<p begin="01:29:02.970" end="01:29:07.200" style="s2">female or male that are like</p>
<p begin="01:29:04.590" end="01:29:09.120" style="s2">second-order complications what we found</p>
<p begin="01:29:07.200" end="01:29:10.650" style="s2">almost invariably with the personality</p>
<p begin="01:29:09.120" end="01:29:12.270" style="s2">literature&#39;s if you look at differences</p>
<p begin="01:29:10.650" end="01:29:14.640" style="s2">between men and women and then you</p>
<p begin="01:29:12.270" end="01:29:16.470" style="s2">control for personality the differences</p>
<p begin="01:29:14.640" end="01:29:18.060" style="s2">go away so they&#39;re not differences</p>
<p begin="01:29:16.470" end="01:29:20.460" style="s2">between men and women per se they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:29:18.060" end="01:29:21.930" style="s2">differences between personality but with</p>
<p begin="01:29:20.460" end="01:29:23.790" style="s2">political correctness we found an</p>
<p begin="01:29:21.930" end="01:29:25.620" style="s2">effective agreeableness which was a pure</p>
<p begin="01:29:23.790" end="01:29:27.810" style="s2">personality effect and an effect of</p>
<p begin="01:29:25.620" end="01:29:29.670" style="s2">being female so we also found a</p>
<p begin="01:29:27.810" end="01:29:32.430" style="s2">pronounced effect of having taken at</p>
<p begin="01:29:29.670" end="01:29:34.260" style="s2">least one seminar that was politically</p>
<p begin="01:29:32.430" end="01:29:37.380" style="s2">correct in its orientation so that had a</p>
<p begin="01:29:34.260" end="01:29:39.660" style="s2">walloping effect so there does seem to</p>
<p begin="01:29:37.380" end="01:29:42.890" style="s2">be something about political according</p>
<p begin="01:29:39.660" end="01:29:45.870" style="s2">to that research which you know it&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="01:29:42.890" end="01:29:48.330" style="s2">try to rely on better research but none</p>
<p begin="01:29:45.870" end="01:29:50.370" style="s2">has been done so that&#39;s the best that I</p>
<p begin="01:29:48.330" end="01:29:52.260" style="s2">thought and and the woman who did this</p>
<p begin="01:29:50.370" end="01:29:53.850" style="s2">research is very very smart and the</p>
<p begin="01:29:52.260" end="01:29:56.880" style="s2">study was well done so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:53.850" end="01:29:58.650" style="s2">credible so and one of the things that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:29:56.880" end="01:30:01.740" style="s2">interesting to me about that is that it</p>
<p begin="01:29:58.650" end="01:30:04.020" style="s2">does tie into the Freudian nightmare of</p>
<p begin="01:30:01.740" end="01:30:06.240" style="s2">the devouring mother essentially which</p>
<p begin="01:30:04.020" end="01:30:08.130" style="s2">was Freud&#39;s I think signal contribution</p>
<p begin="01:30:06.240" end="01:30:10.380" style="s2">to psychopathology you know for most</p>
<p begin="01:30:08.130" end="01:30:12.000" style="s2">most of Freud&#39;s clients were people who</p>
<p begin="01:30:10.380" end="01:30:14.850" style="s2">were struggling to get out of the</p>
<p begin="01:30:12.000" end="01:30:16.350" style="s2">clutches of their family right and part</p>
<p begin="01:30:14.850" end="01:30:18.600" style="s2">of that is human beings are very</p>
<p begin="01:30:16.350" end="01:30:20.400" style="s2">dependent right because well because we</p>
<p begin="01:30:18.600" end="01:30:23.370" style="s2">have this incredibly long period of</p>
<p begin="01:30:20.400" end="01:30:27.060" style="s2">development 30 years maybe but certainly</p>
<p begin="01:30:23.370" end="01:30:30.300" style="s2">18 years and so it&#39;s hard to struggle up</p>
<p begin="01:30:27.060" end="01:30:32.190" style="s2">from infancy mature and leave as an</p>
<p begin="01:30:30.300" end="01:30:33.660" style="s2">independent creature and lots of people</p>
<p begin="01:30:32.190" end="01:30:35.250" style="s2">you see this and if you&#39;re a clinician</p>
<p begin="01:30:33.660" end="01:30:36.030" style="s2">you see this all the time people are so</p>
<p begin="01:30:35.250" end="01:30:37.739" style="s2">tangled up in</p>
<p begin="01:30:36.030" end="01:30:40.020" style="s2">families that they can&#39;t get away from</p>
<p begin="01:30:37.739" end="01:30:42.960" style="s2">them and that&#39;s the eatable situation</p>
<p begin="01:30:40.020" end="01:30:46.020" style="s2">that Freud described so so so</p>
<p begin="01:30:42.960" end="01:30:47.909" style="s2">brilliantly and Jung also elaborated on</p>
<p begin="01:30:46.020" end="01:30:51.360" style="s2">it a lot of that&#39;s a consequence of</p>
<p begin="01:30:47.909" end="01:30:54.780" style="s2">hyper dependence right it&#39;s it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:30:51.360" end="01:30:56.670" style="s2">danger of overprotection now there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:30:54.780" end="01:30:58.980" style="s2">rule if you&#39;re dealing with elderly</p>
<p begin="01:30:56.670" end="01:31:00.570" style="s2">people say in an elder care institution</p>
<p begin="01:30:58.980" end="01:31:02.520" style="s2">and the rule is something like don&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="01:31:00.570" end="01:31:04.860" style="s2">anything for your charges that they can</p>
<p begin="01:31:02.520" end="01:31:06.420" style="s2">do themselves it&#39;s kind of a harsh rule</p>
<p begin="01:31:04.860" end="01:31:08.250" style="s2">you know if you see someone struggling</p>
<p begin="01:31:06.420" end="01:31:10.139" style="s2">with their buttons maybe they&#39;re three</p>
<p begin="01:31:08.250" end="01:31:13.739" style="s2">years old you want to rush over and help</p>
<p begin="01:31:10.139" end="01:31:15.210" style="s2">it&#39;s like well maybe you don&#39;t because</p>
<p begin="01:31:13.739" end="01:31:18.059" style="s2">they need to learn how to do up their</p>
<p begin="01:31:15.210" end="01:31:20.369" style="s2">damn buttons or if there are 85 they</p>
<p begin="01:31:18.059" end="01:31:22.559" style="s2">need to maintain their independence as</p>
<p begin="01:31:20.369" end="01:31:26.940" style="s2">much as possible without your compassion</p>
<p begin="01:31:22.559" end="01:31:28.679" style="s2">stealing it from them okay well we could</p>
<p begin="01:31:26.940" end="01:31:31.440" style="s2">hypothesize that there would be no</p>
<p begin="01:31:28.679" end="01:31:33.989" style="s2">pathology as a consequence of the female</p>
<p begin="01:31:31.440" end="01:31:36.119" style="s2">rise to political power but given that</p>
<p begin="01:31:33.989" end="01:31:38.340" style="s2">females are human beings too and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:31:36.119" end="01:31:40.260" style="s2">pretty much rife with pathology the</p>

<p begin="01:31:40.260" end="01:31:45.239" style="s2">is like there is two male participation</p>
<p begin="01:31:43.710" end="01:31:47.190" style="s2">which would be more aggressive and hyper</p>
<p begin="01:31:45.239" end="01:31:49.289" style="s2">and hyper compressed nests and hyper</p>
<p begin="01:31:47.190" end="01:31:50.699" style="s2">competition the probability that there</p>
<p begin="01:31:49.289" end="01:31:52.949" style="s2">would be a downside is extraordinarily</p>
<p begin="01:31:50.699" end="01:31:54.900" style="s2">high well why wouldn&#39;t it be a downside</p>
<p begin="01:31:52.949" end="01:31:57.480" style="s2">associated with hyper protectiveness</p>
<p begin="01:31:54.900" end="01:31:58.739" style="s2">it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect and then</p>

<p begin="01:37:36.650" end="01:37:41.780" style="s2">obviously think that it&#39;s worthwhile to</p>
<p begin="01:37:39.229" end="01:37:43.820" style="s2">stand up and ask a question yes so you</p>
<p begin="01:37:41.780" end="01:37:46.340" style="s2">think that standing up and asking a</p>
<p begin="01:37:43.820" end="01:37:48.229" style="s2">question is better than not standing up</p>
<p begin="01:37:46.340" end="01:37:51.110" style="s2">and asking a question yes okay that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:37:48.229" end="01:37:53.119" style="s2">hierarchy yes of values yes okay without</p>

<p begin="01:37:53.119" end="01:37:58.280" style="s2">of course no no not of course wait it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:37:56.150" end="01:38:01.639" style="s2">hardly why I&#39;m defending the hierarchy</p>
<p begin="01:37:58.280" end="01:38:03.650" style="s2">without the hierarchy right what&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="01:38:01.639" end="01:38:06.499" style="s2">there is a hierarchy in society no</p>
<p begin="01:38:03.650" end="01:38:08.179" style="s2">there&#39;s multiple hierarchies in society</p>
<p begin="01:38:06.499" end="01:38:09.889" style="s2">right yes and you say that they are</p>
<p begin="01:38:08.179" end="01:38:12.309" style="s2">based at you you invoke the lobster</p>
<p begin="01:38:09.889" end="01:38:14.570" style="s2">right that they are based in in nature I</p>
<p begin="01:38:12.309" end="01:38:18.079" style="s2">said that they were inevitable yes yes</p>
<p begin="01:38:14.570" end="01:38:20.959" style="s2">they were inevitable good but my point</p>
<p begin="01:38:18.079" end="01:38:23.420" style="s2">is that this is dude you have a broader</p>
<p begin="01:38:20.959" end="01:38:26.510" style="s2">point than free speech this is one of</p>
<p begin="01:38:23.420" end="01:38:27.829" style="s2">the things you talk about yes yes okay</p>
<p begin="01:38:26.510" end="01:38:29.570" style="s2">whereas I think there are some other</p>
<p begin="01:38:27.829" end="01:38:31.699" style="s2">activists who focus on more exclusive</p>
<p begin="01:38:29.570" end="01:38:33.499" style="s2">not an activist there&#39;s some other</p>
<p begin="01:38:31.699" end="01:38:37.400" style="s2">individuals who engage in public</p>
<p begin="01:38:33.499" end="01:38:38.959" style="s2">political speech okay yeah who focused</p>
<p begin="01:38:37.400" end="01:38:40.579" style="s2">more exclusively on free speech whereas</p>
<p begin="01:38:38.959" end="01:38:42.459" style="s2">you have other goals in mind</p>
<p begin="01:38:40.579" end="01:38:45.229" style="s2">but one of the things that you&#39;re more</p>
<p begin="01:38:42.459" end="01:38:46.610" style="s2">inflammatory language and fair it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:38:45.229" end="01:38:48.590" style="s2">substantive disagreement has done I</p>
<p begin="01:38:46.610" end="01:38:49.729" style="s2">think is its politicized this free</p>
<p begin="01:38:48.590" end="01:38:51.889" style="s2">speech to an extent that someone like</p>
<p begin="01:38:49.729" end="01:38:53.510" style="s2">height hasn&#39;t I&#39;ve noticed that when</p>
<p begin="01:38:51.889" end="01:38:55.789" style="s2">someone hears the term free speech now</p>
<p begin="01:38:53.510" end="01:38:57.469" style="s2">they associate it with a specific set of</p>
<p begin="01:38:55.789" end="01:39:00.079" style="s2">thinkers often as viewed as on the</p>
<p begin="01:38:57.469" end="01:39:01.249" style="s2">extreme right and I think I I think</p>
<p begin="01:39:00.079" end="01:39:02.689" style="s2">arguably that&#39;s the problem of all</p>
<p begin="01:39:01.249" end="01:39:04.280" style="s2">factions in society because free speech</p>
<p begin="01:39:02.689" end="01:39:06.530" style="s2">should be a universal value poles</p>
<p begin="01:39:04.280" end="01:39:08.689" style="s2">certainly suggest that it&#39;s coming under</p>
<p begin="01:39:06.530" end="01:39:10.400" style="s2">increasing threat from both sides but I</p>
<p begin="01:39:08.689" end="01:39:11.360" style="s2">suppose the heart of my question in</p>
<p begin="01:39:10.400" end="01:39:14.780" style="s2">addition to of course these other</p>
<p begin="01:39:11.360" end="01:39:16.760" style="s2">observations is that do you believe free</p>
<p begin="01:39:14.780" end="01:39:18.019" style="s2">speech is your primary end or do you</p>
<p begin="01:39:16.760" end="01:39:19.400" style="s2">believe these other points you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="01:39:18.019" end="01:39:21.260" style="s2">important because I&#39;ve heard you a bunch</p>
<p begin="01:39:19.400" end="01:39:22.849" style="s2">of times defend free speech sort of</p>
<p begin="01:39:21.260" end="01:39:24.439" style="s2">contextually like you&#39;ve complained</p>
<p begin="01:39:22.849" end="01:39:25.579" style="s2">about some of the laws in Canada that</p>
<p begin="01:39:24.439" end="01:39:27.530" style="s2">you dislike that</p>
<p begin="01:39:25.579" end="01:39:29.209" style="s2">they institutionalize false facts into</p>
<p begin="01:39:27.530" end="01:39:31.280" style="s2">the law but it gives me that an</p>
<p begin="01:39:29.209" end="01:39:33.139" style="s2">absolutist defense of free speech makes</p>
<p begin="01:39:31.280" end="01:39:35.419" style="s2">no preference as to true or false the</p>
<p begin="01:39:33.139" end="01:39:37.039" style="s2">point is that&#39;s something you are being</p>
<p begin="01:39:35.419" end="01:39:38.539" style="s2">forced to say something it would be as</p>
<p begin="01:39:37.039" end="01:39:40.159" style="s2">bad as if you were forced to say</p>
<p begin="01:39:38.539" end="01:39:41.780" style="s2">something that is true because the point</p>
<p begin="01:39:40.159" end="01:39:42.979" style="s2">of free speech is that you can say</p>
<p begin="01:39:41.780" end="01:39:44.959" style="s2">whatever you want right</p>
<p begin="01:39:42.979" end="01:39:46.459" style="s2">no the point of free speech is so that</p>
<p begin="01:39:44.959" end="01:39:48.469" style="s2">you can think your way through life</p>
<p begin="01:39:46.459" end="01:39:50.929" style="s2">without running like butt headlong into</p>
<p begin="01:39:48.469" end="01:39:53.510" style="s2">a brick wall position a versus perfect</p>
<p begin="01:39:50.929" end="01:39:56.300" style="s2">position B is just as bad right even if</p>
<p begin="01:39:53.510" end="01:39:57.829" style="s2">one is true and the other is not okay</p>
<p begin="01:39:56.300" end="01:39:59.059" style="s2">well there was a bunch of questions yes</p>
<p begin="01:39:57.829" end="01:40:00.739" style="s2">good job by the way</p>
<p begin="01:39:59.059" end="01:40:06.919" style="s2">well actually what can I just ask you</p>
<p begin="01:40:00.739" end="01:40:08.959" style="s2">one additional addendum which is I I</p>
<p begin="01:40:06.919" end="01:40:10.969" style="s2">think the the politicization of free</p>
<p begin="01:40:08.959" end="01:40:12.889" style="s2">speech is by far the biggest threat to</p>
<p begin="01:40:10.969" end="01:40:16.629" style="s2">free speech because this is all the</p>
<p begin="01:40:12.889" end="01:40:16.629" style="s2">radical leftists are the biggest well</p>
<p begin="01:40:18.609" end="01:40:22.609" style="s2">eluded to in previous questions the</p>
<p begin="01:40:20.899" end="01:40:24.679" style="s2">substantive threats to free speech in</p>
<p begin="01:40:22.609" end="01:40:26.179" style="s2">much of the world in Europe certainly I</p>
<p begin="01:40:24.679" end="01:40:27.469" style="s2">think in the United States as well from</p>
<p begin="01:40:26.179" end="01:40:29.359" style="s2">the government have come from the</p>
<p begin="01:40:27.469" end="01:40:31.579" style="s2">radical right and I think it&#39;s fair to</p>
<p begin="01:40:29.359" end="01:40:33.229" style="s2">say that on the specific narrow subset</p>
<p begin="01:40:31.579" end="01:40:34.789" style="s2">of certain departments on liberal arts</p>
<p begin="01:40:33.229" end="01:40:36.800" style="s2">colleges it&#39;s fair to say a threat comes</p>
<p begin="01:40:34.789" end="01:40:39.139" style="s2">from the left though its scope is in</p>
<p begin="01:40:36.800" end="01:40:41.239" style="s2">dispute but my question is do you think</p>
<p begin="01:40:39.139" end="01:40:43.070" style="s2">that the way you talk about free speech</p>
<p begin="01:40:41.239" end="01:40:44.599" style="s2">the way you link it to specific issues</p>
<p begin="01:40:43.070" end="01:40:47.089" style="s2">the way you use inflammatory language</p>
<p begin="01:40:44.599" end="01:40:48.559" style="s2">and the way you seem to make it you seem</p>
<p begin="01:40:47.089" end="01:40:49.789" style="s2">to defend a specific set of frees</p>
<p begin="01:40:48.559" end="01:40:51.289" style="s2">because there&#39;s certainly plenty of</p>
<p begin="01:40:49.789" end="01:40:52.909" style="s2">instances of free speech attacked on the</p>
<p begin="01:40:51.289" end="01:40:55.369" style="s2">other side that you don&#39;t mention as</p>
<p begin="01:40:52.909" end="01:40:56.989" style="s2">much do you think you risk politicizing</p>
<p begin="01:40:55.369" end="01:40:58.729" style="s2">this because it seems to me this okay</p>
<p begin="01:40:56.989" end="01:41:00.679" style="s2">and RIT not think that&#39;s a far greater</p>
<p begin="01:40:58.729" end="01:41:02.629" style="s2">threat because for example the array oh</p>
<p begin="01:41:00.679" end="01:41:04.189" style="s2">sorry the NRA is a group in the United</p>
<p begin="01:41:02.629" end="01:41:07.579" style="s2">States the defense guns rights right now</p>
<p begin="01:41:04.189" end="01:41:10.519" style="s2">you hold it yes we need a question yes</p>
<p begin="01:41:07.579" end="01:41:12.260" style="s2">okay like I says you&#39;re doing fine it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:41:10.519" end="01:41:14.929" style="s2">just too much like I can&#39;t keep it you</p>
<p begin="01:41:12.260" end="01:41:16.639" style="s2">think that your behavior risk</p>
<p begin="01:41:14.929" end="01:41:19.519" style="s2">politicizing it and do you think that</p>
<p begin="01:41:16.639" end="01:41:22.059" style="s2">polarization is justified I think my</p>
<p begin="01:41:19.519" end="01:41:24.919" style="s2">behavior risks politicizing it yes I</p>
<p begin="01:41:22.059" end="01:41:28.159" style="s2">would rather it not be politicized and</p>
<p begin="01:41:24.919" end="01:41:30.349" style="s2">I&#39;m doing what I can to manage that risk</p>
<p begin="01:41:28.159" end="01:41:32.030" style="s2">however it&#39;s become political in my</p>
<p begin="01:41:30.349" end="01:41:34.849" style="s2">country because the government</p>
<p begin="01:41:32.030" end="01:41:37.579" style="s2">implemented compelled speech legislation</p>
<p begin="01:41:34.849" end="01:41:39.120" style="s2">so I wasn&#39;t complaining about that</p>
<p begin="01:41:37.579" end="01:41:42.990" style="s2">before it</p>
<p begin="01:41:39.120" end="01:41:46.470" style="s2">Kame political now and there are there</p>
<p begin="01:41:42.990" end="01:41:48.150" style="s2">is a time even when you&#39;re detached in</p>
<p begin="01:41:46.470" end="01:41:51.510" style="s2">some sense from the political realm that</p>
<p begin="01:41:48.150" end="01:41:53.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t be detached anymore well I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:41:51.510" end="01:41:56.160" style="s2">not happy with the fact that this has</p>
<p begin="01:41:53.280" end="01:41:58.230" style="s2">become politicized you could say that I</p>
<p begin="01:41:56.160" end="01:42:00.630" style="s2">haven&#39;t done a stellar job in ensuring</p>
<p begin="01:41:58.230" end="01:42:03.540" style="s2">in every possible manner that this has</p>
<p begin="01:42:00.630" end="01:42:07.860" style="s2">remained neutrally apolitical probably</p>
<p begin="01:42:03.540" end="01:42:09.930" style="s2">true you know but I&#39;m not particularly</p>
<p begin="01:42:07.860" end="01:42:12.540" style="s2">unhappy with the way things have gone so</p>
<p begin="01:42:09.930" end="01:42:15.600" style="s2">far so and I&#39;m not happy with the</p>
<p begin="01:42:12.540" end="01:42:17.610" style="s2">radical left and so if they&#39;re irritated</p>
<p begin="01:42:15.600" end="01:42:20.880" style="s2">at me so much the better as far as I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:42:17.610" end="01:42:25.890" style="s2">concerned so have I conducted myself</p>
<p begin="01:42:20.880" end="01:42:29.310" style="s2">perfectly it&#39;s like undoubtedly no so</p>
<p begin="01:42:25.890" end="01:42:34.580" style="s2">I&#39;m I&#39;ve got more than my fair share of</p>
<p begin="01:42:29.310" end="01:42:41.550" style="s2">faults and a temper is one of them but</p>
<p begin="01:42:34.580" end="01:42:44.180" style="s2">I&#39;m muddling through alright I&#39;m almost</p>
<p begin="01:42:41.550" end="01:42:49.200" style="s2">well hesitant to ask a question now but</p>
<p begin="01:42:44.180" end="01:42:51.200" style="s2">so one thing I was wondering about was a</p>
<p begin="01:42:49.200" end="01:42:55.040" style="s2">lot of people I think would argue that</p>
<p begin="01:42:51.200" end="01:42:57.650" style="s2">have the values of Western civilization</p>
<p begin="01:42:55.040" end="01:42:59.490" style="s2">free-speech the right of the individual</p>
<p begin="01:42:57.650" end="01:43:04.290" style="s2">separation between church and state</p>
<p begin="01:42:59.490" end="01:43:07.260" style="s2">have developed through not so much in</p>
<p begin="01:43:04.290" end="01:43:09.150" style="s2">continues with the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="01:43:07.260" end="01:43:10.800" style="s2">morality but almost in their overthrow</p>
<p begin="01:43:09.150" end="01:43:14.670" style="s2">through such things as the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:43:10.800" end="01:43:17.580" style="s2">the Scientific Revolution and how these</p>
<p begin="01:43:14.670" end="01:43:22.410" style="s2">values would never have come out of just</p>
<p begin="01:43:17.580" end="01:43:24.870" style="s2">simply the continuous of the Middle Ages</p>
<p begin="01:43:22.410" end="01:43:27.740" style="s2">and that judeo-christian morality but my</p>
<p begin="01:43:24.870" end="01:43:30.330" style="s2">understanding of your view would be that</p>
<p begin="01:43:27.740" end="01:43:31.800" style="s2">those values are inherent in the</p>
<p begin="01:43:30.330" end="01:43:36.210" style="s2">judeo-christian morality I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="01:43:31.800" end="01:43:38.250" style="s2">wondering how you think yeah just what</p>
<p begin="01:43:36.210" end="01:43:42.170" style="s2">is the values you take around in my own</p>
<p begin="01:43:38.250" end="01:43:42.170" style="s2">world yeah it&#39;s a great question</p>
<p begin="01:43:47.030" end="01:43:52.500" style="s2">they&#39;re not rational values they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:43:50.550" end="01:43:55.650" style="s2">deeper than rational values I mean it</p>
<p begin="01:43:52.500" end="01:43:57.660" style="s2">was a surprise to meet going back into</p>
<p begin="01:43:55.650" end="01:44:03.150" style="s2">the past let&#39;s say to see how deep these</p>
<p begin="01:43:57.660" end="01:44:05.270" style="s2">values were but I would say that not</p>
<p begin="01:44:03.150" end="01:44:07.650" style="s2">only are they part of the</p>
<p begin="01:44:05.270" end="01:44:10.830" style="s2">judeo-christian story let&#39;s say but that</p>
<p begin="01:44:07.650" end="01:44:12.810" style="s2">they&#39;re grounded in phenomena that are</p>
<p begin="01:44:10.830" end="01:44:15.570" style="s2">even deeper than that there&#39;s been a</p>
<p begin="01:44:12.810" end="01:44:18.360" style="s2">fair bit of investigation into the</p>
<p begin="01:44:15.570" end="01:44:22.170" style="s2">emergence of fair play let&#39;s say among</p>
<p begin="01:44:18.360" end="01:44:25.010" style="s2">animals rats primates wolves and so</p>
<p begin="01:44:22.170" end="01:44:27.330" style="s2">forth there&#39;s an ethos that emerges</p>
<p begin="01:44:25.010" end="01:44:29.400" style="s2">behaviorally and and is then perhaps</p>
<p begin="01:44:27.330" end="01:44:33.330" style="s2">woven into narrative and then codified</p>
<p begin="01:44:29.400" end="01:44:35.580" style="s2">that seems to be isomorphic across these</p>
<p begin="01:44:33.330" end="01:44:38.219" style="s2">different levels and I think it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="01:44:35.580" end="01:44:40.530" style="s2">well articulated in the narrative sense</p>
<p begin="01:44:38.219" end="01:44:42.810" style="s2">in the judeo-christian corpus of stories</p>
<p begin="01:44:40.530" end="01:44:45.239" style="s2">and that it&#39;s out of that that our legal</p>
<p begin="01:44:42.810" end="01:44:47.670" style="s2">systems and and institutions of rights</p>
<p begin="01:44:45.239" end="01:44:49.350" style="s2">have emerged people make the case that</p>
<p begin="01:44:47.670" end="01:44:52.310" style="s2">that was fundamentally an Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:44:49.350" end="01:44:55.380" style="s2">issue and it was certainly the case that</p>
<p begin="01:44:52.310" end="01:44:57.690" style="s2">the rational clarity that came along</p>
<p begin="01:44:55.380" end="01:44:59.520" style="s2">with the Enlightenment increased the</p>
<p begin="01:44:57.690" end="01:45:02.340" style="s2">degree to which that was articulated and</p>
<p begin="01:44:59.520" end="01:45:04.590" style="s2">transformed into law but I think to</p>
<p begin="01:45:02.340" end="01:45:09.390" style="s2">attribute it to that is a great mistake</p>
<p begin="01:45:04.590" end="01:45:12.060" style="s2">I think it&#39;s I think the time span view</p>
<p begin="01:45:09.390" end="01:45:15.449" style="s2">is way too narrow that&#39;s 500 years ago</p>
<p begin="01:45:12.060" end="01:45:19.520" style="s2">I&#39;m a biologically minded guy it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:45:15.449" end="01:45:22.830" style="s2">500 years that&#39;s nothing 5,000 years</p>
<p begin="01:45:19.520" end="01:45:26.310" style="s2">well that&#39;s starting to register 50,000</p>
<p begin="01:45:22.830" end="01:45:28.080" style="s2">years it&#39;s worthy of note 6 million</p>
<p begin="01:45:26.310" end="01:45:30.480" style="s2">years now you&#39;re getting somewhere</p>
<p begin="01:45:28.080" end="01:45:33.780" style="s2">there&#39;s the ethic that we&#39;re discussing</p>
<p begin="01:45:30.480" end="01:45:37.910" style="s2">is way deeper than something conjured up</p>
<p begin="01:45:33.780" end="01:45:41.400" style="s2">in like 1500 by some northern Italians</p>
<p begin="01:45:37.910" end="01:45:43.650" style="s2">so it&#39;s an articulation of a</p>
<p begin="01:45:41.400" end="01:45:45.690" style="s2">substructure that&#39;s much deeper than the</p>
<p begin="01:45:43.650" end="01:45:47.610" style="s2">articulation itself that&#39;s what it looks</p>
<p begin="01:45:45.690" end="01:45:51.120" style="s2">like to me now I think there&#39;s room for</p>
<p begin="01:45:47.610" end="01:45:52.860" style="s2">intelligent debate about that but I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:45:51.120" end="01:45:57.120" style="s2">looked at the Enlightenment thinkers and</p>
<p begin="01:45:52.860" end="01:45:58.110" style="s2">at the deeper at people who I regard as</p>
<p begin="01:45:57.120" end="01:45:59.640" style="s2">deeper and</p>
<p begin="01:45:58.110" end="01:46:01.620" style="s2">think the deeper guys Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:45:59.640" end="01:46:03.990" style="s2">Dostoevsky Jung in particular</p>
<p begin="01:46:01.620" end="01:46:07.650" style="s2">Solzhenitsyn to some degree they&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="01:46:03.990" end="01:46:08.730" style="s2">it right so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:46:07.650" end="01:46:10.470" style="s2">think that our rights are an</p>
<p begin="01:46:08.730" end="01:46:14.130" style="s2">Enlightenment project their</p>
<p begin="01:46:10.470" end="01:46:16.470" style="s2">instantiation into codified law that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:46:14.130" end="01:46:18.450" style="s2">more part parcel of the Enlightenment</p>
<p begin="01:46:16.470" end="01:46:20.880" style="s2">now that would be particularly manifest</p>
<p begin="01:46:18.450" end="01:46:24.780" style="s2">in a place like the United States you</p>
<p begin="01:46:20.880" end="01:46:28.080" style="s2">know so yeah if I can just ask a related</p>
<p begin="01:46:24.780" end="01:46:29.550" style="s2">question you mentioned each and because</p>
<p begin="01:46:28.080" end="01:46:30.810" style="s2">from what I understand of your work you</p>
<p begin="01:46:29.550" end="01:46:32.790" style="s2">just seem to draw from him a lot and</p>
<p begin="01:46:30.810" end="01:46:35.010" style="s2">again you said you agree with him so I</p>
<p begin="01:46:32.790" end="01:46:38.820" style="s2">guess you know well he thinks a lot of</p>
<p begin="01:46:35.010" end="01:46:40.740" style="s2">things yes I guess I I&#39;m wondering where</p>
<p begin="01:46:38.820" end="01:46:42.810" style="s2">do you think because I mean I imagine</p>
<p begin="01:46:40.740" end="01:46:44.790" style="s2">you imagine he went wrong in his</p>
<p begin="01:46:42.810" end="01:46:48.780" style="s2">interpretation of the Christian morality</p>
<p begin="01:46:44.790" end="01:46:51.330" style="s2">and how he believes and how he believes</p>
<p begin="01:46:48.780" end="01:46:53.070" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of a pernicious slave-based</p>
<p begin="01:46:51.330" end="01:46:55.290" style="s2">morality so what do you what exactly do</p>
<p begin="01:46:53.070" end="01:46:57.240" style="s2">you think it because you agree with a</p>
<p begin="01:46:55.290" end="01:46:59.340" style="s2">lot he&#39;s really pretty Christian</p>
<p begin="01:46:57.240" end="01:47:02.310" style="s2">morality he creates critique Christian</p>
<p begin="01:46:59.340" end="01:47:04.560" style="s2">dogma and structures that&#39;s not exactly</p>
<p begin="01:47:02.310" end="01:47:06.630" style="s2">the same thing so you would agree with</p>
<p begin="01:47:04.560" end="01:47:09.810" style="s2">him then well like I said he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:47:06.630" end="01:47:12.060" style="s2">complicated guy but I think the slave</p>
<p begin="01:47:09.810" end="01:47:16.140" style="s2">morality idea the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:12.060" end="01:47:18.390" style="s2">oppressed are somehow virtuous which I</p>
<p begin="01:47:16.140" end="01:47:18.960" style="s2">don&#39;t think is a central Christian idea</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.390" end="01:47:20.940" style="s2">by the way</p>
<p begin="01:47:18.960" end="01:47:23.220" style="s2">it was something that he criticized as</p>
<p begin="01:47:20.940" end="01:47:26.700" style="s2">part and parcel of what was constructed</p>
<p begin="01:47:23.220" end="01:47:28.920" style="s2">and and and concretize din in an</p>
<p begin="01:47:26.700" end="01:47:31.440" style="s2">institutional Christianity and Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="01:47:28.920" end="01:47:33.510" style="s2">also and this is a deeper critique I</p>
<p begin="01:47:31.440" end="01:47:35.580" style="s2">think need to really criticized</p>
<p begin="01:47:33.510" end="01:47:38.130" style="s2">institutional Christianity particularly</p>
<p begin="01:47:35.580" end="01:47:40.620" style="s2">the Protestant and Catholic forms I</p>
<p begin="01:47:38.130" end="01:47:43.110" style="s2">would say for insufficient attention</p>
<p begin="01:47:40.620" end="01:47:45.240" style="s2">paid to the imitation of Christ and too</p>
<p begin="01:47:43.110" end="01:47:47.250" style="s2">much attention paid to the idea that the</p>
<p begin="01:47:45.240" end="01:47:49.530" style="s2">work of redemption had already been done</p>
<p begin="01:47:47.250" end="01:47:51.210" style="s2">which is something that also divides the</p>
<p begin="01:47:49.530" end="01:47:52.890" style="s2">Orthodox Christian types from the</p>
<p begin="01:47:51.210" end="01:47:55.050" style="s2">Protestants and the Catholics because</p>
<p begin="01:47:52.890" end="01:47:57.360" style="s2">the Orthodox types tend to tilt more</p>
<p begin="01:47:55.050" end="01:48:00.120" style="s2">towards the moral demand that you</p>
<p begin="01:47:57.360" end="01:48:03.720" style="s2">imitate Christ in your own life and so</p>
<p begin="01:48:00.120" end="01:48:06.270" style="s2">Nietzsche&#39;s a very it you can&#39;t some him</p>
<p begin="01:48:03.720" end="01:48:08.640" style="s2">up very easily and I found him</p>
<p begin="01:48:06.270" end="01:48:11.970" style="s2">extraordinarily useful in training me</p>
<p begin="01:48:08.640" end="01:48:13.440" style="s2">how to think to say to say that you</p>
<p begin="01:48:11.970" end="01:48:15.600" style="s2">agree with him I don&#39;t think that you</p>
<p begin="01:48:13.440" end="01:48:18.000" style="s2">can say with someone like Nietzsche that</p>
<p begin="01:48:15.600" end="01:48:20.130" style="s2">you agree with him because you know</p>
<p begin="01:48:18.000" end="01:48:21.570" style="s2">Nietzsche had this is one thing that</p>
<p begin="01:48:20.130" end="01:48:23.420" style="s2">Nietzsche said that I really got a kick</p>
<p begin="01:48:21.570" end="01:48:26.220" style="s2">out of because it was the it&#39;s the most</p>
<p begin="01:48:23.420" end="01:48:31.710" style="s2">most arrogant statement I&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="01:48:26.220" end="01:48:34.460" style="s2">anyone make he said I can write in a</p>
<p begin="01:48:31.710" end="01:48:38.790" style="s2">sentence what it takes other people a</p>
<p begin="01:48:34.460" end="01:48:40.760" style="s2">book to relate and then he said no what</p>
<p begin="01:48:38.790" end="01:48:43.410" style="s2">other people can&#39;t even relate in a book</p>
<p begin="01:48:40.760" end="01:48:45.180" style="s2">and that&#39;s exactly right like if you</p>
<p begin="01:48:43.410" end="01:48:47.850" style="s2">read Beyond Good and Evil for example</p>
<p begin="01:48:45.180" end="01:48:49.710" style="s2">which is mostly a four isms so because</p>
<p begin="01:48:47.850" end="01:48:51.840" style="s2">he was a very sick man and he couldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:48:49.710" end="01:48:53.400" style="s2">write for long periods of time so he</p>
<p begin="01:48:51.840" end="01:48:56.130" style="s2">would think for long periods of time and</p>
<p begin="01:48:53.400" end="01:48:59.580" style="s2">then write down a little bomb and beyond</p>
<p begin="01:48:56.130" end="01:49:03.030" style="s2">good and evil is just sequential pieces</p>
<p begin="01:48:59.580" end="01:49:05.550" style="s2">of dynamite and he wasn&#39;t trying to be</p>
<p begin="01:49:03.030" end="01:49:07.140" style="s2">systematic precisely and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="01:49:05.550" end="01:49:09.840" style="s2">it&#39;s not so easy to agree or disagree</p>
<p begin="01:49:07.140" end="01:49:11.730" style="s2">with Nietzsche but you can sure let the</p>
<p begin="01:49:09.840" end="01:49:15.240" style="s2">bombs go off in your brain if you read</p>
<p begin="01:49:11.730" end="01:49:17.100" style="s2">what he has to say and he he was an</p>
<p begin="01:49:15.240" end="01:49:20.100" style="s2">interesting critic of Christianity</p>
<p begin="01:49:17.100" end="01:49:22.110" style="s2">because you know if you&#39;re all warped</p>
<p begin="01:49:20.100" end="01:49:24.090" style="s2">and bent and someone comes along and</p>
<p begin="01:49:22.110" end="01:49:25.440" style="s2">tells you how you&#39;re warped and bent in</p>
<p begin="01:49:24.090" end="01:49:26.970" style="s2">a manner that might enable you to</p>
<p begin="01:49:25.440" end="01:49:30.090" style="s2">straighten up it&#39;s not obvious that</p>
<p begin="01:49:26.970" end="01:49:32.610" style="s2">they&#39;re that you&#39;re their enemy that</p>
<p begin="01:49:30.090" end="01:49:34.170" style="s2">they&#39;re your enemy and I think that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:49:32.610" end="01:49:38.010" style="s2">the right way to read Nietzsche with</p>
<p begin="01:49:34.170" end="01:49:41.490" style="s2">regards to Christianity so he there was</p>
<p begin="01:49:38.010" end="01:49:44.630" style="s2">plenty of rot and that was part of what</p>
<p begin="01:49:41.490" end="01:49:48.060" style="s2">was causing let&#39;s say the death of God</p>
<p begin="01:49:44.630" end="01:49:52.200" style="s2">now it isn&#39;t obvious at all that</p>
<p begin="01:49:48.060" end="01:49:55.110" style="s2">Nietzsche was antithetical II opposed to</p>
<p begin="01:49:52.200" end="01:49:56.970" style="s2">the founding ideas in fact there&#39;s many</p>
<p begin="01:49:55.110" end="01:50:03.180" style="s2">places where he writes that indicate</p>
<p begin="01:49:56.970" end="01:50:06.240" style="s2">quite the contrary so thank you okay so</p>
<p begin="01:50:03.180" end="01:50:09.590" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna go to Alex and then Sayid is</p>
<p begin="01:50:06.240" end="01:50:09.590" style="s2">going to distribute them</p>
<p begin="01:50:16.130" end="01:50:19.199" style="s2">thank you for being here I really</p>
<p begin="01:50:18.270" end="01:50:21.059" style="s2">appreciate it</p>
<p begin="01:50:19.199" end="01:50:23.760" style="s2">so I was watching a few of your</p>
<p begin="01:50:21.059" end="01:50:26.130" style="s2">interviews in preparation for this and I</p>
<p begin="01:50:23.760" end="01:50:28.650" style="s2">heard you speak about religion quite a</p>
<p begin="01:50:26.130" end="01:50:30.239" style="s2">bit and if you look up what religion</p>
<p begin="01:50:28.650" end="01:50:32.760" style="s2">means in the Webster dictionary you get</p>
<p begin="01:50:30.239" end="01:50:35.790" style="s2">something like a system of faith</p>
<p begin="01:50:32.760" end="01:50:37.829" style="s2">centered on supernatural being or beings</p>
<p begin="01:50:35.790" end="01:50:39.480" style="s2">or something like that but I&#39;ve heard</p>
<p begin="01:50:37.829" end="01:50:41.280" style="s2">you use religion to describe things like</p>
<p begin="01:50:39.480" end="01:50:43.320" style="s2">punk rockers for example that that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="01:50:41.280" end="01:50:45.510" style="s2">religious experience so my first</p>
<p begin="01:50:43.320" end="01:50:48.210" style="s2">question would be how do you define what</p>
<p begin="01:50:45.510" end="01:50:53.360" style="s2">is considered religious and then sort of</p>
<p begin="01:50:48.210" end="01:50:57.329" style="s2">as a follow-up to that if say Sam Harris</p>
<p begin="01:50:53.360" end="01:51:01.530" style="s2">what&#39;s that religious is what you act</p>
<p begin="01:50:57.329" end="01:51:04.290" style="s2">out anything you act out everything you</p>
<p begin="01:51:01.530" end="01:51:06.869" style="s2">act out is is predicated on your</p>
<p begin="01:51:04.290" end="01:51:09.300" style="s2">implicit axioms and the system of</p>
<p begin="01:51:06.869" end="01:51:11.460" style="s2">implicit axioms that you hold as primary</p>
<p begin="01:51:09.300" end="01:51:12.599" style="s2">is your religious belief system it</p>
<p begin="01:51:11.460" end="01:51:16.829" style="s2">doesn&#39;t matter whether you&#39;re an atheist</p>
<p begin="01:51:12.599" end="01:51:20.190" style="s2">or not that&#39;s just surface that&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="01:51:16.829" end="01:51:24.030" style="s2">surface noise so it has nothing to do</p>
<p begin="01:51:20.190" end="01:51:27.809" style="s2">with divinity or or it doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:54:41.260" end="01:54:45.880" style="s2">like his conception of what is religious</p>
<p begin="01:54:43.570" end="01:54:49.210" style="s2">is very different from yours yeah well</p>
<p begin="01:54:45.880" end="01:54:51.340" style="s2">he tends to think of religious religious</p>
<p begin="01:54:49.210" end="01:54:53.770" style="s2">thought the same way that a smart</p>

<p begin="01:55:00.489" end="01:55:04.300" style="s2">the heart of the matter you know and I</p>
<p begin="01:55:01.929" end="01:55:07.000" style="s2">just finished reading all of Sam&#39;s books</p>
<p begin="01:55:04.300" end="01:55:09.310" style="s2">in the last couple of weeks and as far</p>
<p begin="01:55:07.000" end="01:55:11.500" style="s2">as I&#39;m concerned he doesn&#39;t ever get to</p>
<p begin="01:55:09.310" end="01:55:13.570" style="s2">the bottom of the issue he doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:55:11.500" end="01:55:16.510" style="s2">address the fundamental thinkers there</p>
<p begin="01:55:13.570" end="01:55:20.290" style="s2">are some profound thinkers Dostoyevsky&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:55:16.510" end="01:55:22.030" style="s2">one Tolstoy Nietzsche Jung&#39;s like</p>

<p begin="01:55:39.190" end="01:55:43.420" style="s2">naive fundamentalists and I have some</p>

<p begin="01:55:45.130" end="01:55:50.849" style="s2">basically saying is something like this</p>
<p begin="01:55:46.869" end="01:55:53.560" style="s2">look we have an ethos that&#39;s valuable</p>
<p begin="01:55:50.849" end="01:55:55.929" style="s2">you scientist types are casually</p>
<p begin="01:55:53.560" end="01:55:58.330" style="s2">dismantling it what the hell are we</p>

<p begin="01:55:58.330" end="01:56:01.869" style="s2">don&#39;t know what to do about that so they</p>
<p begin="01:55:59.710" end="01:56:04.300" style="s2">say well creationism is science it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:56:01.869" end="01:56:07.000" style="s2">like well no it&#39;s not but that doesn&#39;t</p>

<p begin="01:56:07.000" end="01:56:11.770" style="s2">point is there&#39;s something valuable here</p>
<p begin="01:56:08.619" end="01:56:13.540" style="s2">it&#39;s like don&#39;t break it casually what</p>
<p begin="01:56:11.770" end="01:56:15.909" style="s2">are gonna replace it with the new</p>

<p begin="01:57:02.250" end="01:57:07.050" style="s2">ask you although it may be a very broad</p>
<p begin="01:57:04.440" end="01:57:11.489" style="s2">question what is the place of the</p>
<p begin="01:57:07.050" end="01:57:13.560" style="s2">religious in stories and religious is</p>
<p begin="01:57:11.489" end="01:57:16.050" style="s2">something like the grammatical structure</p>
<p begin="01:57:13.560" end="01:57:18.530" style="s2">of stories like if you go down and you</p>
<p begin="01:57:16.050" end="01:57:22.380" style="s2">look at what makes a story a story</p>
<p begin="01:57:18.530" end="01:57:24.480" style="s2">that&#39;s religious yeah it&#39;s not a story</p>
<p begin="01:57:22.380" end="01:57:26.909" style="s2">otherwise like a story is a particular</p>
<p begin="01:57:24.480" end="01:57:29.070" style="s2">sort of thing again in a simplest sense</p>
<p begin="01:57:26.909" end="01:57:32.929" style="s2">the story is an account of how to get</p>
<p begin="01:57:29.070" end="01:57:35.850" style="s2">from point A to point B it&#39;s like a map</p>
<p begin="01:57:32.929" end="01:57:37.320" style="s2">but there&#39;s a value structure inherent</p>
<p begin="01:57:35.850" end="01:57:39.239" style="s2">in that obviously because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="01:57:37.320" end="01:57:41.550" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t go from point A to point B so</p>
<p begin="01:57:39.239" end="01:57:43.110" style="s2">just to make the map means to adopt a</p>
<p begin="01:57:41.550" end="01:57:44.429" style="s2">value structure but there but the story</p>
<p begin="01:57:43.110" end="01:57:46.380" style="s2">is actually more complicated than that</p>

<p begin="01:58:06.719" end="01:58:10.800" style="s2">become religious let&#39;s say is because it</p>
<p begin="01:58:09.060" end="01:58:13.560" style="s2">has something to do with the gap between</p>
<p begin="01:58:10.800" end="01:58:15.840" style="s2">the finite incomprehensible and the</p>
<p begin="01:58:13.560" end="01:58:17.429" style="s2">infinite and uncomprehensible it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="01:58:15.840" end="01:58:19.739" style="s2">we live in the finite incomprehensible</p>
<p begin="01:58:17.429" end="01:58:21.480" style="s2">but we&#39;re surrounded by the infinite and</p>
<p begin="01:58:19.739" end="01:58:23.730" style="s2">incomprehensible and there has to be a</p>
<p begin="01:58:21.480" end="01:58:26.040" style="s2">border between those of some like a</p>
<p begin="01:58:23.730" end="01:58:28.350" style="s2">mediating border that&#39;s poetry and art</p>
<p begin="01:58:26.040" end="01:58:31.650" style="s2">that&#39;s narrative that&#39;s religion and</p>
<p begin="01:58:28.350" end="01:58:34.679" style="s2">it&#39;s that it&#39;s that strange metaphorical</p>
<p begin="01:58:31.650" end="01:58:37.230" style="s2">reality let&#39;s say that&#39;s not factual and</p>
<p begin="01:58:34.679" end="01:58:39.510" style="s2">it&#39;s not comprehensible but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="01:58:37.230" end="01:58:43.140" style="s2">infinitely incomprehensible either it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:58:39.510" end="01:58:45.210" style="s2">a bridge between the two so and as you</p>
<p begin="01:58:43.140" end="01:58:48.330" style="s2">move closer to the infinite and</p>
<p begin="01:58:45.210" end="01:58:50.400" style="s2">incomprehensible across that bridge you</p>
<p begin="01:58:48.330" end="01:58:52.650" style="s2">get farther and farther away from what</p>
<p begin="01:58:50.400" end="01:58:55.290" style="s2">you understand right but how could it be</p>
<p begin="01:58:52.650" end="01:58:58.040" style="s2">otherwise given that you&#39;re finite you</p>
<p begin="01:58:55.290" end="01:59:00.459" style="s2">are a finite being surrounded by</p>
<p begin="01:58:58.040" end="01:59:03.189" style="s2">infinite what&#39;s infinite</p>
<p begin="01:59:00.459" end="01:59:05.019" style="s2">incomprehensible and that was his</p>

<p begin="01:59:05.019" end="01:59:10.209" style="s2">they can&#39;t that it&#39;s hard for them to</p>
<p begin="01:59:06.939" end="01:59:13.030" style="s2">make this - that&#39;s what poets come and</p>
<p begin="01:59:10.209" end="01:59:15.610" style="s2">that&#39;s exactly this is I learned a lot</p>
<p begin="01:59:13.030" end="01:59:17.739" style="s2">of this from young because Young&#39;s idea</p>
<p begin="01:59:15.610" end="01:59:20.199" style="s2">was that rationality is embedded in a</p>
<p begin="01:59:17.739" end="01:59:21.849" style="s2">dream like there&#39;s the infinite</p>
<p begin="01:59:20.199" end="01:59:24.400" style="s2">unknowable and then there&#39;s the dream</p>
<p begin="01:59:21.849" end="01:59:26.800" style="s2">and then inside the dream is the</p>
<p begin="01:59:24.400" end="01:59:31.209" style="s2">rational domain and I believe that to be</p>
<p begin="01:59:26.800" end="01:59:31.929" style="s2">the case why else would we dream we have</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.209" end="01:59:35.110" style="s2">to dream</p>
<p begin="01:59:31.929" end="01:59:37.570" style="s2">if we don&#39;t dream we we go insane it</p>
<p begin="01:59:35.110" end="01:59:41.670" style="s2">doesn&#39;t take very long and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:59:37.570" end="01:59:41.670" style="s2">there&#39;s an element of poetic</p>
<p begin="01:59:42.059" end="01:59:47.650" style="s2">conceptualization that grounds us and it</p>
<p begin="01:59:45.039" end="01:59:50.590" style="s2">has to be taken seriously you know them</p>
<p begin="01:59:47.650" end="01:59:52.869" style="s2">the rational critics of Dreams think</p>
<p begin="01:59:50.590" end="01:59:55.119" style="s2">about them as random neural activity</p>
<p begin="01:59:52.869" end="01:59:58.150" style="s2">it&#39;s like there&#39;s nothing right when you</p>
<p begin="01:59:55.119" end="02:00:02.079" style="s2">look at a TV screen that&#39;s not on a</p>
<p begin="01:59:58.150" end="02:00:04.110" style="s2">channel that&#39;s random when you dream</p>
<p begin="02:00:02.079" end="02:00:10.749" style="s2">something complex and sophisticated</p>
<p begin="02:00:04.110" end="02:00:13.269" style="s2">that&#39;s not random so yeah so the</p>
<p begin="02:00:10.749" end="02:00:14.769" style="s2">metaphor surrounds us let&#39;s say and we</p>
<p begin="02:00:13.269" end="02:00:16.449" style="s2">can critique it rationally and we can</p>
<p begin="02:00:14.769" end="02:00:19.619" style="s2">undermine it but there&#39;s real danger in</p>
<p begin="02:00:16.449" end="02:00:19.619" style="s2">that so</p>
<p begin="02:00:26.880" end="02:00:40.690" style="s2">take one question from here then take</p>
<p begin="02:00:28.960" end="02:00:44.230" style="s2">one on the other end yeah thank you for</p>
<p begin="02:00:40.690" end="02:00:46.840" style="s2">talk I like to find out from you what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:00:44.230" end="02:00:51.040" style="s2">your view of institutional racism is it</p>
<p begin="02:00:46.840" end="02:00:56.410" style="s2">a thing or is it some other left radical</p>
<p begin="02:00:51.040" end="02:00:58.360" style="s2">leftist agenda what was your view of</p>
<p begin="02:00:56.410" end="02:01:03.850" style="s2">institutional racism more systemic</p>
<p begin="02:00:58.360" end="02:01:08.860" style="s2">racism as some people may call it yes is</p>
<p begin="02:01:03.850" end="02:01:11.560" style="s2">it is it a thing is an actual thing is</p>
<p begin="02:01:08.860" end="02:01:14.110" style="s2">it a mother agenda that you might</p>
<p begin="02:01:11.560" end="02:01:17.440" style="s2">attribute to radical leftists it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:01:14.110" end="02:01:20.080" style="s2">multivariate problem right</p>
<p begin="02:01:17.440" end="02:01:22.750" style="s2">like no society is without its biases</p>
<p begin="02:01:20.080" end="02:01:25.170" style="s2">and prejudices and some of them get</p>
<p begin="02:01:22.750" end="02:01:28.420" style="s2">built into the system&#39;s themselves and</p>
<p begin="02:01:25.170" end="02:01:30.010" style="s2">so when you look at unequal outcomes and</p>
<p begin="02:01:28.420" end="02:01:32.410" style="s2">you&#39;re trying to discover why those</p>
<p begin="02:01:30.010" end="02:01:34.300" style="s2">unequal outcomes exist if you have any</p>
<p begin="02:01:32.410" end="02:01:36.790" style="s2">sense then you do a multivariate</p>
<p begin="02:01:34.300" end="02:01:39.670" style="s2">analysis and you put in prejudice and</p>
<p begin="02:01:36.790" end="02:01:43.660" style="s2">discrimination as one of the factors one</p>
<p begin="02:01:39.670" end="02:01:46.120" style="s2">of the factors one of many many factors</p>
<p begin="02:01:43.660" end="02:01:48.640" style="s2">and we&#39;ll the problem with the radical</p>
<p begin="02:01:46.120" end="02:01:50.980" style="s2">leftist is that they take the fact that</p>
<p begin="02:01:48.640" end="02:01:52.840" style="s2">societal structures are tyrannical to</p>
<p begin="02:01:50.980" end="02:01:54.490" style="s2">some degree in arbitrary which of course</p>
<p begin="02:01:52.840" end="02:01:58.420" style="s2">they are because they&#39;re imperfect and</p>
<p begin="02:01:54.490" end="02:02:01.600" style="s2">then they obliterated the complexity</p>
<p begin="02:01:58.420" end="02:02:05.350" style="s2">with that claim so there&#39;s lots of</p>
<p begin="02:02:01.600" end="02:02:08.140" style="s2">reasons for inequality systemic bias is</p>
<p begin="02:02:05.350" end="02:02:10.420" style="s2">one of them - what - it&#39;s an open</p>
<p begin="02:02:08.140" end="02:02:14.470" style="s2">question to what degree systemic bias</p>
<p begin="02:02:10.420" end="02:02:16.600" style="s2">plays in in the inequality problem let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:14.470" end="02:02:18.880" style="s2">say but it&#39;s something that we could</p>
<p begin="02:02:16.600" end="02:02:21.400" style="s2">hypothetically address with a certain</p>
<p begin="02:02:18.880" end="02:02:26.110" style="s2">degree of detachment and intelligence</p>
<p begin="02:02:21.400" end="02:02:29.220" style="s2">so no system is perfect not and</p>
<p begin="02:02:26.110" end="02:02:29.220" style="s2">certainly not us</p>
<p begin="02:02:30.440" end="02:02:41.490" style="s2">reasonable reasonable answer okay that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:35.580" end="02:02:44.340" style="s2">that&#39;s wise all right so I think it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:02:41.490" end="02:02:46.410" style="s2">safe to say you&#39;re a fervent critic of</p>
<p begin="02:02:44.340" end="02:02:48.330" style="s2">post-modernism and there are times where</p>
<p begin="02:02:46.410" end="02:02:51.840" style="s2">I don&#39;t think you quite give it a fair</p>
<p begin="02:02:48.330" end="02:02:53.160" style="s2">shake and I&#39;m no fan of you know a good</p>
<p begin="02:02:51.840" end="02:02:56.460" style="s2">amount of the literature or the theory</p>
<p begin="02:02:53.160" end="02:02:58.530" style="s2">but if you could point to one or two of</p>
<p begin="02:02:56.460" end="02:03:00.780" style="s2">the French theorists and some of their</p>
<p begin="02:02:58.530" end="02:03:03.720" style="s2">pieces whether it&#39;s their literature</p>
<p begin="02:03:00.780" end="02:03:05.400" style="s2">their theory you could point to that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:03:03.720" end="02:03:07.140" style="s2">culpable for this sort of cultural rot</p>
<p begin="02:03:05.400" end="02:03:08.610" style="s2">that you charge post-modernism with</p>
<p begin="02:03:07.140" end="02:03:22.830" style="s2">causing who would it be</p>
<p begin="02:03:08.610" end="02:03:23.940" style="s2">what would it be so and I&#39;ve done my</p>
<p begin="02:03:22.830" end="02:03:25.560" style="s2">best to read LaCount</p>
<p begin="02:03:23.940" end="02:03:27.590" style="s2">and I think the reason I can&#39;t read it</p>
<p begin="02:03:25.560" end="02:03:29.610" style="s2">is because it doesn&#39;t make any sense so</p>
<p begin="02:03:27.590" end="02:03:32.960" style="s2">because I&#39;ve read some very difficult</p>
<p begin="02:03:29.610" end="02:03:35.940" style="s2">things and I could understand them so</p>
<p begin="02:03:32.960" end="02:03:37.920" style="s2">Foucault I think is a ten-part genius I</p>
<p begin="02:03:35.940" end="02:03:39.090" style="s2">read madness and civilization for</p>
<p begin="02:03:37.920" end="02:03:41.640" style="s2">example it just seems to me to be</p>
<p begin="02:03:39.090" end="02:03:43.380" style="s2">self-evident psychiatric diagnostic</p>
<p begin="02:03:41.640" end="02:03:45.150" style="s2">categories are in part social</p>
<p begin="02:03:43.380" end="02:03:47.880" style="s2">constructions it&#39;s like great we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:03:45.150" end="02:03:50.120" style="s2">known that since like 1960 you know it&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:03:52.590" end="02:03:57.540" style="s2">and his critique of the West as fellow</p>
<p begin="02:03:54.750" end="02:04:00.150" style="s2">go centric is dead on point male</p>

<p begin="02:04:02.370" end="02:04:08.700" style="s2">well I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem so and</p>
<p begin="02:04:05.790" end="02:04:10.560" style="s2">I think as well it isn&#39;t even that and I</p>
<p begin="02:04:08.700" end="02:04:13.980" style="s2">understand the post modernist viewpoint</p>
<p begin="02:04:10.560" end="02:04:15.690" style="s2">like look it is the case that a finite</p>
<p begin="02:04:13.980" end="02:04:17.220" style="s2">set of entities is subject to an</p>
<p begin="02:04:15.690" end="02:04:19.320" style="s2">infinite number of interpretations</p>
<p begin="02:04:17.220" end="02:04:21.270" style="s2">okay that&#39;s post-modernism in a nutshell</p>
<p begin="02:04:19.320" end="02:04:24.240" style="s2">the AI guys figured that out in like</p>
<p begin="02:04:21.270" end="02:04:25.680" style="s2">from 1960 to 1992</p>
<p begin="02:04:24.240" end="02:04:28.110" style="s2">it took them that long to wade through</p>
<p begin="02:04:25.680" end="02:04:30.360" style="s2">that fundamental technical problem a</p>
<p begin="02:04:28.110" end="02:04:32.280" style="s2">real problem the problem of perception</p>
<p begin="02:04:30.360" end="02:04:33.930" style="s2">for example it&#39;s be very hard to solve</p>
<p begin="02:04:32.280" end="02:04:35.370" style="s2">the AI problem of perception because</p>
<p begin="02:04:33.930" end="02:04:37.320" style="s2">there are a lot of ways to look at the</p>
<p begin="02:04:35.370" end="02:04:39.750" style="s2">world like the objects aren&#39;t just there</p>
<p begin="02:04:37.320" end="02:04:42.000" style="s2">in any simple sense so okay there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="02:04:39.750" end="02:04:42.770" style="s2">infinite number of interpretations no</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.000" end="02:04:45.390" style="s2">problem</p>
<p begin="02:04:42.770" end="02:04:47.940" style="s2">there&#39;s not an infinite number of viable</p>
<p begin="02:04:45.390" end="02:04:50.070" style="s2">interpretations okay that&#39;s a big</p>
<p begin="02:04:47.940" end="02:04:51.540" style="s2">problem okay and a little bit of</p>
<p begin="02:04:50.070" end="02:04:53.190" style="s2">thinking through that would have gone a</p>
<p begin="02:04:51.540" end="02:04:56.670" style="s2">long ways for the postmodernist so</p>
<p begin="02:04:53.190" end="02:04:57.360" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s number one and then what&#39;s</p>

<p begin="02:04:57.360" end="02:05:05.640" style="s2">oh yes then the other problem is okay</p>
<p begin="02:05:04.140" end="02:05:07.260" style="s2">there&#39;s an infinite number of</p>
<p begin="02:05:05.640" end="02:05:09.630" style="s2">interpretations we won&#39;t make any one</p>
<p begin="02:05:07.260" end="02:05:12.270" style="s2">canonical all right well then how the</p>
<p begin="02:05:09.630" end="02:05:14.310" style="s2">hell are you going to act because you</p>
<p begin="02:05:12.270" end="02:05:16.530" style="s2">have to make a value system canonical if</p>
<p begin="02:05:14.310" end="02:05:18.150" style="s2">you&#39;re gonna act oh well we didn&#39;t solve</p>
<p begin="02:05:16.530" end="02:05:20.310" style="s2">that problem how about we just slip</p>
<p begin="02:05:18.150" end="02:05:23.040" style="s2">Marxism in underneath the carpet and not</p>
<p begin="02:05:20.310" end="02:05:25.680" style="s2">notice the problem then that gives us</p>
<p begin="02:05:23.040" end="02:05:27.270" style="s2">something to do it&#39;s like people come</p>
<p begin="02:05:25.680" end="02:05:28.590" style="s2">out and criticize me and say dr.</p>
<p begin="02:05:27.270" end="02:05:30.300" style="s2">Peterson doesn&#39;t understand that</p>
<p begin="02:05:28.590" end="02:05:33.030" style="s2">post-modernism and Marxism are in</p>
<p begin="02:05:30.300" end="02:05:35.489" style="s2">commensurate it&#39;s like yeah actually I</p>
<p begin="02:05:33.030" end="02:05:37.710" style="s2">do understand that but the postmodern</p>
<p begin="02:05:35.489" end="02:05:40.800" style="s2">neo-marxists don&#39;t seem to understand</p>
<p begin="02:05:37.710" end="02:05:43.469" style="s2">that so how can you be a postmodern</p>
<p begin="02:05:40.800" end="02:05:44.940" style="s2">Isetta Marxist at the same time well the</p>
<p begin="02:05:43.469" end="02:05:47.250" style="s2">answer to that is actually to be found</p>
<p begin="02:05:44.940" end="02:05:49.110" style="s2">in the historical data the postmodernist</p>
<p begin="02:05:47.250" end="02:05:51.690" style="s2">types like Foucault and Derrida were</p>
<p begin="02:05:49.110" end="02:05:54.840" style="s2">Marxists before they became post</p>
<p begin="02:05:51.690" end="02:05:56.610" style="s2">modernists and the postmodern overlay on</p>
<p begin="02:05:54.840" end="02:05:58.560" style="s2">the Marxism was as far as I can tell</p>
<p begin="02:05:56.610" end="02:06:01.170" style="s2">mostly a cover story for going about the</p>
<p begin="02:05:58.560" end="02:06:05.250" style="s2">same old murderous idiocy under a new</p>
<p begin="02:06:01.170" end="02:06:07.650" style="s2">guys so you think it&#39;s possible that</p>
<p begin="02:06:05.250" end="02:06:10.590" style="s2">there are I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="02:06:07.650" end="02:06:13.080" style="s2">know that there are lenses like</p>
<p begin="02:06:10.590" end="02:06:16.500" style="s2">postmodern lenses that we can view</p>
<p begin="02:06:13.080" end="02:06:20.250" style="s2">culture from under that can at times be</p>
<p begin="02:06:16.500" end="02:06:22.290" style="s2">more powerful and useful than than other</p>
<p begin="02:06:20.250" end="02:06:23.940" style="s2">lenses like for example boji art the</p>
<p begin="02:06:22.290" end="02:06:26.850" style="s2">idea of the the simulator and the</p>
<p begin="02:06:23.940" end="02:06:29.239" style="s2">successive phases of the image Joan</p>
<p begin="02:06:26.850" end="02:06:31.410" style="s2">Didion no Gerard could at least think</p>
<p begin="02:06:29.239" end="02:06:34.380" style="s2">and I mean you can&#39;t throw all the</p>
<p begin="02:06:31.410" end="02:06:36.360" style="s2">postmodernist into the same jug you know</p>
<p begin="02:06:34.380" end="02:06:37.680" style="s2">but I would say it&#39;s still Derrida and</p>
<p begin="02:06:36.360" end="02:06:47.370" style="s2">Foucault of had the most pernicious</p>
<p begin="02:06:37.680" end="02:06:49.199" style="s2">effects well well the problem is they</p>
<p begin="02:06:47.370" end="02:06:51.780" style="s2">didn&#39;t deal with it seriously it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:06:49.199" end="02:06:53.280" style="s2">you can&#39;t just say no meta-narrative</p>
<p begin="02:06:51.780" end="02:06:56.010" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay how are we going to unite</p>
<p begin="02:06:53.280" end="02:06:56.850" style="s2">ourselves then we&#39;re going to use</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.010" end="02:06:58.590" style="s2">multicultural</p>
<p begin="02:06:56.850" end="02:07:01.980" style="s2">well that&#39;s really work to produce a</p>
<p begin="02:06:58.590" end="02:07:04.170" style="s2">peaceful world hasn&#39;t it so you need a</p>
<p begin="02:07:01.980" end="02:07:05.730" style="s2">uniting narrative we have if we weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:07:04.170" end="02:07:07.170" style="s2">didn&#39;t have a uniting narrative we</p>
<p begin="02:07:05.730" end="02:07:08.820" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t all be sitting peacefully in</p>
<p begin="02:07:07.170" end="02:07:11.520" style="s2">this room it&#39;s the Uniting narrative</p>
<p begin="02:07:08.820" end="02:07:13.620" style="s2">that governs our behavior in this room</p>
<p begin="02:07:11.520" end="02:07:14.730" style="s2">and look here we are all peaceful it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:07:13.620" end="02:07:17.040" style="s2">like they&#39;re not dealing with the</p>
<p begin="02:07:14.730" end="02:07:19.680" style="s2">fundamental issues and to slip Marxism</p>
<p begin="02:07:17.040" end="02:07:21.180" style="s2">back in as a backdoor route to having</p>
<p begin="02:07:19.680" end="02:07:23.370" style="s2">something to do with your life is</p>
<p begin="02:07:21.180" end="02:07:36.450" style="s2">intellectually repre intellectually and</p>
<p begin="02:07:23.370" end="02:07:37.230" style="s2">morally reprehensible okay thank you how</p>
<p begin="02:07:36.450" end="02:07:39.390" style="s2">are you sir</p>
<p begin="02:07:37.230" end="02:07:40.920" style="s2">my name is Steve I just wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="02:07:39.390" end="02:07:42.300" style="s2">you about this experience that I had</p>
<p begin="02:07:40.920" end="02:07:44.880" style="s2">after watching one of your lectures that</p>
<p begin="02:07:42.300" end="02:07:45.870" style="s2">really profoundly impacted me and I was</p>
<p begin="02:07:44.880" end="02:07:47.480" style="s2">I was wondering if you could kind of</p>
<p begin="02:07:45.870" end="02:07:49.980" style="s2">help me out with understanding this</p>
<p begin="02:07:47.480" end="02:07:52.260" style="s2">after watching your lecture on young and</p>
<p begin="02:07:49.980" end="02:07:54.540" style="s2">he&#39;s talking about his life you started</p>
<p begin="02:07:52.260" end="02:07:56.580" style="s2">talking talking about the Lion King and</p>
<p begin="02:07:54.540" end="02:07:58.980" style="s2">and kind of connecting what the intro</p>
<p begin="02:07:56.580" end="02:08:00.900" style="s2">scene was in the Lion King and the idea</p>
<p begin="02:07:58.980" end="02:08:01.920" style="s2">of archetypes and when I you know I</p>
<p begin="02:08:00.900" end="02:08:04.470" style="s2">started to understand what you were</p>
<p begin="02:08:01.920" end="02:08:06.450" style="s2">saying I had this unbelievable feeling</p>
<p begin="02:08:04.470" end="02:08:08.760" style="s2">in like in my stomach in my whole body</p>
<p begin="02:08:06.450" end="02:08:12.330" style="s2">there&#39;s just this smell like this right</p>
<p begin="02:08:08.760" end="02:08:19.650" style="s2">this very intense feeling so warning</p>
<p begin="02:08:12.330" end="02:08:21.600" style="s2">never to read you yeah oh no it was just</p>
<p begin="02:08:19.650" end="02:08:24.960" style="s2">this powerful feeling and I got so</p>
<p begin="02:08:21.600" end="02:08:26.460" style="s2">emotional you know and ask thinking of</p>
<p begin="02:08:24.960" end="02:08:27.840" style="s2">how to articulate this question to you a</p>
<p begin="02:08:26.460" end="02:08:30.900" style="s2">few minutes ago I was just getting so</p>
<p begin="02:08:27.840" end="02:08:32.910" style="s2">emotional it was it was uh it just seems</p>
<p begin="02:08:30.900" end="02:08:35.030" style="s2">like you know it scared the hell out of</p>
<p begin="02:08:32.910" end="02:08:38.490" style="s2">me that feeling but it was also a really</p>
<p begin="02:08:35.030" end="02:08:41.160" style="s2">meaningful so valuable amazing feeling</p>
<p begin="02:08:38.490" end="02:08:43.550" style="s2">and I thought you know it&#39;s kind of like</p>
<p begin="02:08:41.160" end="02:08:46.290" style="s2">would maybe what God is just you know</p>
<p begin="02:08:43.550" end="02:08:49.110" style="s2">yeah it was so and I usually get that</p>
<p begin="02:08:46.290" end="02:08:50.820" style="s2">that feeling too of after listening to</p>
<p begin="02:08:49.110" end="02:08:53.550" style="s2">like a band like the cro-mags or Black</p>
<p begin="02:08:50.820" end="02:08:55.920" style="s2">Flag you know some hardcore band or see</p>
<p begin="02:08:53.550" end="02:09:02.190" style="s2">like that music is so important to me</p>
<p begin="02:08:55.920" end="02:09:04.260" style="s2">like that and and and it just the</p>
<p begin="02:09:02.190" end="02:09:06.449" style="s2">question that just made me so emotional</p>
<p begin="02:09:04.260" end="02:09:07.949" style="s2">to is like what could my life</p>
<p begin="02:09:06.449" end="02:09:10.320" style="s2">you know and and that was something that</p>
<p begin="02:09:07.949" end="02:09:11.159" style="s2">I I just found myself asking myself you</p>
<p begin="02:09:10.320" end="02:09:13.409" style="s2">know just just what</p>
<p begin="02:09:11.159" end="02:09:14.999" style="s2">and I just I I wonder if you could you</p>
<p begin="02:09:13.409" end="02:09:18.300" style="s2">know give me some some extra stuff on</p>
<p begin="02:09:14.999" end="02:09:19.619" style="s2">that what that really was you know yeah</p>
<p begin="02:09:18.300" end="02:09:21.539" style="s2">well you&#39;ve got to you&#39;ve got to be very</p>
<p begin="02:09:19.619" end="02:09:23.340" style="s2">careful when you&#39;re when you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="02:09:21.539" end="02:09:27.780" style="s2">something like reading young yeah</p>
<p begin="02:09:23.340" end="02:09:30.900" style="s2">because he&#39;ll reorganize your cognitive</p>
<p begin="02:09:27.780" end="02:09:32.670" style="s2">structures and that&#39;s there&#39;s deaths and</p>
<p begin="02:09:30.900" end="02:09:35.610" style="s2">rebirths that go along with that</p>
<p begin="02:09:32.670" end="02:09:38.639" style="s2">you know there&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to</p>
<p begin="02:09:35.610" end="02:09:42.079" style="s2">do in part is to in a sense as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:38.639" end="02:09:44.849" style="s2">trying to bring what you do and how you</p>
<p begin="02:09:42.079" end="02:09:47.280" style="s2">imagine yourself and how you articulate</p>
<p begin="02:09:44.849" end="02:09:49.260" style="s2">yourself into alignment so those three</p>
<p begin="02:09:47.280" end="02:09:50.670" style="s2">things are the same it&#39;s very hard</p>
<p begin="02:09:49.260" end="02:09:52.349" style="s2">because there&#39;s more to you in your</p>
<p begin="02:09:50.670" end="02:09:54.360" style="s2">action than there is in your</p>
<p begin="02:09:52.349" end="02:09:55.590" style="s2">articulation and there&#39;s more to you in</p>
<p begin="02:09:54.360" end="02:09:58.530" style="s2">your action than there is in your</p>
<p begin="02:09:55.590" end="02:10:02.130" style="s2">imagination and so partly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:09:58.530" end="02:10:05.760" style="s2">what you&#39;re experiencing is an expanded</p>
<p begin="02:10:02.130" end="02:10:06.690" style="s2">sense of self and possibility and you</p>
<p begin="02:10:05.760" end="02:10:08.969" style="s2">might think well that&#39;s a wonderful</p>
<p begin="02:10:06.690" end="02:10:12.479" style="s2">thing but it&#39;s a it&#39;s also a very</p>
<p begin="02:10:08.969" end="02:10:15.030" style="s2">daunting thing and it it can be a very</p>
<p begin="02:10:12.479" end="02:10:17.010" style="s2">dangerous thing i when I was dealing</p>
<p begin="02:10:15.030" end="02:10:20.670" style="s2">with all of this material when I was</p>
<p begin="02:10:17.010" end="02:10:22.260" style="s2">writing my first book I had to abandon a</p>
<p begin="02:10:20.670" end="02:10:25.170" style="s2">lot of the things that I was doing that</p>
<p begin="02:10:22.260" end="02:10:28.769" style="s2">were bad habits because it was so</p>
<p begin="02:10:25.170" end="02:10:30.780" style="s2">stressful to move through these systems</p>
<p begin="02:10:28.769" end="02:10:33.269" style="s2">of ideas that I couldn&#39;t afford any</p>
<p begin="02:10:30.780" end="02:10:35.309" style="s2">additional mental energy being wasted on</p>
<p begin="02:10:33.269" end="02:10:54.300" style="s2">things I was doing that wasn&#39;t that</p>
<p begin="02:10:35.309" end="02:10:57.520" style="s2">weren&#39;t together so so that wasn&#39;t very</p>
<p begin="02:10:54.300" end="02:11:00.670" style="s2">break wasn&#39;t no</p>
<p begin="02:10:57.520" end="02:11:03.880" style="s2">on march 9th actually with Noam Chomsky</p>
<p begin="02:11:00.670" end="02:11:05.740" style="s2">Noam Chomsky move on and so I want to</p>
<p begin="02:11:03.880" end="02:11:14.560" style="s2">ask you as like the leading because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:11:05.740" end="02:11:16.840" style="s2">old yeah so yeah do you think it is to</p>
<p begin="02:11:14.560" end="02:11:20.410" style="s2">like to be these intellectuals and do</p>
<p begin="02:11:16.840" end="02:11:24.220" style="s2">you think that you are you want oh god I</p>
<p begin="02:11:20.410" end="02:11:27.940" style="s2">always hesitate the hesitate to claim</p>
<p begin="02:11:24.220" end="02:11:30.460" style="s2">victory like to escape without abject</p>
<p begin="02:11:27.940" end="02:11:35.770" style="s2">defeat is a pretty good pretty good</p>
<p begin="02:11:30.460" end="02:11:37.840" style="s2">ambition so and plus I think it&#39;s rather</p>
<p begin="02:11:35.770" end="02:11:40.240" style="s2">improbable that I would win a debate</p>
<p begin="02:11:37.840" end="02:11:45.850" style="s2">with a quote bought so some people</p>
<p begin="02:11:40.240" end="02:11:49.420" style="s2">thought it was pretty close Twitter is a</p>
<p begin="02:11:45.850" end="02:11:51.630" style="s2">weird platform you know it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="02:11:49.420" end="02:11:55.360" style="s2">it is a complicated platform and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:11:51.630" end="02:11:57.750" style="s2">I&#39;ve modified my approach to Twitter in</p>
<p begin="02:11:55.360" end="02:12:03.120" style="s2">the last month and a half I would say</p>
<p begin="02:11:57.750" end="02:12:05.800" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to selectively retweet</p>
<p begin="02:12:03.120" end="02:12:07.240" style="s2">information I I pulled a bunch of people</p>
<p begin="02:12:05.800" end="02:12:10.170" style="s2">and asked them if they knew of credible</p>
<p begin="02:12:07.240" end="02:12:15.190" style="s2">Twitter sources that were producing</p>

<p begin="02:14:09.679" end="02:14:13.790" style="s2">engage in a Twitter combat about it was</p>
<p begin="02:14:11.989" end="02:14:16.460" style="s2">serious enough to write a blog post</p>
<p begin="02:14:13.790" end="02:14:19.130" style="s2">about and so I&#39;ve kind of made this rule</p>
<p begin="02:14:16.460" end="02:14:21.290" style="s2">which is I&#39;m not going to comment on</p>
<p begin="02:14:19.130" end="02:14:24.500" style="s2">anything on Twitter in that sort of</p>

<p begin="02:14:24.500" end="02:14:28.699" style="s2">it at some length is justifiable and so</p>
<p begin="02:14:27.050" end="02:14:30.800" style="s2">I started doing that this week I wrote</p>
<p begin="02:14:28.699" end="02:14:34.699" style="s2">three blog posts and that seems to have</p>
<p begin="02:14:30.800" end="02:14:35.710" style="s2">gone pretty well so I hope that answered</p>
<p begin="02:14:34.699" end="02:14:38.710" style="s2">your question</p>
<p begin="02:14:35.710" end="02:14:38.710" style="s2">yep</p>
<p begin="02:14:48.349" end="02:14:53.179" style="s2">kind of go on a different topic I have a</p>
<p begin="02:14:50.270" end="02:14:55.130" style="s2">personality psychology question okay so</p>
<p begin="02:14:53.179" end="02:14:56.599" style="s2">when I did the understand myself quiz I</p>
<p begin="02:14:55.130" end="02:14:58.250" style="s2">was very surprised to find out that I</p>
<p begin="02:14:56.599" end="02:15:01.099" style="s2">was on the bottom two percentile for</p>
<p begin="02:14:58.250" end="02:15:03.260" style="s2">conscientiousness which openness</p>
<p begin="02:15:01.099" end="02:15:04.969" style="s2">yes you&#39;re not your venereal type I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:15:03.260" end="02:15:11.510" style="s2">gonna need to partner with someone whose</p>
<p begin="02:15:04.969" end="02:15:13.179" style="s2">discipline that&#39;s exactly see there</p>
<p begin="02:15:11.510" end="02:15:16.010" style="s2">seems to be a real tension between</p>
<p begin="02:15:13.179" end="02:15:18.980" style="s2">openness and and especially orderliness</p>
<p begin="02:15:16.010" end="02:15:20.540" style="s2">you know who&#39;s open people while they</p>
<p begin="02:15:18.980" end="02:15:22.010" style="s2">think laterally and they blow boxes</p>
<p begin="02:15:20.540" end="02:15:23.270" style="s2">apart and they tend to make a mess when</p>
<p begin="02:15:22.010" end="02:15:25.550" style="s2">they&#39;re transforming things and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:23.270" end="02:15:26.659" style="s2">all over the place and and they have to</p>
<p begin="02:15:25.550" end="02:15:29.570" style="s2">be because otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="02:15:26.659" end="02:15:32.630" style="s2">open but it&#39;s hard to do that and also</p>
<p begin="02:15:29.570" end="02:15:34.429" style="s2">be orderly and conscientious and so and</p>
<p begin="02:15:32.630" end="02:15:35.599" style="s2">corporations suffer from this tension</p>
<p begin="02:15:34.429" end="02:15:39.349" style="s2">all the time right because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:15:35.599" end="02:15:41.599" style="s2">started by open people but when they get</p>
<p begin="02:15:39.349" end="02:15:43.369" style="s2">going and get algorithm eyes they&#39;re run</p>
<p begin="02:15:41.599" end="02:15:44.840" style="s2">by conscientious people but then the</p>
<p begin="02:15:43.369" end="02:15:46.340" style="s2">conscientious people can only go down</p>
<p begin="02:15:44.840" end="02:15:48.020" style="s2">one track and if the environment</p>
<p begin="02:15:46.340" end="02:15:50.989" style="s2">transforms the whole company disappears</p>
<p begin="02:15:48.020" end="02:15:53.510" style="s2">so I would say you take a look at the</p>
<p begin="02:15:50.989" end="02:15:54.650" style="s2">conscientiousness score you see if you</p>
<p begin="02:15:53.510" end="02:15:56.810" style="s2">can figure out how to discipline</p>
<p begin="02:15:54.650" end="02:15:58.849" style="s2">yourself a bit more and see if you can</p>
<p begin="02:15:56.810" end="02:16:01.250" style="s2">figure out how to schedule your time not</p>
<p begin="02:15:58.849" end="02:16:03.139" style="s2">like a prison but like like a structured</p>
<p begin="02:16:01.250" end="02:16:05.270" style="s2">set of opportunities and then you</p>
<p begin="02:16:03.139" end="02:16:07.670" style="s2">understand that in order to be</p>
<p begin="02:16:05.270" end="02:16:09.889" style="s2">successful in life likely in the medium</p>
<p begin="02:16:07.670" end="02:16:12.079" style="s2">to long run you&#39;re going to have to find</p>
<p begin="02:16:09.889" end="02:16:13.610" style="s2">someone could be someone close to you or</p>
<p begin="02:16:12.079" end="02:16:16.210" style="s2">it could be business partners or</p>
<p begin="02:16:13.610" end="02:16:19.250" style="s2">whatever that fill in that missing</p>
<p begin="02:16:16.210" end="02:16:21.139" style="s2">conscientiousness gap so I guess the</p>
<p begin="02:16:19.250" end="02:16:22.550" style="s2">Part B was my boyfriend we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="02:16:21.139" end="02:16:24.770" style="s2">together for a very long time we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="02:16:22.550" end="02:16:26.510" style="s2">that old it&#39;s also very high in</p>
<p begin="02:16:24.770" end="02:16:28.099" style="s2">neuroticism and I feel that&#39;s where like</p>
<p begin="02:16:26.510" end="02:16:30.530" style="s2">our conflict comes and as far as</p>
<p begin="02:16:28.099" end="02:16:35.200" style="s2">long-term what are some things that you</p>
<p begin="02:16:30.530" end="02:16:35.200" style="s2">know lowly conscientious and erotic</p>
<p begin="02:16:38.700" end="02:16:45.131" style="s2">we&#39;ll look into that</p>
<p begin="02:16:40.240" end="02:16:48.760" style="s2">yeah well I mean the simple I can only</p>
<p begin="02:16:45.131" end="02:16:50.620" style="s2">its it high levels of neuroticism are</p>
<p begin="02:16:48.760" end="02:16:54.490" style="s2">problematic in a relationship</p>
<p begin="02:16:50.620" end="02:16:57.070" style="s2">it&#39;s probably why 75% of divorces are</p>
<p begin="02:16:54.490" end="02:16:59.080" style="s2">initiated by women because women are</p>
<p begin="02:16:57.070" end="02:17:00.551" style="s2">higher in neuroticism than men and I</p>
<p begin="02:16:59.080" end="02:17:02.290" style="s2">think the reason for that is that they</p>
<p begin="02:17:00.551" end="02:17:04.330" style="s2">have to be more sensitive to infant</p>
<p begin="02:17:02.290" end="02:17:06.370" style="s2">distress and so that makes them more</p>
<p begin="02:17:04.330" end="02:17:07.750" style="s2">sensitive to distress in general now I</p>
<p begin="02:17:06.370" end="02:17:10.240" style="s2">don&#39;t know that for sure</p>
<p begin="02:17:07.750" end="02:17:11.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a supposition but high levels of</p>
<p begin="02:17:10.240" end="02:17:14.740" style="s2">neuroticism do tend to make a</p>
<p begin="02:17:11.680" end="02:17:17.020" style="s2">relationship volatile and and to put a</p>
<p begin="02:17:14.740" end="02:17:19.841" style="s2">fair bit of negative emotion into it now</p>
<p begin="02:17:17.020" end="02:17:21.790" style="s2">the question is where what the source of</p>
<p begin="02:17:19.841" end="02:17:23.410" style="s2">the high level of neuroticism is it</p>
<p begin="02:17:21.790" end="02:17:24.790" style="s2">might be purely temperamental but it</p>
<p begin="02:17:23.410" end="02:17:26.440" style="s2">also might be indicative of an</p>
<p begin="02:17:24.790" end="02:17:29.591" style="s2">underlying anxiety disorder depression</p>
<p begin="02:17:26.440" end="02:17:31.000" style="s2">or or a physiological problem because</p>
<p begin="02:17:29.591" end="02:17:32.470" style="s2">they can manifest themselves in high</p>
<p begin="02:17:31.000" end="02:17:35.260" style="s2">levels of negative emotion and so</p>
<p begin="02:17:32.470" end="02:17:37.091" style="s2">there&#39;s always the possibility of doing</p>
<p begin="02:17:35.260" end="02:17:38.980" style="s2">something about that what I usually tell</p>
<p begin="02:17:37.091" end="02:17:42.790" style="s2">my clients who are high in neuroticism</p>
<p begin="02:17:38.980" end="02:17:45.010" style="s2">is two simple things number one get up</p>
<p begin="02:17:42.790" end="02:17:46.420" style="s2">at the same time in the morning okay</p>
<p begin="02:17:45.010" end="02:17:49.810" style="s2">because that helps stabilize your</p>
<p begin="02:17:46.420" end="02:17:52.030" style="s2">circadian rhythms number two eat a large</p>
<p begin="02:17:49.810" end="02:17:54.370" style="s2">meal before you stress yourself in the</p>
<p begin="02:17:52.030" end="02:17:57.341" style="s2">morning and mostly protein and fat based</p>
<p begin="02:17:54.370" end="02:17:59.020" style="s2">because if you&#39;re high on neuroticism</p>
<p begin="02:17:57.341" end="02:18:02.920" style="s2">and you stress yourself before you eat</p>
<p begin="02:17:59.020" end="02:18:05.080" style="s2">you you dis regulate your your emotional</p>
<p begin="02:18:02.920" end="02:18:07.110" style="s2">reaction systems essentially and you can</p>
<p begin="02:18:05.080" end="02:18:10.000" style="s2">tree regulate them till you sleep again</p>
<p begin="02:18:07.110" end="02:18:13.860" style="s2">so other than that goodwill and</p>
<p begin="02:18:10.000" end="02:18:13.860" style="s2">understanding is about what you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="02:18:15.030" end="02:18:19.260" style="s2">are you doing tonight dr. Pearson</p>
<p begin="02:18:23.760" end="02:18:27.670" style="s2">nervous to uh talk in front of you</p>
<p begin="02:18:26.591" end="02:18:29.801" style="s2">because you&#39;ve got to be one of the most</p>
<p begin="02:18:27.670" end="02:18:32.801" style="s2">formidable people that I&#39;ve ever heard</p>
<p begin="02:18:29.801" end="02:18:35.051" style="s2">up or ever listen to her ever seen so my</p>
<p begin="02:18:32.801" end="02:18:36.850" style="s2">question is again you&#39;re one of the best</p>
<p begin="02:18:35.051" end="02:18:42.370" style="s2">communicators that I&#39;ve ever listened to</p>
<p begin="02:18:36.850" end="02:18:45.100" style="s2">if I could be half as good at you or at</p>
<p begin="02:18:42.370" end="02:18:47.070" style="s2">communicating as you are I would be set</p>
<p begin="02:18:45.100" end="02:18:48.620" style="s2">how can I teach myself to do that</p>
<p begin="02:18:47.070" end="02:18:51.860" style="s2">practice</p>
<p begin="02:18:48.620" end="02:18:56.320" style="s2">you know really like well there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="02:18:51.860" end="02:19:01.040" style="s2">couple of things is helps to read a lot</p>
<p begin="02:18:56.320" end="02:19:04.250" style="s2">it really helps to write so if you want</p>
<p begin="02:19:01.040" end="02:19:08.179" style="s2">to make yourself articulate which is a</p>
<p begin="02:19:04.250" end="02:19:10.429" style="s2">very good idea then not only should you</p>
<p begin="02:19:08.179" end="02:19:13.219" style="s2">read but you should write down what you</p>
<p begin="02:19:10.429" end="02:19:16.700" style="s2">think and if you can do that a little</p>
<p begin="02:19:13.219" end="02:19:19.520" style="s2">bit every day 15 minutes maybe you could</p>
<p begin="02:19:16.700" end="02:19:21.770" style="s2">steal 15 minutes and do it every day but</p>
<p begin="02:19:19.520" end="02:19:24.530" style="s2">if you do that for ten years you really</p>
<p begin="02:19:21.770" end="02:19:28.880" style="s2">straighten out your thinking if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:19:24.530" end="02:19:30.950" style="s2">gonna speak effectively you have to know</p>
<p begin="02:19:28.880" end="02:19:32.900" style="s2">way more than you&#39;re talking about you</p>
<p begin="02:19:30.950" end="02:19:34.790" style="s2">know so if you this is often difficult</p>
<p begin="02:19:32.900" end="02:19:36.200" style="s2">for beginning lectures at university</p>
<p begin="02:19:34.790" end="02:19:37.760" style="s2">because they&#39;ll do a lecture on a topic</p>
<p begin="02:19:36.200" end="02:19:39.679" style="s2">but they only know as much as they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:19:37.760" end="02:19:41.420" style="s2">saying in the lecture and they get kind</p>
<p begin="02:19:39.679" end="02:19:43.639" style="s2">of stuck to their notes because of it</p>
<p begin="02:19:41.420" end="02:19:45.710" style="s2">but you want to know ten times as much</p>
<p begin="02:19:43.639" end="02:19:48.680" style="s2">as you are saying in the lecture and</p>
<p begin="02:19:45.710" end="02:19:51.021" style="s2">then you can specify a stepping path</p>
<p begin="02:19:48.680" end="02:19:52.550" style="s2">through it and elaborate with the other</p>
<p begin="02:19:51.021" end="02:19:54.620" style="s2">things that you know but to do that you</p>
<p begin="02:19:52.550" end="02:19:56.090" style="s2">have to do a lot of reading but you also</p>
<p begin="02:19:54.620" end="02:19:57.860" style="s2">have to do a lot of reading because</p>
<p begin="02:19:56.090" end="02:20:01.130" style="s2">that&#39;s where the synthesize that&#39;s where</p>
<p begin="02:19:57.860" end="02:20:02.900" style="s2">the synthesizing comes so that&#39;s on the</p>
<p begin="02:20:01.130" end="02:20:05.420" style="s2">input side and then on the output side</p>
<p begin="02:20:02.900" end="02:20:07.790" style="s2">well there&#39;s some tricks techniques</p>
<p begin="02:20:05.420" end="02:20:10.340" style="s2">let&#39;s say is like if you&#39;re speaking in</p>
<p begin="02:20:07.790" end="02:20:13.910" style="s2">front of a group you are not delivering</p>
<p begin="02:20:10.340" end="02:20:15.710" style="s2">a talk to a group that&#39;s not what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:20:13.910" end="02:20:18.500" style="s2">doing the talk isn&#39;t a package thing</p>
<p begin="02:20:15.710" end="02:20:21.230" style="s2">that you present to a group there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:20:18.500" end="02:20:24.140" style="s2">a group there&#39;s a bunch of individuals</p>
<p begin="02:20:21.230" end="02:20:26.300" style="s2">and you talk to them so when I talk to a</p>
<p begin="02:20:24.140" end="02:20:26.720" style="s2">group I always talk to people one at a</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.300" end="02:20:28.521" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="02:20:26.720" end="02:20:30.410" style="s2">and that makes it easier to because you</p>
<p begin="02:20:28.521" end="02:20:31.970" style="s2">know how to talk to a person it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:20:30.410" end="02:20:33.140" style="s2">can you talk to a thousand people well</p>
<p begin="02:20:31.970" end="02:20:35.360" style="s2">probably not because it&#39;s too</p>
<p begin="02:20:33.140" end="02:20:38.840" style="s2">intimidating but there isn&#39;t a thousand</p>
<p begin="02:20:35.360" end="02:20:40.430" style="s2">people there there&#39;s a thousand</p>
<p begin="02:20:38.840" end="02:20:42.500" style="s2">individuals and so you just look at an</p>
<p begin="02:20:40.430" end="02:20:45.710" style="s2">individual and you say something and you</p>
<p begin="02:20:42.500" end="02:20:47.630" style="s2">can tell if they&#39;re engaged they look</p>
<p begin="02:20:45.710" end="02:20:49.790" style="s2">confused or they look interested or they</p>
<p begin="02:20:47.630" end="02:20:51.320" style="s2">look angry or they look bored or maybe</p>
<p begin="02:20:49.790" end="02:20:54.110" style="s2">they&#39;re asleep in which case you look at</p>
<p begin="02:20:51.320" end="02:20:56.420" style="s2">someone else and they give you feedback</p>
<p begin="02:20:54.110" end="02:21:00.950" style="s2">about how you&#39;re doing and so one thing</p>
<p begin="02:20:56.420" end="02:21:02.570" style="s2">is to to have something to say yeah</p>
<p begin="02:21:00.950" end="02:21:05.181" style="s2">thing is pay attention to who you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:02.570" end="02:21:07.550" style="s2">talking to because unless you&#39;re very</p>
<p begin="02:21:05.181" end="02:21:09.410" style="s2">badly socialized then that seems</p>
<p begin="02:21:07.550" end="02:21:11.510" style="s2">unlikely in your case because you know</p>
<p begin="02:21:09.410" end="02:21:14.360" style="s2">you present yourself at least moderately</p>
<p begin="02:21:11.510" end="02:21:16.130" style="s2">well you know and well I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:21:14.360" end="02:21:19.070" style="s2">know you very well but at first but on</p>
<p begin="02:21:16.130" end="02:21:20.811" style="s2">first sight you know you&#39;re doing fine</p>
<p begin="02:21:19.070" end="02:21:23.150" style="s2">so the probability that if you pay</p>
<p begin="02:21:20.811" end="02:21:26.931" style="s2">attention to the individuals that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:23.150" end="02:21:29.750" style="s2">talking to that your natural wealth of</p>
<p begin="02:21:26.931" end="02:21:32.870" style="s2">social skill will manifest itself is</p>
<p begin="02:21:29.750" end="02:21:35.480" style="s2">extremely high and so you don&#39;t deliver</p>
<p begin="02:21:32.870" end="02:21:36.561" style="s2">a talk to an audience that&#39;s a really</p>
<p begin="02:21:35.480" end="02:21:38.360" style="s2">bad way of thinking about you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:21:36.561" end="02:21:40.220" style="s2">actually engaged in a conversation with</p>
<p begin="02:21:38.360" end="02:21:43.490" style="s2">an audience even if they&#39;re not talking</p>
<p begin="02:21:40.220" end="02:21:46.130" style="s2">they&#39;re nodding and shifting position</p>
<p begin="02:21:43.490" end="02:21:49.040" style="s2">and you know looking like this or and</p>
<p begin="02:21:46.130" end="02:21:52.280" style="s2">you can you can pull all that in and and</p>
<p begin="02:21:49.040" end="02:21:56.290" style="s2">and use it to govern the level at which</p>
<p begin="02:21:52.280" end="02:21:58.521" style="s2">you&#39;re addressing the entire audience so</p>
<p begin="02:21:56.290" end="02:22:00.710" style="s2">the last thing I would say is well</p>
<p begin="02:21:58.521" end="02:22:02.690" style="s2">having the aim to be a good communicator</p>
<p begin="02:22:00.710" end="02:22:06.380" style="s2">is a good start and you think well I</p>
<p begin="02:22:02.690" end="02:22:07.521" style="s2">could bunch us that to some degree well</p>
<p begin="02:22:06.380" end="02:22:09.170" style="s2">there isn&#39;t anything that you can</p>
<p begin="02:22:07.521" end="02:22:11.061" style="s2">possibly this is the whole point of a</p>
<p begin="02:22:09.170" end="02:22:13.700" style="s2">liberal education there isn&#39;t anything</p>
<p begin="02:22:11.061" end="02:22:17.780" style="s2">that you can possibly do that makes you</p>
<p begin="02:22:13.700" end="02:22:19.641" style="s2">more competent in everything you do than</p>
<p begin="02:22:17.780" end="02:22:20.960" style="s2">to learn how to communicate I don&#39;t care</p>
<p begin="02:22:19.641" end="02:22:22.311" style="s2">if you&#39;re gonna be a carpenter I mean</p>
<p begin="02:22:20.960" end="02:22:23.630" style="s2">being a carpenter by the way is very</p>
<p begin="02:22:22.311" end="02:22:25.580" style="s2">difficult especially if you&#39;re a good</p>
<p begin="02:22:23.630" end="02:22:27.380" style="s2">carpenter but if you&#39;re good at</p>
<p begin="02:22:25.580" end="02:22:31.220" style="s2">communicating as a carpenter you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="02:22:27.380" end="02:22:33.470" style="s2">10 times better as a carpenter so the</p>
<p begin="02:22:31.220" end="02:22:36.200" style="s2">and this is something that the liberal</p>
<p begin="02:22:33.470" end="02:22:37.490" style="s2">arts colleges I think I don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="02:22:36.200" end="02:22:38.990" style="s2">they&#39;ve forgotten it but they don&#39;t do a</p>
<p begin="02:22:37.490" end="02:22:41.030" style="s2">very good job of marketing it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="02:22:38.990" end="02:22:43.730" style="s2">what&#39;s the use of a bachelor&#39;s degree a</p>
<p begin="02:22:41.030" end="02:22:47.570" style="s2">Bachelor of Arts it&#39;s like well you can</p>
<p begin="02:22:43.730" end="02:22:51.200" style="s2">think you can write you can speak you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:22:47.570" end="02:22:53.780" style="s2">read something it&#39;s like the economic</p>
<p begin="02:22:51.200" end="02:22:55.931" style="s2">value that is incalculable the people</p>
<p begin="02:22:53.780" end="02:22:59.330" style="s2">that I&#39;ve watched in my life have been</p>
<p begin="02:22:55.931" end="02:23:03.340" style="s2">spectacularly successful are they have</p>
<p begin="02:22:59.330" end="02:23:06.200" style="s2">skills clearly that that&#39;s a minimum</p>
<p begin="02:23:03.340" end="02:23:08.420" style="s2">precondition but they&#39;re also very very</p>
<p begin="02:23:06.200" end="02:23:10.340" style="s2">good at articulating themselves and so</p>
<p begin="02:23:08.420" end="02:23:12.740" style="s2">whenever they negotiate they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:23:10.340" end="02:23:13.140" style="s2">successful well that&#39;s kind of like the</p>
<p begin="02:23:12.740" end="02:23:15.479" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="02:23:13.140" end="02:23:16.739" style="s2">success in life right you negotiate and</p>
<p begin="02:23:15.479" end="02:23:19.020" style="s2">you&#39;re six it doesn&#39;t mean you win</p>
<p begin="02:23:16.739" end="02:23:21.180" style="s2">because if you&#39;re a good negotiator if</p>
<p begin="02:23:19.020" end="02:23:23.489" style="s2">you&#39;re really good negotiator everybody</p>
<p begin="02:23:21.180" end="02:23:26.640" style="s2">walks away from the negotiation thrilled</p>
<p begin="02:23:23.489" end="02:23:29.430" style="s2">and so then people line up to do things</p>
<p begin="02:23:26.640" end="02:23:30.810" style="s2">with you so and that&#39;s all that&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="02:23:29.430" end="02:23:36.710" style="s2">dependent on your ability to communicate</p>

<p begin="02:24:51.800" end="02:24:55.760" style="s2">that&#39;s done so he must have been a KGB</p>

<p begin="02:25:26.660" end="02:25:30.950" style="s2">believe our modern people don&#39;t remember</p>

<p begin="02:26:09.601" end="02:26:15.661" style="s2">in our religious and cognitive evolution</p>
<p begin="02:26:11.961" end="02:26:21.661" style="s2">so we don&#39;t understand them they&#39;re an</p>

<p begin="02:27:28.291" end="02:27:32.400" style="s2">that we call socialist and communist are</p>
<p begin="02:27:30.301" end="02:27:36.570" style="s2">totalitarian states ruled by a single</p>
<p begin="02:27:32.400" end="02:27:40.411" style="s2">party or a single man why do we continue</p>

<p begin="02:27:48.271" end="02:27:51.331" style="s2">a good question I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="02:27:50.311" end="02:27:54.871" style="s2">know the answer to that</p>
<p begin="02:27:51.331" end="02:27:56.221" style="s2">it looks like who knows right maybe</p>
<p begin="02:27:54.871" end="02:27:58.411" style="s2">maybe the</p>
<p begin="02:27:56.221" end="02:28:00.421" style="s2">the inevitable end product of a</p>
<p begin="02:27:58.411" end="02:28:03.091" style="s2">collectivist viewpoint is something like</p>
<p begin="02:28:00.421" end="02:28:05.911" style="s2">a totalitarian state it seems probable</p>
<p begin="02:28:03.091" end="02:28:09.240" style="s2">because most human governments have been</p>
<p begin="02:28:05.911" end="02:28:12.360" style="s2">essentially totalitarian states of one</p>
<p begin="02:28:09.240" end="02:28:15.061" style="s2">degree of severity or another so the</p>
<p begin="02:28:12.360" end="02:28:16.921" style="s2">tribal tendency might manifest itself in</p>
<p begin="02:28:15.061" end="02:28:19.740" style="s2">the rigid hierarchy but it is it is a</p>
<p begin="02:28:16.921" end="02:28:21.480" style="s2">perverse fact right and you think that</p>
<p begin="02:28:19.740" end="02:28:23.461" style="s2">it&#39;s one of the mysteries about the</p>
<p begin="02:28:21.480" end="02:28:25.650" style="s2">continual apologetics for the radical</p>
<p begin="02:28:23.461" end="02:28:27.360" style="s2">left it&#39;s like well didn&#39;t China just</p>
<p begin="02:28:25.650" end="02:28:29.791" style="s2">announced that its president is now</p>
<p begin="02:28:27.360" end="02:28:33.181" style="s2">president for life like that&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:28:29.791" end="02:28:34.681" style="s2">a big problem and then well and despite</p>
<p begin="02:28:33.181" end="02:28:36.591" style="s2">the fact that they&#39;ve moved quite a</p>
<p begin="02:28:34.681" end="02:28:39.690" style="s2">distance in the free-market direction</p>
<p begin="02:28:36.591" end="02:28:43.530" style="s2">obviously that underlying totalitarian</p>
<p begin="02:28:39.690" end="02:28:45.751" style="s2">impulse is still alive then and well and</p>
<p begin="02:28:43.530" end="02:28:47.311" style="s2">thriving I mean then what the Chinese</p>
<p begin="02:28:45.751" end="02:28:49.440" style="s2">are doing with electronic surveillance</p>
<p begin="02:28:47.311" end="02:28:54.891" style="s2">should make everyone&#39;s hair stand on end</p>
<p begin="02:28:49.440" end="02:28:54.891" style="s2">so yeah thing</p>

<p begin="02:29:27.139" end="02:29:31.939" style="s2">you you put a great emphasis on truth in</p>

<p begin="02:29:46.849" end="02:29:50.809" style="s2">about how Nietzsche foresaw the nihilism</p>
<p begin="02:29:49.009" end="02:29:53.179" style="s2">implicit in European culture in the</p>
<p begin="02:29:50.809" end="02:29:54.949" style="s2">1800s that would likely lead to the</p>
<p begin="02:29:53.179" end="02:29:56.299" style="s2">authoritarianism and death tolls</p>

<p begin="02:29:56.299" end="02:30:00.919" style="s2">quote and I find this interesting for</p>
<p begin="02:29:58.729" end="02:30:03.799" style="s2">the following reason so here&#39;s Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="02:30:00.919" end="02:30:05.899" style="s2">in the will to power radical nihilism is</p>
<p begin="02:30:03.799" end="02:30:07.579" style="s2">the conviction of an absolute unten</p>
<p begin="02:30:05.899" end="02:30:10.069" style="s2">ability of existence when it comes to</p>
<p begin="02:30:07.579" end="02:30:12.319" style="s2">the highest values one recognizes this</p>
<p begin="02:30:10.069" end="02:30:15.109" style="s2">realization is a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="02:30:12.319" end="02:30:18.169" style="s2">cultivation of truthfulness so in other</p>
<p begin="02:30:15.109" end="02:30:20.179" style="s2">words Nietzsche saw the that valuing</p>
<p begin="02:30:18.169" end="02:30:24.619" style="s2">truth to its fullest undercuts valuation</p>
<p begin="02:30:20.179" end="02:30:26.479" style="s2">itself within a Christian context by the</p>
<p begin="02:30:24.619" end="02:30:29.539" style="s2">way it can mean one of the things that</p>
<p begin="02:30:26.479" end="02:30:33.049" style="s2">that needs you in his role as Christian</p>
<p begin="02:30:29.539" end="02:30:36.289" style="s2">critic pointed out was that the death of</p>
<p begin="02:30:33.049" end="02:30:39.589" style="s2">God was a consequence in his formulation</p>
<p begin="02:30:36.289" end="02:30:43.539" style="s2">of the Christian insistence on truth so</p>
<p begin="02:30:39.589" end="02:30:46.999" style="s2">his his idea was essentially that as</p>
<p begin="02:30:43.539" end="02:30:49.009" style="s2">Christianity elevated the truth to the</p>
<p begin="02:30:46.999" end="02:30:53.919" style="s2">position of highest moral virtue and</p>
<p begin="02:30:49.009" end="02:30:56.329" style="s2">then that truth seeking spirit developed</p>
<p begin="02:30:53.919" end="02:30:59.419" style="s2">scientific and rational viewpoint that</p>
<p begin="02:30:56.329" end="02:31:02.239" style="s2">the logical consequence of that was the</p>
<p begin="02:30:59.419" end="02:31:03.589" style="s2">turning of the spirit of truth on the</p>
<p begin="02:31:02.239" end="02:31:06.049" style="s2">metaphysical presumptions of</p>
<p begin="02:31:03.589" end="02:31:08.179" style="s2">Christianity itself that&#39;s the context</p>
<p begin="02:31:06.049" end="02:31:10.549" style="s2">for that right so what I wanted to ask</p>
<p begin="02:31:08.179" end="02:31:13.069" style="s2">you is that you appear to care deeply</p>
<p begin="02:31:10.549" end="02:31:14.959" style="s2">about meeting and the philosophical</p>
<p begin="02:31:13.069" end="02:31:16.960" style="s2">problem of nihilism so I was just</p>
<p begin="02:31:14.959" end="02:31:20.650" style="s2">wondering if you could elaborate on this</p>
<p begin="02:31:16.960" end="02:31:23.890" style="s2">between nihilism and valuing truth light</p>
<p begin="02:31:20.650" end="02:31:25.330" style="s2">of what you&#39;re saying and whether</p>
<p begin="02:31:23.890" end="02:31:28.990" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which you see your</p>
<p begin="02:31:25.330" end="02:31:33.070" style="s2">ideas as elaborated in in your latest as</p>
<p begin="02:31:28.990" end="02:31:37.450" style="s2">a solution to the problems nihilism -</p>
<p begin="02:31:33.070" end="02:31:39.490" style="s2">the great question I think I think</p>
<p begin="02:31:37.450" end="02:31:43.690" style="s2">really that the Jung&#39;s work is the</p>
<p begin="02:31:39.490" end="02:31:46.150" style="s2">answer to that question because Jung was</p>
<p begin="02:31:43.690" end="02:31:50.860" style="s2">profoundly influenced by Freud obviously</p>
<p begin="02:31:46.150" end="02:31:53.800" style="s2">and if you read the Freudian biographers</p>
<p begin="02:31:50.860" end="02:31:57.970" style="s2">let&#39;s say it&#39;s easy to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="02:31:53.800" end="02:31:59.140" style="s2">Jung as a an acolyte of Freud but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:31:57.970" end="02:32:02.050" style="s2">not really accurate</p>
<p begin="02:31:59.140" end="02:32:03.430" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say or it&#39;s insufficiently</p>
<p begin="02:32:02.050" end="02:32:05.740" style="s2">accurate because Freud had a great</p>
<p begin="02:32:03.430" end="02:32:07.570" style="s2">influence on you but you know was also</p>
<p begin="02:32:05.740" end="02:32:11.800" style="s2">exceptionally influenced by Nietzsche</p>
<p begin="02:32:07.570" end="02:32:13.360" style="s2">and you I think you can also view Piaget</p>
<p begin="02:32:11.800" end="02:32:14.860" style="s2">in this manner by the way although not</p>
<p begin="02:32:13.360" end="02:32:16.000" style="s2">directly as a consequence of the</p>
<p begin="02:32:14.860" end="02:32:19.660" style="s2">influence of Nietzsche it be more</p>
<p begin="02:32:16.000" end="02:32:22.840" style="s2">indirect but you really regarded what he</p>
<p begin="02:32:19.660" end="02:32:25.390" style="s2">was doing as an answer to Nietzsche&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:32:22.840" end="02:32:30.970" style="s2">question and the question is something</p>
<p begin="02:32:25.390" end="02:32:34.030" style="s2">like well the inquiry inquiring Western</p>
<p begin="02:32:30.970" end="02:32:36.670" style="s2">rational mind has murdered or the</p>
<p begin="02:32:34.030" end="02:32:41.080" style="s2">metaphysical presuppositions of Western</p>

<p begin="02:36:40.841" end="02:36:44.381" style="s2">initiated properly in that regard is you</p>
<p begin="02:36:42.700" end="02:36:46.091" style="s2">develop a comprehensive philosophy of</p>

<p begin="02:37:27.461" end="02:37:31.511" style="s2">contact with someone who truly wants to</p>
<p begin="02:37:29.440" end="02:37:33.820" style="s2">hurt you the probability that that will</p>
<p begin="02:37:31.511" end="02:37:37.480" style="s2">undo you psychologically is very very</p>
<p begin="02:37:33.820" end="02:37:39.040" style="s2">high so you have to be wise as serpents</p>
<p begin="02:37:37.480" end="02:37:41.230" style="s2">that&#39;s the old saying you have to be</p>
<p begin="02:37:39.040" end="02:37:44.761" style="s2">wise as a serpent because otherwise you</p>
<p begin="02:37:41.230" end="02:37:44.761" style="s2">have no protection against serpents</p>
<p begin="02:37:50.880" end="02:37:55.210" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll do two more because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="02:37:53.260" end="02:37:59.560" style="s2">starting to get fuzzy minded and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="02:37:55.210" end="02:38:02.260" style="s2">learned to quit at that point mostly so</p>
<p begin="02:37:59.560" end="02:38:04.180" style="s2">we talked a bit before yeah before you</p>
<p begin="02:38:02.260" end="02:38:06.550" style="s2">started don&#39;t know exactly how to phrase</p>
<p begin="02:38:04.180" end="02:38:08.440" style="s2">this and I think that this will be like</p>
<p begin="02:38:06.550" end="02:38:10.000" style="s2">I do what I like acknowledge that all of</p>
<p begin="02:38:08.440" end="02:38:11.920" style="s2">this Q&amp;A has been amazing because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:38:10.000" end="02:38:14.410" style="s2">basically been a lecture mixed with</p>
<p begin="02:38:11.920" end="02:38:17.680" style="s2">reality and that&#39;s a good combination</p>
<p begin="02:38:14.410" end="02:38:20.050" style="s2">yeah it&#39;s a good combination and I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:38:17.680" end="02:38:22.000" style="s2">think many speakers I go to actually</p>
<p begin="02:38:20.050" end="02:38:25.300" style="s2">know how to combine that the way you did</p>
<p begin="02:38:22.000" end="02:38:26.770" style="s2">so thank you for that but uh I guess</p>
<p begin="02:38:25.300" end="02:38:28.920" style="s2">this question is a bit of a departure</p>
<p begin="02:38:26.770" end="02:38:32.440" style="s2">from that and it&#39;s sort of going to</p>
<p begin="02:38:28.920" end="02:38:34.930" style="s2">something more of a say I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="02:38:32.440" end="02:38:36.910" style="s2">everyone can relate to because it&#39;s in</p>
<p begin="02:38:34.930" end="02:38:39.850" style="s2">your book you say don&#39;t lie and I think</p>
<p begin="02:38:36.910" end="02:38:43.180" style="s2">that after living 21 short years I</p>
<p begin="02:38:39.850" end="02:38:45.400" style="s2">learned that the hard way but you and</p>
<p begin="02:38:43.180" end="02:38:48.760" style="s2">your life and me and my life I feel like</p>
<p begin="02:38:45.400" end="02:38:52.120" style="s2">we both a moment where we&#39;ve had to</p>
<p begin="02:38:48.760" end="02:38:54.880" style="s2">confront a sope alienating instance of</p>
<p begin="02:38:52.120" end="02:38:59.280" style="s2">nature where there is no path forward</p>
<p begin="02:38:54.880" end="02:39:01.690" style="s2">that we really have at our disposal and</p>
<p begin="02:38:59.280" end="02:39:03.100" style="s2">there&#39;s a point where an unnatural</p>
<p begin="02:39:01.690" end="02:39:05.410" style="s2">amount of growth had to come out of us</p>
<p begin="02:39:03.100" end="02:39:09.070" style="s2">so I just wanted to know where you drew</p>
<p begin="02:39:05.410" end="02:39:11.380" style="s2">that line at your own ability to develop</p>
<p begin="02:39:09.070" end="02:39:14.440" style="s2">as a person to where you didn&#39;t become</p>
<p begin="02:39:11.380" end="02:39:16.540" style="s2">tunnel visioned with trying to face</p>
<p begin="02:39:14.440" end="02:39:18.670" style="s2">life&#39;s problems on your own earth okay</p>
<p begin="02:39:16.540" end="02:39:21.010" style="s2">well we had talked just before this the</p>
<p begin="02:39:18.670" end="02:39:22.300" style="s2">second part of this Q&amp;A both my</p>
<p begin="02:39:21.010" end="02:39:24.190" style="s2">daughter&#39;s illness and about this</p>
<p begin="02:39:22.300" end="02:39:26.020" style="s2">gentleman&#39;s have illness in his family</p>
<p begin="02:39:24.190" end="02:39:29.910" style="s2">too so that&#39;s kind of the background to</p>
<p begin="02:39:26.020" end="02:39:29.910" style="s2">this well the first part of that is like</p>
<p begin="02:39:30.090" end="02:39:36.220" style="s2">if we were going to be pessimistically</p>
<p begin="02:39:33.280" end="02:39:40.750" style="s2">realistic about all this I would say</p>
<p begin="02:39:36.220" end="02:39:42.220" style="s2">that your best that is truth but that</p>
<p begin="02:39:40.750" end="02:39:44.650" style="s2">doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="02:39:42.220" end="02:39:47.410" style="s2">going to do the trick right I mean</p>
<p begin="02:39:44.650" end="02:39:51.520" style="s2">sometimes you go fight a dragon and it</p>
<p begin="02:39:47.410" end="02:39:54.370" style="s2">eats you and if the if you being eaten</p>
<p begin="02:39:51.520" end="02:39:57.070" style="s2">wasn&#39;t a real possibility it wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="02:39:54.370" end="02:39:59.550" style="s2">a real fight and so you see people like</p>
<p begin="02:39:57.070" end="02:40:02.851" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen people</p>
<p begin="02:39:59.550" end="02:40:05.070" style="s2">in my clinical practice sometimes I had</p>
<p begin="02:40:02.851" end="02:40:06.450" style="s2">one client in particular who was</p>
<p begin="02:40:05.070" end="02:40:08.570" style="s2">undergoing a particularly vicious</p>
<p begin="02:40:06.450" end="02:40:11.221" style="s2">divorce with someone who was really</p>
<p begin="02:40:08.570" end="02:40:14.010" style="s2">seriously inclined to take him out and</p>
<p begin="02:40:11.221" end="02:40:17.311" style="s2">would do pretty much everything at her</p>
<p begin="02:40:14.010" end="02:40:20.130" style="s2">disposal to do so and I strategized with</p>
<p begin="02:40:17.311" end="02:40:23.101" style="s2">him for about three years and we did</p>
<p begin="02:40:20.130" end="02:40:24.900" style="s2">everything like and hyper carefully he</p>
<p begin="02:40:23.101" end="02:40:27.061" style="s2">was a very conscientious and diligent</p>
<p begin="02:40:24.900" end="02:40:28.800" style="s2">person and he put into practice</p>
<p begin="02:40:27.061" end="02:40:31.050" style="s2">everything that we discussed and</p>
<p begin="02:40:28.800" end="02:40:32.851" style="s2">strategized and he still pretty much he</p>
<p begin="02:40:31.050" end="02:40:35.721" style="s2">got backed into a corner so hard that I</p>
<p begin="02:40:32.851" end="02:40:38.700" style="s2">didn&#39;t know how to help him anymore so I</p>
<p begin="02:40:35.721" end="02:40:40.440" style="s2">would say however that he like he was a</p>
<p begin="02:40:38.700" end="02:40:43.351" style="s2">very truthful person throughout that and</p>
<p begin="02:40:40.440" end="02:40:47.700" style="s2">one thing he did do was part of it was a</p>
<p begin="02:40:43.351" end="02:40:51.510" style="s2">custody battle and he did manage despite</p>
<p begin="02:40:47.700" end="02:40:54.061" style="s2">his decline in consequence of being</p>
<p begin="02:40:51.510" end="02:40:56.101" style="s2">repeatedly cornered I would say he did</p>
<p begin="02:40:54.061" end="02:40:59.250" style="s2">manage to establish what I think was a</p>
<p begin="02:40:56.101" end="02:41:02.280" style="s2">lasting relationship with his kids so he</p>
<p begin="02:40:59.250" end="02:41:05.311" style="s2">might have got enough out of what he did</p>
<p begin="02:41:02.280" end="02:41:09.601" style="s2">to justify it even though the whole</p>
<p begin="02:41:05.311" end="02:41:12.530" style="s2">landscape was pretty awful I think that</p>
<p begin="02:41:09.601" end="02:41:16.290" style="s2">not lying is your best bet</p>
<p begin="02:41:12.530" end="02:41:19.110" style="s2">but life is hard and people get run over</p>
<p begin="02:41:16.290" end="02:41:20.971" style="s2">and it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that</p>
<p begin="02:41:19.110" end="02:41:24.510" style="s2">you&#39;re going to emerge in any obvious</p>
<p begin="02:41:20.971" end="02:41:26.790" style="s2">sense triumphant but if you take the</p>
<p begin="02:41:24.510" end="02:41:29.940" style="s2">alternative path path especially when</p>
<p begin="02:41:26.790" end="02:41:32.610" style="s2">you&#39;re facing severe tribulations let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:41:29.940" end="02:41:34.860" style="s2">say and you complicate those with deceit</p>
<p begin="02:41:32.610" end="02:41:36.360" style="s2">you can be sure that whatever tragedy</p>
<p begin="02:41:34.860" end="02:41:38.641" style="s2">that you&#39;re confronting is going to turn</p>
<p begin="02:41:36.360" end="02:41:41.580" style="s2">into not only tragedy but something very</p>
<p begin="02:41:38.641" end="02:41:43.740" style="s2">much akin to hell and so you might be</p>
<p begin="02:41:41.580" end="02:41:46.800" style="s2">able to at least minimize the degree of</p>
<p begin="02:41:43.740" end="02:41:49.410" style="s2">suffering even if you can&#39;t overcome it</p>
<p begin="02:41:46.800" end="02:41:52.410" style="s2">or transcendent and that&#39;s something you</p>
<p begin="02:41:49.410" end="02:41:54.330" style="s2">know it&#39;s something I I&#39;m always</p>
<p begin="02:41:52.410" end="02:41:57.271" style="s2">reminded in a discussion like this of</p>
<p begin="02:41:54.330" end="02:41:59.280" style="s2">what I watched when my my wife&#39;s family</p>
<p begin="02:41:57.271" end="02:42:03.271" style="s2">were around the deathbed of her mother</p>
<p begin="02:41:59.280" end="02:42:05.250" style="s2">she had frontotemporal dementia which is</p>
<p begin="02:42:03.271" end="02:42:11.120" style="s2">like Alzheimer&#39;s had quite an awful way</p>
<p begin="02:42:05.250" end="02:42:13.501" style="s2">to go and her husband my father-in-law</p>
<p begin="02:42:11.120" end="02:42:15.900" style="s2">really stepped up to the plate</p>
<p begin="02:42:13.501" end="02:42:18.570" style="s2">like he was quite the man about town</p>
<p begin="02:42:15.900" end="02:42:20.311" style="s2">very extroverted partier type and quite</p>
<p begin="02:42:18.570" end="02:42:23.131" style="s2">disagreeable but when his wife got sick</p>
<p begin="02:42:20.311" end="02:42:25.381" style="s2">man he was there it was something to</p>
<p begin="02:42:23.131" end="02:42:27.811" style="s2">watch and so he turned what could have</p>
<p begin="02:42:25.381" end="02:42:30.660" style="s2">been absolutely dreadful into just</p>
<p begin="02:42:27.811" end="02:42:32.431" style="s2">miserable and then when their entire</p>
<p begin="02:42:30.660" end="02:42:37.410" style="s2">family was gathered around her deathbed</p>
<p begin="02:42:32.431" end="02:42:39.480" style="s2">like my wife and her sister had both</p>
<p begin="02:42:37.410" end="02:42:42.211" style="s2">dealt with dying people before and the</p>
<p begin="02:42:39.480" end="02:42:45.360" style="s2">other sister was a pharmacist and they</p>
<p begin="02:42:42.211" end="02:42:49.440" style="s2">were attentive to their mother and there</p>
<p begin="02:42:45.360" end="02:42:51.570" style="s2">was no foolish catastrophes going on</p>
<p begin="02:42:49.440" end="02:42:54.121" style="s2">between the family and they all pulled</p>
<p begin="02:42:51.570" end="02:42:56.791" style="s2">together and so their mother died but</p>
<p begin="02:42:54.121" end="02:42:58.771" style="s2">what I observed was that their bonds</p>
<p begin="02:42:56.791" end="02:43:01.410" style="s2">were strengthened as a consequence and</p>
<p begin="02:42:58.771" end="02:43:02.700" style="s2">that they gained something from the</p>
<p begin="02:43:01.410" end="02:43:04.681" style="s2">tightening of the remaining</p>
<p begin="02:43:02.700" end="02:43:06.181" style="s2">relationships that was at least partial</p>
<p begin="02:43:04.681" end="02:43:08.190" style="s2">compensation for the loss of their</p>
<p begin="02:43:06.181" end="02:43:10.081" style="s2">mother and that beat the hell out of</p>
<p begin="02:43:08.190" end="02:43:12.030" style="s2">squabbling about everything while she</p>
<p begin="02:43:10.081" end="02:43:14.181" style="s2">was dying because that&#39;s a real</p>
<p begin="02:43:12.030" end="02:43:17.181" style="s2">possibility and people certainly do that</p>
<p begin="02:43:14.181" end="02:43:17.181" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="02:43:19.939" end="02:43:24.340" style="s2">one more and maybe we&#39;ll call it a night</p>
<p begin="02:43:27.370" end="02:43:33.920" style="s2">the one thing that has been kind of</p>
<p begin="02:43:30.380" end="02:43:36.610" style="s2">going to my mind in this discussion in</p>
<p begin="02:43:33.920" end="02:43:38.330" style="s2">general when I watch their videos</p>
<p begin="02:43:36.610" end="02:43:41.120" style="s2">personally one of the most interesting</p>
<p begin="02:43:38.330" end="02:43:43.670" style="s2">aspects of neuroscience to me is no</p>
<p begin="02:43:41.120" end="02:43:46.580" style="s2">robusticity when the brain capacity to</p>
<p begin="02:43:43.670" end="02:43:49.850" style="s2">change the adaptive but I think that a</p>
<p begin="02:43:46.580" end="02:43:53.180" style="s2">dynamic issue and your toxin you know in</p>
<p begin="02:43:49.850" end="02:43:55.689" style="s2">your arguments is that people both on</p>
<p begin="02:43:53.180" end="02:43:57.200" style="s2">the left and on the right can be</p>
<p begin="02:43:55.689" end="02:43:59.270" style="s2">possessed by it</p>
<p begin="02:43:57.200" end="02:44:02.710" style="s2">they all need five key points that will</p>
<p begin="02:43:59.270" end="02:44:05.300" style="s2">then be stagnant and not to change their</p>
<p begin="02:44:02.710" end="02:44:08.479" style="s2">they don&#39;t really understand that maybe</p>
<p begin="02:44:05.300" end="02:44:12.670" style="s2">to the one that they should but big plus</p>
<p begin="02:44:08.479" end="02:44:14.990" style="s2">sign right and so my opinion is that</p>
<p begin="02:44:12.670" end="02:44:17.540" style="s2">that makes a little bit of a paradox</p>
<p begin="02:44:14.990" end="02:44:20.360" style="s2">because you know we are wired we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="02:44:17.540" end="02:44:23.720" style="s2">hardwired essentially become adept to</p>
<p begin="02:44:20.360" end="02:44:25.370" style="s2">change we&#39;re able to change ourselves to</p>
<p begin="02:44:23.720" end="02:44:27.560" style="s2">respond to the thing on our environment</p>
<p begin="02:44:25.370" end="02:44:30.229" style="s2">our brain itself James I have to start</p>
<p begin="02:44:27.560" end="02:44:31.399" style="s2">behavior though the actual the heaters</p>
<p begin="02:44:30.229" end="02:44:33.590" style="s2">at the derivation of what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="02:44:31.399" end="02:44:35.300" style="s2">changing so you&#39;re arguing is that a lot</p>
<p begin="02:44:33.590" end="02:44:36.979" style="s2">of people will become you know it touch</p>
<p begin="02:44:35.300" end="02:44:38.930" style="s2">this and they&#39;ll stay stagnant so how do</p>
<p begin="02:44:36.979" end="02:44:40.820" style="s2">you explain you know what aspects of</p>
<p begin="02:44:38.930" end="02:44:43.580" style="s2">political phenomena or you know just</p>
<p begin="02:44:40.820" end="02:44:45.430" style="s2">social discourse what is so powerful</p>
<p begin="02:44:43.580" end="02:44:48.280" style="s2">about that that it overcomes our</p>
<p begin="02:44:45.430" end="02:44:54.100" style="s2">predisposed to different</p>
<p begin="02:44:48.280" end="02:44:56.810" style="s2">well changes changes especially if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:44:54.100" end="02:44:59.149" style="s2">the more radical the necessary change</p>
<p begin="02:44:56.810" end="02:45:01.880" style="s2">the more pain that accompanies it like</p>
<p begin="02:44:59.149" end="02:45:03.740" style="s2">the more opportunity as well but and a</p>
<p begin="02:45:01.880" end="02:45:05.630" style="s2">lot of what we learn we learn painfully</p>
<p begin="02:45:03.740" end="02:45:07.939" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not surprising that people</p>
<p begin="02:45:05.630" end="02:45:10.160" style="s2">shrink away from learning we learn in</p>
<p begin="02:45:07.939" end="02:45:12.290" style="s2">pain and anxiety very frequently</p>
<p begin="02:45:10.160" end="02:45:13.939" style="s2">everyone knows that like the things that</p>
<p begin="02:45:12.290" end="02:45:16.550" style="s2">really that you really learned in life</p>
<p begin="02:45:13.939" end="02:45:18.710" style="s2">it&#39;s like there was no joy man like it</p>
<p begin="02:45:16.550" end="02:45:22.070" style="s2">took you out and so the fact that people</p>
<p begin="02:45:18.710" end="02:45:24.110" style="s2">flee from that is hardly surprising but</p>
<p begin="02:45:22.070" end="02:45:26.720" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t help that&#39;s the thing it just</p>
<p begin="02:45:24.110" end="02:45:30.170" style="s2">stores up the catastrophe for later and</p>
<p begin="02:45:26.720" end="02:45:31.729" style="s2">so the better the better idea is to eat</p>
<p begin="02:45:30.170" end="02:45:33.580" style="s2">a little poison every day so that you</p>
<p begin="02:45:31.729" end="02:45:36.430" style="s2">don&#39;t have to overdose in a month</p>
<p begin="02:45:33.580" end="02:45:40.420" style="s2">it&#39;s something like that and it is the</p>
<p begin="02:45:36.430" end="02:45:42.310" style="s2">case that I think because you don&#39;t you</p>
<p begin="02:45:40.420" end="02:45:43.990" style="s2">aren&#39;t forced first of all you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="02:45:42.310" end="02:45:45.700" style="s2">learn unless you&#39;re forced to learn I</p>
<p begin="02:45:43.990" end="02:45:47.200" style="s2">know there&#39;s alternatives to that</p>
<p begin="02:45:45.700" end="02:45:49.000" style="s2">there&#39;s the voluntary search for</p>
<p begin="02:45:47.200" end="02:45:52.270" style="s2">knowledge and that&#39;s a fine thing and</p>
<p begin="02:45:49.000" end="02:45:56.170" style="s2">that is an antidote to this but apart</p>
<p begin="02:45:52.270" end="02:45:58.060" style="s2">from that speaking more practically you</p>
<p begin="02:45:56.170" end="02:46:00.520" style="s2">tend not to learn unless you&#39;re forced</p>
<p begin="02:45:58.060" end="02:46:02.500" style="s2">to learn and it&#39;s and what you tend to</p>
<p begin="02:46:00.520" end="02:46:07.720" style="s2">learn by force are difficult lessons and</p>
<p begin="02:46:02.500" end="02:46:11.290" style="s2">so people are very prone to not do not</p>

<p begin="02:46:26.859" end="02:46:30.460" style="s2">all you do is make it worse in the</p>
<p begin="02:46:28.330" end="02:46:33.609" style="s2">future you make yourself smaller and you</p>
<p begin="02:46:30.460" end="02:46:36.010" style="s2">make the lesson harder and so that&#39;s why</p>
<p begin="02:46:33.609" end="02:46:38.890" style="s2">in so many religious doctrines there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="02:46:36.010" end="02:46:42.430" style="s2">emphasis on humility you know and</p>
<p begin="02:46:38.890" end="02:46:45.220" style="s2">humility is to debase yourself it&#39;s to</p>

<p begin="02:46:45.220" end="02:46:49.300" style="s2">that your life isn&#39;t going to be</p>
<p begin="02:46:46.479" end="02:46:51.790" style="s2">miserable and so every chance you get to</p>

<p begin="02:46:51.790" end="02:46:56.560" style="s2">along your way you should take it as</p>
<p begin="02:46:54.010" end="02:47:02.530" style="s2">fast as you can but you have to have a</p>

<p begin="02:47:02.530" end="02:47:06.790" style="s2">and also a harsh one because it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="02:47:04.899" end="02:47:07.960" style="s2">just tragedy it&#39;s also malevolence you</p>
<p begin="02:47:06.790" end="02:47:10.960" style="s2">have to understand that those are</p>
<p begin="02:47:07.960" end="02:47:13.359" style="s2">waiting for you and that makes you</p>
