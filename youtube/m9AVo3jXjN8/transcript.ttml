<p begin="00:02:05.520" end="00:02:09.440" style="s2">interested in human behavior and</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.799" end="00:02:09.840" style="s2">psychology and so while the rest of the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.440" end="00:02:12.480" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.840" end="00:02:14.000" style="s2">is uh is collapsing it feels like um</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.480" end="00:02:15.360" style="s2">jesse and i took the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.000" end="00:02:17.760" style="s2">capitalize on it and it&#39;s working out</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.360" end="00:02:20.879" style="s2">pretty well for us with this podcast</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.760" end="00:02:22.239" style="s2">awesome and i mean we&#39;re all three of us</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.879" end="00:02:23.760" style="s2">journalists so this might get a little</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.239" end="00:02:25.120" style="s2">bit inside baseball</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.760" end="00:02:26.560" style="s2">so we&#39;re going to try and kind of keep</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.120" end="00:02:28.000" style="s2">it as big picture as possible but i</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.560" end="00:02:30.480" style="s2">think there is</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.000" end="00:02:31.920" style="s2">a lot of framing that we need to do kind</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.480" end="00:02:32.959" style="s2">of just going over the the recent</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.920" end="00:02:34.640" style="s2">history which</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.959" end="00:02:36.319" style="s2">feels like there&#39;s there&#39;s a huge amount</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.640" end="00:02:37.680" style="s2">even in the last two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.319" end="00:02:39.440" style="s2">and i&#39;d really direct people to your</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.680" end="00:02:40.720" style="s2">podcast if they want to kind of double</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.440" end="00:02:44.800" style="s2">click on any of it</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.720" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">but in particular the the new york times</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.800" end="00:02:51.680" style="s2">um the the op-ed editor there</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.160" end="00:02:52.879" style="s2">left after some big um kind of rebellion</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.680" end="00:02:54.239" style="s2">inside the paper</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.879" end="00:02:56.400" style="s2">seems to have been led by mostly the</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.239" end="00:02:57.840" style="s2">kind of the news staff there was a tweet</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.400" end="00:02:59.840" style="s2">storm by barry weiss</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.840" end="00:03:01.599" style="s2">who&#39;s an opinion writer there</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.840" end="00:03:03.040" style="s2">controversial opinion writer there</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.599" end="00:03:05.280" style="s2">or controversial to people inside the</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.040" end="00:03:07.120" style="s2">paper she originally</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.280" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">coined she wrote the original article</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.120" end="00:03:10.400" style="s2">about the intellectual dark web that</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.200" style="s2">people might be familiar with</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.400" end="00:03:14.720" style="s2">um and i think she she laid out in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.200" end="00:03:16.000" style="s2">series of tweets kind of what she</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.720" end="00:03:17.040" style="s2">thought was going on inside the</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.000" end="00:03:19.040" style="s2">newsrooms</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.040" end="00:03:20.800" style="s2">largely a kind of generational divide</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.040" end="00:03:22.720" style="s2">between sort of the new</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.800" end="00:03:24.560" style="s2">more woke journalists and an older kind</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.720" end="00:03:26.640" style="s2">of liberal class of journalists</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.560" end="00:03:28.560" style="s2">and then there&#39;s a matt tybee piece</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.640" end="00:03:31.519" style="s2">which talked about i think eight</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.560" end="00:03:33.200" style="s2">different revolts inside newsrooms that</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.519" end="00:03:35.440" style="s2">seem to follow a similar pattern over</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.200" end="00:03:37.360" style="s2">the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.440" end="00:03:39.519" style="s2">there was a tweet by mati iglesias who</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.360" end="00:03:41.120" style="s2">was one of the original founders of vox</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.519" end="00:03:42.879" style="s2">where he basically said he&#39;d have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.120" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">apologize for saying that this was a</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.879" end="00:03:46.080" style="s2">problem just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:47.360" style="s2">confined to university campuses so all</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.080" end="00:03:48.560" style="s2">of this stuff was coming kind of thick</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.360" end="00:03:51.440" style="s2">and fast</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.560" end="00:03:52.799" style="s2">um how would you you summarize it and we</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.440" end="00:03:54.319" style="s2">can kind of double click on any of those</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.799" end="00:03:55.599" style="s2">and go into the details of it but how</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.319" end="00:03:56.879" style="s2">would you summarize</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.599" end="00:04:00.640" style="s2">what&#39;s been going on over the last</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.879" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">couple of weeks go for a case uh i would</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.640" end="00:04:04.080" style="s2">call what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:05.360" style="s2">a part of an element of what i see as an</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.080" end="00:04:06.879" style="s2">ongoing moral panic</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.360" end="00:04:08.480" style="s2">um that has taken over lots of</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.879" end="00:04:10.080" style="s2">institutions across the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.480" end="00:04:12.239" style="s2">particularly the western world</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.080" end="00:04:13.760" style="s2">um that seems to really have sunk its</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.239" end="00:04:15.040" style="s2">claws into journalism</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.760" end="00:04:17.120" style="s2">and what we&#39;ve been observing over the</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.040" end="00:04:18.560" style="s2">past couple weeks a lot of us have been</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.120" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">observing for years and</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.560" end="00:04:22.079" style="s2">it has just sort of broken open in a way</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:23.360" style="s2">that i think is more visible to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.079" end="00:04:26.000" style="s2">public right now which is</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.360" end="00:04:26.560" style="s2">frankly a bit of a relief that this</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.000" end="00:04:28.320" style="s2">thing that</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.560" end="00:04:30.000" style="s2">that that jesse and i have been writing</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.320" end="00:04:32.639" style="s2">about and sort of trying to warn people</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.000" end="00:04:35.120" style="s2">about for years is now um is now open</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.639" end="00:04:37.280" style="s2">um so it&#39;s been wild to watch and uh it</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.120" end="00:04:38.880" style="s2">feels very destabilizing but also at</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.280" end="00:04:40.479" style="s2">least people are talking about it now</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.880" end="00:04:42.000" style="s2">and acknowledging some people at least</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.479" end="00:04:44.880" style="s2">are acknowledging that this this trend</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.000" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">is uh israel yeah i think katie&#39;s giving</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.880" end="00:04:50.400" style="s2">me slightly too much credit because i</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:52.160" style="s2">i think i in areas where i had done</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.400" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">reporting i had noticed a certain</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.160" end="00:04:54.479" style="s2">tendency to not treat questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:56.320" style="s2">journalistically</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.479" end="00:04:58.320" style="s2">and to to really tip things too far in</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.320" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">the activist direction</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.320" end="00:05:00.880" style="s2">i don&#39;t think i realized how bad it was</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:02.240" style="s2">until around the time we started the</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.880" end="00:05:05.360" style="s2">podcast maybe even after</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.240" end="00:05:08.400" style="s2">um there&#39;s a sense that</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.360" end="00:05:10.080" style="s2">certain important norms of liberal</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.400" end="00:05:11.759" style="s2">values and particularly journalistic</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.080" end="00:05:14.479" style="s2">values are being tossed aside because</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.759" end="00:05:16.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a bit of a revolutionary moment and</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.479" end="00:05:17.520" style="s2">my argument was it is that if if you</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.320" end="00:05:18.720" style="s2">care about the world and you want to</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.520" end="00:05:20.320" style="s2">improve it and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.720" end="00:05:22.400" style="s2">care about things like police brutality</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.320" end="00:05:24.560" style="s2">and racial justice</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.400" end="00:05:26.320" style="s2">it has to be grounded in in liberal</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.560" end="00:05:28.800" style="s2">values and in journalism and in</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.320" end="00:05:30.320" style="s2">science and a lot of what&#39;s going on now</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.800" end="00:05:32.080" style="s2">is not that in part because people are</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.320" end="00:05:34.479" style="s2">afraid that if they say the wrong thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.080" end="00:05:35.120" style="s2">and this happened this week or last week</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.479" end="00:05:38.080" style="s2">a kid</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.120" end="00:05:39.680" style="s2">at a data scientist tweeted a respected</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.080" end="00:05:42.320" style="s2">study showing that</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">in certain contexts um violent protests</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.320" end="00:05:45.520" style="s2">could be shown to not work</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:47.360" style="s2">relative to violent protest which you</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.520" end="00:05:49.280" style="s2">know it&#39;s complicated subject</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.360" end="00:05:50.639" style="s2">he got fired because people said they</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.280" end="00:05:51.039" style="s2">were offended that he would even suggest</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.639" end="00:05:52.880" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.039" end="00:05:54.720" style="s2">and and the academic study was by a</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.880" end="00:05:56.639" style="s2">black academic as well i think</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.720" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">omar was so yeah i think he&#39;s biracially</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.639" end="00:05:59.520" style="s2">identifies as black</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.000" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">yeah i mean that that was one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.919" end="00:06:04.639" style="s2">most kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.720" end="00:06:07.919" style="s2">that seemed to be one of the most kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.000" end="00:06:09.440" style="s2">of intense examples i was going to come</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.919" end="00:06:10.560" style="s2">to this a bit later in the conversation</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.440" end="00:06:12.639" style="s2">but i think i&#39;m going to come to it now</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.560" end="00:06:14.560" style="s2">because katie you mentioned that</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.639" end="00:06:15.840" style="s2">it feels like everyone now realizes that</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.560" end="00:06:18.080" style="s2">there&#39;s a problem</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.840" end="00:06:20.240" style="s2">it&#39;s not that&#39;s not strictly true i mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.080" end="00:06:21.759" style="s2">there was an article by nathan robinson</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.240" end="00:06:22.479" style="s2">and current affairs that basically sort</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.759" end="00:06:24.080" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.479" end="00:06:25.840" style="s2">pooh-poohed the whole idea that there is</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.080" end="00:06:27.680" style="s2">this moral panic and was just saying</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.840" end="00:06:29.360" style="s2">that it&#39;s being used to attack the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.680" end="00:06:31.759" style="s2">and if you look into these questions</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.360" end="00:06:33.520" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s overblown or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.759" end="00:06:35.199" style="s2">right-wing agitators</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.520" end="00:06:37.120" style="s2">so there is there are still people kind</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.199" end="00:06:38.400" style="s2">of saying no this is this isn&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.120" end="00:06:39.840" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.400" end="00:06:42.560" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s definitely true and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.840" end="00:06:43.840" style="s2">has been that&#39;s been ongoing so</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.560" end="00:06:45.600" style="s2">anybody who&#39;s written about</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.840" end="00:06:47.440" style="s2">quote-unquote cancel culture over the</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.600" end="00:06:49.039" style="s2">past year so every time there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.440" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">article or a piece about it there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.039" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">backlash to that and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:53.680" style="s2">people particularly people on the left</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:54.960" style="s2">who say no cancer culture isn&#39;t real</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.680" end="00:06:57.840" style="s2">cancer culture is just</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.960" end="00:06:58.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s just you know a response to</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.840" end="00:07:01.840" style="s2">criticism</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.720" end="00:07:02.720" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s uh it&#39;s right grifter</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.840" end="00:07:04.560" style="s2">is trying to</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.720" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">trying to sort of shield themselves from</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.560" end="00:07:06.479" style="s2">any sort of criticism so that has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:08.479" style="s2">ongoing</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.479" end="00:07:10.400" style="s2">i have seen people who before have said</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.479" end="00:07:11.840" style="s2">like cancer culture isn&#39;t real in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.400" end="00:07:13.120" style="s2">past couple weeks say okay it&#39;s real but</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.840" end="00:07:15.120" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.120" end="00:07:16.960" style="s2">um so yes there is there the denial</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.120" end="00:07:18.639" style="s2">continues but i think it&#39;s it&#39;s harder</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.960" end="00:07:20.080" style="s2">it&#39;s harder to deny for most people both</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.639" end="00:07:21.599" style="s2">inside and outside of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.080" end="00:07:23.120" style="s2">echo chambers that we live in i</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.599" end="00:07:23.840" style="s2">personally have had a few people</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.120" end="00:07:25.199" style="s2">actually</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.840" end="00:07:26.880" style="s2">do sort of the remarkable thing of</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.199" end="00:07:28.639" style="s2">apologize to me in the past couple weeks</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.880" end="00:07:30.160" style="s2">were saying you know i thought you were</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.639" end="00:07:31.919" style="s2">crazy when you were writing about sort</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.160" end="00:07:33.199" style="s2">of the excesses of cancer culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.919" end="00:07:34.880" style="s2">over the past couple years and now that</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.199" end="00:07:36.800" style="s2">i see that you&#39;re right so um that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.880" end="00:07:38.080" style="s2">new experience for me</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.800" end="00:07:39.520" style="s2">but yeah i think you&#39;re right people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.080" end="00:07:41.199" style="s2">definitely there&#39;s still a contingent of</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.520" end="00:07:42.160" style="s2">people who are very invested in denying</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.199" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">that this uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.160" end="00:07:45.840" style="s2">this trend is is happening</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.479" end="00:07:50.560" style="s2">yeah what did you make of that article</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:53.759" style="s2">jesse</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.560" end="00:07:55.440" style="s2">you know there&#39;s been sort of a long</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.759" end="00:07:56.800" style="s2">this is a whole sub genre of articles</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.440" end="00:07:58.000" style="s2">now that tries to make this out as</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.800" end="00:08:00.479" style="s2">though on the one hand</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.000" end="00:08:02.160" style="s2">are you know reactionary white men and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.479" end="00:08:04.720" style="s2">maybe katie is an honorary</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.160" end="00:08:05.520" style="s2">reactionary white man i identify as a</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.720" end="00:08:08.240" style="s2">reactionary</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.520" end="00:08:09.840" style="s2">white man there we go um so so it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.240" end="00:08:11.520" style="s2">this totally oversimplified view where</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.840" end="00:08:13.039" style="s2">on the one hand are those</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.520" end="00:08:14.639" style="s2">evil reactionary white people who just</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.039" end="00:08:15.759" style="s2">want to continue being racist without</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.639" end="00:08:16.800" style="s2">consequences</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.759" end="00:08:18.160" style="s2">on the other hand are the people</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.800" end="00:08:20.160" style="s2">fighting for social justice who just</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.160" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">want them to stop being racist</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.160" end="00:08:22.960" style="s2">this is a complete oversimplification</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:24.479" style="s2">because when we talk about cancer</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.960" end="00:08:28.240" style="s2">culture however you define it i</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.479" end="00:08:29.759" style="s2">you know i people like dave chappelle</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.240" end="00:08:31.360" style="s2">are not affected by cancer culture</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.759" end="00:08:33.599" style="s2">because they&#39;re rich and powerful even</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.360" end="00:08:34.880" style="s2">people like me much lower on the sort of</p>

<p begin="00:08:36.959" end="00:08:40.159" style="s2">i&#39;m much more worried about you know</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.240" end="00:08:41.760" style="s2">david shore the kid who got he&#39;s 28</p>

<p begin="00:08:41.760" end="00:08:44.800" style="s2">because of a dumb twitter blow up</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.279" end="00:08:46.399" style="s2">the washington post just wrote an</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.800" end="00:08:46.959" style="s2">article about a year and a half incident</p>

<p begin="00:08:55.120" end="00:08:57.920" style="s2">was humiliated that wasn&#39;t enough they</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.560" end="00:08:59.360" style="s2">had to dig it up a year and a half later</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.920" end="00:09:01.519" style="s2">now she&#39;s fired she&#39;s a</p>

<p begin="00:09:07.040" end="00:09:09.839" style="s2">so when we talk about cancer culture</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.560" end="00:09:12.000" style="s2">it&#39;s very punitive</p>

<p begin="00:09:14.480" end="00:09:18.080" style="s2">it&#39;s more vulnerable people who are more</p>

<p begin="00:09:18.080" end="00:09:21.200" style="s2">affected by it so that&#39;s that&#39;s usually</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.680" end="00:09:22.480" style="s2">my response when people claim this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.200" end="00:09:23.600" style="s2">a thing or that we shouldn&#39;t worry about</p>

<p begin="00:09:45.360" end="00:09:48.399" style="s2">of like you just point to the one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.959" end="00:09:50.080" style="s2">doing well and like jesse i think</p>

<p begin="00:09:50.080" end="00:09:53.120" style="s2">but for people who</p>

<p begin="00:09:53.120" end="00:09:56.560" style="s2">the public eye it can be</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.959" end="00:09:58.080" style="s2">terrible for your career and for your</p>

<p begin="00:10:01.920" end="00:10:05.600" style="s2">happening but it&#39;s uh</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:06.560" style="s2">some people certainly still deny it yeah</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.600" end="00:10:10.560" style="s2">and i want to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.560" end="00:10:13.600" style="s2">focus on the the moment right now i mean</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.560" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">you guys and rebel wisdom like i&#39;ve done</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.600" end="00:10:16.800" style="s2">interviews with brett</p>

<p begin="00:10:18.160" end="00:10:20.399" style="s2">arguments i think a lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.200" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">watching will be familiar with the</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.399" end="00:10:24.240" style="s2">backstory and</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.360" style="s2">how how much this has been growing over</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.240" end="00:10:28.640" style="s2">the last few years</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.360" end="00:10:30.880" style="s2">but just right now i i had a a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.640" end="00:10:32.640" style="s2">texts from friends in newsrooms</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.880" end="00:10:34.240" style="s2">saying that things have shifted just in</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.640" end="00:10:35.839" style="s2">the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.240" end="00:10:37.360" style="s2">that the kind of language that&#39;s being</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.839" end="00:10:39.760" style="s2">used and when</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.360" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">in the uk we didn&#39;t really have that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.760" end="00:10:43.519" style="s2">the same kind of language as you have in</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:45.760" style="s2">the states like the allyship and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.519" end="00:10:46.640" style="s2">people of color and that&#39;s not really</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.760" end="00:10:48.320" style="s2">english</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.640" end="00:10:49.920" style="s2">that hasn&#39;t been english terminology and</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.320" end="00:10:52.959" style="s2">he&#39;s saying that the</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.920" end="00:10:55.279" style="s2">the the tone of just the the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.959" end="00:10:57.519" style="s2">the language in the newsroom has changed</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.279" end="00:10:59.440" style="s2">dramatically even in the last two weeks</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.519" end="00:11:00.079" style="s2">and the atmosphere in editorial meetings</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.440" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">he described</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.079" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">as incendiary and that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">what are you hearing from people from</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:10.640" style="s2">from friends or former colleagues in</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:14.320" style="s2">in newsrooms i mean it&#39;s the same</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.640" end="00:11:15.920" style="s2">yeah yeah i heard uh yesterday from a a</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.320" end="00:11:17.760" style="s2">friend in a newsroom that at his</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.920" end="00:11:19.760" style="s2">newsroom they have started</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.760" end="00:11:20.959" style="s2">they started a book club but the book</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.760" end="00:11:22.160" style="s2">club</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.959" end="00:11:23.360" style="s2">it was sort of posed as like there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.160" end="00:11:25.120" style="s2">going to be a book club in this in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.360" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">newsroom but it has devolved into or</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.120" end="00:11:28.720" style="s2">maybe evil</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.839" style="s2">into a book club about just like racial</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.720" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">justice issues</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.839" end="00:11:33.440" style="s2">so he was telling me about a meeting of</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:34.959" style="s2">this book club where white people were</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.440" end="00:11:36.480" style="s2">sitting around and just talking about</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.959" end="00:11:38.000" style="s2">their like it was like an aaa meeting</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.480" end="00:11:39.600" style="s2">they were saying like like one by one</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.000" end="00:11:40.480" style="s2">going by like my name is katie and i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.600" end="00:11:42.800" style="s2">racist</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.480" end="00:11:44.800" style="s2">um which is a very bizarre thing to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.800" end="00:11:47.120" style="s2">imagine happening in any workplace</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.800" end="00:11:49.440" style="s2">much less a newsroom um but it is</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.120" end="00:11:53.120" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.440" end="00:11:54.480" style="s2">yeah and i think um i&#39;ve also heard from</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.120" end="00:11:55.920" style="s2">people who just don&#39;t really think they</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.480" end="00:11:57.600" style="s2">can do their jobs well anymore because</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.920" end="00:11:59.360" style="s2">like if you&#39;re covering</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.600" end="00:12:01.040" style="s2">one example is just like the protests in</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.360" end="00:12:03.040" style="s2">the states which have been</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.040" end="00:12:04.560" style="s2">i think overwhelmingly peaceful and i</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.040" end="00:12:05.680" style="s2">think they&#39;ve trended toward becoming</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.560" end="00:12:07.600" style="s2">more peaceful but</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.680" end="00:12:09.519" style="s2">uh if you&#39;re a journalist or you&#39;re sort</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.600" end="00:12:10.639" style="s2">of a public policy analyst</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.519" end="00:12:12.560" style="s2">you might have something to say about</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.639" end="00:12:14.000" style="s2">the the corner of them that weren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.560" end="00:12:14.320" style="s2">peaceful and you might be able to want</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.000" end="00:12:16.160" style="s2">to</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.320" end="00:12:17.440" style="s2">you will likely want to be able to speak</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.160" end="00:12:18.880" style="s2">openly about the effects of that</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.440" end="00:12:20.399" style="s2">violence or how that violence has</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.880" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">affected businesses that gotten burned</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.399" end="00:12:23.120" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:24.160" style="s2">just really basic forms of journalism</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.120" end="00:12:26.639" style="s2">and activism and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.160" end="00:12:27.440" style="s2">policy analysis that people now feel</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.639" end="00:12:30.079" style="s2">afraid to do</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.440" end="00:12:32.079" style="s2">so it&#39;s just a sort of some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.079" end="00:12:32.800" style="s2">spiral of silence thing going on maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.079" end="00:12:34.720" style="s2">and these aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.800" end="00:12:36.079" style="s2">people who are seeking to express like</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.720" end="00:12:38.240" style="s2">far-right views or anything they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.079" end="00:12:41.120" style="s2">seeking to express views that a month</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.240" end="00:12:43.440" style="s2">ago felt unremarkable</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.120" end="00:12:45.279" style="s2">yeah i think that spiral of silence</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.440" end="00:12:46.880" style="s2">piece is really interesting</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.279" end="00:12:48.480" style="s2">because i remember some of the coverage</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.880" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">of the new york times situation</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.480" end="00:12:53.680" style="s2">included people saying well on our on</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:56.399" style="s2">our slack channels no one&#39;s supporting</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.680" end="00:12:57.200" style="s2">uh or no one no one&#39;s speaking out</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.399" end="00:12:58.720" style="s2">against the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.200" end="00:13:01.120" style="s2">i think was the sacking of was it tom</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.720" end="00:13:01.600" style="s2">cotton or uh no cotton was the senator</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.120" end="00:13:03.120" style="s2">james</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.600" end="00:13:04.639" style="s2">so james bennett was sacked but what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.120" end="00:13:06.880" style="s2">amazing about that is these slack</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.639" end="00:13:08.079" style="s2">channels where they&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.880" end="00:13:10.480" style="s2">no one&#39;s speaking up in the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.079" end="00:13:12.480" style="s2">direction are in real time getting</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.480" end="00:13:14.639" style="s2">leaked by liberal twitter users</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.480" end="00:13:16.320" style="s2">and inevitably there&#39;s always an article</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.639" end="00:13:18.079" style="s2">later on this time by vice</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.320" end="00:13:20.399" style="s2">in another case by huffington post</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.079" end="00:13:21.680" style="s2">leaking the entire contents of these so</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.399" end="00:13:22.560" style="s2">of course you&#39;re not going to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.680" end="00:13:25.200" style="s2">because then you&#39;ll be the one</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.560" end="00:13:26.880" style="s2">dissenting voice in the the inevitable</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.200" end="00:13:28.320" style="s2">huffpo or buzzfeed art it&#39;s just very</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.880" end="00:13:29.760" style="s2">bad faith to say that because people</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.320" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">aren&#39;t speaking up internally</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.760" end="00:13:33.360" style="s2">i&#39;ve i&#39;ve talked to multiple time</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:34.720" style="s2">staffers who are concerned about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.360" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">going on and they would not speak up</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.720" end="00:13:37.680" style="s2">because what&#39;s the incentive</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.000" end="00:13:44.959" style="s2">and do you have a sense of why</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.440" end="00:13:45.839" style="s2">journalism has</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.959" end="00:13:48.320" style="s2">do you think that it was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.839" end="00:13:49.839" style="s2">structural issues in journalism that</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.320" end="00:13:51.680" style="s2">have that have kind of got it to the</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.839" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">point where it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.680" end="00:13:55.279" style="s2">taken over by this kind of situation how</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:57.199" style="s2">how do you frame it</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.279" end="00:13:59.199" style="s2">it sort of feels a bit like a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.199" end="00:14:01.360" style="s2">mirror of the of the whole pandemic to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.199" end="00:14:02.959" style="s2">me like a week a week host being taken</p>

<p begin="00:14:08.560" end="00:14:10.800" style="s2">mean yeah we&#39;ve talked about this a</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.680" end="00:14:13.040" style="s2">little too but some people</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.800" end="00:14:14.320" style="s2">there&#39;s just like two simple catchphrase</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.040" end="00:14:15.279" style="s2">that particularly people on the right</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.320" end="00:14:18.480" style="s2">use like</p>

<p begin="00:14:18.480" end="00:14:21.839" style="s2">are these journalis these outlets are</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.079" end="00:14:23.279" style="s2">struggling because of their</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.839" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">political stances but i think katie and</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.279" end="00:14:26.160" style="s2">i both think the opposite is true is</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.240" style="s2">that the structural problems with</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.160" end="00:14:30.480" style="s2">journalism go so far beyond</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.240" end="00:14:32.000" style="s2">ideology there&#39;s just an entire business</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.480" end="00:14:32.639" style="s2">model has collapsed a business model</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.000" end="00:14:35.040" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.639" end="00:14:36.639" style="s2">30 years ago was such that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.040" end="00:14:39.040" style="s2">baltimore sun and the boston globe could</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.639" end="00:14:40.320" style="s2">have farm bureaus which is unthinkable</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.040" end="00:14:42.480" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.320" end="00:14:44.160" style="s2">i think as an institution collapses the</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.480" end="00:14:46.959" style="s2">culture inside is going to get very</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.160" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">weird and and in this case what you see</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.959" end="00:14:50.639" style="s2">basically is that whatever concerns</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">upper middle class graduates of elite</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.639" end="00:14:54.079" style="s2">universities is more and more</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:55.360" style="s2">what they care about uh and that is</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.079" end="00:14:57.600" style="s2">where wokeness resides</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.360" end="00:14:59.680" style="s2">so yeah i think i think obviously they</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.600" end="00:15:01.199" style="s2">feed back into one another because like</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.680" end="00:15:02.639" style="s2">maybe people will stop reading certain</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.199" end="00:15:04.160" style="s2">publications as they get less and less</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.639" end="00:15:05.600" style="s2">trustworthy but overall i&#39;m much more in</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.160" end="00:15:09.199" style="s2">the camp of um</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.600" end="00:15:11.199" style="s2">go broke awoke than vice versa</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.199" end="00:15:12.720" style="s2">yeah the structural stuff is a much</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.199" end="00:15:13.120" style="s2">bigger deal and it&#39;s all and this goes</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.720" end="00:15:15.600" style="s2">back</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.120" end="00:15:17.120" style="s2">decades this goes back to craigslist and</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.600" end="00:15:18.000" style="s2">then social media i mean the business</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.120" end="00:15:19.279" style="s2">models have</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.000" end="00:15:21.600" style="s2">totally collapsed i mean just for</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.279" end="00:15:22.800" style="s2">instance like the seattle times the big</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.600" end="00:15:26.079" style="s2">sort of daily paper</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.800" end="00:15:27.839" style="s2">here 20 years ago had 5 000 staffers</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.079" end="00:15:29.440" style="s2">today they have sold their buildings</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.839" end="00:15:30.240" style="s2">they exist on two floors in a tiny</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.440" end="00:15:32.720" style="s2">building it was</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.240" end="00:15:35.279" style="s2">apparently uh the the publisher was</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.720" end="00:15:36.720" style="s2">offered like 730 million dollars in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.279" end="00:15:38.720" style="s2">early early 2000s</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.720" end="00:15:40.079" style="s2">from you know gannett or some like major</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.720" end="00:15:40.800" style="s2">corporation to buy this paper and today</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.079" end="00:15:43.199" style="s2">it is almost</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.800" end="00:15:44.720" style="s2">worthless um so that i mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.199" end="00:15:46.320" style="s2">really the issue is that the industry is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.720" end="00:15:47.600" style="s2">failing and the response</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.320" end="00:15:49.519" style="s2">the response of that has been for</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.600" end="00:15:50.480" style="s2">everybody to sort of go kind of crazy in</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.519" end="00:15:52.160" style="s2">some ways um</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.480" end="00:15:53.600" style="s2">but it is not i think yeah the the</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.160" end="00:15:55.920" style="s2">structural issues really precede</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.600" end="00:15:57.440" style="s2">sort of the um the other things that are</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.920" end="00:15:58.240" style="s2">happening within methodist and i also</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.440" end="00:15:59.839" style="s2">think this is also</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.240" end="00:16:01.519" style="s2">part of a broader a broader trend in the</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.839" end="00:16:02.959" style="s2">culture a lot of which has to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.519" end="00:16:04.160" style="s2">sort of backlash against donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.959" end="00:16:08.320" style="s2">and a lot of fear about</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.160" end="00:16:09.519" style="s2">um you know him sort of ushering into uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.320" end="00:16:11.279" style="s2">people think that he&#39;s going to usher in</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.519" end="00:16:12.720" style="s2">you know a new danger of fascism or</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.279" end="00:16:14.560" style="s2">authoritarianism</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.720" end="00:16:16.240" style="s2">into into the into the nation and so</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.560" end="00:16:17.600" style="s2">there&#39;s been this sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.240" end="00:16:19.519" style="s2">ben smith from the new york times calls</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.600" end="00:16:20.720" style="s2">it resistance journalism and i do think</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.519" end="00:16:22.240" style="s2">there has been a trend over the past</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.720" end="00:16:22.800" style="s2">couple years for journalists to really</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.240" end="00:16:24.639" style="s2">sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.800" end="00:16:25.600" style="s2">themselves more or maybe they still see</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.639" end="00:16:27.360" style="s2">themselves as journalists but they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.600" end="00:16:28.880" style="s2">really turned into activists</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.360" end="00:16:30.560" style="s2">um and you know and everybody sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.880" end="00:16:32.800" style="s2">wants to be on the right side of history</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.560" end="00:16:35.600" style="s2">we&#39;re in such a weird moment in time</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.800" end="00:16:36.639" style="s2">that people are deeply concerned about</p>
<p begin="00:16:35.600" end="00:16:38.720" style="s2">the country</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.639" end="00:16:39.759" style="s2">understandably and they want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.720" end="00:16:41.279" style="s2">do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.759" end="00:16:43.360" style="s2">but do the right thing in this case</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.279" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">often means sort of shaking off these</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.360" end="00:16:46.639" style="s2">the values of journalism that have</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:47.920" style="s2">existed for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.639" end="00:16:50.560" style="s2">i want to talk a little bit more about</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.920" end="00:16:52.399" style="s2">that dynamic because it seems</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.560" end="00:16:53.600" style="s2">i&#39;m thinking about the intercept case as</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.399" end="00:16:55.440" style="s2">well where one</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.600" end="00:16:57.040" style="s2">member of staff basically criticized</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.440" end="00:16:58.639" style="s2">another and the and the other member of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.040" end="00:16:59.920" style="s2">staff ended up having to apologize that</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.639" end="00:17:01.279" style="s2">the lee fang</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.920" end="00:17:03.279" style="s2">was was the member of staff had to</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.279" end="00:17:06.240" style="s2">apologize but if you think about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.279" end="00:17:09.280" style="s2">imbalance of power now with social media</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.240" end="00:17:11.439" style="s2">any member of staff could criticize</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.280" end="00:17:12.319" style="s2">you publicly even if you&#39;re a senior</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.439" end="00:17:15.760" style="s2">journalist</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.319" end="00:17:18.400" style="s2">and and you you&#39;re now potentially so</p>
<p begin="00:17:15.760" end="00:17:19.039" style="s2">anything that can happen any any single</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.400" end="00:17:20.959" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.039" end="00:17:22.640" style="s2">editorial process that happens someone</p>
<p begin="00:17:20.959" end="00:17:24.880" style="s2">could leak at any point</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.640" end="00:17:25.839" style="s2">so what what does that do to journalism</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.880" end="00:17:27.360" style="s2">what does that what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.839" end="00:17:29.760" style="s2">what does that cultural fear look and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.360" end="00:17:32.320" style="s2">feel like</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.760" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">start a podcast luckily i would hate to</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.320" end="00:17:35.120" style="s2">be in journalism right now</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.440" end="00:17:42.400" style="s2">yeah totally i mean free from from these</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.799" end="00:17:43.840" style="s2">environments now because we started this</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.400" end="00:17:46.000" style="s2">podcast</p>
<p begin="00:17:43.840" end="00:17:47.520" style="s2">that that nobody has leaked or leaked</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.000" end="00:17:48.960" style="s2">our chats yet although if jesse pisses</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.520" end="00:17:50.559" style="s2">me off too much maybe i&#39;ll do it</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.960" end="00:17:52.000" style="s2">they&#39;re incredibly celebrating like you</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.559" end="00:17:54.960" style="s2">said it&#39;s a culture of fear</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.000" end="00:17:55.760" style="s2">right um this this culture of fear and</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.960" end="00:17:58.080" style="s2">it does</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.760" end="00:17:59.280" style="s2">influence not just you know how people</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.080" end="00:18:01.600" style="s2">relate to each other within the</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.280" end="00:18:02.880" style="s2">workplace but also what gets covered</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.600" end="00:18:04.720" style="s2">and i think that&#39;s a problem as well you</p>
<p begin="00:18:02.880" end="00:18:07.120" style="s2">know i guess he mentioned this</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.720" end="00:18:09.720" style="s2">washington post piece yesterday about a</p>

<p begin="00:18:28.720" end="00:18:31.440" style="s2">what incentive would anybody have to</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.000" end="00:18:39.760" style="s2">and anybody who pushes back on that is</p>

<p begin="00:19:06.640" end="00:19:10.240" style="s2">particularly a vox story where</p>

<p begin="00:19:20.799" end="00:19:24.720" style="s2">more of them so i just</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.559" end="00:19:26.640" style="s2">it&#39;s the quality of the of of</p>

<p begin="00:19:26.640" end="00:19:30.000" style="s2">itself at the moment that also drives me</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.320" end="00:19:32.160" style="s2">crazy because i it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.000" end="00:19:34.320" style="s2">it just seems there&#39;s sort of no uh</p>

<p begin="00:19:34.320" end="00:19:38.240" style="s2">yeah i think that was a vox article that</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.160" end="00:19:40.000" style="s2">sort of framed itself as</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.240" end="00:19:41.679" style="s2">the explainer of all you need to know</p>

<p begin="00:19:41.679" end="00:19:45.600" style="s2">and i think i i remember you sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.280" end="00:19:48.640" style="s2">saying that it was a it was a really</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.600" end="00:19:50.080" style="s2">one-sided take yeah on</p>
<p begin="00:19:48.640" end="00:19:52.640" style="s2">on what was happening do you have a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.080" end="00:19:54.880" style="s2">sense of what matt iglesias was</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.640" end="00:19:57.520" style="s2">referring to when he said</p>
<p begin="00:19:54.880" end="00:19:58.640" style="s2">that he he needed to apologize for</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.520" end="00:20:00.000" style="s2">thinking it was just confined to</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.640" end="00:20:01.679" style="s2">university campuses he seemed to be</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.000" end="00:20:04.080" style="s2">referring to something happening inside</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.679" end="00:20:07.280" style="s2">box</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.080" end="00:20:08.640" style="s2">yeah um i think that&#39;s accurate i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.280" end="00:20:10.880" style="s2">there&#39;s stuff going on in box</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.640" end="00:20:13.039" style="s2">that sort of wouldn&#39;t want to see more</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.880" end="00:20:16.000" style="s2">than that</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.039" end="00:20:16.400" style="s2">there was another guy at fox um zac</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.000" end="00:20:18.000" style="s2">champ</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.400" end="00:20:20.159" style="s2">who what jesse do you remember what the</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.000" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">tweet was exactly no it was jeremiah</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.159" end="00:20:22.960" style="s2">lopez uh</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:25.520" style="s2">spelled german lopez who said something</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.960" end="00:20:27.679" style="s2">similar to ignacius that um</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.520" end="00:20:29.360" style="s2">basically i forget what he was</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.679" end="00:20:30.720" style="s2">responding with strongly implying that</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.360" end="00:20:34.480" style="s2">he agrees that there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.720" end="00:20:35.919" style="s2">going on there um but i think you could</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.480" end="00:20:37.919" style="s2">basically take what happened at the</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.919" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">times in a very public spectacular way</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.919" end="00:20:40.320" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.919" style="s2">imagine a thousand versions of that</p>
<p begin="00:20:40.320" end="00:20:44.880" style="s2">going on more quietly at</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.919" end="00:20:46.400" style="s2">any modern media outlet with a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.880" end="00:20:48.960" style="s2">sort of younger staffers</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.400" end="00:20:50.240" style="s2">and that would be accurate enough right</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.960" end="00:20:52.799" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.240" end="00:20:53.919" style="s2">and so vox bought new york magazine and</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.799" end="00:20:55.760" style="s2">new york magazine</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.919" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">is where andrew sullivan writes and</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.760" end="00:20:59.200" style="s2">andrew sullivan has</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.280" style="s2">uh apparently there&#39;s basically like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.200" end="00:21:02.960" style="s2">committee of like young staffers who now</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.280" end="00:21:03.679" style="s2">vet his columns and have the power to</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.960" end="00:21:05.919" style="s2">veto</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.679" end="00:21:07.440" style="s2">what andrew sullivan writes and i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.919" end="00:21:09.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s because vox took it over</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.440" end="00:21:10.480" style="s2">i i&#39;d heard rumors about this since uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.200" end="00:21:14.320" style="s2">well before box took a</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.480" end="00:21:17.840" style="s2">uh new york magazine um but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.320" end="00:21:20.640" style="s2">bizarre bizarre twist</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.840" end="00:21:22.640" style="s2">yeah and is it worth sort of unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.640" end="00:21:23.919" style="s2">what happened at the new york times</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.640" end="00:21:26.480" style="s2">just for people who maybe aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.919" end="00:21:28.240" style="s2">familiar with it</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.480" end="00:21:29.919" style="s2">yeah i mean so basically tom cotton</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.240" end="00:21:32.720" style="s2">wrote an op-ed saying that the troops</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.919" end="00:21:34.960" style="s2">should be called in to quell</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.720" end="00:21:36.720" style="s2">uh looters and rioters p it was people</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.960" end="00:21:38.080" style="s2">subsequently claimed he was saying</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.720" end="00:21:40.240" style="s2">the troops should be called in to just</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.080" end="00:21:41.679" style="s2">murder protesters that wasn&#39;t what he</p>
<p begin="00:21:40.240" end="00:21:43.120" style="s2">said he&#39;d also done some tweets that</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.679" end="00:21:44.480" style="s2">were like pretty far right and suggested</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.120" end="00:21:46.320" style="s2">maybe he was toning down his true</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.480" end="00:21:48.480" style="s2">beliefs in the column the point is</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.320" end="00:21:50.159" style="s2">the columns staked out a i would say</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.480" end="00:21:52.159" style="s2">right wing position but one that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.159" end="00:21:52.640" style="s2">a fair amount of u.s polio and support</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.159" end="00:21:54.159" style="s2">for</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.640" end="00:21:56.480" style="s2">it gets a little bit fuzzy with question</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.159" end="00:21:58.640" style="s2">wording also he&#39;s suggesting like</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.480" end="00:21:59.919" style="s2">the army gets sent in even in cities</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.640" end="00:22:00.559" style="s2">where the governor mayor doesn&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:21:59.919" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">them which is</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.559" end="00:22:05.520" style="s2">you know pretty extreme policy</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:07.120" style="s2">a bunch of time staffers tweeted in</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.520" end="00:22:09.679" style="s2">unison that this column</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.120" end="00:22:11.200" style="s2">put black times journalists in danger</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.679" end="00:22:14.080" style="s2">which is a very hard thing to</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:15.760" style="s2">to figure out what that means how tom</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.080" end="00:22:17.360" style="s2">cotton publishing this column in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.760" end="00:22:19.039" style="s2">times versus</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.360" end="00:22:20.720" style="s2">breitbart or medium how that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.039" end="00:22:23.039" style="s2">difference between journalists being</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.720" end="00:22:24.880" style="s2">safe and being in danger and i think</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.039" end="00:22:26.240" style="s2">my reaction to this i think katie&#39;s was</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.880" end="00:22:27.840" style="s2">was partly about</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.240" end="00:22:29.520" style="s2">the times bending over backward to</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.840" end="00:22:30.960" style="s2">pretend this had been some horrible</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.520" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">editorial breach rather than just a</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.960" end="00:22:32.720" style="s2">right-wing call when people freaked out</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.400" end="00:22:34.720" style="s2">at</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.720" end="00:22:36.240" style="s2">but also it&#39;s creepy watching a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.720" end="00:22:37.679" style="s2">of journalists</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.240" end="00:22:39.120" style="s2">you know responsible for bringing us the</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.679" end="00:22:40.720" style="s2">truth all tweeting the same thing in</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.120" end="00:22:43.440" style="s2">unison that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.720" end="00:22:44.960" style="s2">questionable at best so it was just i</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.440" end="00:22:46.720" style="s2">don&#39;t think the times acquitted itself</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.960" end="00:22:48.880" style="s2">well during that sorry katie</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.720" end="00:22:50.240" style="s2">i think the it&#39;s also for people</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.880" end="00:22:51.840" style="s2">especially in the uk who might not know</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.240" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">this um tom cotton is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.840" end="00:22:57.760" style="s2">is a sitting u.s senator um so he is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.400" style="s2">a man who actually does power have power</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.760" end="00:22:59.360" style="s2">in the world</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.400" end="00:23:01.520" style="s2">he does not have the power to</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.360" end="00:23:03.919" style="s2">unilaterally send troops into you know</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.520" end="00:23:06.640" style="s2">the the streets of the united states</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.919" end="00:23:07.200" style="s2">um but he is you know he is a a notable</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.640" end="00:23:09.520" style="s2">figure</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.200" end="00:23:10.400" style="s2">in this country um and as jesse</p>
<p begin="00:23:09.520" end="00:23:13.120" style="s2">mentioned so</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.400" end="00:23:13.919" style="s2">all of these time staffers replied in</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.120" end="00:23:17.039" style="s2">unison</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.919" end="00:23:18.799" style="s2">this piece uh in dangerous black times</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.039" end="00:23:19.600" style="s2">journalists or black time staffers or</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.799" end="00:23:21.200" style="s2">something like that</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.600" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">and in subsequent recording that was</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.200" end="00:23:26.320" style="s2">published actually in the new york times</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:27.919" style="s2">um the staffers said like the reason we</p>
<p begin="00:23:26.320" end="00:23:29.280" style="s2">went with the sort of we went with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.919" end="00:23:32.159" style="s2">harm angle</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.280" end="00:23:33.280" style="s2">for a reason because the you know you</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.159" end="00:23:35.039" style="s2">can&#39;t just say</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.280" end="00:23:36.480" style="s2">i don&#39;t like this right because then it</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.039" end="00:23:38.320" style="s2">becomes a free speech issue</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.480" end="00:23:39.919" style="s2">an intellectual freedom issue so they</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.320" end="00:23:42.880" style="s2">found this sort of one like little</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.919" end="00:23:44.320" style="s2">narrow narrow position that would allow</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.880" end="00:23:46.880" style="s2">them to take a sort of mor</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.320" end="00:23:48.080" style="s2">the moral high ground here while while</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.880" end="00:23:50.080" style="s2">trying not to appear</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.080" end="00:23:52.000" style="s2">as sensors which is exactly what they</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.080" end="00:23:54.159" style="s2">were doing</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.000" end="00:23:55.440" style="s2">yeah and i think it&#39;s worth also</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.159" end="00:23:56.720" style="s2">emphasizing there were two pieces that</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.440" end="00:23:57.360" style="s2">came out afterwards that i thought were</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.720" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.360" end="00:24:01.360" style="s2">interesting one as you mentioned jesse</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:03.039" style="s2">that the the polling suggests that</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.360" end="00:24:04.640" style="s2">actually what tom cotton was calling for</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.039" end="00:24:07.279" style="s2">is actually quite popular</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.640" end="00:24:08.400" style="s2">um in in the american public so if</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.279" end="00:24:09.679" style="s2">you&#39;re basically saying that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.400" end="00:24:12.000" style="s2">acceptable you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.679" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve seen up to like 47 of people saying</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.000" end="00:24:14.080" style="s2">that that was</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">that they might have been in favor of</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.080" end="00:24:17.360" style="s2">that yeah to be clear that was a</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:18.720" style="s2">slightly different question but i think</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.360" end="00:24:20.080" style="s2">what you&#39;re saying is accurate there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.720" end="00:24:22.480" style="s2">at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.080" end="00:24:23.760" style="s2">would be you would think 40 or 45</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.480" end="00:24:25.200" style="s2">support for what he&#39;s saying depending</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.760" end="00:24:26.400" style="s2">on how you phrase the question was not</p>
<p begin="00:24:25.200" end="00:24:27.840" style="s2">for better or worse it was not an</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.400" end="00:24:29.039" style="s2">outlier opinion the way some people made</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.840" end="00:24:31.360" style="s2">it out to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.039" end="00:24:33.520" style="s2">yeah and also the the point was made</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.360" end="00:24:34.480" style="s2">that that&#39;s why you publish things like</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.520" end="00:24:36.559" style="s2">that because</p>
<p begin="00:24:34.480" end="00:24:38.799" style="s2">actually in retrospect it turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.559" end="00:24:40.080" style="s2">have been premature it turned out to</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.799" end="00:24:42.320" style="s2">have been bad advice</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.080" end="00:24:43.760" style="s2">and if you stop those opinions being put</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.320" end="00:24:44.400" style="s2">out there you don&#39;t have a record of</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.760" end="00:24:47.440" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.400" end="00:24:49.440" style="s2">actually it&#39;s probably not um</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.440" end="00:24:51.120" style="s2">it looks certainly premature and maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.440" end="00:24:52.720" style="s2">ill-advised in retrospect what he was</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.120" end="00:24:53.840" style="s2">arguing for</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.720" end="00:24:55.919" style="s2">yeah i mean that is a good point he</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.840" end="00:24:58.400" style="s2">happened to be very wrong and and the</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.919" end="00:25:00.159" style="s2">the key takeaway here is going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.400" end="00:25:02.240" style="s2">times having made a fool of itself</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.159" end="00:25:03.600" style="s2">and sort of acted on acting on</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.240" end="00:25:05.279" style="s2">journalistically rather than what the</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.600" end="00:25:08.080" style="s2">story should be which is tom cotton was</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.279" end="00:25:10.640" style="s2">a reactionary idiot here</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.080" end="00:25:11.279" style="s2">yeah and you you deprived the chance of</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.640" end="00:25:13.279" style="s2">of actually</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.279" end="00:25:14.880" style="s2">that being exposed in the marketplace of</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.279" end="00:25:16.640" style="s2">of ideas by</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.880" end="00:25:18.000" style="s2">uh preventing him from making the</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.640" end="00:25:21.279" style="s2">argument in the first place</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.000" end="00:25:23.039" style="s2">i&#39;m interested right and what</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.279" end="00:25:25.279" style="s2">well one more point about that so he</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.039" end="00:25:27.200" style="s2">like he could have published this on any</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.279" end="00:25:28.240" style="s2">right-wing site but he didn&#39;t and i</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.200" end="00:25:29.200" style="s2">think that&#39;s actually a good thing</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.240" end="00:25:31.360" style="s2">because</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.200" end="00:25:33.039" style="s2">we live in these very narrow media</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.360" end="00:25:34.400" style="s2">bubbles and echo chambers so if he had</p>
<p begin="00:25:33.039" end="00:25:35.520" style="s2">published this on breitbart or the</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.400" end="00:25:37.200" style="s2">federalist or the washington</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.520" end="00:25:38.880" style="s2">examiner or whatever it wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.200" end="00:25:41.360" style="s2">made a storm people wouldn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.880" end="00:25:42.000" style="s2">even like people on the on the left this</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.360" end="00:25:43.600" style="s2">would have</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.000" end="00:25:45.360" style="s2">made they would it wouldn&#39;t be it</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.600" end="00:25:47.440" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t have registered um</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.360" end="00:25:48.640" style="s2">and now people know and the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:25:47.440" end="00:25:50.799" style="s2">like the times is like</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.640" end="00:25:52.720" style="s2">sort of forcing it&#39;s mostly liberal</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.799" end="00:25:55.120" style="s2">readership to contend with</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.720" end="00:25:57.520" style="s2">these ideas i think is a good thing um</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.120" end="00:25:59.840" style="s2">but time staffers obviously disagree</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.520" end="00:26:00.880" style="s2">yeah yeah and i wanted to pick up you</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.840" end="00:26:02.799" style="s2">mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:26:00.880" end="00:26:04.480" style="s2">that they chose a particular angle for</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.799" end="00:26:06.159" style="s2">it katie like the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.480" end="00:26:08.640" style="s2">and i think barry wise framed it as</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.159" end="00:26:10.000" style="s2">safetyism so going back to jonathan</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.640" end="00:26:11.279" style="s2">heights work with the coddling of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.000" end="00:26:13.039" style="s2">american mind</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.279" end="00:26:15.760" style="s2">and the idea that there is a culture of</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.039" end="00:26:17.360" style="s2">safetyism i know that you i heard your</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.760" end="00:26:18.880" style="s2">in your podcast jesse you kind of</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.360" end="00:26:19.760" style="s2">disagreed with barry a little bit on</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.880" end="00:26:21.679" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.760" end="00:26:23.360" style="s2">but but you seem to be saying that you</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.679" end="00:26:25.200" style="s2">thought it was safetyism katie is that</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.360" end="00:26:28.320" style="s2">right</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.200" end="00:26:29.520" style="s2">i think i think safety is excuse me i</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.320" end="00:26:30.880" style="s2">think safetyism is an</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.520" end="00:26:33.120" style="s2">angle i think they were trying to turn</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.880" end="00:26:36.159" style="s2">it into a labor issue um</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.120" end="00:26:37.120" style="s2">just to to appear as though as though it</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.159" end="00:26:39.039" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.120" end="00:26:40.640" style="s2">not about censorship i think it was sort</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.039" end="00:26:41.440" style="s2">of a convenient angle that they took i</p>
<p begin="00:26:40.640" end="00:26:44.080" style="s2">do think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.440" end="00:26:45.360" style="s2">safetyism is very widespread um</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.080" end="00:26:47.600" style="s2">especially in sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.360" end="00:26:49.440" style="s2">elite institutions people it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.600" end="00:26:51.200" style="s2">uh the quintessential safety</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.440" end="00:26:52.559" style="s2">environment as a college and all of</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.200" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">these people sort of that come from</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.559" end="00:26:55.600" style="s2">academia</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:56.799" style="s2">or at least are college-educated but i</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.600" end="00:27:00.000" style="s2">think it was an excuse</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.799" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">um you know and and one that that seemed</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.000" end="00:27:03.440" style="s2">legitimate to an awful lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.320" end="00:27:07.600" style="s2">why did you disagree with that as a as</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.159" end="00:27:08.960" style="s2">an explanation jesse</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.600" end="00:27:11.600" style="s2">i don&#39;t think we disagree that much i</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.960" end="00:27:13.679" style="s2">think saying that the column could</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.600" end="00:27:14.799" style="s2">harm black journalists isn&#39;t is an</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.679" end="00:27:16.480" style="s2">instant</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.799" end="00:27:19.120" style="s2">i can&#39;t talk is a manifestation of</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.480" end="00:27:20.000" style="s2">safetyism i thought in terms of framing</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.120" end="00:27:21.520" style="s2">what the opposing</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.000" end="00:27:24.320" style="s2">sides are i don&#39;t think it&#39;s true that</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.520" end="00:27:26.240" style="s2">one side is like safetyism the other is</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.320" end="00:27:27.760" style="s2">not like for example i think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.240" end="00:27:29.440" style="s2">conservatives have have really bad</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.760" end="00:27:30.480" style="s2">issues of safetyism with their own when</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.440" end="00:27:32.240" style="s2">they say</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.480" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">you know flag burning does some real</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.240" end="00:27:35.279" style="s2">harm to america or colin kaepernick</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:37.039" style="s2">taking a knee</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.279" end="00:27:38.880" style="s2">i they have all sorts of stuff they</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.039" end="00:27:41.760" style="s2">freak out at so i just i think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.880" end="00:27:43.440" style="s2">natural human inclination and i think</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.760" end="00:27:44.880" style="s2">as we laid out on the podcast you can</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.440" end="00:27:47.200" style="s2">get a little bit more specific in</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.880" end="00:27:48.960" style="s2">journalistic context of the norms that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.200" end="00:27:50.880" style="s2">are are being fought over here and and</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.960" end="00:27:52.960" style="s2">that includes norms like</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.880" end="00:27:55.360" style="s2">you know uh how far to the right an</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.960" end="00:27:58.159" style="s2">opinion are we willing to publish or or</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.360" end="00:27:59.919" style="s2">should we judge stuff from the</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.159" end="00:28:01.760" style="s2">ideological outgroup at</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.919" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">a higher more stringent standard for</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.760" end="00:28:04.799" style="s2">quality stuff like that</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.760" end="00:28:09.120" style="s2">i&#39;d love to um go a little bit back over</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.720" end="00:28:10.559" style="s2">your</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.120" end="00:28:12.320" style="s2">your personal history because you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.559" end="00:28:14.480" style="s2">both had kind of</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.320" end="00:28:15.919" style="s2">relatively high profile run-ins with</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.480" end="00:28:18.720" style="s2">you&#39;ve both written about</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.919" end="00:28:20.559" style="s2">trans and then had quite high profile</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.720" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">run-ins or at least caused controversy</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.559" end="00:28:23.679" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:24.880" style="s2">with trans activists i&#39;d love if you</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.679" end="00:28:26.720" style="s2">could just summarize that</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.880" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">that backstory and we can kind of ask a</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.720" end="00:28:31.840" style="s2">little bit about that</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:33.919" style="s2">yeah sure um so in 2017</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.840" end="00:28:35.360" style="s2">i was a freelancer um and i wrote a</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.919" end="00:28:37.919" style="s2">piece for the stranger called the d</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.360" end="00:28:39.440" style="s2">transitioners and it was what it sounds</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.919" end="00:28:40.480" style="s2">like it was a piece about people who</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.440" end="00:28:42.640" style="s2">transitioned from</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.480" end="00:28:44.000" style="s2">one sex or gender to the other and then</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.640" end="00:28:47.200" style="s2">and then change their mind</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.000" end="00:28:47.760" style="s2">and and transition back um and this was</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.200" end="00:28:49.360" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.760" end="00:28:50.880" style="s2">it was deeply reported it wasn&#39;t an</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.360" end="00:28:53.840" style="s2">opinion piece i</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.880" end="00:28:54.480" style="s2">i took every sort of um precaution in</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.840" end="00:28:56.559" style="s2">terms of</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.480" end="00:28:57.679" style="s2">getting happily trans voices in there</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.559" end="00:28:59.919" style="s2">it&#39;s talking about how</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.679" end="00:29:01.840" style="s2">transition you know does seem to</p>
<p begin="00:28:59.919" end="00:29:02.720" style="s2">alleviate gender dysphoria for an awful</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.840" end="00:29:04.720" style="s2">lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.720" end="00:29:06.080" style="s2">um i had trans sensitivity readers but</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.720" end="00:29:07.279" style="s2">there was still this sort of massive</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.080" end="00:29:08.559" style="s2">firestorm and i don&#39;t know how many</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.279" end="00:29:10.559" style="s2">people who hated the piece actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.559" end="00:29:12.159" style="s2">read the piece um and that&#39;s this is</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.559" end="00:29:12.640" style="s2">actually how i met jesse for the first</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.159" end="00:29:15.120" style="s2">time i</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.640" end="00:29:16.480" style="s2">er through email like i when i was</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.120" end="00:29:17.360" style="s2">working on the piece i got in touch with</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.480" end="00:29:19.840" style="s2">jesse to</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.360" end="00:29:21.200" style="s2">to try to interview him um for a second</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.840" end="00:29:22.000" style="s2">that ultimately didn&#39;t didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.200" end="00:29:23.840" style="s2">published</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.000" end="00:29:25.520" style="s2">um and there was just this like people</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.840" end="00:29:26.159" style="s2">were actually burning stacks of the</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.520" end="00:29:27.919" style="s2">paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.159" end="00:29:30.320" style="s2">there were flyers up in coffee shops in</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.919" end="00:29:32.720" style="s2">my neighborhood calling me transphobic</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.320" end="00:29:33.360" style="s2">and that really changed the course of my</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.720" end="00:29:34.799" style="s2">career</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.360" end="00:29:36.640" style="s2">for the better to be honest i mean</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.799" end="00:29:39.600" style="s2">there&#39;s some irony here is that the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.640" end="00:29:40.399" style="s2">the freak out that everybody had about</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.600" end="00:29:42.159" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.399" end="00:29:43.679" style="s2">really elevated my profile it got me a</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.159" end="00:29:45.360" style="s2">lot more opportunities i ultimately was</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.679" end="00:29:46.559" style="s2">offered a staff shop at the paper</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.360" end="00:29:48.000" style="s2">and i don&#39;t think any of that would have</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.559" end="00:29:49.360" style="s2">happened if people had just sort of read</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.000" end="00:29:51.760" style="s2">the piece and said like i disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.360" end="00:29:54.000" style="s2">it but no big deal you know um</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.760" end="00:29:55.440" style="s2">and that that happens it happens sort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.000" end="00:29:57.520" style="s2">sort of frequently</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.440" end="00:29:58.559" style="s2">um you know it&#39;s emotionally difficult</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.520" end="00:30:00.240" style="s2">to go through this experience but</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.559" end="00:30:02.000" style="s2">ultimately it was it was</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.240" end="00:30:03.600" style="s2">you know probably the best the best move</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.000" end="00:30:05.360" style="s2">in my career um</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.600" end="00:30:06.720" style="s2">but it&#39;s still i have gotten since that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.360" end="00:30:08.000" style="s2">piece was published and i would say</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.720" end="00:30:10.960" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing transphobic about</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.000" end="00:30:12.240" style="s2">it that is my reputation if you ask like</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.960" end="00:30:13.919" style="s2">a random person who</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.240" end="00:30:15.279" style="s2">reads the stranger on the streets of</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.919" end="00:30:17.120" style="s2">seattle who katie</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.279" end="00:30:18.799" style="s2">herzog is they would probably say she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.120" end="00:30:20.799" style="s2">the transphobe which is</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.799" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">patently false um but that&#39;s just sort</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.799" end="00:30:25.200" style="s2">of what happens you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:27.039" style="s2">anybody who who has the temerity</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.200" end="00:30:29.360" style="s2">questions some aspects of</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.039" end="00:30:31.440" style="s2">of the the current trans dogma is</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.360" end="00:30:34.559" style="s2">automatically pegged as a bigot</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.440" end="00:30:36.159" style="s2">um and you know this happens</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.559" end="00:30:38.559" style="s2">not just with not just with journalists</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.159" end="00:30:39.120" style="s2">it&#39;s happened with academics with jk</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.559" end="00:30:41.360" style="s2">rowling</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.120" end="00:30:42.559" style="s2">recently of course um just a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.360" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">people have gone through sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.559" end="00:30:45.279" style="s2">similar experience</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.640" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">uh so my yeah mine was also about trans</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.000" end="00:30:53.760" style="s2">issues it was really a pair of articles</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:56.240" style="s2">in one of them i looked into the</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.760" end="00:30:57.760" style="s2">allegations against the doctor who ran a</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.240" end="00:30:59.200" style="s2">gender clinic in toronto</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.760" end="00:31:00.720" style="s2">he had been accused of conversion</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.200" end="00:31:02.000" style="s2">therapy and his clinic had been shut</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.720" end="00:31:04.480" style="s2">down and he had been fired</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.000" end="00:31:06.080" style="s2">a lot of kids had lost access to their</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.480" end="00:31:08.000" style="s2">care uh</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.080" end="00:31:09.279" style="s2">the accusations against him were almost</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.000" end="00:31:10.960" style="s2">entirely false</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.279" end="00:31:12.640" style="s2">one of them was completely wrong it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.960" end="00:31:13.600" style="s2">a misunderstanding on the part of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.640" end="00:31:15.120" style="s2">accuser who</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.600" end="00:31:16.720" style="s2">acknowledged that after i pointed out</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.120" end="00:31:20.159" style="s2">inconsistencies</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.720" end="00:31:21.440" style="s2">in his story um i was seen as defending</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.159" end="00:31:22.640" style="s2">the indefensible it was</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.440" end="00:31:24.480" style="s2">other journalists seem to think that</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.640" end="00:31:26.320" style="s2">because this guy had been accused of</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.480" end="00:31:27.760" style="s2">transphobia and we all know transphobia</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.320" end="00:31:29.519" style="s2">is wrong i should just take the activist</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.760" end="00:31:30.720" style="s2">views at face value instead i looked</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.519" end="00:31:32.240" style="s2">into them and i found they were false</p>
<p begin="00:31:30.720" end="00:31:34.640" style="s2">and i did what journalists do or</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.240" end="00:31:36.159" style="s2">used to do and printed a story that went</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.640" end="00:31:38.080" style="s2">against the common wisdom that i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:31:36.159" end="00:31:39.360" style="s2">proud of to this day</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.080" end="00:31:40.799" style="s2">then a couple summers ago today&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.360" end="00:31:42.240" style="s2">actually the two day anniversary of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.799" end="00:31:44.960" style="s2">facebook informed me</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.240" end="00:31:46.880" style="s2">uh happy anniversary jesse thank you i</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.960" end="00:31:49.200" style="s2">had a cover story in the atlantic about</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.880" end="00:31:49.919" style="s2">uh gender dysphoria among young people</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.200" end="00:31:52.000" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.919" end="00:31:54.320" style="s2">what the process should be look like for</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.000" end="00:31:56.000" style="s2">a 12 or 13 year old in particular</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.320" end="00:31:58.320" style="s2">and especially one with sort of complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.000" end="00:31:59.440" style="s2">other mental health problems</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.320" end="00:32:00.880" style="s2">you know what should the process look</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.440" end="00:32:02.559" style="s2">like before we put them on hormones</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.880" end="00:32:04.159" style="s2">before we consider surgery for older</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.559" end="00:32:06.799" style="s2">teenagers</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.159" end="00:32:08.320" style="s2">it&#39;s a 12 or 13 000 word story that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.799" end="00:32:09.360" style="s2">immensely proud of and i was the</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.320" end="00:32:12.000" style="s2">beneficiary of like</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.360" end="00:32:15.039" style="s2">expert fact checking and there&#39;s nothing</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.000" end="00:32:17.120" style="s2">transphobic about it but is viewed as</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.039" end="00:32:19.360" style="s2">basically like at least adjacent to a</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.120" end="00:32:21.120" style="s2">hate crime for even suggesting</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.360" end="00:32:22.640" style="s2">that some people regret transition which</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.120" end="00:32:24.720" style="s2">some people do or that some kids are</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.640" end="00:32:26.799" style="s2">rushed into transition which they are</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.720" end="00:32:28.320" style="s2">so yeah that um it&#39;s sort of the same</p>
<p begin="00:32:26.799" end="00:32:29.840" style="s2">deal as katie where</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.320" end="00:32:31.360" style="s2">our situation socially we&#39;re different</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.840" end="00:32:33.360" style="s2">because i have like very</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.360" end="00:32:35.120" style="s2">vanilla obama liberal friends and</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.360" end="00:32:36.399" style="s2">katie&#39;s from like a more radical queer</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.120" end="00:32:37.679" style="s2">community or once at the time so i</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.399" end="00:32:39.200" style="s2">didn&#39;t i didn&#39;t lose real friends over</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.679" end="00:32:41.360" style="s2">it but a subset of</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.200" end="00:32:42.720" style="s2">left of center journalists uh still view</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.360" end="00:32:45.519" style="s2">me as</p>
<p begin="00:32:42.720" end="00:32:46.880" style="s2">just a evil bigot and when i try to ask</p>
<p begin="00:32:45.519" end="00:32:48.960" style="s2">them to point to stuff i&#39;ve actually</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.880" end="00:32:50.399" style="s2">written to support that assessment</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.960" end="00:32:51.440" style="s2">they can&#39;t so it&#39;s just sort of a meme</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.399" end="00:32:52.640" style="s2">at this point and one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.440" end="00:32:53.840" style="s2">that&#39;s been very frustrating and</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.640" end="00:32:55.279" style="s2">enlightening</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.840" end="00:32:57.039" style="s2">is watching professional journalists</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.279" end="00:32:58.240" style="s2">sort of launch accusations without any</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.039" end="00:32:59.840" style="s2">evidence and without caring about the</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.240" end="00:33:02.080" style="s2">evidence so</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.840" end="00:33:03.440" style="s2">i think katie and i are extremely sad</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.080" end="00:33:05.039" style="s2">journalism is burning down for</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.440" end="00:33:06.399" style="s2">structural reasons but like</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.039" end="00:33:07.679" style="s2">you know it&#39;s gratifying to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.399" end="00:33:10.159" style="s2">build their own platform and not have to</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.679" end="00:33:12.640" style="s2">worry about those sorts of people at all</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.159" end="00:33:13.679" style="s2">yeah jessie&#39;s jesse&#39;s firestorm is much</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.640" end="00:33:15.600" style="s2">much bigger than i mean</p>
<p begin="00:33:13.679" end="00:33:17.360" style="s2">lena dunham calls you an asshole right i</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.600" end="00:33:19.120" style="s2">mean you are an asshole but</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.360" end="00:33:20.480" style="s2">she doesn&#39;t actually know you she called</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.120" end="00:33:23.200" style="s2">me that i think in the third person</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.480" end="00:33:25.200" style="s2">sense not to me but uh</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.200" end="00:33:26.480" style="s2">yeah it got pretty intense i think yours</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.200" end="00:33:27.600" style="s2">was worse in terms of sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.480" end="00:33:29.200" style="s2">interpersonal damage</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.600" end="00:33:30.799" style="s2">mine might have temporarily been higher</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.200" end="00:33:33.440" style="s2">profile but i&#39;m not sure</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.799" end="00:33:33.919" style="s2">right yeah because i mean you you both</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.440" end="00:33:36.960" style="s2">sort of</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.919" end="00:33:38.720" style="s2">um i think are saying that it was on the</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.960" end="00:33:39.840" style="s2">on the whole sort of a net positive for</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.720" end="00:33:41.440" style="s2">your careers but</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.840" end="00:33:43.440" style="s2">i&#39;m interested in how it was to go</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.440" end="00:33:45.200" style="s2">through that experience because i know</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.440" end="00:33:46.960" style="s2">there aren&#39;t that many people who have a</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.200" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">um what did jezebel</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.960" end="00:33:51.519" style="s2">jezebel wrote a story called what is</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.760" style="s2">what is jesse singles fucking deal</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.519" end="00:33:56.000" style="s2">yeah yeah exactly well and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.760" end="00:33:58.000" style="s2">investigative journalism</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.000" end="00:33:59.120" style="s2">so in that story the did they find out</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.000" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">though if they found out that</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.120" end="00:34:02.559" style="s2">they did it that&#39;s my biggest secret if</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:03.919" style="s2">it gets out what my fucking deal is my</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.559" end="00:34:06.960" style="s2">career is over um</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.919" end="00:34:08.639" style="s2">i&#39;m gonna end up writing that piece well</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.960" end="00:34:09.839" style="s2">that was a good example because</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.639" end="00:34:12.159" style="s2">katie do you remember the author&#39;s name</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.839" end="00:34:15.760" style="s2">off the herron walker herron walker</p>

<p begin="00:34:19.599" end="00:34:22.800" style="s2">your deal what&#39;s your deal no attempt to</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.879" end="00:34:24.159" style="s2">do an actual interview</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.800" end="00:34:26.800" style="s2">i&#39;m obviously not gonna respond to that</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.159" end="00:34:27.200" style="s2">then they run a piece that gets my views</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.800" end="00:34:28.879" style="s2">wrong</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.200" end="00:34:30.320" style="s2">that that absolutely misrepresents what</p>

<p begin="00:34:53.839" end="00:34:57.760" style="s2">for them to chime in on the right side</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.359" end="00:34:59.040" style="s2">of the controversy i found it insane</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.760" end="00:35:00.800" style="s2">that i had to deal with writing a letter</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.040" end="00:35:02.160" style="s2">to the editor to correct something in</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.800" end="00:35:03.599" style="s2">the new york times like</p>

<p begin="00:35:08.640" end="00:35:12.079" style="s2">it saps away your soul a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.560" end="00:35:14.240" style="s2">watch people just lie about you without</p>

<p begin="00:35:14.240" end="00:35:20.320" style="s2">and it also for me it was also sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.040" end="00:35:22.000" style="s2">destabilizing in the sense that i had</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.320" end="00:35:23.760" style="s2">previously lived in a world where i</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.000" end="00:35:25.920" style="s2">trusted the media</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.760" end="00:35:27.440" style="s2">you know where i trusted um people to</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.920" end="00:35:29.280" style="s2">interpret things to like read things</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.440" end="00:35:31.599" style="s2">before they interpret them and that i</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.280" end="00:35:34.960" style="s2">was i was just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.599" end="00:35:37.040" style="s2">shown um in a very visceral way that you</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.960" end="00:35:38.800" style="s2">basically can&#39;t trust you can&#39;t trust</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.040" end="00:35:39.839" style="s2">what you read oftentimes and that has</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.800" end="00:35:41.680" style="s2">that has been</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.839" end="00:35:43.040" style="s2">reinforced over the over the last few</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.680" end="00:35:44.720" style="s2">years and as jesse</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.040" end="00:35:46.160" style="s2">jesse mentioned i think it had a higher</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.720" end="00:35:48.960" style="s2">social cost for me because</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.160" end="00:35:50.079" style="s2">i&#39;m gay and most of the social networks</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.960" end="00:35:52.320" style="s2">that i existed in</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.079" end="00:35:54.320" style="s2">for my entire adulthood have been sort</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.320" end="00:35:56.400" style="s2">of radical queer circles</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.320" end="00:35:57.599" style="s2">um and i was basically shunned by my</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.400" end="00:36:00.400" style="s2">social networks</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.599" end="00:36:02.079" style="s2">and i still am i had i had there was on</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.400" end="00:36:02.960" style="s2">on one occasion i was walking up the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.079" end="00:36:05.520" style="s2">street um</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.960" end="00:36:07.119" style="s2">near my house and i saw saw an ex of</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.520" end="00:36:08.720" style="s2">mine who i had been on like very good</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.119" end="00:36:09.839" style="s2">terms with someone i had remained close</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.720" end="00:36:10.880" style="s2">with after we broke up</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.839" end="00:36:12.640" style="s2">we were walking on the same side of the</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.880" end="00:36:14.000" style="s2">street and she just i was passing her</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.640" end="00:36:16.160" style="s2">she just turned around</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.000" end="00:36:17.280" style="s2">you know it was like i wasn&#39;t there um</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.160" end="00:36:19.839" style="s2">in seattle is sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.280" end="00:36:20.320" style="s2">like notoriously pacific city so i</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.839" end="00:36:22.960" style="s2">wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.320" end="00:36:24.400" style="s2">super worried about people um at first i</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.960" end="00:36:26.320" style="s2">was sort of worried about being like</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.400" end="00:36:27.920" style="s2">accosted in the street um</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.320" end="00:36:29.599" style="s2">but what i realized is that people were</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.920" end="00:36:31.040" style="s2">more likely to like dive into the bushes</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.599" end="00:36:32.000" style="s2">when they saw me coming and then shit</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.040" end="00:36:34.800" style="s2">talk me online</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.000" end="00:36:36.880" style="s2">that&#39;s more of a more of a seattle uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.800" end="00:36:39.760" style="s2">go-to response to any sort of conflict</p>
<p begin="00:36:36.880" end="00:36:40.240" style="s2">but it was very um it was very isolating</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.760" end="00:36:42.640" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.240" end="00:36:44.480" style="s2">i felt totally friendless because i was</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.640" end="00:36:46.800" style="s2">all of a sudden totally friendless</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.480" end="00:36:48.079" style="s2">and it hasn&#39;t really rebounded i i think</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.800" end="00:36:50.240" style="s2">that i still am sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.079" end="00:36:52.320" style="s2">um i think a lot of my sort of former</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.240" end="00:36:54.079" style="s2">friends and and allies would consider me</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.320" end="00:36:55.599" style="s2">sort of a pariah or a thought criminal</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.079" end="00:36:57.680" style="s2">or they probably think i&#39;m like an</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.599" end="00:36:58.480" style="s2">all-right neo-nazi there there are still</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.680" end="00:37:00.800" style="s2">i mean</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.480" end="00:37:02.640" style="s2">there are stickers up in seattle there</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.800" end="00:37:04.480" style="s2">are like four different versions of</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.640" end="00:37:05.760" style="s2">stickers in seattle calling me some</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.480" end="00:37:07.760" style="s2">version of a bigot</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.760" end="00:37:08.800" style="s2">um just recently during the uh all of</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.760" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">this sort of protest</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.800" end="00:37:12.160" style="s2">so my office in seattle my former office</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:14.000" style="s2">is in</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.160" end="00:37:15.599" style="s2">chaz the capitol hill autonomous zone</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.000" end="00:37:17.119" style="s2">that has sort of made international news</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.599" end="00:37:19.520" style="s2">it&#39;s this area in seattle that has been</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.119" end="00:37:21.760" style="s2">taken over by protesters and um</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.520" end="00:37:23.040" style="s2">and uh so my office is right is right in</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.760" end="00:37:24.640" style="s2">that and on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.040" end="00:37:27.280" style="s2">one of the first days of the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.640" end="00:37:28.480" style="s2">protest down there the um</p>
<p begin="00:37:27.280" end="00:37:29.520" style="s2">i don&#39;t know maybe it was riots down</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.480" end="00:37:30.880" style="s2">there maybe it was protest i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.520" end="00:37:33.760" style="s2">how much looting was happening</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.880" end="00:37:35.520" style="s2">um someone graffitied fuck herzog on the</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.760" end="00:37:38.560" style="s2">door of my former office</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.520" end="00:37:40.480" style="s2">and this is all a response to</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.560" end="00:37:42.400" style="s2">you know this one piece and subsequently</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.480" end="00:37:43.920" style="s2">like once i got hired at the paper i</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.400" end="00:37:45.359" style="s2">continued to write things that</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.920" end="00:37:47.119" style="s2">um i didn&#39;t think were particularly</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.359" end="00:37:48.560" style="s2">inflammatory but a lot of people did</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.119" end="00:37:50.480" style="s2">just things like you know questioning</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.560" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">sort of the excesses of me too</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.480" end="00:37:53.920" style="s2">writing about concern for due process</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:56.720" style="s2">concern for you know the</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.920" end="00:37:58.880" style="s2">um diminishing values of free speech</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.720" end="00:38:01.760" style="s2">these liberal values that i think are</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.880" end="00:38:02.720" style="s2">incredibly important um and so my</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.760" end="00:38:05.359" style="s2">reputation</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.720" end="00:38:06.160" style="s2">within seattle is i think basically as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.359" end="00:38:09.119" style="s2">as a</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.160" end="00:38:09.440" style="s2">you know like a literal nazi um which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.119" end="00:38:11.280" style="s2">very</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.440" end="00:38:12.800" style="s2">a very strange sort of rebranding it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.280" end="00:38:13.520" style="s2">not what i ever would have expected you</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.800" end="00:38:16.240" style="s2">know like</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.520" end="00:38:18.480" style="s2">even five or five or six years ago um so</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.240" end="00:38:20.320" style="s2">it&#39;s been weird and how would you</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.480" end="00:38:23.520" style="s2">describe your political views</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.320" end="00:38:24.079" style="s2">maybe to both of you i i&#39;m just sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.520" end="00:38:26.000" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.079" end="00:38:27.520" style="s2">like a milktoast liberal i mean probably</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.000" end="00:38:31.119" style="s2">farther to the left than</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.520" end="00:38:32.880" style="s2">most americans um my values have changed</p>
<p begin="00:38:31.119" end="00:38:34.320" style="s2">a little bit i think i am since all this</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.880" end="00:38:36.400" style="s2">sort of happened one of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.320" end="00:38:38.400" style="s2">sort of more interesting but also</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.400" end="00:38:42.160" style="s2">destabilizing and disorienting</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.400" end="00:38:44.000" style="s2">parts of this experience was that</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.160" end="00:38:45.839" style="s2">before i wrote this piece and before the</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.000" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">response to this piece i had sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.839" end="00:38:49.599" style="s2">blanket assumption that everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:51.440" style="s2">on the left was correct and everything</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.599" end="00:38:53.760" style="s2">on the right was wrong</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.440" end="00:38:56.079" style="s2">and the response to my piece sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.760" end="00:38:58.240" style="s2">opened my eyes to the fact that my side</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.079" end="00:38:59.680" style="s2">my ideological allies my tribe</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.240" end="00:39:01.280" style="s2">could be wrong because i knew they were</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.680" end="00:39:04.000" style="s2">wrong about this piece</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.280" end="00:39:05.599" style="s2">um and and once you see that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.000" end="00:39:06.880" style="s2">sort of no going back</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.599" end="00:39:08.880" style="s2">and that doesn&#39;t mean that i&#39;ve become a</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.880" end="00:39:10.400" style="s2">republican i haven&#39;t for sure</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.880" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">i think i have drifted towards more sort</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.400" end="00:39:13.680" style="s2">of civil libertarian values not so much</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">in a financial</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.680" end="00:39:17.760" style="s2">sense but um as the culture has changed</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:19.280" style="s2">over the past couple years i have become</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.760" end="00:39:21.359" style="s2">much more concerned about civil</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.280" end="00:39:23.599" style="s2">liberties as the left has</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.359" end="00:39:24.800" style="s2">in many cases sort of you know even the</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.599" end="00:39:26.720" style="s2">aclu has sort of</p>

<p begin="00:39:26.720" end="00:39:30.400" style="s2">and free expression um</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.800" end="00:39:32.480" style="s2">and so i think my politics have changed</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.400" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">a little bit but in terms of how i vote</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.480" end="00:39:36.160" style="s2">i&#39;m just sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:36.880" style="s2">basic like milk dose democrat um you</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.160" end="00:39:40.000" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.880" end="00:39:41.440" style="s2">in 2016 i supported bernie sanders i</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.000" end="00:39:43.040" style="s2">voted for hillary clinton this time</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.440" end="00:39:45.359" style="s2">around i will vote for whoever</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.040" end="00:39:46.880" style="s2">you know it will be joe biden presumably</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.359" end="00:39:48.160" style="s2">but i will vote for whoever is running</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.880" end="00:39:49.760" style="s2">against donald trump</p>
<p begin="00:39:48.160" end="00:39:51.200" style="s2">so pretty just sort of standard</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.760" end="00:39:53.520" style="s2">normative politics</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.200" end="00:39:55.200" style="s2">um that were you know if i looked at</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.520" end="00:39:56.880" style="s2">polling i&#39;m probably further</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.200" end="00:39:58.560" style="s2">you know further to the left than than</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.880" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">the vast majority of americans but i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.560" end="00:40:03.040" style="s2">not like uh</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:05.440" style="s2">you know i&#39;m not a rose emoji marxist or</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.040" end="00:40:08.000" style="s2">anything like that</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.440" end="00:40:09.119" style="s2">yeah i mean i think i&#39;m somewhat similar</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.000" end="00:40:10.720" style="s2">i guess like if it was we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.119" end="00:40:12.240" style="s2">about the</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.720" end="00:40:13.599" style="s2">other redistributive questions we</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.240" end="00:40:14.560" style="s2">basically no one ever talks about</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.599" end="00:40:16.480" style="s2">because we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:40:14.560" end="00:40:17.760" style="s2">it&#39;s always who dressed in blackface at</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.480" end="00:40:19.119" style="s2">the halloween party in terms of who</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.760" end="00:40:20.720" style="s2">whose tax money goes where</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.119" end="00:40:22.480" style="s2">or at least i&#39;m oversimplifying but not</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.720" end="00:40:24.079" style="s2">by much these days um</p>
<p begin="00:40:22.480" end="00:40:25.920" style="s2">i think i&#39;m pretty far to the left i</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.079" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">mean i uh i was torn between bernie</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.920" end="00:40:29.680" style="s2">sanders and liz warren</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:31.040" style="s2">again if you actually laid us out on</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.680" end="00:40:32.160" style="s2">sort of some spectrum of american</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.040" end="00:40:34.079" style="s2">opinion we would</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.160" end="00:40:35.119" style="s2">both be pretty far to the left and i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.079" end="00:40:36.560" style="s2">you know i don&#39;t know really what to</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.119" end="00:40:38.000" style="s2">call myself other than a liberal or</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.560" end="00:40:41.359" style="s2">leftist or progressive i</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.000" end="00:40:43.760" style="s2">i i wish that on cultural stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.359" end="00:40:45.440" style="s2">cancel culture stuff</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.760" end="00:40:47.200" style="s2">what katie&#39;s describing sort of cultural</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.440" end="00:40:49.040" style="s2">libertarianism i think should be a part</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.200" end="00:40:50.560" style="s2">of progressivism or a part of the left</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.040" end="00:40:51.920" style="s2">in part because</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.560" end="00:40:54.000" style="s2">if we&#39;re on the left we should care</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.920" end="00:40:57.040" style="s2">about people who have less power</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.000" end="00:40:59.200" style="s2">and any punitive system of dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.040" end="00:41:00.319" style="s2">crime with infractions at work with</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.200" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">microaggressions</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.319" end="00:41:03.680" style="s2">is going to come down harder on more</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:05.119" style="s2">vulnerable people like again</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.680" end="00:41:06.880" style="s2">dave chappelle is not the victim of</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:08.480" style="s2">cancer culture he could do 15 deeply</p>
<p begin="00:41:06.880" end="00:41:10.319" style="s2">offensive segments and still have</p>

<p begin="00:41:10.319" end="00:41:14.319" style="s2">it i resent the fact you know no hate</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.880" end="00:41:15.680" style="s2">for libertarians but i&#39;m not a</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.319" end="00:41:17.040" style="s2">libertarian and i don&#39;t think i should</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.680" end="00:41:19.680" style="s2">have to adopt the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.040" end="00:41:20.880" style="s2">cultural libertarian label just to make</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.680" end="00:41:23.200" style="s2">arguments like</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.880" end="00:41:25.040" style="s2">some hapless woman shouldn&#39;t lose her</p>
<p begin="00:41:23.200" end="00:41:27.200" style="s2">job over a bad halloween costume a year</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.040" end="00:41:29.280" style="s2">and a half ago and i think the left</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.200" end="00:41:30.640" style="s2">harms itself greatly by leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.280" end="00:41:32.400" style="s2">territory for the</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.640" end="00:41:33.839" style="s2">right to claim sometimes in a bad faith</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.400" end="00:41:35.440" style="s2">way because the right has its own</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.839" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">canceled culture but</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.440" end="00:41:39.680" style="s2">why would we see just like these aspects</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:41.359" style="s2">of basic human dignity and and the</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.680" end="00:41:42.240" style="s2">chance for redemption all the stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.359" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.240" end="00:41:45.839" style="s2">gives humanity potential i think that</p>
<p begin="00:41:43.839" end="00:41:48.560" style="s2">frustrates me</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.839" end="00:41:50.480" style="s2">yeah i would i&#39;d like to add one thing i</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.560" end="00:41:52.160" style="s2">think in an ideal world these labels</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.480" end="00:41:53.599" style="s2">we would get rid of the labels all</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.160" end="00:41:54.560" style="s2">together and i know that&#39;s never going</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.599" end="00:41:57.599" style="s2">to happen</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.560" end="00:42:00.720" style="s2">but i&#39;ve sort of drifted away from</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.599" end="00:42:02.400" style="s2">sort of wrapping my identity up with my</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.720" end="00:42:03.280" style="s2">political affiliations or my political</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.400" end="00:42:05.359" style="s2">positions so</p>
<p begin="00:42:03.280" end="00:42:06.640" style="s2">for for one thing i i no longer would</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.359" end="00:42:07.440" style="s2">call myself a feminist or an</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.640" end="00:42:09.440" style="s2">environmentalist or</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.440" end="00:42:10.800" style="s2">these labels that that had some more</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.440" end="00:42:12.960" style="s2">meaning to me a few years ago</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.800" end="00:42:15.040" style="s2">because i&#39;ve found that when your</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.960" end="00:42:17.200" style="s2">identity is wrapped up in a movement or</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.040" end="00:42:18.160" style="s2">a label like this it becomes harder to</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.200" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">evaluate</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.160" end="00:42:21.520" style="s2">the position based on their merits and</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:22.240" style="s2">not sort of your own sort of emotional</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.520" end="00:42:24.480" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.240" end="00:42:26.400" style="s2">um you know to the label itself you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.480" end="00:42:28.880" style="s2">liberals good conservatives bad or</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.400" end="00:42:30.960" style="s2">vice versa or whatever it is so i think</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.880" end="00:42:34.319" style="s2">in an ideal world</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.960" end="00:42:36.800" style="s2">you know we would look at every issue</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.319" end="00:42:38.319" style="s2">for its merits and not uh based on who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.800" end="00:42:39.119" style="s2">making the argument but we don&#39;t live in</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.319" end="00:42:41.200" style="s2">that world</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.119" end="00:42:42.560" style="s2">um so i&#39;m gonna consider i&#39;m gonna keep</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.200" end="00:42:44.880" style="s2">calling myself a liberal because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.560" end="00:42:47.599" style="s2">how i vote and those are sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.880" end="00:42:49.040" style="s2">policies i typically agree with um but i</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.599" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">wish that i wish that we didn&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.040" end="00:42:51.359" style="s2">i wish that</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:53.680" style="s2">that sort of we could do away with these</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.359" end="00:42:55.040" style="s2">designations and um and just look at</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.680" end="00:42:57.440" style="s2">issues without this sort of added</p>
<p begin="00:42:55.040" end="00:43:00.079" style="s2">baggage of these labels</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.440" end="00:43:01.839" style="s2">yeah i think i&#39;d agree i mean i i was</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.079" end="00:43:04.079" style="s2">brought up in a very left-wing family</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.839" end="00:43:06.880" style="s2">i&#39;ve always kind of considered myself</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.079" end="00:43:07.839" style="s2">um we don&#39;t quite use liberal in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.880" end="00:43:10.079" style="s2">same way as you</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.839" end="00:43:12.000" style="s2">use it there as a political affiliation</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.079" end="00:43:14.880" style="s2">but i&#39;m certainly a disaffected</p>
<p begin="00:43:12.000" end="00:43:16.480" style="s2">uh left winger but i&#39;m also and i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.880" end="00:43:17.920" style="s2">i heard you refer to this jesse in one</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.480" end="00:43:19.760" style="s2">of the recent podcasts</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.920" end="00:43:21.280" style="s2">wary of how that kind of can be</p>
<p begin="00:43:19.760" end="00:43:22.960" style="s2">weaponized as well</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.280" end="00:43:24.960" style="s2">like the dave rubin i&#39;ve been quite</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.960" end="00:43:27.280" style="s2">critical in the past of dave rubin</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.960" end="00:43:28.160" style="s2">for that just the sort of singular focus</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.280" end="00:43:30.480" style="s2">on the left</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.160" end="00:43:32.160" style="s2">yeah and the faults of the left like</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.480" end="00:43:32.720" style="s2">even that kind of disaffected liberal</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.160" end="00:43:35.200" style="s2">kind of</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.720" end="00:43:36.800" style="s2">identity can be sort of part of the</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.200" end="00:43:38.640" style="s2">weaponized as part of a culture war</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.800" end="00:43:40.960" style="s2">which i&#39;m very wary of</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.640" end="00:43:42.319" style="s2">yeah i mean you see people katie and i</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.960" end="00:43:43.119" style="s2">have talked about this like people who</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.319" end="00:43:44.880" style="s2">are like well</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.119" end="00:43:46.480" style="s2">political correctness has gone so far</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.880" end="00:43:49.280" style="s2">i&#39;m just going to vote for trump i can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.480" end="00:43:51.520" style="s2">stand this anymore which to me is a</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.280" end="00:43:53.359" style="s2">severe misunderstanding of power or an</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.520" end="00:43:54.160" style="s2">inability to put things in perspective</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.359" end="00:43:56.400" style="s2">because like</p>
<p begin="00:43:54.160" end="00:43:57.760" style="s2">on the whole if i have to live with a</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.400" end="00:44:00.000" style="s2">world with</p>
<p begin="00:43:57.760" end="00:44:01.920" style="s2">more cancer culture but biden rather</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.000" end="00:44:03.040" style="s2">than trump is choosing supreme court</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.920" end="00:44:05.119" style="s2">nominees and who to stock the</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.040" end="00:44:06.319" style="s2">environmental protection agency with</p>
<p begin="00:44:05.119" end="00:44:07.839" style="s2">you know i would choose that world it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.319" end="00:44:10.079" style="s2">just i think if you&#39;re in journalism or</p>
<p begin="00:44:07.839" end="00:44:11.760" style="s2">academia you you need to be vigilant</p>
<p begin="00:44:10.079" end="00:44:12.560" style="s2">because stuff is getting really bad and</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.760" end="00:44:14.000" style="s2">you need to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.560" end="00:44:15.520" style="s2">fight two battles at once but i think</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.000" end="00:44:17.040" style="s2">there is this sort of cottage industry</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.520" end="00:44:19.920" style="s2">of like</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.040" end="00:44:21.200" style="s2">um people who posit themselves as</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.920" end="00:44:22.640" style="s2">disillusioned liberals but if you</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.200" end="00:44:23.119" style="s2">actually watch what they say and write</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.640" end="00:44:24.880" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.119" end="00:44:27.280" style="s2">the furthest their liberalism goes is</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.880" end="00:44:29.119" style="s2">saying they&#39;re well ruben&#39;s case is gay</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.280" end="00:44:31.760" style="s2">or like in favor of gay marriage which</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.119" end="00:44:35.119" style="s2">like in 2020 is like</p>

<p begin="00:44:35.119" end="00:44:38.079" style="s2">yeah i&#39;m wary of that and i</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.240" end="00:44:40.160" style="s2">i do think that i what i hope our</p>

<p begin="00:44:40.160" end="00:44:44.880" style="s2">the the sort of discourse landscape</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:46.640" style="s2">mainstream circles is so bare and i hope</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.880" end="00:44:48.000" style="s2">that we can sort of be like a net to</p>
<p begin="00:44:46.640" end="00:44:48.960" style="s2">prevent people from falling through</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.000" end="00:44:51.920" style="s2">towards sort of more</p>
<p begin="00:44:48.960" end="00:44:52.960" style="s2">reactionary stuff because we again the</p>

<p begin="00:44:52.960" end="00:44:56.319" style="s2">politics is is we sometimes have boring</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.880" end="00:44:59.440" style="s2">liberal tendencies but we have</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.319" end="00:45:00.800" style="s2">uh i think donald trump&#39;s election was a</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.440" end="00:45:01.599" style="s2">fucking disaster for i don&#39;t know if we</p>

<p begin="00:45:39.280" end="00:45:42.720" style="s2">in a in a time where a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.880" end="00:45:45.440" style="s2">journalists feel that they can&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:45:49.119" end="00:45:51.920" style="s2">of the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.119" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">um i think the future for the podcast</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.240" end="00:46:00.400" style="s2">is is bright as long as jesse and i</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.240" style="s2">managed not to kill each other um</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.400" end="00:46:03.599" style="s2">it&#39;s been just uh it&#39;s been really</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.240" end="00:46:05.119" style="s2">remarkable i i</p>
<p begin="00:46:03.599" end="00:46:06.560" style="s2">if you had asked me you know when i was</p>
<p begin="00:46:05.119" end="00:46:07.680" style="s2">laid off during a pandemic if this was</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.560" end="00:46:08.800" style="s2">ultimate would ultimately be</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.680" end="00:46:10.640" style="s2">good for my career i would have thought</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.800" end="00:46:12.240" style="s2">you were crazy but it the response has</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.640" end="00:46:13.839" style="s2">been really remarkable to see</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.240" end="00:46:15.119" style="s2">and i think part of that i you know i</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.839" end="00:46:16.560" style="s2">hear from people jesse and i both hear</p>
<p begin="00:46:15.119" end="00:46:18.960" style="s2">from people all the time who say</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.560" end="00:46:19.680" style="s2">i can&#39;t have these conversations with my</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.960" end="00:46:22.000" style="s2">friends</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.680" end="00:46:23.200" style="s2">i don&#39;t know what to do i feel like i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.000" end="00:46:25.359" style="s2">going crazy</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.200" end="00:46:26.880" style="s2">thank you for making me feel less crazy</p>
<p begin="00:46:25.359" end="00:46:28.400" style="s2">and yeah we&#39;re i don&#39;t think we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.880" end="00:46:29.599" style="s2">anything particularly remarkable but</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.400" end="00:46:31.200" style="s2">there&#39;s something right now about just</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.599" end="00:46:32.880" style="s2">like speaking honestly about our</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.200" end="00:46:34.480" style="s2">observations about the world that is</p>
<p begin="00:46:32.880" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">really resonating with people because</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.480" end="00:46:40.319" style="s2">they&#39;re not getting that anywhere else</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:42.880" style="s2">um and so for me you know coming from a</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.319" end="00:46:43.680" style="s2">staff writer position if i had been</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.880" end="00:46:46.079" style="s2">covering</p>
<p begin="00:46:43.680" end="00:46:47.040" style="s2">the protests and and the pandemic and</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.079" end="00:46:48.880" style="s2">everything that&#39;s been happening over</p>
<p begin="00:46:47.040" end="00:46:49.839" style="s2">the past couple months within my my</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.880" end="00:46:51.359" style="s2">former job</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.839" end="00:46:53.359" style="s2">i would have felt really constrained</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.359" end="00:46:55.200" style="s2">about what i was able to say and what i</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.359" end="00:46:56.480" style="s2">wasn&#39;t able to say and i mostly wrote</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.200" end="00:46:59.119" style="s2">opinion pieces</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.480" end="00:47:00.480" style="s2">um for the paper but my opinion just</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.119" end="00:47:01.359" style="s2">wasn&#39;t aligned with a lot of my</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.480" end="00:47:03.760" style="s2">colleagues</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.359" end="00:47:05.599" style="s2">and there&#39;s such pressure to conform and</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.760" end="00:47:07.760" style="s2">such sort of internal sort of</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.599" end="00:47:09.040" style="s2">you know conflict when there&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:47:07.760" end="00:47:11.599" style="s2">person who is</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.040" end="00:47:12.079" style="s2">who has a slightly slightly different</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.599" end="00:47:15.119" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.079" end="00:47:16.160" style="s2">perspective on things that it feels very</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.119" end="00:47:19.040" style="s2">constraining</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.160" end="00:47:19.680" style="s2">and so now i feel free for the first</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.040" end="00:47:21.839" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.680" end="00:47:23.040" style="s2">ever you know and and the only person i</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.839" end="00:47:24.000" style="s2">have to really worry about is pissing</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.040" end="00:47:26.880" style="s2">off is jessie</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.000" end="00:47:27.920" style="s2">and uh luckily he&#39;s pretty tolerant for</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.880" end="00:47:30.000" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.920" end="00:47:31.040" style="s2">for now we&#39;ll see how long it lasts yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.000" end="00:47:31.920" style="s2">i mean i would just echo everything</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.040" end="00:47:34.640" style="s2">she&#39;s saying for me</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.920" end="00:47:35.680" style="s2">it&#39;s a huge relief to just to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.640" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">vent about this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.680" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">and also just the emails we&#39;re getting</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.920" end="00:47:43.200" style="s2">they&#39;re like they&#39;re thanking us as</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:45.280" style="s2">though we&#39;re providing some life</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.200" end="00:47:47.280" style="s2">preserving or sandy preserving</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.280" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">service which is crazy because i know</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.280" end="00:47:50.480" style="s2">we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:52.319" style="s2">i think we put out a good product but</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.480" end="00:47:53.760" style="s2">it&#39;s just a sign that like mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:47:52.319" end="00:47:55.680" style="s2">outlets are not providing this very</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.760" end="00:47:57.200" style="s2">basic service of just normal analysis</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.680" end="00:47:58.960" style="s2">and journalism so</p>
<p begin="00:47:57.200" end="00:48:00.640" style="s2">i think our success like is tied</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.960" end="00:48:02.079" style="s2">directly to the fact that jerk like so</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.640" end="00:48:04.079" style="s2">many outlets have just gone off the</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.079" end="00:48:06.319" style="s2">rails and it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy that we should</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.079" end="00:48:08.880" style="s2">be able to</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.319" end="00:48:09.680" style="s2">quickly build out a podcast that you</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.880" end="00:48:11.440" style="s2">know will support</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.680" end="00:48:13.200" style="s2">almost a full time like it&#39;s it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:48:11.440" end="00:48:14.319" style="s2">crazy and it i just want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.200" end="00:48:16.319" style="s2">make it clear because i want the</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.319" end="00:48:17.359" style="s2">take-home point i want to be here</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.319" end="00:48:18.960" style="s2">is not that we have launched a</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.359" end="00:48:20.480" style="s2">successful podcast as perhaps i am with</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.960" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">that but that that what the hell are</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.480" end="00:48:24.079" style="s2">other outlets doing like how can</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:25.280" style="s2">between us and the other outlets that</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.079" end="00:48:26.240" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.280" end="00:48:28.000" style="s2">the other podcasts that are</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.240" end="00:48:29.599" style="s2">significantly left but not really into</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.000" end="00:48:31.119" style="s2">like the super woke thing</p>
<p begin="00:48:29.599" end="00:48:32.800" style="s2">there&#39;s clearly a market of this people</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.119" end="00:48:34.319" style="s2">will hand over their money</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.800" end="00:48:36.240" style="s2">the cost of a subscription to like a</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.319" end="00:48:37.359" style="s2">streaming service just for our podcast</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.240" end="00:48:39.119" style="s2">what does that tell you about</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.359" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">what what the market isn&#39;t serving right</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.119" end="00:48:42.400" style="s2">now i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think it&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:43.599" style="s2">katie and i are particularly geniuses</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.400" end="00:48:44.960" style="s2">although i wish i could say that was the</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.599" end="00:48:47.119" style="s2">answer</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.960" end="00:48:48.800" style="s2">yeah and just just as a final piece i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.119" end="00:48:50.000" style="s2">like to read from an article that was</p>

<p begin="00:49:10.319" end="00:49:15.680" style="s2">of an awful lot of people</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.079" end="00:49:18.160" style="s2">have a lot of um and a lot of values</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.680" end="00:49:19.920" style="s2">so yeah i just want to read this quote</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.160" end="00:49:21.839" style="s2">this isn&#39;t just a media story it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.920" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">story about the epistemological rupture</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.839" end="00:49:25.440" style="s2">in the u.s polity that was provoked by</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:27.760" style="s2">the events of 2016</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.440" end="00:49:29.280" style="s2">and has since grown more extreme in</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.760" end="00:49:30.000" style="s2">isolation these moral panics and</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.280" end="00:49:31.359" style="s2">collective mental</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.000" end="00:49:33.200" style="s2">breakdowns can be difficult to make</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.359" end="00:49:35.040" style="s2">sense of but when you see them through</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.200" end="00:49:37.200" style="s2">the prism of america&#39;s current status as</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.040" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">a rapidly declining hegemonic power</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.200" end="00:49:40.880" style="s2">it all becomes much more intelligible</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.520" end="00:49:44.800" style="s2">i think that that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.839" end="00:49:47.599" style="s2">frighteningly</p>
<p begin="00:49:44.800" end="00:49:48.480" style="s2">uh astute um things are crazy and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.599" end="00:49:50.319" style="s2">know and obviously</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.480" end="00:49:53.359" style="s2">a lot of the same elements are happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.319" end="00:49:55.040" style="s2">in the uk um but you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.359" end="00:49:56.480" style="s2">there&#39;s trump or there&#39;s boris johnson</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.040" end="00:49:57.599" style="s2">or something and then there&#39;s an immense</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.480" end="00:50:00.480" style="s2">backlash um</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.599" end="00:50:01.200" style="s2">to try to sort of to right to right the</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.480" end="00:50:03.040" style="s2">ship</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.200" end="00:50:04.880" style="s2">um but then there you know there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.040" end="00:50:06.240" style="s2">backlash to the backlash and the writing</p>
<p begin="00:50:04.880" end="00:50:07.839" style="s2">of the ship might end up you know just</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.240" end="00:50:09.760" style="s2">tossing the ship over to the other</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.839" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">direction</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.760" end="00:50:13.440" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s definitely something some</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:15.680" style="s2">sort of epistemic breach going on his</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.440" end="00:50:16.960" style="s2">that quote reminded me of um</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.680" end="00:50:18.480" style="s2">we don&#39;t know again again this whole</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.960" end="00:50:20.079" style="s2">thing but they saw the covington</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.480" end="00:50:21.599" style="s2">catholic scandal from a year or two ago</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.079" end="00:50:22.800" style="s2">where a bunch of kids were filmed</p>
<p begin="00:50:21.599" end="00:50:24.160" style="s2">at first it seemed like they were</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.800" end="00:50:25.440" style="s2">mocking and harassing this native</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.160" end="00:50:27.359" style="s2">american elder</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.440" end="00:50:28.720" style="s2">they weren&#39;t like the progressive media</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.359" end="00:50:30.160" style="s2">was completely wrong about it but there</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.720" end="00:50:31.839" style="s2">was this real unwillingness on the part</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.160" end="00:50:33.680" style="s2">of many progressives to see what was</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.839" end="00:50:36.160" style="s2">before us what was before our own eyes</p>
<p begin="00:50:33.680" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">and for me that was like a radicalizing</p>
<p begin="00:50:36.160" end="00:50:39.280" style="s2">moment because i just realized</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.079" end="00:50:43.599" style="s2">to look at a video and not see what&#39;s on</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.839" end="00:50:43.920" style="s2">the video to continue to say that this</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.599" end="00:50:45.599" style="s2">was</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.920" end="00:50:46.880" style="s2">like a borderline hate crime rather than</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.599" end="00:50:47.440" style="s2">you know a few kids did that the</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.880" end="00:50:48.640" style="s2">tomahawk</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.440" end="00:50:50.400" style="s2">chop which is a little offensive but</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.640" end="00:50:51.119" style="s2">thousands of people do it every year at</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.400" end="00:50:53.359" style="s2">us</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.119" end="00:50:54.720" style="s2">sporting events that i think episomic</p>
<p begin="00:50:53.359" end="00:50:56.079" style="s2">breach is really right so when you talk</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.720" end="00:50:56.720" style="s2">about things like ruptures in the times</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.079" end="00:50:57.920" style="s2">newsroom</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.720" end="00:50:58.960" style="s2">if you could really dig into them and</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.920" end="00:51:00.319" style="s2">figure out the arguments people are</p>
<p begin="00:50:58.960" end="00:51:01.440" style="s2">making they have to do with questions</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.319" end="00:51:03.680" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.440" end="00:51:05.440" style="s2">do you do you challenge the testimonies</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.680" end="00:51:07.280" style="s2">of people from marginalized groups what</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.440" end="00:51:08.240" style="s2">constitutes knowledge what constitutes</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.280" end="00:51:10.319" style="s2">sufficient evidence</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.240" end="00:51:12.160" style="s2">and i think for a long time on the left</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.319" end="00:51:14.319" style="s2">we didn&#39;t really we ignored that there</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.160" end="00:51:16.559" style="s2">were these breaches but um</p>
<p begin="00:51:14.319" end="00:51:17.599" style="s2">trump and then i think the pandemic</p>
<p begin="00:51:16.559" end="00:51:20.640" style="s2">mixed with the</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.599" end="00:51:22.800" style="s2">protest has like been this trump-like</p>
<p begin="00:51:20.640" end="00:51:24.559" style="s2">event almost that has just</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.800" end="00:51:26.720" style="s2">starting to really crack up the left in</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.559" end="00:51:28.319" style="s2">ways that could be</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.720" end="00:51:29.760" style="s2">i think dangerous but there&#39;s also some</p>
<p begin="00:51:28.319" end="00:51:30.400" style="s2">potential upside so i&#39;m just very</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.760" end="00:51:32.319" style="s2">curious</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.400" end="00:51:33.440" style="s2">and scared about how things are gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.319" end="00:51:36.079" style="s2">it&#39;s a good time to be an independent</p>
