<p begin="00:00:26.270" end="00:00:31.279" style="s2">already there the psychologist stanislav</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.820" end="00:00:34.370" style="s2">grof talked about altered states and</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.279" end="00:00:36.710" style="s2">especially psychedelics as nonspecific</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.370" end="00:00:39.290" style="s2">amplifiers just making everything more</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.710" end="00:00:41.300" style="s2">intense whether good or bad so if this</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.290" end="00:00:43.970" style="s2">has been a bit of a joint psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.300" end="00:00:45.860" style="s2">trip how do we navigate it I thought the</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.970" end="00:00:48.290" style="s2">best person to speak to was Erik Davis</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.860" end="00:00:50.360" style="s2">who&#39;s one of the foremost historians of</p>

<p begin="00:01:02.930" end="00:01:07.760" style="s2">say Eric really good thank you for</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.600" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">making time for the conversation yeah no</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.760" end="00:01:14.150" style="s2">good to be here cool so the reason I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:15.530" style="s2">really keen to talk to you Eric is that</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.150" end="00:01:19.580" style="s2">you&#39;re one of the kind of foremost</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.530" end="00:01:22.070" style="s2">historians of weirdness strangeness and</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.580" end="00:01:26.450" style="s2">the sort of the pioneers of that in the</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.070" end="00:01:28.550" style="s2">60s and 70s and since this pandemic has</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.450" end="00:01:31.510" style="s2">kind of been ramping up and so much has</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.550" end="00:01:34.670" style="s2">changed I&#39;ve had this real sense of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.510" end="00:01:38.030" style="s2">pandemic and the lockdown as this sort</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.670" end="00:01:41.590" style="s2">of nonspecific amplifier I&#39;m reminded of</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.030" end="00:01:44.479" style="s2">Stan Grof stanislav grof the amazing</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.590" end="00:01:46.909" style="s2">psychologist and pioneer of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.479" end="00:01:49.550" style="s2">therapy talked about psychedelics as a</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.909" end="00:01:52.010" style="s2">nonspecific amplifier so it just made</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.550" end="00:01:53.450" style="s2">everything more intense and it feels a</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.010" end="00:01:56.540" style="s2">lot like this is what&#39;s been happening</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.450" end="00:01:58.370" style="s2">in our culture I want to start just</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.540" end="00:02:01.190" style="s2">asking you what we&#39;ll get onto some of</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.370" end="00:02:02.479" style="s2">the the figures from the 60s and 70s and</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.190" end="00:02:04.640" style="s2">what we might be able to learn from them</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.479" end="00:02:07.040" style="s2">but what what do you feel about that</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.640" end="00:02:07.970" style="s2">frame like the pandemic and this kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.040" end="00:02:10.519" style="s2">time we&#39;re going through as a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.970" end="00:02:13.159" style="s2">nonspecific amplifier I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.519" end="00:02:15.640" style="s2">wonderful frame in the sense that it it</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.159" end="00:02:19.250" style="s2">forces us to reflect on our own</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.640" end="00:02:21.110" style="s2">reactions at least as much as our ideas</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.250" end="00:02:23.389" style="s2">about what are what&#39;s causing those</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.110" end="00:02:28.040" style="s2">reactions he&#39;s a way saying the</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.389" end="00:02:30.829" style="s2">experience is not caused by LSD</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.040" end="00:02:33.409" style="s2">causes your experiences your own set and</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.829" end="00:02:36.829" style="s2">setting your own even physiological set</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.409" end="00:02:40.549" style="s2">being stimulated by this nonspecific or</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.829" end="00:02:43.010" style="s2">amplified by this nonspecific factor so</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.549" end="00:02:45.890" style="s2">what that means with acid is it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.010" end="00:02:49.129" style="s2">don&#39;t go oh the LSD told me this or the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.890" end="00:02:51.920" style="s2">LSD made me do this or so it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.129" end="00:02:55.790" style="s2">wow I have now an opportunity to see how</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.920" end="00:02:57.680" style="s2">I respond or what gets amplified when</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.790" end="00:03:00.939" style="s2">I&#39;m in encounter this particular</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.680" end="00:03:02.720" style="s2">marvelous chemical so if I have a great</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.939" end="00:03:04.340" style="s2">psyche death you know if I have a</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.720" end="00:03:06.409" style="s2">visionary experience that&#39;s something of</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.340" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">mine if I have a hell trip it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.409" end="00:03:10.849" style="s2">something I have to kind of reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:14.389" style="s2">and so in that sense I think it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.849" end="00:03:16.879" style="s2">really wonderful way to but again to</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.389" end="00:03:19.760" style="s2">push it back on to our own reactions</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.879" end="00:03:21.439" style="s2">meaning both how we&#39;re processing and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.760" end="00:03:24.200" style="s2">thinking about what&#39;s happening out</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.439" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">there but it also I think helps explain</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.200" end="00:03:30.709" style="s2">the Sur reality or weirdness of the</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:33.079" style="s2">situation we&#39;re in because it&#39;s not like</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.709" end="00:03:35.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a specific event that we&#39;re all</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.079" end="00:03:39.099" style="s2">reacting to more or less the same it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.930" end="00:03:43.760" style="s2">that there&#39;s a nebulous largely</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.099" end="00:03:47.659" style="s2">invisible you know distributed event</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.760" end="00:03:50.329" style="s2">that actually I don&#39;t really see too</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.659" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">much in my life I see the signs of it or</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.329" end="00:03:55.519" style="s2">how other people are interpreting it but</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:57.470" style="s2">it&#39;s very nebulous it&#39;s like a invisible</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.519" end="00:04:01.099" style="s2">bomb went off and we&#39;re kind of in the</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.470" end="00:04:02.569" style="s2">the you know the aftershock of it but we</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.099" end="00:04:04.760" style="s2">don&#39;t we can&#39;t really locate where did</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.569" end="00:04:06.889" style="s2">it happen what&#39;s going on and so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.760" end="00:04:08.870" style="s2">a there&#39;s a surreal quality to it</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.889" end="00:04:11.150" style="s2">because you can you&#39;re you have to kind</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.870" end="00:04:14.209" style="s2">of navigate other people&#39;s projections</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.150" end="00:04:16.519" style="s2">and fears and narratives even as you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.209" end="00:04:18.639" style="s2">sort of struggling to come up with your</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.519" end="00:04:21.380" style="s2">own and resist ones that are starting to</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.639" end="00:04:23.210" style="s2">over you know overly impinge on you or</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.380" end="00:04:25.340" style="s2">being attracted to ones that make you</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.210" end="00:04:28.220" style="s2">feel more afraid and you&#39;re like they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.340" end="00:04:30.080" style="s2">so we&#39;re in a kind of lightly</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.220" end="00:04:31.669" style="s2">psychedelic state where there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.080" end="00:04:33.830" style="s2">narratives multiple multiple</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.669" end="00:04:36.520" style="s2">possibilities multiple emotional</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.830" end="00:04:41.240" style="s2">reactions that have a kind of excessive</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.520" end="00:04:41.570" style="s2">surreal dreamlike quality even the way</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.240" end="00:04:44.150" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.570" end="00:04:47.150" style="s2">these polarized political events have</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.150" end="00:04:49.510" style="s2">just finally revealed that the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.150" end="00:04:53.150" style="s2">media as some kind of coherent</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.510" end="00:04:55.730" style="s2">maintainer of consensus reality is just</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.150" end="00:04:57.410" style="s2">gone really I mean there are individuals</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.730" end="00:04:58.880" style="s2">and individual organs that are doing</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.410" end="00:05:01.490" style="s2">good work and you know it&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.880" end="00:05:03.800" style="s2">but the overall sense that we have now</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.490" end="00:05:07.220" style="s2">entered into some kind of media</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.800" end="00:05:10.040" style="s2">implosion is also part of this sense of</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.220" end="00:05:12.470" style="s2">the surreal so it is also an interesting</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.040" end="00:05:14.930" style="s2">kind of opportunity to like</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.470" end="00:05:16.850" style="s2">pedal-to-the-metal with your spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.930" end="00:05:20.810" style="s2">practice your psychological practice</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.850" end="00:05:23.450" style="s2">your like like this is where clear clear</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.810" end="00:05:26.690" style="s2">thinking starts to actually have an</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.450" end="00:05:28.220" style="s2">active feedback process that improves</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.690" end="00:05:30.980" style="s2">the quality of your life and improves</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.220" end="00:05:33.320" style="s2">your ability to not be swamped by what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.980" end="00:05:34.880" style="s2">going on and to me you know you can you</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.320" end="00:05:37.400" style="s2">don&#39;t need to invoke psychedelics to</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.880" end="00:05:40.250" style="s2">talk about that sort of intelligence or</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.400" end="00:05:43.640" style="s2">that sort of process or practice at all</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.250" end="00:05:45.260" style="s2">but in my life it is partly about having</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.640" end="00:05:47.810" style="s2">been a psychedelic person for a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.260" end="00:05:50.420" style="s2">long time and going through very strange</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.810" end="00:05:52.280" style="s2">experiences and quasi psychotic</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.420" end="00:05:53.920" style="s2">experiences and dangerous experiences</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.280" end="00:05:56.600" style="s2">and delightful experiences and</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.920" end="00:05:59.180" style="s2">processing that that has come to allow</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.600" end="00:06:02.660" style="s2">me to a certain kind of flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.180" end="00:06:05.780" style="s2">around both nightmare scenarios paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.660" end="00:06:07.340" style="s2">scenarios but also a sense of the almost</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.780" end="00:06:10.130" style="s2">humour of being in the midst of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.340" end="00:06:13.520" style="s2">difficult situations and just plunging</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.130" end="00:06:17.210" style="s2">forward with a certain kind of Jawad avi</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.520" end="00:06:19.670" style="s2">and also a celebration of the ways that</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.210" end="00:06:21.740" style="s2">people can come together who are</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.670" end="00:06:23.450" style="s2">similarly going through difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.740" end="00:06:26.060" style="s2">situations and you can actually improve</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.450" end="00:06:28.520" style="s2">the quality of your communication and of</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.060" end="00:06:30.940" style="s2">your perception of the world and even if</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.520" end="00:06:33.140" style="s2">that perception can be very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.940" end="00:06:34.700" style="s2">yeah I mean there&#39;s so much to pick up</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.140" end="00:06:36.070" style="s2">on and what you were just saying but the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.700" end="00:06:37.850" style="s2">one thing that really came through</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.070" end="00:06:40.160" style="s2">partly but when you were talking about</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.850" end="00:06:42.740" style="s2">the media as well is this sort of sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.160" end="00:06:45.230" style="s2">of narrative collapse but I also wanted</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.740" end="00:06:48.680" style="s2">to bring in the concept of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.230" end="00:06:50.690" style="s2">emergency because this is again coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.680" end="00:06:53.000" style="s2">from Stan Grof is probably the one who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.690" end="00:06:55.470" style="s2">done the most work on this but the sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.000" end="00:06:59.370" style="s2">of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.470" end="00:07:02.280" style="s2">we&#39;re in a kind of medical paradigm that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.370" end="00:07:04.320" style="s2">that often pathologize --is altered</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.280" end="00:07:06.150" style="s2">states often pathologize a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.320" end="00:07:08.100" style="s2">experience and he came up with the</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.150" end="00:07:10.980" style="s2">concept of spiritual emergency to talk</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.100" end="00:07:13.230" style="s2">about anything that didn&#39;t an altered</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.980" end="00:07:15.930" style="s2">state or a transformational process that</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.230" end="00:07:19.640" style="s2">didn&#39;t really fit into a Western medical</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.930" end="00:07:22.740" style="s2">model and would often be labeled as SCI</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.640" end="00:07:26.670" style="s2">psychosis or mania or some of those and</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.740" end="00:07:29.250" style="s2">it feels I&#39;ve had experiences like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.670" end="00:07:30.900" style="s2">or I understand and I understand a lot</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.250" end="00:07:32.970" style="s2">of what that feels like</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.900" end="00:07:34.440" style="s2">and often what I found that would come</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.970" end="00:07:36.810" style="s2">up in those spiritual emergencies</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.440" end="00:07:38.430" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of the buried stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.810" end="00:07:40.260" style="s2">the past stuff that I hadn&#39;t dealt with</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.430" end="00:07:42.330" style="s2">from childhood or stuff that I hadn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.260" end="00:07:44.520" style="s2">dealt with from my my upbringing my</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.330" end="00:07:47.190" style="s2">conditioning and it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.520" end="00:07:50.550" style="s2">especially in the last few weeks where</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.190" end="00:07:52.350" style="s2">we see all of this repressed stuff from</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.550" end="00:07:55.020" style="s2">the American culture from the British</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.350" end="00:07:58.110" style="s2">culture just coming up it feels to me</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.020" end="00:07:59.490" style="s2">like the the entire culture is in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.110" end="00:08:02.580" style="s2">middle of some kind of spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.490" end="00:08:04.200" style="s2">emergency would you would you agree with</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.580" end="00:08:06.390" style="s2">that you sort of seen the same kind of</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.200" end="00:08:08.550" style="s2">yeah I mean I I would because they in a</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.390" end="00:08:11.810" style="s2">way spiritual emergency is the best</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.550" end="00:08:14.400" style="s2">model you have to as an alternate to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.810" end="00:08:15.450" style="s2">break down in psychosis I mean that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.400" end="00:08:17.160" style="s2">kind of what he&#39;s saying he&#39;s saying</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.450" end="00:08:18.390" style="s2">look if you have somebody maybe they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.160" end="00:08:19.470" style="s2">tripping or maybe they&#39;re not even</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.390" end="00:08:21.419" style="s2">tripping they&#39;re just going through a</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.470" end="00:08:23.730" style="s2">point part of their life and they start</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.419" end="00:08:25.620" style="s2">to have these symptoms that conventional</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.730" end="00:08:27.480" style="s2">science is going to say or medicine is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.620" end="00:08:30.030" style="s2">going to say oh they&#39;re psychotic or</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.480" end="00:08:31.680" style="s2">they&#39;re bipolar he want Groth wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.030" end="00:08:33.090" style="s2">say look there&#39;s another way of framing</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.680" end="00:08:35.360" style="s2">it and there was a lot of stuff like</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.090" end="00:08:37.770" style="s2">that in the 60s and 70s it was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.360" end="00:08:41.430" style="s2">anti-psychiatry moment there was a whole</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.770" end="00:08:44.130" style="s2">attempt to reframe difficult altered</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.430" end="00:08:46.140" style="s2">states as potentially valuable as even</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.130" end="00:08:48.270" style="s2">trauma you know that that&#39;s actually a</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.140" end="00:08:51.330" style="s2">very interesting thing a very important</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.270" end="00:08:53.460" style="s2">difference between our era now and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.330" end="00:08:55.830" style="s2">era that people don&#39;t talk about enough</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.460" end="00:08:56.880" style="s2">that&#39;s really key to understand if</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.830" end="00:08:58.680" style="s2">you&#39;ve taught if you&#39;re thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.880" end="00:09:03.120" style="s2">terms of that connection and then I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.680" end="00:09:06.030" style="s2">go on more about now is in a sense a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.120" end="00:09:08.819" style="s2">of people in the 60s embraced trauma as</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.030" end="00:09:11.970" style="s2">a rite of passage</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.819" end="00:09:13.859" style="s2">into a new state so the idea that taking</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.970" end="00:09:16.019" style="s2">a huge dose of psychedelics is going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.859" end="00:09:17.549" style="s2">tear you apart it opens up the</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.019" end="00:09:18.899" style="s2">possibility you walk out on the other</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.549" end="00:09:22.459" style="s2">side and you&#39;ve left a lot of stuff</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.899" end="00:09:25.139" style="s2">behind a lot of the ideas about having</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.459" end="00:09:27.629" style="s2">extraordinary experience enlightenment</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.139" end="00:09:30.959" style="s2">experience in fact that eras whole quest</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.629" end="00:09:33.419" style="s2">for radical intense experiences was</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.959" end="00:09:35.479" style="s2">partly justified because lots of people</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.419" end="00:09:37.979" style="s2">you know people on the street</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.479" end="00:09:40.199" style="s2">psychiatrists people at Esalen etc etc</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.979" end="00:09:43.859" style="s2">had this idea that there was a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.199" end="00:09:46.289" style="s2">cleansing craziness at the far end of</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.859" end="00:09:49.169" style="s2">which was the opportunity to reconstruct</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.289" end="00:09:52.829" style="s2">in a new way and we don&#39;t think that way</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.169" end="00:09:56.999" style="s2">anymore you know we are much more scared</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.829" end="00:09:58.649" style="s2">about trauma and how trauma you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.999" end="00:10:00.359" style="s2">get out of it or it tears things down</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.649" end="00:10:01.739" style="s2">and there&#39;s we&#39;re not you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.359" end="00:10:04.249" style="s2">almost on the opposite where we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.739" end="00:10:07.379" style="s2">even want to trigger past trauma and</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.249" end="00:10:09.119" style="s2">that those two differences are very</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.379" end="00:10:12.269" style="s2">important they help explain a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.119" end="00:10:15.269" style="s2">ways that to them contemporary discourse</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.269" end="00:10:17.669" style="s2">around psychedelics is so different than</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.269" end="00:10:20.609" style="s2">it used to be but I think it&#39;s also in</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.669" end="00:10:22.289" style="s2">some ways not setting us up as well as</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.609" end="00:10:24.149" style="s2">it could be for what we&#39;re going through</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.289" end="00:10:26.039" style="s2">because what we&#39;re going through like</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.149" end="00:10:28.589" style="s2">you say does have the character of some</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.039" end="00:10:31.109" style="s2">return of the repressed or some kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.589" end="00:10:33.449" style="s2">now I have to actually look at not just</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.109" end="00:10:35.669" style="s2">aspects of myself but aspects of reality</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.449" end="00:10:37.199" style="s2">it&#39;s like if you&#39;ve if you&#39;ve kind of</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.669" end="00:10:38.819" style="s2">been in your bubble your whole life and</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.199" end="00:10:40.649" style="s2">then finally you have the opportunity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.819" end="00:10:43.199" style="s2">really absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.649" end="00:10:46.470" style="s2">existentially recognize that you are</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.199" end="00:10:48.689" style="s2">going to die and you can&#39;t layer</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.470" end="00:10:51.119" style="s2">anything on top of it that is a</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.689" end="00:10:52.919" style="s2">traumatic experience or can be you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.119" end="00:10:54.689" style="s2">also be an illuminating experience and</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.919" end="00:10:56.819" style="s2">there can be illumination in the trauma</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.689" end="00:10:58.739" style="s2">and that&#39;s it gets really complicated</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.819" end="00:11:01.319" style="s2">one of the things that I&#39;m talking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.739" end="00:11:03.089" style="s2">with all three of the characters that I</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.319" end="00:11:05.009" style="s2">write about it I think one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.089" end="00:11:09.089" style="s2">that&#39;s sort of unique about my approach</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.009" end="00:11:13.350" style="s2">is that a lot of counts they will either</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.089" end="00:11:15.329" style="s2">stress the psychopathology or the stress</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.350" end="00:11:16.199" style="s2">the spirituality so you take someone</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.329" end="00:11:18.059" style="s2">like Alan Watts</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.199" end="00:11:20.369" style="s2">you know when Alan Watts comes off as a</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.059" end="00:11:22.199" style="s2">really groovy mellow guys on top of him</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.369" end="00:11:22.499" style="s2">stuff but his actual life is kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.199" end="00:11:24.779" style="s2">mad</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.499" end="00:11:26.999" style="s2">in some ways he was sort of a dark</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.779" end="00:11:29.189" style="s2">character and you know whatever it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.999" end="00:11:31.889" style="s2">complicated but he you know he was an</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.189" end="00:11:34.079" style="s2">alcoholic he died of alcoholism he was a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.889" end="00:11:35.789" style="s2">womanizer he was you know he had a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.079" end="00:11:37.319" style="s2">of issues with control or self-control</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.789" end="00:11:39.359" style="s2">and so when you start to look at the</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.319" end="00:11:41.399" style="s2">philosophy you go huh what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.359" end="00:11:43.289" style="s2">here it gets complicated but some most</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.399" end="00:11:45.419" style="s2">people would either say you know some</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.289" end="00:11:48.419" style="s2">dark but negative biographers who go oh</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.419" end="00:11:49.709" style="s2">he was just a reprobate he couldn&#39;t deal</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.419" end="00:11:52.019" style="s2">with it and all everything else was just</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.709" end="00:11:53.909" style="s2">a justification for that and then a lot</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.019" end="00:11:55.109" style="s2">of the kind of you know spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.909" end="00:11:56.729" style="s2">new-age thing they don&#39;t think about</p>
<p begin="00:11:55.109" end="00:11:59.459" style="s2">that they just talk about his brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.729" end="00:12:00.869" style="s2">ideas but it&#39;s a mix it&#39;s on a continuum</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.459" end="00:12:03.149" style="s2">and the three guys that I talk about</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.869" end="00:12:05.789" style="s2">they are they all spend time in</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.149" end="00:12:09.329" style="s2">something like psychosis or something</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.789" end="00:12:10.979" style="s2">like paranoid pathology some some quite</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.329" end="00:12:14.429" style="s2">repeatedly in the case of philip k dick</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.979" end="00:12:17.009" style="s2">but they also were spiritual figures</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.429" end="00:12:19.409" style="s2">they also had prophetic visionary</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.009" end="00:12:22.589" style="s2">experiences that had integrity and</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.409" end="00:12:24.869" style="s2">consequence and richness they also all</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.589" end="00:12:27.479" style="s2">reflected philosophically on things and</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.869" end="00:12:30.149" style="s2">and that there&#39;s a continuum there and</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.479" end="00:12:31.619" style="s2">so you the fact that there&#39;s psychosis</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.149" end="00:12:33.569" style="s2">in the picture or the fact that there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.619" end="00:12:37.589" style="s2">social breakdown or the fact that there</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.569" end="00:12:40.039" style="s2">is a big uptick in mental disturbance</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.589" end="00:12:42.629" style="s2">doesn&#39;t mean just the whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.039" end="00:12:45.269" style="s2">unraveling it also means there are other</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.629" end="00:12:47.939" style="s2">possibilities that are open and I you</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.269" end="00:12:49.859" style="s2">know a more positive view of let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.939" end="00:12:52.919" style="s2">in the United States in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.859" end="00:12:54.989" style="s2">weeks the extraordinary energy of these</p>

<p begin="00:21:52.200" end="00:21:56.520" style="s2">get it back up most of the time and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.929" end="00:21:58.409" style="s2">really think that this was something</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.520" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">that these guys were kind of exploring</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.409" end="00:22:03.600" style="s2">and another analogy for that you get in</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.320" end="00:22:06.450" style="s2">Robert Anton Wilson that I also think is</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.600" end="00:22:08.399" style="s2">really applicable to two today two</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.450" end="00:22:11.070" style="s2">aspects of today particularly if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.399" end="00:22:14.250" style="s2">thinking about conspiracy theory and how</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.070" end="00:22:16.020" style="s2">easily it is for people to get absorbed</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.250" end="00:22:19.080" style="s2">into conspiracy narratives today which</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.020" end="00:22:22.169" style="s2">is a fascinating thing it&#39;s it&#39;s for me</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.080" end="00:22:24.539" style="s2">under trying to grapple with conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.169" end="00:22:26.580" style="s2">theory today and I admit that the term</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.539" end="00:22:28.649" style="s2">conspiracy theory is problematic and we</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.580" end="00:22:30.390" style="s2">have to NIST or assign it and it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.649" end="00:22:31.470" style="s2">mean there are conspiracies bah-bah-bah</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.390" end="00:22:32.970" style="s2">it&#39;s always important to say these</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.470" end="00:22:34.740" style="s2">things because there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.970" end="00:22:37.740" style="s2">mainstream talk about conspiracy theory</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.740" end="00:22:39.900" style="s2">that&#39;s really pretty stupid but for me</p>
<p begin="00:22:37.740" end="00:22:43.200" style="s2">it&#39;s a really grapple with it in its</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.900" end="00:22:45.210" style="s2">complexity is not just like a sidelight</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.200" end="00:22:47.700" style="s2">it&#39;s not like oh yeah all the deplorable</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.210" end="00:22:49.410" style="s2">is over here getting into conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.700" end="00:22:51.390" style="s2">theory you know all the smart people are</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.410" end="00:22:54.900" style="s2">trying to keep the ship going it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.390" end="00:22:57.060" style="s2">like that it&#39;s much more symptomatic and</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.900" end="00:22:59.460" style="s2">it&#39;s much more central I think to as a</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.060" end="00:23:01.620" style="s2">sign of what&#39;s happening with media with</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.460" end="00:23:04.410" style="s2">consensus reality with the narrative</p>

<p begin="00:25:48.800" end="00:25:55.340" style="s2">get pull away from a consensus view and</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.550" end="00:25:57.820" style="s2">then where are you well then you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.340" end="00:26:00.650" style="s2">locked into some weird internet</p>

<p begin="00:26:04.520" end="00:26:08.810" style="s2">found my tribe and and you find these</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.040" end="00:26:10.430" style="s2">people and they just iterate the same</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.810" end="00:26:12.260" style="s2">stuff you&#39;ve heard from the guy next to</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.430" end="00:26:14.240" style="s2">them so they haven&#39;t freed themselves</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.260" end="00:26:16.520" style="s2">from collective narratives from</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.240" end="00:26:19.490" style="s2">collective stories a lot of them they</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.520" end="00:26:22.340" style="s2">just get away from the first layer and</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.490" end="00:26:24.170" style="s2">get stuck in the second but the radical</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.340" end="00:26:27.230" style="s2">agnostic goes well how do I why should I</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.170" end="00:26:29.770" style="s2">trust this weird guy over here and with</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.230" end="00:26:32.630" style="s2">his videos why do I trust these</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.770" end="00:26:36.020" style="s2">conspiracy narratives why do I trust my</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.630" end="00:26:38.270" style="s2">own fear and and so there&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.020" end="00:26:41.690" style="s2">going deeper and deeper and deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.270" end="00:26:44.720" style="s2">skepticism where you pop out and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.690" end="00:26:47.330" style="s2">like okay I I really can&#39;t really ground</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.720" end="00:26:49.310" style="s2">any of my beliefs I can see the way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.330" end="00:26:51.710" style="s2">mathematics has these self contradictory</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.310" end="00:26:54.800" style="s2">elements to them I can see the way that</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.710" end="00:26:56.900" style="s2">you know physics is contradictory in all</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.800" end="00:26:57.560" style="s2">sorts of ways and which physics are we</p>

<p begin="00:26:57.560" end="00:27:03.380" style="s2">and will there ever be one physics</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.680" end="00:27:05.630" style="s2">unlikely you realize how multiplicities</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.380" end="00:27:08.990" style="s2">how chaotic how multi-dimensional the</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.630" end="00:27:10.970" style="s2">world is but you&#39;re ok with that because</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.990" end="00:27:13.520" style="s2">you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of back you&#39;re back</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.970" end="00:27:15.650" style="s2">with a difference you&#39;re back with like</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.520" end="00:27:17.960" style="s2">well but I&#39;m in this condition where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.650" end="00:27:20.150" style="s2">making decisions I&#39;m building models of</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.960" end="00:27:22.520" style="s2">the world I&#39;m talking to people that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.150" end="00:27:23.120" style="s2">can resonate with and we&#39;re helping each</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.520" end="00:27:26.180" style="s2">other</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.120" end="00:27:27.890" style="s2">clarify how we get through that you know</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.180" end="00:27:30.140" style="s2">science can give us a lot of information</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.890" end="00:27:32.450" style="s2">about what&#39;s going on but you hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.140" end="00:27:34.520" style="s2">everything more lightly you hold</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.450" end="00:27:37.280" style="s2">everything sort of gingerly and you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.520" end="00:27:38.900" style="s2">aware that it can go south or turn under</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.280" end="00:27:41.060" style="s2">or the rug can be pulled out from under</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.900" end="00:27:43.250" style="s2">you at any time so that when that</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.060" end="00:27:45.350" style="s2">happens you&#39;re not terrified you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.250" end="00:27:48.260" style="s2">lose the plot you&#39;re like oh it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.350" end="00:27:50.000" style="s2">crazy part again or oh now I&#39;m paranoid</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.260" end="00:27:53.420" style="s2">today yeah I&#39;m Reese all coming together</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.000" end="00:27:56.180" style="s2">ok well let&#39;s try to navigate this be be</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.420" end="00:27:58.370" style="s2">nice to people don&#39;t hurt myself you</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.180" end="00:28:00.680" style="s2">know it in a weird way it comes back to</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.370" end="00:28:02.990" style="s2">being very pragmatic and very realistic</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.680" end="00:28:06.530" style="s2">but you&#39;re not clinging onto these</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.990" end="00:28:08.210" style="s2">totalizing narratives anymore and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.530" end="00:28:11.060" style="s2">where people get stuck because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.210" end="00:28:13.820" style="s2">scary I mean it&#39;s scary to believe that</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.060" end="00:28:15.260" style="s2">Bill Gates is making a vaccine that</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.820" end="00:28:16.910" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna he&#39;s gonna force us all to</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.260" end="00:28:18.170" style="s2">take and it&#39;s got a microchip and</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.910" end="00:28:20.150" style="s2">they&#39;re gonna control us yeah that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.170" end="00:28:22.370" style="s2">pretty scary it&#39;s like a weird fiction</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.150" end="00:28:24.800" style="s2">or I love all I love weird fiction I</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.370" end="00:28:26.630" style="s2">love horror I love science fiction you</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.800" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">know it&#39;s another one of those and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.630" end="00:28:33.920" style="s2">scary if you think it&#39;s true but it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:37.460" style="s2">lot scarier to go in some ways the world</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.920" end="00:28:40.310" style="s2">is a chaos that nobody knows is really</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.460" end="00:28:42.200" style="s2">going on nobody knows and if you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.310" end="00:28:44.600" style="s2">that there&#39;s a captain of the ship and</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.200" end="00:28:48.010" style="s2">you finally get there and you get into</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.600" end="00:28:51.530" style="s2">the the captain&#39;s chamber it&#39;s empty</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.010" end="00:28:54.920" style="s2">there&#39;s just committees and and fights</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.530" end="00:28:58.640" style="s2">and negotiations and different models</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.920" end="00:29:02.090" style="s2">and that&#39;s us riding history riding this</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:04.160" style="s2">flowing chaos of a wave and there you</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.090" end="00:29:06.260" style="s2">are waking up to it you know having</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.160" end="00:29:08.840" style="s2">ultimate responsibility but also</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.260" end="00:29:11.210" style="s2">realizing you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.840" end="00:29:14.090" style="s2">and that&#39;s a very psychedelic moment</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.210" end="00:29:15.890" style="s2">and you then there&#39;s the next day how</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.090" end="00:29:18.140" style="s2">are you gonna live with that well get</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.890" end="00:29:21.020" style="s2">out of Chapel perilous man</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.140" end="00:29:24.950" style="s2">get in get into like if that&#39;s the way</p>
<p begin="00:29:21.020" end="00:29:28.429" style="s2">you&#39;ve gone embrace radical agnosticism</p>
<p begin="00:29:24.950" end="00:29:30.559" style="s2">embrace not knowing but not not a one</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.429" end="00:29:33.140" style="s2">that forced that and this enables you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.559" end="00:29:35.659" style="s2">from making decisions it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.140" end="00:29:39.679" style="s2">paradox in a way but not totally and</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.659" end="00:29:43.659" style="s2">it&#39;s to my mind a very it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.679" end="00:29:46.520" style="s2">mature psychedelia or a mature kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.659" end="00:29:49.940" style="s2">skepticism where you&#39;re you&#39;re going for</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.520" end="00:29:52.370" style="s2">it but you don&#39;t stop from from you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.940" end="00:29:54.080" style="s2">taking all the way down and then having</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.370" end="00:29:55.789" style="s2">to come back because there you are</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.080" end="00:29:57.770" style="s2">you&#39;re still making decisions do I do</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.789" end="00:30:00.049" style="s2">this do I do that you can&#39;t just say I</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.770" end="00:30:01.490" style="s2">don&#39;t know it&#39;s all of its all fake or</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.049" end="00:30:04.340" style="s2">whatever doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.490" end="00:30:05.899" style="s2">so that&#39;s my hope you know or it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.340" end="00:30:08.450" style="s2">it&#39;s not for everybody it&#39;s just for</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.899" end="00:30:11.960" style="s2">people I think who find themselves going</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.450" end="00:30:14.529" style="s2">in these weird ways that as I said with</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.960" end="00:30:16.700" style="s2">conspiracy theory are now just part of</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.529" end="00:30:18.890" style="s2">mediated reality so you have people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.700" end="00:30:20.840" style="s2">have no psychedelic experience who don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.890" end="00:30:22.789" style="s2">think about this these ways it does</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.840" end="00:30:25.480" style="s2">don&#39;t know the history of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.789" end="00:30:28.190" style="s2">theory just tuning into this stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.480" end="00:30:30.830" style="s2">really getting lost really fast and I</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.190" end="00:30:32.480" style="s2">know people personally I&#39;ve seen a lot</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.830" end="00:30:34.429" style="s2">of people in the new-age world and the</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.480" end="00:30:36.380" style="s2">yoga world and the psychedelic world</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.429" end="00:30:39.169" style="s2">Burning Man world all these worlds that</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.380" end="00:30:42.350" style="s2">I&#39;m kind of part in and part out just</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.169" end="00:30:44.000" style="s2">lose the plot get gets get absorbed into</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.350" end="00:30:45.740" style="s2">narratives that are being manipulated by</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.000" end="00:30:48.890" style="s2">other levels of narrative and other</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.740" end="00:30:52.520" style="s2">players for very specific reasons so</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.890" end="00:30:58.820" style="s2">it&#39;s a time for for some of these tools</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.520" end="00:31:00.590" style="s2">to to spread yeah yeah it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.820" end="00:31:04.399" style="s2">interesting I mean we did a whole series</p>
<p begin="00:31:00.590" end="00:31:06.429" style="s2">on conspiracy so I kind of looked into</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.399" end="00:31:08.929" style="s2">it and there&#39;s something it is very</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.429" end="00:31:10.760" style="s2">psychoactive the whole the whole area of</p>
<p begin="00:31:08.929" end="00:31:14.179" style="s2">conspiracy theory is very psychoactive</p>
<p begin="00:31:10.760" end="00:31:16.010" style="s2">and one of the best summaries of why</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.179" end="00:31:17.690" style="s2">that is came from a friend of mine who</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.010" end="00:31:20.299" style="s2">says that it&#39;s a lot of it is very</p>
<p begin="00:31:17.690" end="00:31:21.980" style="s2">archetypal material we&#39;re moving into</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.299" end="00:31:24.990" style="s2">we&#39;re moving into like mythopoetic</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.980" end="00:31:27.900" style="s2">realms and if you&#39;re not careful at some</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.990" end="00:31:29.760" style="s2">you actually start chasing Satan like</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.900" end="00:31:32.790" style="s2">there&#39;s there&#39;s all of these kind of</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.760" end="00:31:34.770" style="s2">really deep religious archetypes and for</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.790" end="00:31:37.590" style="s2">example like projecting Satan onto Bill</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.770" end="00:31:40.260" style="s2">Gates classic one that you sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.590" end="00:31:42.390" style="s2">people doing constantly online but at</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.260" end="00:31:44.970" style="s2">the same time you can&#39;t reject it</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.390" end="00:31:47.179" style="s2">wholesale either because a friend of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.970" end="00:31:49.950" style="s2">mine also said that this in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.179" end="00:31:51.900" style="s2">becoming a conspiracy theories theorist</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.950" end="00:31:52.559" style="s2">is probably a necessary initiation for</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.900" end="00:31:55.260" style="s2">all of us</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.559" end="00:31:56.910" style="s2">like when once we let go of consensus</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.260" end="00:31:59.040" style="s2">reality going through that process is</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.910" end="00:32:01.350" style="s2">almost like a necessary initiation now I</p>
<p begin="00:31:59.040" end="00:32:01.620" style="s2">I think that&#39;s I think that&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.350" end="00:32:04.110" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.620" end="00:32:05.730" style="s2">another thing that that reminds me of is</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.110" end="00:32:08.280" style="s2">what one of the things I was trying to</p>

<p begin="00:32:29.940" end="00:32:33.900" style="s2">it literally and then a lot of things</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.500" end="00:32:36.150" style="s2">have been have been set up so it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.900" end="00:32:38.700" style="s2">of those in a way it&#39;s another aspect of</p>

<p begin="00:32:43.320" end="00:32:47.970" style="s2">for and part of it I think is a</p>

<p begin="00:32:47.970" end="00:32:54.809" style="s2">narratives these unconscious fears and</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.900" end="00:32:58.500" style="s2">phantasms like Satan like the end of the</p>

<p begin="00:33:02.100" end="00:33:06.809" style="s2">think that part of the problem with</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.190" end="00:33:09.840" style="s2">conspiracy theory is that how to say</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.809" end="00:33:12.570" style="s2">this is that it initiates you into a</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.840" end="00:33:14.910" style="s2">kind of realm of the imaginal that again</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.570" end="00:33:19.080" style="s2">we have to take seriously that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.910" end="00:33:21.780" style="s2">just fantasies or you know dream</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.080" end="00:33:24.570" style="s2">patterns in some dusty book that like</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.780" end="00:33:26.640" style="s2">the imaginal is no joke it&#39;s part of our</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.570" end="00:33:28.410" style="s2">world it&#39;s part of who we are and you</p>

<p begin="00:33:28.410" end="00:33:33.929" style="s2">going on here and there are certain</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.179" end="00:33:36.660" style="s2">patterns that have humans have used to</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.929" end="00:33:39.360" style="s2">kind of organize it and the Christian</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.660" end="00:33:40.980" style="s2">one has a certain has</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.360" end="00:33:44.940" style="s2">some features of it that make it</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.980" end="00:33:47.610" style="s2">attractive and one of those is that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.940" end="00:33:51.450" style="s2">very clear there&#39;s a good and an evil</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.610" end="00:33:54.390" style="s2">and I&#39;m on the good side and then that</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.450" end="00:33:57.420" style="s2">gives me a purpose in life which is to</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.390" end="00:34:00.330" style="s2">spread the message of good and evil so</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.420" end="00:34:03.870" style="s2">now I&#39;m gonna propagate the conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.330" end="00:34:06.809" style="s2">theory and it&#39;s all in relationship to a</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.870" end="00:34:08.700" style="s2">moment in the near future where</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.809" end="00:34:11.220" style="s2">everything is going to come apart or</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.700" end="00:34:13.470" style="s2">it&#39;s all going to be revealed you know</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.220" end="00:34:17.129" style="s2">in UFO stuff they talk about disclosure</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.470" end="00:34:18.990" style="s2">and UFO folks have been talking about</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.129" end="00:34:20.550" style="s2">disclosure for decades and we get a</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.990" end="00:34:22.109" style="s2">little bits of it you know it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.550" end="00:34:23.580" style="s2">authorities even play with it they give</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.109" end="00:34:25.320" style="s2">you you know the Air Force gives you a</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.580" end="00:34:27.480" style="s2">few bits and you&#39;re like that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.320" end="00:34:29.700" style="s2">disclosure is just around the corner but</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.480" end="00:34:31.770" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a pattern it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.700" end="00:34:33.510" style="s2">organizing history that&#39;s very rooted in</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.770" end="00:34:36.240" style="s2">a kind of Christian way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:34:33.510" end="00:34:38.040" style="s2">I prefer a more shamanic view of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.240" end="00:34:40.530" style="s2">imaginal world and I think that that is</p>
<p begin="00:34:38.040" end="00:34:42.389" style="s2">a more mature psychedelically informed</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.530" end="00:34:45.060" style="s2">kind of view and that&#39;s one in which</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.389" end="00:34:48.000" style="s2">you&#39;re like welcome to a world with many</p>
<p begin="00:34:45.060" end="00:34:49.710" style="s2">ambiguous players what looks like evil</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.000" end="00:34:52.139" style="s2">may not be so evil what looks like good</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.710" end="00:34:55.139" style="s2">may not be so good and you and yours</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.139" end="00:34:58.550" style="s2">have to kind of navigate this through</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.139" end="00:35:01.950" style="s2">alliances and practices and your own</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.550" end="00:35:04.890" style="s2">sort of autonomous ability to navigate</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.950" end="00:35:06.869" style="s2">that zone rather than joining the army</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.890" end="00:35:09.450" style="s2">of the good against the army of the</p>
<p begin="00:35:06.869" end="00:35:11.340" style="s2">devil and so that&#39;s I think a dimension</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.450" end="00:35:12.900" style="s2">that&#39;s going on with this idea that</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.340" end="00:35:15.780" style="s2">you&#39;re that you&#39;re talking about as I</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.900" end="00:35:19.320" style="s2">kind of as a kind of initiation but in a</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.780" end="00:35:22.470" style="s2">more grounded way I would also say that</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.320" end="00:35:25.619" style="s2">the the way that a lot of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.470" end="00:35:29.460" style="s2">theories are true is that they are let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.619" end="00:35:32.940" style="s2">call them allegories for real conditions</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.460" end="00:35:35.850" style="s2">of real power whose implications are</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.940" end="00:35:38.760" style="s2">both harrowing enough and difficult</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.850" end="00:35:42.630" style="s2">enough to pin down that you can&#39;t really</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.760" end="00:35:44.609" style="s2">get there through conventional means of</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.630" end="00:35:47.550" style="s2">journalism investigative journalism</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.609" end="00:35:50.400" style="s2">academic study that it just it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.550" end="00:35:52.820" style="s2">alludes that so that you know the degree</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.400" end="00:35:52.820" style="s2">to which</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.660" end="00:35:58.950" style="s2">psychopharmacology and and and you know</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.280" end="00:36:01.770" style="s2">the corporations that make pill like</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.950" end="00:36:05.720" style="s2">that they maintain such a massive</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.770" end="00:36:08.730" style="s2">influence over media over our self-image</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.720" end="00:36:11.099" style="s2">over our medicine that the very things</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.730" end="00:36:13.440" style="s2">we take into our bodies you know from a</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.099" end="00:36:18.329" style="s2">alien anthropologist point of view it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.440" end="00:36:22.140" style="s2">this totally weird you know dark dark</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.329" end="00:36:25.530" style="s2">white coded shamanism that has works but</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.140" end="00:36:28.500" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and I mean it&#39;s so it&#39;s so</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.530" end="00:36:31.109" style="s2">vast that you can&#39;t really get there</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.500" end="00:36:33.210" style="s2">with just like you know even if you</p>
<p begin="00:36:31.109" end="00:36:34.880" style="s2">follow like the oxycontin trail I go how</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.210" end="00:36:37.619" style="s2">did they how did we end up like</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.880" end="00:36:39.960" style="s2">addicting millions of Americans with</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.619" end="00:36:41.460" style="s2">these powerful drugs that we knew were</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.960" end="00:36:43.020" style="s2">bad like how does that happen</p>
<p begin="00:36:41.460" end="00:36:45.300" style="s2">and you can go through as an</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.020" end="00:36:46.950" style="s2">investigative journalist and track ok</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.300" end="00:36:49.200" style="s2">this family these guys made this</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.950" end="00:36:51.089" style="s2">decision here&#39;s this regulatory agency</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.200" end="00:36:53.550" style="s2">here are these lobbyists blah blah blah</p>
<p begin="00:36:51.089" end="00:36:55.619" style="s2">and you get this kind of murky it&#39;s war</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.550" end="00:36:58.020" style="s2">story that never really ends and hardly</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.619" end="00:36:59.910" style="s2">anybody ever takes responsibility for it</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.020" end="00:37:02.160" style="s2">and that may be the best we can do with</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.910" end="00:37:05.280" style="s2">that medium but on another level the</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.160" end="00:37:07.559" style="s2">horror of that like the horror of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.280" end="00:37:09.420" style="s2">where are you gonna put that you put it</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.559" end="00:37:13.980" style="s2">in the imagination and so then when you</p>
<p begin="00:37:09.420" end="00:37:18.420" style="s2">get a Bill Gates vaccine microchip story</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.980" end="00:37:21.930" style="s2">you&#39;re like the effect the emotional</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.420" end="00:37:26.549" style="s2">energy that is animating that story</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.930" end="00:37:30.359" style="s2">that&#39;s true that or it&#39;s responsive to a</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.549" end="00:37:32.940" style="s2">real situation and that&#39;s another thing</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.359" end="00:37:35.790" style="s2">I that I recommend people who are going</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.940" end="00:37:40.109" style="s2">through this realm is to become very</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.790" end="00:37:44.609" style="s2">good at picking apart the effect or the</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.109" end="00:37:47.190" style="s2">emotion from the narrative and that this</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.609" end="00:37:48.960" style="s2">is true of you too like when something</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.190" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">is seems exciting or seems attractive</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.960" end="00:37:54.359" style="s2">seems to be true what is it what is it</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:57.270" style="s2">pulling out of you emotionally not the</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.359" end="00:37:59.069" style="s2">story emotionally because a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.270" end="00:38:01.829" style="s2">manipulation a lot of the narrative</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.069" end="00:38:05.040" style="s2">manipulation that we see it has to do</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.829" end="00:38:05.940" style="s2">with figuring out which of many stories</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.040" end="00:38:09.450" style="s2">are</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.940" end="00:38:11.339" style="s2">best able to trigger and capture these</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.450" end="00:38:13.020" style="s2">emotions which most of us aren&#39;t is</p>
<p begin="00:38:11.339" end="00:38:18.300" style="s2">aware of which are sometimes very</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.020" end="00:38:20.819" style="s2">powerful fear dread lust resentment</p>

<p begin="00:38:25.589" end="00:38:30.420" style="s2">narrative oh I&#39;ve got it you know and I</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.079" end="00:38:33.300" style="s2">learned this listening to a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.420" end="00:38:35.700" style="s2">right-wing radio back in the day you</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.300" end="00:38:37.170" style="s2">know be you know be kind of before well</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.700" end="00:38:38.970" style="s2">I mean you know it&#39;s still continues on</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.170" end="00:38:40.950" style="s2">and it&#39;s glorious but this was like you</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.970" end="00:38:43.470" style="s2">know 20 30 years ago when it was really</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.950" end="00:38:45.210" style="s2">just sort of bubbling up and it was</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.470" end="00:38:48.210" style="s2">always so interesting because you could</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.210" end="00:38:51.750" style="s2">just hear the way the host was sort of</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.210" end="00:38:53.460" style="s2">like retelling a story about like</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.750" end="00:38:54.630" style="s2">immigrants okay all the immigrants they</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.460" end="00:38:56.790" style="s2">come in here and got it</p>

<p begin="00:38:56.790" end="00:39:02.430" style="s2">these calls God God these people are</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.369" end="00:39:04.500" style="s2">they&#39;re done and you realize that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.430" end="00:39:07.230" style="s2">not actually about the language or the</p>

<p begin="00:41:30.060" end="00:41:34.619" style="s2">people and all that self reinforcing</p>
<p begin="00:41:31.730" end="00:41:37.220" style="s2">kind of counter-narrative ready to</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.619" end="00:41:39.690" style="s2">absorb you and if you want to stay</p>

<p begin="00:41:48.420" end="00:41:53.099" style="s2">realms that aren&#39;t we&#39;re not we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.609" end="00:41:56.190" style="s2">really have a good guide for then it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.099" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">really important to be aware and process</p>
<p begin="00:41:56.190" end="00:42:00.869" style="s2">that spiritual emotional level and</p>
<p begin="00:41:58.880" end="00:42:03.450" style="s2">recognize what&#39;s going on in other</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.869" end="00:42:05.190" style="s2">people because it&#39;s sort of like the</p>

<p begin="00:42:05.190" end="00:42:12.330" style="s2">necessarily look like we can keep alert</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.609" end="00:42:14.010" style="s2">to what&#39;s going on and do the work yeah</p>
<p begin="00:42:12.330" end="00:42:16.200" style="s2">just that just a file to keep on that</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.010" end="00:42:21.420" style="s2">keep alert to what&#39;s going on but that</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.200" end="00:42:23.220" style="s2">your own emotions are not secondary to</p>
<p begin="00:42:21.420" end="00:42:26.160" style="s2">that process and indeed we&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.220" end="00:42:28.380" style="s2">asked to become more clear about our own</p>
<p begin="00:42:26.160" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">emotional processing because that&#39;s part</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.380" end="00:42:31.890" style="s2">of both the way we get captured and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:32.940" style="s2">also part of the way that we step</p>
