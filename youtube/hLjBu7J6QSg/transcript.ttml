<p begin="00:00:04.319" end="00:00:09.040" style="s2">times before but maybe</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.759" end="00:00:11.040" style="s2">not on here i joined this facebook group</p>
<p begin="00:00:09.040" end="00:00:11.599" style="s2">that talks about climate change being</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.040" end="00:00:14.240" style="s2">limbic</p>
<p begin="00:00:11.599" end="00:00:15.599" style="s2">problems the limbic system in our brain</p>
<p begin="00:00:14.240" end="00:00:18.080" style="s2">and when i read</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.599" end="00:00:19.920" style="s2">what the limbic system does i know it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.080" end="00:00:20.800" style="s2">a lot of the issues i have a problem</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.920" end="00:00:24.000" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.800" end="00:00:26.480" style="s2">i have a neurodiverse brain i&#39;ve had a</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.000" end="00:00:28.880" style="s2">d and known about it most of my life and</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.480" end="00:00:30.480" style="s2">i have autism but only discovered that i</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.880" end="00:00:31.760" style="s2">had that even though i had it my whole</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.480" end="00:00:33.280" style="s2">life i only discovered that i had it a</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.760" end="00:00:36.800" style="s2">couple years ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.280" end="00:00:39.680" style="s2">and then i also had brain surgery</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.800" end="00:00:40.559" style="s2">and radiation on my brain which together</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.680" end="00:00:43.840" style="s2">resulted</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.559" end="00:00:46.160" style="s2">in a mild tbi with my brains falling</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.840" end="00:00:49.280" style="s2">after my first surgery and the radiation</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.160" end="00:00:49.680" style="s2">and all of the changes um i just anyway</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.280" end="00:00:52.640" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.680" end="00:00:54.559" style="s2">in the facebook group the main guy who</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.640" end="00:00:56.160" style="s2">is a neuroscientist</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.559" end="00:00:57.680" style="s2">posted he posts a lot of stuff that</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.160" end="00:01:00.239" style="s2">triggers me because he</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.680" end="00:01:01.680" style="s2">even just the fact that and it&#39;s not him</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.239" end="00:01:02.640" style="s2">who calls himself an act like he calls</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.680" end="00:01:03.840" style="s2">himself an expert because he&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.640" end="00:01:06.159" style="s2">neuroscientist i think</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.840" end="00:01:07.040" style="s2">most people in the world would agree</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.159" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.040" end="00:01:12.000" style="s2">but i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think you can be an</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.000" end="00:01:14.720" style="s2">expert in something without experiencing</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.000" end="00:01:15.680" style="s2">it and you only have one brain to</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.720" end="00:01:17.200" style="s2">experience</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.680" end="00:01:18.479" style="s2">and the issue with being an expert in</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.200" end="00:01:20.240" style="s2">the brain and thinking you have the</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.479" end="00:01:21.280" style="s2">answers and yet only having access to</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.240" end="00:01:23.600" style="s2">one brain</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.280" end="00:01:25.119" style="s2">is it&#39;s the definite place where experts</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.600" end="00:01:25.600" style="s2">end up hurting you instead of helping</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.119" end="00:01:27.280" style="s2">you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.600" end="00:01:29.680" style="s2">because they think they&#39;re the expert</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.280" end="00:01:31.439" style="s2">okay but he posted this 20 minute video</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.680" end="00:01:32.720" style="s2">linked it in the description which i</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.439" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">actually found was very powerful and i</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.720" end="00:01:37.920" style="s2">don&#39;t know who the doctor is in it</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:39.759" style="s2">um but the doctor is very thorough and</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.920" end="00:01:40.720" style="s2">he&#39;s exactly the kind of specialist you</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.759" end="00:01:42.799" style="s2">would want to see</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.720" end="00:01:43.759" style="s2">for a mild tbi which he talks in there</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.799" end="00:01:45.600" style="s2">is is um</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.759" end="00:01:47.200" style="s2">one of the most devastating things that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.600" end="00:01:48.560" style="s2">someone can have and a lot of times they</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.200" end="00:01:50.240" style="s2">go undiagnosed</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.560" end="00:01:51.920" style="s2">because we don&#39;t know their brains have</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.240" end="00:01:53.680" style="s2">been injured we&#39;ve gotten hit we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.920" end="00:01:55.280" style="s2">gotten in a fight we&#39;ve got we&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.680" end="00:01:58.479" style="s2">in a minor accident</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.280" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">and um traumatic brain injuries are</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.479" end="00:02:04.320" style="s2">they change your brain even mild ones</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:05.040" style="s2">and so talking to this this guy who he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.320" end="00:02:06.640" style="s2">he&#39;s doing</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.040" end="00:02:08.000" style="s2">the brains kind of they have a colorful</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.640" end="00:02:10.640" style="s2">brain scan i don&#39;t know what they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.000" end="00:02:12.400" style="s2">called but i&#39;ve had dozens of mris</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.640" end="00:02:13.920" style="s2">and they&#39;ve never given me a colorful</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.400" end="00:02:17.040" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.920" end="00:02:18.160" style="s2">um which is he also talks about how in</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.040" end="00:02:21.760" style="s2">our medical system</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.160" end="00:02:24.239" style="s2">we have divorced the brain and the mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.760" end="00:02:26.160" style="s2">with neuroscientists taking over the</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.239" end="00:02:28.720" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.160" end="00:02:29.840" style="s2">and psychiatrists taking over the mind</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.720" end="00:02:31.599" style="s2">and this is part of the problem</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.840" end="00:02:33.840" style="s2">i&#39;ve had in the medical system is it</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.599" end="00:02:35.360" style="s2">somewhat like experts in software and</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.840" end="00:02:37.040" style="s2">experts in hardware when you go to the</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.360" end="00:02:37.920" style="s2">experts in hardware they blame it on the</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.040" end="00:02:39.599" style="s2">software</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.920" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">they blame it they&#39;re like yes this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.599" end="00:02:41.519" style="s2">the part that&#39;s my hardware and you need</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.080" style="s2">to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.519" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">steps x y and z and if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.080" end="00:02:46.720" style="s2">working it&#39;s because it&#39;s the other the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:49.440" style="s2">other system</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.720" end="00:02:50.560" style="s2">and so each expert both tells you to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.440" end="00:02:52.959" style="s2">things that will</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.560" end="00:02:54.800" style="s2">help that part the mind or the brain</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.959" end="00:02:55.760" style="s2">without ever taking into consideration</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.800" end="00:02:57.280" style="s2">the other piece</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.760" end="00:02:59.920" style="s2">and you&#39;re made to feel wrong about it</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.280" end="00:03:01.120" style="s2">constantly if it&#39;s not working for you</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.920" end="00:03:02.560" style="s2">you&#39;re the problem right if you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.120" end="00:03:03.680" style="s2">change your thoughts you&#39;re the problem</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.560" end="00:03:05.440" style="s2">if your brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.680" end="00:03:07.440" style="s2">if your brain is having issues but we</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.440" end="00:03:09.920" style="s2">can&#39;t see it physically on a scan</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.440" end="00:03:11.280" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem and that&#39;s also even</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.920" end="00:03:14.159" style="s2">just looking at the brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.280" end="00:03:14.800" style="s2">these colorful mri images are your brain</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.159" end="00:03:17.200" style="s2">in your mind</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.800" end="00:03:18.560" style="s2">it&#39;s your brain working as a mind it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.200" end="00:03:20.879" style="s2">you thinking it&#39;s lighting up the</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.560" end="00:03:22.480" style="s2">different areas based on emotion</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.879" end="00:03:23.760" style="s2">based on activity based on all these</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.480" end="00:03:24.400" style="s2">things you can see if your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.760" end="00:03:25.760" style="s2">healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.400" end="00:03:28.640" style="s2">if you&#39;re what your brain looks like</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.760" end="00:03:32.560" style="s2">compared to other people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.640" end="00:03:34.000" style="s2">um i wish everyone had access to a</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.560" end="00:03:36.159" style="s2">doctor like this</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.000" end="00:03:38.080" style="s2">and at the same time i know nobody does</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.159" end="00:03:39.599" style="s2">and so going asking people to go to</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.080" end="00:03:41.040" style="s2">experts when they&#39;re never going to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.599" end="00:03:43.519" style="s2">this kind of treatment</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.040" end="00:03:45.519" style="s2">um and even with this treatment i</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.519" end="00:03:46.959" style="s2">imagine this doctor is a very expensive</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.519" end="00:03:49.599" style="s2">doctor to go and see</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.959" end="00:03:50.959" style="s2">plus the things that he says fish oil i</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.599" end="00:03:52.640" style="s2">try to take the soil but it&#39;s hard to</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.959" end="00:03:54.239" style="s2">remember to take it</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.640" end="00:03:56.319" style="s2">and it&#39;s like okay put a thing in your</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.239" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">phone right then i&#39;m going to ignore it</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.319" end="00:04:00.560" style="s2">it&#39;s like in order to be able to repair</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:01.599" style="s2">your brain you have to be able to repair</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.560" end="00:04:03.599" style="s2">your brain</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.599" end="00:04:05.680" style="s2">and that&#39;s that&#39;s part of it but i know</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.599" end="00:04:06.799" style="s2">for me if my biggest priority was taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.680" end="00:04:09.360" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.799" end="00:04:10.400" style="s2">fish oil i would manage to do it so that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.360" end="00:04:11.200" style="s2">is going to become one of my biggest</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.400" end="00:04:13.200" style="s2">priorities</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.200" end="00:04:14.560" style="s2">i also talked about keeping a journal</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.200" end="00:04:16.239" style="s2">which i find helpful</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.560" end="00:04:17.919" style="s2">just kind of saying what what has</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.239" end="00:04:18.400" style="s2">happened that day whether you felt</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.919" end="00:04:20.160" style="s2">yourself</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.400" end="00:04:22.320" style="s2">positive negative but he does talk about</p>
<p begin="00:04:20.160" end="00:04:24.240" style="s2">having a list of everything that you</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.320" end="00:04:25.440" style="s2">you want out of life like out of your</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.240" end="00:04:26.080" style="s2">which i&#39;m kind of doing in a six week</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.440" end="00:04:28.560" style="s2">course</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.080" end="00:04:30.400" style="s2">but we&#39;ll be doing it together but</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.560" end="00:04:33.840" style="s2">there&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.400" end="00:04:35.600" style="s2">like to ask are my actions helping with</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.840" end="00:04:38.400" style="s2">that every day</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.600" end="00:04:39.919" style="s2">no but i can&#39;t do the actions that help</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.400" end="00:04:42.960" style="s2">with it like so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.919" end="00:04:45.040" style="s2">really helping it&#39;s like okay if taking</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.960" end="00:04:46.400" style="s2">the fish oil is going to help but you</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.040" end="00:04:47.440" style="s2">can&#39;t remember to take the fish oil</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.400" end="00:04:50.160" style="s2">that&#39;s a problem and then</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.440" end="00:04:51.759" style="s2">some of the other things he suggested um</p>

<p begin="00:05:27.840" end="00:05:31.280" style="s2">if my brain was healthier i&#39;d be able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.759" end="00:05:31.919" style="s2">do the things to keep it healthy and so</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.280" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.919" end="00:05:35.840" style="s2">part of my frustration is this</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.800" end="00:05:41.440" style="s2">focus on healing your brain instead of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.680" end="00:05:44.560" style="s2">focus on accepting your brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.440" end="00:05:45.199" style="s2">because anyone can kind of accept their</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.560" end="00:05:46.720" style="s2">brain</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.199" end="00:05:49.039" style="s2">not everyone can heal their brain can</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.720" end="00:05:51.120" style="s2">your brain heal yes brains can heal</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.039" end="00:05:52.080" style="s2">but not everyone&#39;s can heal not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.120" end="00:05:54.320" style="s2">can heal to the same</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.080" end="00:05:56.319" style="s2">degree so even if a hundred people get</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.320" end="00:05:57.840" style="s2">this exact same traumatic brain injury</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.319" end="00:05:58.720" style="s2">and they all go through the exact same</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.840" end="00:06:01.280" style="s2">program</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.720" end="00:06:02.560" style="s2">not all of them are gonna heal and so to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.280" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">say okay well someone else had your</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.560" end="00:06:05.600" style="s2">brain injury and they healed doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:06.880" style="s2">mean you&#39;re going to and yet belief in</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.600" end="00:06:08.880" style="s2">the healing system</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.880" end="00:06:10.319" style="s2">helps it work and when you&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.880" end="00:06:11.919" style="s2">through enough treatments that haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.319" end="00:06:12.880" style="s2">worked you have less and less belief in</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:14.720" style="s2">the new ones for me</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.880" end="00:06:16.800" style="s2">i know i&#39;m like unless it&#39;s free unless</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.720" end="00:06:18.479" style="s2">it&#39;s guaranteed i&#39;m not doing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:16.800" end="00:06:20.800" style="s2">but watching this i was he does have</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.479" end="00:06:23.280" style="s2">some techniques some thought techniques</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.800" end="00:06:25.120" style="s2">that were um like the negative thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.280" end="00:06:28.319" style="s2">in your head is this true</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.120" end="00:06:29.520" style="s2">am i 100 certain this is true how do i</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.319" end="00:06:30.800" style="s2">feel about it being true and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.520" end="00:06:32.400" style="s2">powerful things he talks about is</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.800" end="00:06:34.720" style="s2">flipping it around</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.400" end="00:06:36.400" style="s2">and not just there was three ways to</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.720" end="00:06:38.479" style="s2">flip it around the guys</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.400" end="00:06:39.440" style="s2">um and i&#39;m not remember what the three</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.479" end="00:06:42.479" style="s2">are just tell</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.440" end="00:06:46.160" style="s2">but they&#39;re flipping around completely</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.479" end="00:06:48.720" style="s2">so like i&#39;m stupid could be unsmart</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.160" end="00:06:50.479" style="s2">um but then sometimes it&#39;s it&#39;s flipping</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.720" end="00:06:52.400" style="s2">it so i think you&#39;re stupid</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.479" end="00:06:54.160" style="s2">might be the negative thought in my head</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.400" end="00:06:55.680" style="s2">that&#39;s causing me negative emotion so i</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.160" end="00:06:56.880" style="s2">can flip it around to say i&#39;m stupid i</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.680" end="00:06:58.800" style="s2">can flip it around to say</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.880" end="00:07:00.880" style="s2">you&#39;re smart and i can flip it around to</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.800" end="00:07:04.319" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.880" end="00:07:05.919" style="s2">it&#39;s like my anyway there&#39;s three ways</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.319" end="00:07:07.680" style="s2">to to do the opposite</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.919" end="00:07:10.319" style="s2">it was like say the actual opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.680" end="00:07:12.720" style="s2">the sentence flip it so it&#39;s about you</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.319" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">and um flip it so it&#39;s not about you i</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.720" end="00:07:14.960" style="s2">think this is the third one something</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:16.479" style="s2">like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.960" end="00:07:19.360" style="s2">something like that changing the verb</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.479" end="00:07:23.039" style="s2">something along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.360" end="00:07:26.639" style="s2">but there&#39;s i find frustration because</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.039" end="00:07:28.400" style="s2">i the more i try to heal my brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.639" end="00:07:30.319" style="s2">the worse it becomes and the more i</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.400" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">accept it as it is the more</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.319" end="00:07:33.840" style="s2">it&#39;s helping me create a world that</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:34.479" style="s2">works for everyone so i live in a very</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.840" end="00:07:37.520" style="s2">unique</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.479" end="00:07:39.840" style="s2">position and i am an expert in my brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.520" end="00:07:41.280" style="s2">no one else can be an expert in my brain</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.840" end="00:07:43.199" style="s2">it has been cut open it has been</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.280" end="00:07:44.479" style="s2">radiated it has been has so many</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.199" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">pictures of it</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.479" end="00:07:48.160" style="s2">and yet unless there is an expert like</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:49.840" style="s2">this expert in this video</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.160" end="00:07:51.680" style="s2">and even then i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna come</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.840" end="00:07:53.520" style="s2">to that with all of my baggage</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.680" end="00:07:54.879" style="s2">right and it&#39;s like to think that you</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.520" end="00:07:57.919" style="s2">can go to an expert</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.879" end="00:07:59.039" style="s2">and get this level of treatment he&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.919" end="00:08:01.039" style="s2">in a million</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.039" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">because of what he talks about we have</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.039" end="00:08:04.000" style="s2">have separated</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:05.360" style="s2">the mind and the brain if you go to one</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.000" end="00:08:06.720" style="s2">expert they are not an expert in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.360" end="00:08:08.479" style="s2">other one and they pass everything they</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.720" end="00:08:09.759" style="s2">want to pass off to the other one</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.479" end="00:08:11.039" style="s2">like i said it&#39;s like going to a</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.759" end="00:08:12.240" style="s2">hardware doctor and then blaming</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.039" end="00:08:13.759" style="s2">everything on the software and going to</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.240" end="00:08:15.120" style="s2">a software doctor and blaming everything</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.759" end="00:08:16.960" style="s2">on the hardware</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.120" end="00:08:18.479" style="s2">and making you respond you&#39;re the one to</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.960" end="00:08:19.199" style="s2">pick the software you can change it if</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.479" end="00:08:20.479" style="s2">you wanted</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.199" end="00:08:21.759" style="s2">the hardware doesn&#39;t look like it has a</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.479" end="00:08:23.520" style="s2">problem so it&#39;s got to be the software</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.759" end="00:08:24.800" style="s2">and i&#39;m the hardware person go to them</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.520" end="00:08:26.800" style="s2">and they don&#39;t communicate and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.800" end="00:08:28.400" style="s2">don&#39;t coordinate and then the patient&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.800" end="00:08:30.240" style="s2">supposed to be able to do that go to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.400" end="00:08:32.240" style="s2">psychiatrist to get</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.240" end="00:08:33.519" style="s2">mind help and go to the neurologist to</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.240" end="00:08:34.719" style="s2">get brain help</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.519" end="00:08:37.039" style="s2">and you&#39;re supposed to be able to put</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.719" end="00:08:38.800" style="s2">the two together which is nearly</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.039" end="00:08:40.640" style="s2">impossible for anyone especially someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.800" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">who some brain for issues</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.640" end="00:08:44.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m in this group because it keeps</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:47.839" style="s2">triggering me and i know i&#39;m like yep</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.880" end="00:08:50.399" style="s2">here&#39;s my learning and</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.839" end="00:08:53.279" style="s2">to bring my expertise to it even if they</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.399" end="00:08:55.360" style="s2">don&#39;t see my expertise as expertise</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.279" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">i don&#39;t think you can be an expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.360" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">an animal unless you&#39;ve lived in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:00.399" style="s2">animal&#39;s body</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:02.399" style="s2">you can&#39;t you can never be a frog expert</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.399" end="00:09:04.000" style="s2">a chimpanzee expert an elephant expert</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.399" end="00:09:05.680" style="s2">unless you know how to mind meld and be</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.000" end="00:09:08.800" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.680" end="00:09:10.959" style="s2">because you can dissect it</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.800" end="00:09:11.839" style="s2">you can learn about it you could see its</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.959" end="00:09:15.440" style="s2">behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.839" end="00:09:17.680" style="s2">and and make um inferences about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.440" end="00:09:20.080" style="s2">but you&#39;re never going to be an elephant</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.680" end="00:09:22.399" style="s2">expert or a chimpanzee expert</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.080" end="00:09:23.120" style="s2">or a frog expert and lets you live as</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.399" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">one</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.120" end="00:09:26.480" style="s2">and those things don&#39;t go together</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:27.839" style="s2">similar with brains right they can never</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.480" end="00:09:28.399" style="s2">you can never live in another person&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.839" end="00:09:29.920" style="s2">body</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.399" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">so you can never be an expert in their</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.920" end="00:09:33.200" style="s2">brain but i can tell you having a brain</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:33.839" style="s2">that is different and a brain that has</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.200" end="00:09:35.600" style="s2">changed</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.839" end="00:09:37.760" style="s2">that is one of my superpowers because i</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.600" end="00:09:42.160" style="s2">can see the world in different ways</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.760" end="00:09:44.480" style="s2">i remember before i knew before my tbi</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.160" end="00:09:45.519" style="s2">during my tbi after my first surgery</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.480" end="00:09:47.040" style="s2">when i i</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.519" end="00:09:48.720" style="s2">experienced my brain swelling and was</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.040" end="00:09:51.360" style="s2">acting like a toddler</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.720" end="00:09:52.959" style="s2">and having these tender tantrums of like</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.360" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">there&#39;s too much sound and too much</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.959" end="00:09:56.320" style="s2">light and too much spells</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:57.440" style="s2">and stop it like why can&#39;t you all just</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.320" end="00:09:59.279" style="s2">stop it</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.440" end="00:10:01.360" style="s2">um but not being able to even verbally</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.279" end="00:10:02.959" style="s2">communicate that made me have so much</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.360" end="00:10:04.399" style="s2">more empathy for my child when she was</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.959" end="00:10:05.920" style="s2">going through that stage</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.399" end="00:10:08.079" style="s2">going through that stage of like the</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.920" end="00:10:09.680" style="s2">world&#39;s not working for me and i have no</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.079" end="00:10:12.160" style="s2">power over it</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.680" end="00:10:13.839" style="s2">and i know that the day i go through</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.160" end="00:10:15.680" style="s2">having patients and a brain that works</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.839" end="00:10:17.680" style="s2">in the morning and having less patience</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.680" end="00:10:20.320" style="s2">and being non-verbal and not being able</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.680" end="00:10:23.200" style="s2">to do things in the evening</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.320" end="00:10:24.160" style="s2">helps me have more patience overall and</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.200" end="00:10:27.600" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.160" end="00:10:29.200" style="s2">my belief is that our brain diversity</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.600" end="00:10:31.600" style="s2">is exactly what it&#39;s supposed to be and</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.200" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">the individual can</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.600" end="00:10:34.640" style="s2">seek out to heal their brain but their</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:36.320" style="s2">brain is only going to heal as much as</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.640" end="00:10:37.760" style="s2">it&#39;s supposed to and making them wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.320" end="00:10:39.120" style="s2">for it in any way making them wrong for</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.760" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">accepting their brain making them wrong</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.120" end="00:10:41.680" style="s2">for having</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:43.040" style="s2">a brain injury and making them wrong for</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.680" end="00:10:43.920" style="s2">not being able to heal or not wanting to</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.040" end="00:10:45.519" style="s2">heal</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.920" end="00:10:47.440" style="s2">all of it it&#39;s like we&#39;re exactly who</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.519" end="00:10:49.120" style="s2">we&#39;re supposed to be i know i am</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.440" end="00:10:50.640" style="s2">i can&#39;t imagine what my brain would</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.120" end="00:10:52.480" style="s2">would be what i would be giving the</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.640" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">world if i didn&#39;t have my brain tumors i</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.480" end="00:10:55.360" style="s2">didn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:56.560" style="s2">my neurodiversity that i was born with</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.360" end="00:10:57.680" style="s2">which still could have</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.560" end="00:11:00.480" style="s2">i could have done a lot of what i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.680" end="00:11:03.040" style="s2">doing i don&#39;t know because it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.480" end="00:11:04.240" style="s2">is this different the brain change not</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.040" end="00:11:05.839" style="s2">just being different</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.240" end="00:11:07.600" style="s2">but the actual experience of</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.839" end="00:11:08.160" style="s2">experiencing my neuro diverse brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.600" end="00:11:11.040" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.160" end="00:11:12.880" style="s2">tbi and after and during and all of that</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.040" end="00:11:15.120" style="s2">has given me any experience i&#39;d say</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.880" end="00:11:16.640" style="s2">the one person i might give expertise to</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.120" end="00:11:19.040" style="s2">besides this doctor who does seem to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.640" end="00:11:20.800" style="s2">an expert in both the mind and the brain</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.040" end="00:11:22.640" style="s2">and i would probably hand over some of</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.800" end="00:11:23.920" style="s2">my intellectual sovereignty for him to</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.640" end="00:11:26.160" style="s2">make decisions</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.920" end="00:11:28.079" style="s2">but also with the help of right but i</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.160" end="00:11:29.440" style="s2">can&#39;t do it foreign</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.079" end="00:11:31.200" style="s2">but the other person i don&#39;t remember</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.440" end="00:11:32.880" style="s2">her name which has a ted talk or the</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.200" end="00:11:34.800" style="s2">i think they&#39;re a neurosurgeon or a</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.880" end="00:11:35.600" style="s2">neurologist who goes through having a</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.800" end="00:11:37.440" style="s2">stroke</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.600" end="00:11:38.720" style="s2">and i&#39;m like yep that person i will give</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.440" end="00:11:41.200" style="s2">brain expert</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.720" end="00:11:44.000" style="s2">to because they&#39;ve experienced it but</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.200" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">most people in the medical profession</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.000" end="00:11:47.519" style="s2">they might be neurodiverse they might</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:49.279" style="s2">have autism they might have add but if</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.519" end="00:11:50.880" style="s2">they do they don&#39;t have it harsh because</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.279" end="00:11:52.079" style="s2">they&#39;ve gone through medical school</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.880" end="00:11:53.360" style="s2">they got into university they went</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.079" end="00:11:54.560" style="s2">through medical school they figured out</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.360" end="00:11:56.320" style="s2">how to get over their wall of yogurt</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.560" end="00:11:58.399" style="s2">they figured out how to study how to do</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.320" end="00:12:01.600" style="s2">it with or without adrenaline</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.399" end="00:12:03.920" style="s2">whereas most people who&#39;ve gone through</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.600" end="00:12:05.279" style="s2">having anxiety having depression having</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.920" end="00:12:08.399" style="s2">add having</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.279" end="00:12:09.600" style="s2">autism don&#39;t get into med school</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.399" end="00:12:12.480" style="s2">and if they do they don&#39;t make it</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.600" end="00:12:15.120" style="s2">through and so the ones that we want</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.480" end="00:12:16.959" style="s2">there to be the experts aren&#39;t there</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.120" end="00:12:19.519" style="s2">and so we&#39;re dealing with a bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.959" end="00:12:20.480" style="s2">neurotypical at least not tbi people who</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.519" end="00:12:21.920" style="s2">are like telling people</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.480" end="00:12:23.600" style="s2">tbis how it should be for them because</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.920" end="00:12:25.839" style="s2">they studied in a textbook</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.600" end="00:12:26.880" style="s2">instead of experiencing it so i just</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.839" end="00:12:28.079" style="s2">want to come on here</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.880" end="00:12:30.560" style="s2">suggest watching the video in the</p>
