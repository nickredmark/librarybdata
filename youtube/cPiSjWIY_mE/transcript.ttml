<p begin="00:03:23.120" end="00:03:27.120" style="s2">and it was talking about a similar thing</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.879" end="00:03:28.000" style="s2">where in adhd there&#39;s so many different</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.120" end="00:03:29.840" style="s2">theories</p>

<p begin="00:03:29.840" end="00:03:33.599" style="s2">social aspect to development</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.760" end="00:03:35.760" style="s2">once again not much of it talked to each</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.599" end="00:03:37.760" style="s2">other and one of the authors</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.760" end="00:03:39.920" style="s2">quoted greg and said hey there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.760" end="00:03:41.280" style="s2">interesting guy</p>

<p begin="00:03:51.519" end="00:03:55.280" style="s2">but it&#39;s pretty stunning to see what</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.680" end="00:03:57.040" style="s2">greg has accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.280" end="00:03:59.200" style="s2">he has this sketch on his website where</p>

<p begin="00:06:56.240" end="00:06:59.280" style="s2">sort of is a flashbang tour of the</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:01.919" style="s2">garden</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.280" end="00:07:03.680" style="s2">all right uh so my garden is a my</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.919" end="00:07:06.000" style="s2">religion that&#39;s not a religion</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.680" end="00:07:07.280" style="s2">uh you hear john vervicky and uh jordan</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.000" end="00:07:10.720" style="s2">hall talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.280" end="00:07:14.479" style="s2">and i want to share with you why uh</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.720" end="00:07:16.000" style="s2">i fell into from in the mid 2000s a new</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.479" end="00:07:17.759" style="s2">atheist view</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.000" end="00:07:20.319" style="s2">into what would be sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.759" end="00:07:22.800" style="s2">naturalistic spiritual view</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.319" end="00:07:24.000" style="s2">um and some of my connections in</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.800" end="00:07:25.520" style="s2">relationship to that some of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.000" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">symbolism that&#39;s in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.520" end="00:07:29.440" style="s2">why the hell i created a cartoon out of</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:30.000" style="s2">my theory um certainly my dad wondered</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.440" end="00:07:31.520" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.000" end="00:07:33.280" style="s2">and he&#39;s professor of history what the</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.520" end="00:07:33.680" style="s2">hell are you doing i was like i don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.280" end="00:07:35.919" style="s2">know</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.680" end="00:07:37.599" style="s2">but it&#39;s a calling okay and then i want</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.919" end="00:07:39.919" style="s2">to share with you why that is</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.599" end="00:07:41.120" style="s2">um next week i was thinking i would dive</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.919" end="00:07:44.240" style="s2">into justification</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.120" end="00:07:45.039" style="s2">systems all right uh obviously peter</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.240" end="00:07:47.199" style="s2">lindbergh</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.039" end="00:07:49.520" style="s2">uh shot across uh the culture</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.199" end="00:07:52.000" style="s2">consciousness with culture war 2.0</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.520" end="00:07:52.720" style="s2">um and the explosion of different mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.000" end="00:07:55.280" style="s2">plexus</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.720" end="00:07:57.199" style="s2">and uh i can help frame that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.280" end="00:07:58.720" style="s2">systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.199" end="00:08:00.240" style="s2">and make a connection between human</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.720" end="00:08:02.240" style="s2">consciousness and our</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.240" end="00:08:03.680" style="s2">run around on this planet as persons and</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.240" end="00:08:04.879" style="s2">trying to justify why the hell we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.680" end="00:08:08.319" style="s2">doing what we&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.879" end="00:08:10.240" style="s2">um and what that means for the chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.319" end="00:08:12.160" style="s2">wave of fluctuation that we&#39;re seeing in</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.240" end="00:08:14.319" style="s2">the various paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.160" end="00:08:15.360" style="s2">gi dynamics places the systems of</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.319" end="00:08:17.520" style="s2">justification</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.360" end="00:08:18.639" style="s2">on our investment and influence patterns</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.520" end="00:08:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s what the ii</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.639" end="00:08:21.840" style="s2">stands for so we&#39;re investing and</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.800" end="00:08:24.240" style="s2">influencing</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.840" end="00:08:26.400" style="s2">and justifying and that intersection of</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.240" end="00:08:27.840" style="s2">justification investment and influence</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.400" end="00:08:29.840" style="s2">you want to understand human behavior</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.840" end="00:08:31.840" style="s2">dynamics that&#39;s a pretty good way in my</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.840" end="00:08:35.200" style="s2">opinion to do so</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.840" end="00:08:36.320" style="s2">um and then the third session uh</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.200" end="00:08:38.159" style="s2">i&#39;m going to talk about the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.320" end="00:08:39.120" style="s2">psychology i&#39;m completely obsessed with</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.159" end="00:08:40.240" style="s2">this thing called the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.120" end="00:08:43.360" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.240" end="00:08:45.680" style="s2">uh and uh following my good friend zach</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.360" end="00:08:46.240" style="s2">stein in his brilliant four-part series</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.680" end="00:08:48.720" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.240" end="00:08:49.920" style="s2">learned a lot about the tripartite view</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.720" end="00:08:52.480" style="s2">of skill development</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.920" end="00:08:54.399" style="s2">uh insolvent and transcendence which i</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.480" end="00:08:56.160" style="s2">think provides a brilliant humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.399" end="00:08:56.800" style="s2">educational frame of reference for how</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.160" end="00:08:58.880" style="s2">we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.800" end="00:09:00.480" style="s2">cultivate ourselves in this time between</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.880" end="00:09:02.640" style="s2">worlds um</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.480" end="00:09:04.560" style="s2">i i want to riff off to some of that and</p>
<p begin="00:09:02.640" end="00:09:08.399" style="s2">then offer my version of reality</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.560" end="00:09:10.080" style="s2">in relation and uh my location is really</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.399" end="00:09:11.760" style="s2">and zach nailed us in his uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.080" end="00:09:14.080" style="s2">actually i think he was responding to</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.760" end="00:09:16.480" style="s2">anjen uh nailed in his response and said</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.080" end="00:09:19.440" style="s2">hey greg&#39;s working in the science domain</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.480" end="00:09:20.800" style="s2">okay and academia um which yeah i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.440" end="00:09:24.640" style="s2">been banging my head up again</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.800" end="00:09:28.000" style="s2">again see academy now for 20 years um</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.640" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">so uh the i i look forward to dialoguing</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.000" end="00:09:31.040" style="s2">about that</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:32.640" style="s2">and then finally we&#39;ll see where</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.040" end="00:09:33.920" style="s2">questions are i can come in and riff on</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.640" end="00:09:36.560" style="s2">the last session</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.920" end="00:09:37.279" style="s2">uh i also have some ideas for meta psych</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.560" end="00:09:40.399" style="s2">tech</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.279" end="00:09:43.519" style="s2">um so jordan hall john verbaki uh</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.399" end="00:09:45.120" style="s2">got together and you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.519" end="00:09:46.640" style="s2">uh john was talking about the psycho</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.120" end="00:09:49.279" style="s2">technologies that we need and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.640" end="00:09:50.399" style="s2">jordan was talking about coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.279" end="00:09:52.399" style="s2">it was like hey man we need a</p>
<p begin="00:09:50.399" end="00:09:54.399" style="s2">metapsychology tech</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.399" end="00:09:55.920" style="s2">uh system it&#39;s like well you know for</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.399" end="00:09:56.959" style="s2">last 20 years in many ways that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.920" end="00:10:00.320" style="s2">essentially what</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.959" end="00:10:01.760" style="s2">my journey has uh uh pushed me into</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.320" end="00:10:03.040" style="s2">and as a function of that i can talk to</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.760" end="00:10:04.880" style="s2">you about how i&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.040" end="00:10:06.880" style="s2">metapsych tech in general</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.880" end="00:10:08.800" style="s2">and at the same time you know if we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.880" end="00:10:11.920" style="s2">hit on a lot of conversations</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.800" end="00:10:12.480" style="s2">um uh then we can just riff and jam and</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.920" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.480" end="00:10:16.839" style="s2">good with that so that&#39;s the basic game</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:20.720" style="s2">plan of the month</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.839" end="00:10:22.160" style="s2">um you know this is a 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.720" end="00:10:23.839" style="s2">vision of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.160" end="00:10:25.519" style="s2">i&#39;m not going to be talking an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.839" end="00:10:27.760" style="s2">amount about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.519" end="00:10:29.600" style="s2">uh you know there&#39;s a whole this now in</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.760" end="00:10:31.839" style="s2">the last 10 years 20 years</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.600" end="00:10:33.120" style="s2">been an academic enterprise to try to</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.839" end="00:10:35.040" style="s2">delineate</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:36.160" style="s2">what is wisdom where does it come from</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.040" end="00:10:39.360" style="s2">what are its elements</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.160" end="00:10:41.200" style="s2">um i&#39;m basically i&#39;m going to offer you</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.360" end="00:10:43.120" style="s2">a quick frame of reference on wisdom i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.200" end="00:10:46.399" style="s2">happy to talk about wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.120" end="00:10:47.839" style="s2">for me the short summary of wisdom</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.399" end="00:10:49.680" style="s2">is the cultivation of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.839" end="00:10:50.320" style="s2">practices that lead to value states of</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.680" end="00:10:53.519" style="s2">being</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.320" end="00:10:54.640" style="s2">okay um so fundamentally that&#39;s uh what</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.519" end="00:10:56.240" style="s2">i am after</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.640" end="00:10:57.760" style="s2">and so our question is given the current</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.240" end="00:11:00.320" style="s2">state of affairs that we find ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.760" end="00:11:01.040" style="s2">in what are the sense making knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.320" end="00:11:03.600" style="s2">systems</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.040" end="00:11:04.800" style="s2">uh and the cultivation practices that</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.600" end="00:11:06.640" style="s2">lead to what we</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.800" end="00:11:09.200" style="s2">can reflect on and of course be open to</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.640" end="00:11:12.320" style="s2">changing uh to be our valued</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.200" end="00:11:13.360" style="s2">states of being so that&#39;s fundamentally</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.320" end="00:11:15.680" style="s2">what this is about</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.360" end="00:11:16.480" style="s2">is about sharing with you my uh</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.680" end="00:11:19.279" style="s2">sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.480" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">uh if we get into practices uh what i</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.279" end="00:11:23.279" style="s2">use as a psychotherapist</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:24.800" style="s2">as a neurotic son of a you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.279" end="00:11:27.440" style="s2">all that to help</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.800" end="00:11:28.800" style="s2">uh cultivate a sense of being in this</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.440" end="00:11:31.360" style="s2">world that has purpose</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.800" end="00:11:32.079" style="s2">uh matters uh seems to add some</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.360" end="00:11:35.519" style="s2">well-being</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.079" end="00:11:38.079" style="s2">uh to self and others so</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.519" end="00:11:38.880" style="s2">um i wanna start off a little bit to</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.079" end="00:11:42.000" style="s2">help folks</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.880" end="00:11:43.519" style="s2">uh my system uh this thing i want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.000" end="00:11:45.760" style="s2">offer you some thoughts on groking this</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.519" end="00:11:47.920" style="s2">thing at least to enter into it because</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.760" end="00:11:51.040" style="s2">a lot of people will experience my</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.920" end="00:11:52.720" style="s2">system as a bit of a maze or a cathedral</p>
<p begin="00:11:51.040" end="00:11:54.720" style="s2">it&#39;s got a lot of twists and turns it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.720" end="00:11:56.240" style="s2">got a lot of references</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.720" end="00:11:58.480" style="s2">embedded in it so i want to at least</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.240" end="00:12:01.360" style="s2">start off and try to open up</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.480" end="00:12:01.680" style="s2">a frame of reference to this big system</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.360" end="00:12:03.519" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.680" end="00:12:05.040" style="s2">unified theory of knowledge so we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.519" end="00:12:05.760" style="s2">have some ideas about growth in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.040" end="00:12:07.680" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.760" end="00:12:10.720" style="s2">and then that means we have to say what</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.680" end="00:12:14.079" style="s2">exactly is this system</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.720" end="00:12:16.720" style="s2">um so it&#39;s the overarching term uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.079" end="00:12:18.639" style="s2">for this uh you know kind of behemoth</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.720" end="00:12:21.680" style="s2">network a cathedral of ideas</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.639" end="00:12:24.240" style="s2">is the unified theory of knowledge uh to</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.680" end="00:12:27.120" style="s2">grok the you talk it&#39;s helpful to start</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.240" end="00:12:27.760" style="s2">thinking of it as a unified theory of</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.120" end="00:12:31.200" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.760" end="00:12:33.600" style="s2">tree of knowledge system okay</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.200" end="00:12:36.560" style="s2">and the word tree has got to play on</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.600" end="00:12:38.720" style="s2">several different meanings</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.560" end="00:12:39.760" style="s2">so the first meeting is this this</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.720" end="00:12:43.040" style="s2">cartoon</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.760" end="00:12:44.480" style="s2">uh depiction of a tree uh</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.040" end="00:12:47.040" style="s2">that can be thought of as the unified</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.480" end="00:12:49.279" style="s2">theory of knowledge tree</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.040" end="00:12:51.120" style="s2">um it can also be thought of as the me a</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.279" end="00:12:53.920" style="s2">tua tok tree which me</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.120" end="00:12:55.760" style="s2">stands for metaphysical empirical and</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.920" end="00:12:56.959" style="s2">yes this is a yin yang symbol with</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.760" end="00:12:58.959" style="s2">little knees around it</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.959" end="00:13:00.000" style="s2">it also spells out meme if you pay</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.959" end="00:13:04.560" style="s2">attention to it</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.000" end="00:13:07.279" style="s2">me i mean there&#39;s a unified theory</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.560" end="00:13:08.959" style="s2">a unified approach and a theory of</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.279" end="00:13:10.720" style="s2">knowledge embedded</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.959" end="00:13:12.880" style="s2">in the structures the unified theory of</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.720" end="00:13:14.079" style="s2">psychology a unified approach to</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.880" end="00:13:15.920" style="s2">psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.079" end="00:13:17.600" style="s2">one of which is a pure reason the other</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.920" end="00:13:19.519" style="s2">is a practical reason that merges</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.600" end="00:13:22.959" style="s2">philosophy and psychology together</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.519" end="00:13:25.519" style="s2">into a new theory of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.959" end="00:13:27.040" style="s2">um on the unified theory of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.519" end="00:13:29.120" style="s2">tree are eight branches and this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.040" end="00:13:31.279" style="s2">where it gets kind of confusing</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.120" end="00:13:32.399" style="s2">the tree of knowledge system represents</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.279" end="00:13:36.240" style="s2">the first branch</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.399" end="00:13:37.920" style="s2">on the unified theory of knowledge tree</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.240" end="00:13:39.680" style="s2">uh to understand that is understand my</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.920" end="00:13:41.760" style="s2">history uh this was actually even</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.680" end="00:13:42.959" style="s2">discussed a little bit it was in 1997</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.760" end="00:13:45.600" style="s2">that actually the four</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.959" end="00:13:48.000" style="s2">cones uh you know i just fired it up one</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.600" end="00:13:50.000" style="s2">day and four cones fell out of my head</p>
<p begin="00:13:48.000" end="00:13:52.240" style="s2">and my life hasn&#39;t been the same ever</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.000" end="00:13:54.160" style="s2">since back in 1997</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.240" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">so for four years i worked on and really</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.160" end="00:13:57.120" style="s2">elaborated and then ultimately published</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:13:59.120" style="s2">in 2003 that</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.120" end="00:14:00.639" style="s2">the tree of knowledge system at that</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.120" end="00:14:03.440" style="s2">time i&#39;m really</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.639" end="00:14:04.800" style="s2">basically trying to essentially grok</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.440" end="00:14:06.639" style="s2">natural science</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.800" end="00:14:08.639" style="s2">and do so in a way that allows me to</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.639" end="00:14:09.839" style="s2">make sense of the science of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.639" end="00:14:12.959" style="s2">that&#39;s my first</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.839" end="00:14:14.000" style="s2">um sort of uh vision not a small task by</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.959" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">any set</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.000" end="00:14:18.320" style="s2">but this view of of knowledge and cosmic</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:20.880" style="s2">evolution allows me</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.320" end="00:14:22.160" style="s2">a new way to sort the variables uh and</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.880" end="00:14:24.639" style="s2">extract meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.160" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">um but it&#39;s awesome and ultimately what</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.639" end="00:14:28.639" style="s2">i would now call sort of as</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:29.199" style="s2">modern empirical natural science meaning</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.639" end="00:14:30.399" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.199" end="00:14:32.399" style="s2">if those of you familiar with big</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.399" end="00:14:33.040" style="s2">history it&#39;s essentially a map of big</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.399" end="00:14:34.800" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.040" end="00:14:36.320" style="s2">in a way that solves the problem of</p>
<p begin="00:14:34.800" end="00:14:38.160" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.320" end="00:14:40.000" style="s2">and i now recently refer to this as</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.160" end="00:14:44.320" style="s2">men&#39;s knowledge that&#39;s modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.000" end="00:14:47.120" style="s2">empirical natural scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.320" end="00:14:48.480" style="s2">uh that started in 1997 however from</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.120" end="00:14:50.880" style="s2">1997</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.480" end="00:14:52.240" style="s2">really it launched a different kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.880" end="00:14:54.399" style="s2">frame of reference that i&#39;ll be sharing</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.240" end="00:14:56.399" style="s2">with you in relationship to the garden</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.399" end="00:14:59.360" style="s2">okay the unified theory of knowledge is</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.399" end="00:15:01.279" style="s2">a wisdom-oriented philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.360" end="00:15:03.519" style="s2">to ground men so we need to move from</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.279" end="00:15:06.880" style="s2">men&#39;s knowledge to women&#39;s knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.519" end="00:15:08.720" style="s2">okay in the 21st century uh and</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.880" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">my wife appreciates that and has been</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.720" end="00:15:13.519" style="s2">telling me that for a long time</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.480" end="00:15:15.279" style="s2">um so it is a transition</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.519" end="00:15:16.639" style="s2">uh from a scientific theory for the</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.279" end="00:15:18.600" style="s2">science of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.639" end="00:15:19.839" style="s2">into a scientific humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.600" end="00:15:21.920" style="s2">wisdom-oriented</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.839" end="00:15:23.120" style="s2">uh frame of reference that&#39;s grounded in</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.920" end="00:15:25.600" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.120" end="00:15:27.120" style="s2">but it&#39;s also grounded in science in a</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.600" end="00:15:29.120" style="s2">way that reaches out</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.120" end="00:15:31.040" style="s2">to our other systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.120" end="00:15:33.839" style="s2">scientific systems of justification</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.040" end="00:15:34.959" style="s2">are grounded in logos logic analysis and</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.839" end="00:15:38.000" style="s2">attempting to get at</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.959" end="00:15:40.240" style="s2">objectivity okay um but there are a lot</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.000" end="00:15:42.160" style="s2">of other ways of being in the world ways</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.240" end="00:15:42.880" style="s2">that are grounded in our humanistic</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.160" end="00:15:45.680" style="s2">essence</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.880" end="00:15:46.639" style="s2">uh that and have ethos and morality and</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.680" end="00:15:50.160" style="s2">mythos</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.639" end="00:15:51.680" style="s2">okay um so it&#39;s to rock the system you</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.160" end="00:15:53.680" style="s2">want to understand the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.680" end="00:15:55.759" style="s2">system is in dialectical tension</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.680" end="00:15:58.000" style="s2">with this metaphysical empirical theory</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.759" end="00:16:00.079" style="s2">of knowledge as a whole</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.000" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">and there are pure reason and practical</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.079" end="00:16:04.079" style="s2">reason elements that are embedded in it</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.959" end="00:16:09.120" style="s2">it&#39;s also the case that i want to make a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.440" end="00:16:10.079" style="s2">acknowledgement here that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.120" end="00:16:12.480" style="s2">connection</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.079" end="00:16:13.759" style="s2">uh between this version of reality and</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.480" end="00:16:16.079" style="s2">the bible of course</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.759" end="00:16:16.959" style="s2">you can&#39;t help but know it&#39;s a tree of</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.079" end="00:16:19.440" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.959" end="00:16:20.480" style="s2">system if you know any sunday school um</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.440" end="00:16:21.920" style="s2">and uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.480" end="00:16:24.000" style="s2">obviously then you have a tree in a</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.920" end="00:16:26.399" style="s2">garden um</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.000" end="00:16:27.759" style="s2">and i&#39;ll just also make a tie-in uh so</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.399" end="00:16:30.160" style="s2">here&#39;s jordan peterson</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.759" end="00:16:30.959" style="s2">uh who i really uh appreciate his bible</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.160" end="00:16:33.600" style="s2">series</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.959" end="00:16:34.000" style="s2">uh he opens up his bible series talking</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.600" end="00:16:37.519" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.000" end="00:16:38.079" style="s2">genesis okay and notes a very powerful</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.519" end="00:16:39.920" style="s2">fact</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.079" end="00:16:42.079" style="s2">uh that the christian interpretation of</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.920" end="00:16:44.880" style="s2">genesis has this part of john</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.079" end="00:16:45.279" style="s2">uh in the beginning there was the word</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.880" end="00:16:47.120" style="s2">uh</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.279" end="00:16:48.800" style="s2">and george peterson offers i think a</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.120" end="00:16:52.639" style="s2">brilliant analysis</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.800" end="00:16:54.639" style="s2">of genesis uh the fall uh the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.639" end="00:16:56.639" style="s2">self-consciousness and what it speaks to</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.639" end="00:16:59.600" style="s2">us in terms of mythos</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.639" end="00:17:01.360" style="s2">i encourage you to check out that aspect</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.600" end="00:17:05.039" style="s2">of his work</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.360" end="00:17:07.600" style="s2">and it is an aspect that i speak to</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.039" end="00:17:08.559" style="s2">metaphorically in the naming of the tree</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.600" end="00:17:10.640" style="s2">of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.559" end="00:17:12.160" style="s2">uh that is ultimately we need to come to</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.640" end="00:17:12.799" style="s2">a place that we have eaten off the tree</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.160" end="00:17:14.799" style="s2">of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.799" end="00:17:16.640" style="s2">and we need to learn how to healthily</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.799" end="00:17:19.600" style="s2">eat off the tree of knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.640" end="00:17:22.720" style="s2">ultimately do so to cultivate a garden</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.600" end="00:17:24.640" style="s2">for ourselves for our communities for</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.720" end="00:17:27.280" style="s2">our nation-states and for the globe</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.640" end="00:17:29.600" style="s2">ultimately uh in the 21st century and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.280" end="00:17:31.600" style="s2">that is essentially the wisdom task</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.600" end="00:17:32.640" style="s2">uh certainly in the western intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.600" end="00:17:35.200" style="s2">tradition</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.640" end="00:17:36.880" style="s2">that i see us as confronting with and</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.200" end="00:17:40.240" style="s2">ultimately my system</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.880" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">is really about my version of reality as</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.240" end="00:17:43.440" style="s2">to how that might be accomplished</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.080" end="00:17:47.600" style="s2">so what i&#39;m now going to do then is i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.960" end="00:17:50.480" style="s2">going to do</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.600" end="00:17:52.160" style="s2">give you the flash uh and then i&#39;m going</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.480" end="00:17:53.200" style="s2">to stop and then we&#39;ll pause and i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.160" end="00:17:55.039" style="s2">see where questions are</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.200" end="00:17:56.880" style="s2">things like that so um what am i</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.039" end="00:17:58.840" style="s2">basically this next two minutes what i&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.880" end="00:18:00.480" style="s2">like everybody to do is just take a deep</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.840" end="00:18:03.760" style="s2">breath</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.480" end="00:18:06.320" style="s2">get centered okay those of you that know</p>
<p begin="00:18:03.760" end="00:18:07.919" style="s2">uh ken wilbur talk a lot about vision</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.320" end="00:18:10.400" style="s2">logic you know that there are different</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.919" end="00:18:11.679" style="s2">ways of processing information</p>
<p begin="00:18:10.400" end="00:18:13.360" style="s2">we can process information</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.679" end="00:18:14.000" style="s2">linguistically and we can pre-practice</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.360" end="00:18:17.520" style="s2">information through</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.000" end="00:18:18.799" style="s2">perceptual reasoning gestalts</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.520" end="00:18:20.960" style="s2">so what i&#39;m going to do is give you a</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.799" end="00:18:24.000" style="s2">really fast two-minute</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.960" end="00:18:25.360" style="s2">perceptual reasoning gestalt and then we</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.000" end="00:18:28.400" style="s2">can come back and talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.360" end="00:18:31.840" style="s2">uh about the various parts about this</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.400" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">okay so this is my 21st century vision</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.840" end="00:18:43.840" style="s2">of wisdom in two minutes</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.840" end="00:19:25.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.840" end="00:19:39.840" style="s2">so</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.000" end="00:19:50.960" style="s2">alrighty there it is so</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.520" end="00:19:52.320" style="s2">what i&#39;d like to do now is just come</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.960" end="00:19:55.200" style="s2">back i&#39;m going to stop sharing the</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.320" end="00:19:58.720" style="s2">screen for a sec</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.200" end="00:20:02.799" style="s2">and see um uh let&#39;s see</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.720" end="00:20:05.840" style="s2">anjin uh i&#39;ll check in with you</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.799" end="00:20:07.919" style="s2">and see if you have thoughts about</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.840" end="00:20:10.559" style="s2">any questions at this point i&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:20:07.919" end="00:20:13.919" style="s2">take or i can jump back in and then do</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.559" end="00:20:15.360" style="s2">the more detailed analysis of the garden</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.919" end="00:20:17.360" style="s2">it&#39;s the game plan</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.360" end="00:20:18.559" style="s2">but i figured i&#39;d just pause here for a</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.360" end="00:20:21.200" style="s2">second</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.559" end="00:20:23.679" style="s2">and engage and see uh what your thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.200" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">are on jim</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.679" end="00:20:27.360" style="s2">um does anybody have any questions</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.840" end="00:20:38.159" style="s2">okay uh greg if i</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.679" end="00:20:39.760" style="s2">if i could throw my two cents in i think</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.159" end="00:20:41.039" style="s2">when i first approached your work i got</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.760" end="00:20:42.880" style="s2">overwhelmed when i</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.039" end="00:20:44.240" style="s2">came across the garden like it was a lot</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.880" end="00:20:46.720" style="s2">of information for me</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.240" end="00:20:48.400" style="s2">yeah i think what helped me was you had</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.720" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">this story</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.400" end="00:20:51.919" style="s2">of just the t okay like kind of the big</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:54.799" style="s2">history story</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.919" end="00:20:55.440" style="s2">i&#39;m curious if you&#39;d you&#39;d want to start</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.799" end="00:20:57.280" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.440" end="00:20:58.640" style="s2">just focusing on that or that framing if</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.280" end="00:21:01.360" style="s2">that would be of interest to you</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.640" end="00:21:02.559" style="s2">and then kind of expand to that sure</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.360" end="00:21:05.679" style="s2">absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.559" end="00:21:08.000" style="s2">yeah um</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.679" end="00:21:09.600" style="s2">let me go ahead and uh yeah let me i</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.000" end="00:21:12.000" style="s2">have to pull up a</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.600" end="00:21:13.360" style="s2">powerpoint in relationship to that okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.000" end="00:21:15.760" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:21:13.360" end="00:21:16.960" style="s2">but uh that&#39;s that&#39;s definitely to</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.760" end="00:21:18.720" style="s2">organize the</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.960" end="00:21:20.320" style="s2">frame of reference the reason i didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.720" end="00:21:21.840" style="s2">actually start there was because uh</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.320" end="00:21:24.080" style="s2">i was back at the store i don&#39;t know i</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.840" end="00:21:25.760" style="s2">think it was in remember exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.080" end="00:21:28.799" style="s2">the hell it was june or something</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.760" end="00:21:30.159" style="s2">um and i did do a tok on that uh that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.799" end="00:21:31.600" style="s2">was sort of the focus</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.159" end="00:21:33.440" style="s2">but it probably would help to go back</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.600" end="00:21:34.559" style="s2">and just have some frame of reference in</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.440" end="00:21:36.799" style="s2">relationship to that</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.559" end="00:21:39.280" style="s2">uh so let me pull that up and give a</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.799" end="00:21:42.960" style="s2">little frame on that okay</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.280" end="00:21:46.480" style="s2">that&#39;s something reasonable all right</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.960" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">so uh let me find it real fast</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.480" end="00:21:59.840" style="s2">and i&#39;ll be right there</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.200" end="00:22:13.840" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.520" end="00:22:18.880" style="s2">all right let me share screen</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.039" end="00:22:24.240" style="s2">okay so what i&#39;m going to do is i&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:22:22.640" end="00:22:26.880" style="s2">then walk you through just sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.240" end="00:22:29.440" style="s2">basics of the first part of this</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.880" end="00:22:30.480" style="s2">set of ideas the thing that portal that</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.440" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">got me</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.480" end="00:22:34.400" style="s2">involved in it i&#39;ll share my screen</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.559" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">okay okay um</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.159" end="00:22:45.039" style="s2">so the tree of knowledge system all</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:47.200" style="s2">right uh provides a framework</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.039" end="00:22:48.960" style="s2">a novel framework for us to think about</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.200" end="00:22:53.200" style="s2">ways in which we want to map</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.960" end="00:22:55.200" style="s2">both reality okay and our scientific</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.200" end="00:22:56.559" style="s2">knowledge of that reality</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.200" end="00:22:58.640" style="s2">that&#39;s one of the things that is</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.559" end="00:23:00.640" style="s2">important to realize about the system</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.640" end="00:23:02.320" style="s2">uh is because i came to the system i&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.640" end="00:23:04.960" style="s2">psychologist not a physicist</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.320" end="00:23:08.400" style="s2">okay um but what i did then is i sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.960" end="00:23:10.080" style="s2">cracked the code or at least it&#39;s my</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.400" end="00:23:12.000" style="s2">through the process by which humans</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.080" end="00:23:14.000" style="s2">justify okay</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.000" end="00:23:15.600" style="s2">by realizing then uh those of you that</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.000" end="00:23:18.240" style="s2">are familiar with john verveigh&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.600" end="00:23:21.520" style="s2">uh system will know that he divides</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.240" end="00:23:23.840" style="s2">human knowing up into four different ps</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.520" end="00:23:25.679" style="s2">we have a base of procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.840" end="00:23:27.360" style="s2">sort of the the most basic we</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.679" end="00:23:28.559" style="s2">learn habits we learn basic frames of</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.360" end="00:23:30.159" style="s2">reference and then we can engage in</p>
<p begin="00:23:28.559" end="00:23:32.640" style="s2">procedural knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.159" end="00:23:34.960" style="s2">he talks about perspectival knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.640" end="00:23:38.159" style="s2">talks about participatory knowing</p>
<p begin="00:23:34.960" end="00:23:40.640" style="s2">i would argue that we should pre-mates</p>
<p begin="00:23:38.159" end="00:23:41.919" style="s2">okay but we humans also have another</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.640" end="00:23:44.880" style="s2">fourth p</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.919" end="00:23:46.720" style="s2">uh it&#39;s propositional knowing uh that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.880" end="00:23:49.600" style="s2">basically the process by which we</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.720" end="00:23:50.559" style="s2">uh semantically represent uh knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.600" end="00:23:52.159" style="s2">claims</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.559" end="00:23:54.400" style="s2">uh and really what i did is with</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.159" end="00:23:56.880" style="s2">justification systems theory i developed</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.400" end="00:23:58.480" style="s2">a theory of propositional knowing and</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.880" end="00:23:59.600" style="s2">its implication in terms of how it will</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.480" end="00:24:02.400" style="s2">take off</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.600" end="00:24:02.840" style="s2">i did that in 1996 and it was because i</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.400" end="00:24:05.919" style="s2">then</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.840" end="00:24:07.039" style="s2">cleaved the culture person part of us in</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.919" end="00:24:09.200" style="s2">terms of the way</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.039" end="00:24:10.640" style="s2">propositions are organized from the</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.200" end="00:24:12.880" style="s2">primate part of us</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.640" end="00:24:14.799" style="s2">okay which are perspectival procedural</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.880" end="00:24:16.880" style="s2">participatory knowing systems</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.799" end="00:24:19.440" style="s2">it fundamentally then set the stage for</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.880" end="00:24:20.960" style="s2">me to sort of grok the way people know</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.440" end="00:24:22.640" style="s2">and then flip that back on and say well</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.960" end="00:24:24.799" style="s2">if this is the way individuals know</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.640" end="00:24:25.679" style="s2">then what are our justification systems</p>

<p begin="00:26:46.000" end="00:26:51.039" style="s2">hey man you know uh i&#39;ll say this system</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.799" end="00:26:52.880" style="s2">fell out of me in about four seconds</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.039" end="00:26:54.080" style="s2">and it really is just elaborated on its</p>
<p begin="00:26:52.880" end="00:26:55.120" style="s2">sense there&#39;s been very little</p>

<p begin="00:26:58.799" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">thinking the earth is six thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.400" end="00:27:04.159" style="s2">old i mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:04.640" style="s2">evolution is here to stay um and this</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.159" end="00:27:07.279" style="s2">adopt</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.640" end="00:27:08.640" style="s2">the periodic table of the elements uh is</p>

<p begin="00:27:08.640" end="00:27:12.159" style="s2">there are ways to consolidate our</p>

<p begin="00:27:12.159" end="00:27:15.919" style="s2">they were best theories together at</p>
<p begin="00:27:13.919" end="00:27:19.600" style="s2">least that&#39;s what i&#39;m positioning</p>
<p begin="00:27:15.919" end="00:27:22.559" style="s2">uh this so um when i talk about</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.600" end="00:27:24.880" style="s2">antic reality i mean that i&#39;m uh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.559" end="00:27:26.159" style="s2">inside science now science operates from</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.880" end="00:27:28.799" style="s2">a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.159" end="00:27:29.600" style="s2">realism uh the realism of science is</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.799" end="00:27:31.360" style="s2">that there isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.600" end="00:27:32.640" style="s2">uh reality that&#39;s independent of our</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.360" end="00:27:34.399" style="s2">knowledge of it now those of you</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.640" end="00:27:36.960" style="s2">familiar with quantum mechanics and</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.399" end="00:27:38.080" style="s2">general relativity and know that physics</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.960" end="00:27:40.000" style="s2">uh went from</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.080" end="00:27:41.279" style="s2">a complete independence of observer</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.000" end="00:27:43.120" style="s2">observed uh</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.279" end="00:27:45.279" style="s2">into systems that actually have to get</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.120" end="00:27:46.480" style="s2">entangled as it were especially in</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.279" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">quantum but both in</p>
<p begin="00:27:46.480" end="00:27:50.320" style="s2">general relativity also um so there are</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:51.760" style="s2">lots of interesting questions about the</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.320" end="00:27:52.399" style="s2">relationship between observer and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.760" end="00:27:54.559" style="s2">observed</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.399" end="00:27:55.679" style="s2">but fundamentally the scientific system</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.559" end="00:27:58.640" style="s2">of justification</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.679" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">is that there is an antic reality um and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.640" end="00:28:02.799" style="s2">that there</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:04.559" style="s2">are ontological theories of that reality</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.799" end="00:28:07.279" style="s2">and that there are systems of</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.559" end="00:28:09.919" style="s2">epistemological justification</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.279" end="00:28:10.320" style="s2">so modern empirical natural science says</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.919" end="00:28:13.279" style="s2">hey</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.320" end="00:28:14.880" style="s2">you have to have data you have to then</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.279" end="00:28:17.200" style="s2">engage and once you engage in data you</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.880" end="00:28:19.200" style="s2">engage in experimentation</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.200" end="00:28:21.120" style="s2">the tree of knowledge says that the the</p>

<p begin="00:28:21.120" end="00:28:25.039" style="s2">uh offers what&#39;s called an exterior</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.600" end="00:28:26.559" style="s2">epistemology means it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.039" end="00:28:28.799" style="s2">it operates from a third person</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.559" end="00:28:31.600" style="s2">generalized view and it divides the</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.799" end="00:28:35.120" style="s2">world up into objects fields and change</p>
<p begin="00:28:31.600" end="00:28:38.720" style="s2">uh these are the fundamental elements of</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.120" end="00:28:39.919" style="s2">us of the grammar of science um</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.720" end="00:28:42.240" style="s2">that&#39;s really important to me as a</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.919" end="00:28:43.440" style="s2">psychologist uh because there are some</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.240" end="00:28:44.240" style="s2">people out there that argue that</p>

<p begin="00:28:44.240" end="00:28:50.320" style="s2">is the science of behavior okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.679" end="00:28:51.919" style="s2">if if you&#39;re following me then you think</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.320" end="00:28:54.399" style="s2">about the idea that psychology is the</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.919" end="00:28:56.480" style="s2">signs of behavior like wait a minute</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.399" end="00:28:57.919" style="s2">behavior goes all the way down okay</p>

<p begin="00:28:58.640" end="00:29:03.360" style="s2">uh and so the issue uh that</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.120" end="00:29:06.640" style="s2">psychologists get cons confused about</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.360" end="00:29:09.120" style="s2">is they then fail to separate uh key</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.640" end="00:29:10.480" style="s2">b uh issues of ontology which is the</p>

<p begin="00:29:54.240" end="00:29:57.840" style="s2">sciences</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.840" end="00:29:59.120" style="s2">in relation so the physical sciences</p>
<p begin="00:29:57.840" end="00:30:01.120" style="s2">correspond to matter</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.120" end="00:30:02.480" style="s2">biological sciences correspond to life</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.120" end="00:30:05.440" style="s2">now that&#39;s standard</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.480" end="00:30:07.200" style="s2">okay what happens in science is that</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.440" end="00:30:09.200" style="s2">then you get into neuroscience that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.200" end="00:30:10.799" style="s2">still real science and stem</p>
<p begin="00:30:09.200" end="00:30:12.480" style="s2">and then you move into psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.799" end="00:30:14.399" style="s2">the hits the fan</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.480" end="00:30:15.679" style="s2">and what i mean by that is then every</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.399" end="00:30:18.559" style="s2">there&#39;s an enormous amount</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.679" end="00:30:19.760" style="s2">of dispute and difference so much so</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.559" end="00:30:22.559" style="s2">that you ask john</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.760" end="00:30:24.159" style="s2">uh john verbaki there&#39;s an entire branch</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.559" end="00:30:24.720" style="s2">of understanding called cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.159" end="00:30:26.480" style="s2">science</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.720" end="00:30:28.320" style="s2">that breaks off some psychology and</p>
<p begin="00:30:26.480" end="00:30:30.399" style="s2">tries to be its own thing</p>
<p begin="00:30:28.320" end="00:30:32.640" style="s2">the reason cognitive science emerges is</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.399" end="00:30:34.960" style="s2">precisely because psychology is such a</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.640" end="00:30:36.480" style="s2">well anjan said it you know it&#39;s in such</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.960" end="00:30:38.399" style="s2">a fragmented mess</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.480" end="00:30:40.159" style="s2">i would argue that cognitive science</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.399" end="00:30:40.880" style="s2">basically inherits the same basic</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.159" end="00:30:43.039" style="s2">problems</p>
<p begin="00:30:40.880" end="00:30:45.360" style="s2">uh although it&#39;s more somewhat more</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.039" end="00:30:46.240" style="s2">unified it finds itself in a very very</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.360" end="00:30:49.200" style="s2">fragmented</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.240" end="00:30:51.120" style="s2">place because we&#39;re lacking a</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.200" end="00:30:52.559" style="s2">fundamental sense-making system that</p>
<p begin="00:30:51.120" end="00:30:55.200" style="s2">allows us to get the grammar and</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.559" end="00:30:57.279" style="s2">language correct</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.200" end="00:30:58.240" style="s2">so the basics of the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.279" end="00:30:59.840" style="s2">is the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.240" end="00:31:01.840" style="s2">out of a pure energy singularity we can</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.840" end="00:31:04.320" style="s2">talk about this how this might</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.840" end="00:31:05.919" style="s2">have a first inflationary reaction</p>
<p begin="00:31:04.320" end="00:31:07.600" style="s2">inside the energy singularity</p>
<p begin="00:31:05.919" end="00:31:09.840" style="s2">that begins a massive process of</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.600" end="00:31:12.559" style="s2">expansion and differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.840" end="00:31:13.360" style="s2">okay and then ultimately this explodes</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.559" end="00:31:15.760" style="s2">into</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.360" end="00:31:16.880" style="s2">the matter dimension the matter</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.760" end="00:31:19.600" style="s2">dimension</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.880" end="00:31:21.200" style="s2">refers to uh at the basis quantum</p>
<p begin="00:31:19.600" end="00:31:22.000" style="s2">mechanics across scaleless general</p>
<p begin="00:31:21.200" end="00:31:24.960" style="s2">relativity</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.000" end="00:31:26.399" style="s2">and up in terms of the complexity and</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.960" end="00:31:28.000" style="s2">arrangement of objects goes into</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.399" end="00:31:29.840" style="s2">chemistry</p>
<p begin="00:31:28.000" end="00:31:31.519" style="s2">there are certainly other very complex</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.840" end="00:31:32.880" style="s2">objects like the earth can be thought of</p>
<p begin="00:31:31.519" end="00:31:34.399" style="s2">as a complex object</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.880" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">but that relates to the size and</p>
<p begin="00:31:34.399" end="00:31:37.440" style="s2">multiplicity of it</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.679" end="00:31:42.000" style="s2">then we see about 4 billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:40.399" end="00:31:44.399" style="s2">3.8 billion years ago</p>
<p begin="00:31:42.000" end="00:31:45.360" style="s2">there&#39;s the miracle of life the spark of</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.399" end="00:31:47.440" style="s2">life</p>
<p begin="00:31:45.360" end="00:31:49.679" style="s2">we talk about exactly what happens there</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.440" end="00:31:52.240" style="s2">but fundamentally there&#39;s an inside and</p>
<p begin="00:31:49.679" end="00:31:53.919" style="s2">outside of a cell organized around a</p>
<p begin="00:31:52.240" end="00:31:55.600" style="s2">lipid membrane</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.919" end="00:31:57.840" style="s2">somehow there&#39;s a correspondence between</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.600" end="00:32:00.720" style="s2">a storage of data information</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.840" end="00:32:02.240" style="s2">dna and then r maybe rna initially and</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.720" end="00:32:03.760" style="s2">then into dna</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.240" end="00:32:05.440" style="s2">that allows for an intergenerational</p>
<p begin="00:32:03.760" end="00:32:07.600" style="s2">transmission and then there are</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.440" end="00:32:10.320" style="s2">metabolic processes that do work</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.600" end="00:32:11.279" style="s2">to maintain uh differentiation</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.320" end="00:32:14.960" style="s2">replication</p>
<p begin="00:32:11.279" end="00:32:16.320" style="s2">metabolism etc lots of fascinating ideas</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.960" end="00:32:18.399" style="s2">about what gave rise to life</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.320" end="00:32:20.559" style="s2">once it gets started we see the</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.399" end="00:32:23.360" style="s2">explosion of prokaryotic cells as</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.559" end="00:32:24.399" style="s2">cells with out of nucleus and then into</p>
<p begin="00:32:23.360" end="00:32:27.200" style="s2">more advanced</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.399" end="00:32:28.240" style="s2">bigger cells big life shortly after big</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.200" end="00:32:31.120" style="s2">life emerges</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.240" end="00:32:33.120" style="s2">uh we see another tremendous shift uh</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.120" end="00:32:35.200" style="s2">one of the kingdoms splits off</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.120" end="00:32:36.799" style="s2">uh so you have kingdoms of plants and</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.200" end="00:32:38.960" style="s2">kingdoms of fungi as</p>
<p begin="00:32:36.799" end="00:32:40.080" style="s2">big life and then you get the animal</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.960" end="00:32:43.360" style="s2">kingdom</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.080" end="00:32:44.799" style="s2">about 550 million years ago animals get</p>
<p begin="00:32:43.360" end="00:32:46.799" style="s2">organized into complex</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.799" end="00:32:48.640" style="s2">active bodies that are then coordinated</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.799" end="00:32:50.559" style="s2">by brains and nervous systems</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.640" end="00:32:52.320" style="s2">it is that process that the tree of</p>
<p begin="00:32:50.559" end="00:32:55.440" style="s2">knowledge introduces the kind</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.320" end="00:32:56.960" style="s2">capital m mind so the term mind is to</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.440" end="00:32:58.320" style="s2">refer to the third dimension of</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.960" end="00:33:00.960" style="s2">behavioral complexity</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.320" end="00:33:02.559" style="s2">the third plane of existence okay so i</p>
<p begin="00:33:00.960" end="00:33:03.360" style="s2">look over here i see my fish swimming</p>
<p begin="00:33:02.559" end="00:33:04.880" style="s2">around</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.360" end="00:33:07.360" style="s2">in the language of the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:33:04.880" end="00:33:09.919" style="s2">capital m mind i&#39;m observing their</p>
<p begin="00:33:07.360" end="00:33:11.519" style="s2">mind as they swim around just as though</p>
<p begin="00:33:09.919" end="00:33:14.559" style="s2">you&#39;d look at a living flower</p>
<p begin="00:33:11.519" end="00:33:17.120" style="s2">and you say oh that&#39;s alive okay</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.559" end="00:33:17.600" style="s2">why do i can explain why we need this</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.120" end="00:33:20.640" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.600" end="00:33:22.080" style="s2">mind um and what it does is it solves a</p>
<p begin="00:33:20.640" end="00:33:24.240" style="s2">lot of the split</p>
<p begin="00:33:22.080" end="00:33:26.159" style="s2">uh and confusion around what</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.240" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">consciousness is and what behavior is</p>
<p begin="00:33:26.159" end="00:33:28.960" style="s2">in psychology</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.840" end="00:33:34.320" style="s2">but then uh we fast forward to about a</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.720" end="00:33:36.559" style="s2">hundred thousand years ago</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.320" end="00:33:37.440" style="s2">uh and you see the evolution from</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.559" end="00:33:41.519" style="s2">insects and</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.440" end="00:33:44.159" style="s2">fish into birds uh and mammals</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.519" end="00:33:45.760" style="s2">and then uh we see ultimately one</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.159" end="00:33:49.360" style="s2">particular primate</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.760" end="00:33:51.039" style="s2">um adopts yet another interacting</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.360" end="00:33:53.279" style="s2">information processing communication</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.039" end="00:33:55.440" style="s2">system in the in the form of language</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.279" end="00:33:57.200" style="s2">um that explodes there&#39;s a thing called</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.440" end="00:33:58.720" style="s2">the justification hypothesis that i was</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.200" end="00:34:00.880" style="s2">going to talk about next time</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.720" end="00:34:02.799" style="s2">provides a frame of reference for</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.880" end="00:34:04.080" style="s2">understanding why over the last 100 000</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.799" end="00:34:07.200" style="s2">years</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.080" end="00:34:09.440" style="s2">our system of being uh</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.200" end="00:34:11.679" style="s2">has escalated and so dramatically</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.440" end="00:34:15.679" style="s2">changed uh the balance of power</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.679" end="00:34:16.639" style="s2">um and the tok system as i mentioned</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.679" end="00:34:17.919" style="s2">already then says</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.639" end="00:34:20.079" style="s2">as part of that evolution of</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.919" end="00:34:23.040" style="s2">justification which dates back</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.079" end="00:34:23.440" style="s2">you know 75 000 years et cetera clearly</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.040" end="00:34:25.919" style="s2">is in</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.440" end="00:34:27.839" style="s2">in process 50 000 years ago we see an</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.919" end="00:34:29.040" style="s2">emergence and then 12 000 years ago we</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.839" end="00:34:30.879" style="s2">see agriculture</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.040" end="00:34:32.720" style="s2">uh it starts to merge with technology in</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.879" end="00:34:34.639" style="s2">particular ways and particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.720" end="00:34:37.359" style="s2">justification system</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.639" end="00:34:39.200" style="s2">that we call science emerges out of that</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.359" end="00:34:40.480" style="s2">and then functions to map the evolution</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.200" end="00:34:42.800" style="s2">of complexity</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.480" end="00:34:44.480" style="s2">so it&#39;s a theory on the right hand side</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.800" end="00:34:47.280" style="s2">of scientific knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.480" end="00:34:50.079" style="s2">or scientific ontological claims</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.280" end="00:34:52.960" style="s2">justified by scientific epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:34:50.079" end="00:34:55.839" style="s2">that then uh map the antic reality of</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.960" end="00:34:57.920" style="s2">matter like mind and culture</p>
<p begin="00:34:55.839" end="00:34:59.599" style="s2">and then here&#39;s a diagram so the blue is</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.920" end="00:35:02.480" style="s2">that antic reality</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.599" end="00:35:05.359" style="s2">and the red is the scientific onto</p>

<p begin="00:35:06.240" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">what that means is is that basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.240" end="00:35:12.400" style="s2">what we should be really instilling is a</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:13.920" style="s2">return to what ken wilber called the</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.400" end="00:35:16.079" style="s2">perennial philosophy</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.920" end="00:35:17.920" style="s2">okay the great chain of being that</p>
<p begin="00:35:16.079" end="00:35:20.960" style="s2">before it got messed with</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.920" end="00:35:22.240" style="s2">um uh christianity the great chain of</p>
<p begin="00:35:20.960" end="00:35:25.440" style="s2">bean was basically</p>
<p begin="00:35:22.240" end="00:35:27.040" style="s2">there are rocks there are plants</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.440" end="00:35:28.640" style="s2">there are animals and there are people</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.040" end="00:35:30.480" style="s2">uh that great chain of bean really comes</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.640" end="00:35:32.960" style="s2">from aristotle</p>
<p begin="00:35:30.480" end="00:35:33.520" style="s2">and virtually every philosophy every</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.960" end="00:35:36.320" style="s2">culture</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.520" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s ever been studied categorizes the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.320" end="00:35:39.200" style="s2">world</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:41.040" style="s2">up into these four different categories</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.200" end="00:35:42.960" style="s2">now what happened with modern science</p>
<p begin="00:35:41.040" end="00:35:44.880" style="s2">is they showed that the simple</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.960" end="00:35:46.000" style="s2">classification of rocks plants animals</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.880" end="00:35:48.480" style="s2">people doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.000" end="00:35:50.720" style="s2">kind of like earth wind air and fire uh</p>
<p begin="00:35:48.480" end="00:35:53.760" style="s2">and therefore as a function of it being</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.720" end="00:35:55.440" style="s2">not working it got lost um or</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.760" end="00:35:56.880" style="s2">and then was seen as simplistic and</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.440" end="00:35:59.280" style="s2">needed to be upgraded</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.880" end="00:35:59.920" style="s2">okay but the question was well actually</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.280" end="00:36:02.640" style="s2">we can now</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.920" end="00:36:04.000" style="s2">fill in the gaps and understand the</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.640" end="00:36:06.480" style="s2">emergences over time</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.000" end="00:36:08.079" style="s2">and then also understand why rocks</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.480" end="00:36:10.640" style="s2">plants animals and people</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.079" end="00:36:12.720" style="s2">exist on different dimensions of</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.640" end="00:36:14.079" style="s2">complexity or planes of existence</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.720" end="00:36:15.839" style="s2">that&#39;s what the tree of knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.079" end="00:36:17.200" style="s2">affords us many many different people</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.839" end="00:36:18.800" style="s2">have seen this in different ways the</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.200" end="00:36:19.520" style="s2">tree of knowledge offers a particular</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.800" end="00:36:21.680" style="s2">kind</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.520" end="00:36:23.760" style="s2">of explanation for this four-dimensional</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.680" end="00:36:26.960" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:36:23.760" end="00:36:29.040" style="s2">so what as a sense-making system</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.960" end="00:36:30.640" style="s2">okay uh the tree of knowledge then</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.040" end="00:36:33.839" style="s2">encourages you to then</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.640" end="00:36:35.040" style="s2">view the world through a prism that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.839" end="00:36:38.160" style="s2">organizes it around</p>
<p begin="00:36:35.040" end="00:36:40.320" style="s2">different uh frequencies material</p>
<p begin="00:36:38.160" end="00:36:43.200" style="s2">frequencies operate at one</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.320" end="00:36:45.119" style="s2">in one way biological living frequencies</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.200" end="00:36:47.119" style="s2">mental animal frequencies and culture</p>
<p begin="00:36:45.119" end="00:36:48.480" style="s2">person frequencies</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.119" end="00:36:50.400" style="s2">and if you learn to see the world</p>
<p begin="00:36:48.480" end="00:36:52.720" style="s2">through that particular lens</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.400" end="00:36:54.400" style="s2">i believe that you can then derive an</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.720" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">enormous amount of</p>
<p begin="00:36:54.400" end="00:36:57.760" style="s2">clarity and coherence</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.920" end="00:37:04.880" style="s2">so i&#39;m going to i&#39;ll stop there</p>
<p begin="00:37:01.680" end="00:37:06.720" style="s2">and see anjan if uh</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.880" end="00:37:08.000" style="s2">if that if there are questions that</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.720" end="00:37:11.440" style="s2">arise out of that</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.000" end="00:37:12.079" style="s2">um or we can uh move into a wide variety</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.440" end="00:37:16.240" style="s2">of different</p>
<p begin="00:37:12.079" end="00:37:18.240" style="s2">angles here given that</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.240" end="00:37:19.359" style="s2">we got some questions in the chat just a</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.240" end="00:37:22.800" style="s2">quick question to you greg</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.359" end="00:37:24.720" style="s2">um what&#39;s your plan um after this little</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.800" end="00:37:26.160" style="s2">question session do you have more to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.720" end="00:37:26.800" style="s2">your slides you said you wanted to talk</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.160" end="00:37:29.839" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.800" end="00:37:30.160" style="s2">the garden yeah i mean well there&#39;s i</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.839" end="00:37:32.400" style="s2">got</p>
<p begin="00:37:30.160" end="00:37:33.839" style="s2">uh basically you know i know throwing a</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.400" end="00:37:35.359" style="s2">lot out there and i basically</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.839" end="00:37:37.440" style="s2">see what people are what&#39;s alive for</p>
<p begin="00:37:35.359" end="00:37:38.880" style="s2">people uh you know i i can go back to</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.440" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">that listen obviously i flew through the</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.880" end="00:37:41.680" style="s2">garden just to give you a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:44.240" style="s2">a</p>
<p begin="00:37:41.680" end="00:37:45.760" style="s2">a run down about what that is uh it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.240" end="00:37:47.040" style="s2">cathedral i mean you know so it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:45.760" end="00:37:48.160" style="s2">hey you know there are lots of different</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.040" end="00:37:50.880" style="s2">elements that we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:48.160" end="00:37:51.839" style="s2">talk about um so that&#39;s an option we can</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.880" end="00:37:53.440" style="s2">return to that</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.839" end="00:37:55.040" style="s2">um but why don&#39;t i take some questions</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.440" end="00:37:57.359" style="s2">and we&#39;ll see where</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.040" end="00:37:58.240" style="s2">uh what feels interesting to people to</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.359" end="00:38:00.320" style="s2">move towards and</p>
<p begin="00:37:58.240" end="00:38:03.280" style="s2">i&#39;ll go back to that if that feels uh</p>
<p begin="00:38:00.320" end="00:38:05.599" style="s2">where the flow takes us</p>
<p begin="00:38:03.280" end="00:38:06.400" style="s2">um just a quick clarification question</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.599" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">for me then</p>
<p begin="00:38:06.400" end="00:38:08.640" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.720" end="00:38:16.320" style="s2">like there there&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.320" end="00:38:18.560" style="s2">sect of youtube that&#39;s like the way to</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.320" end="00:38:21.280" style="s2">pick up girls is to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:18.560" end="00:38:22.960" style="s2">how they&#39;re evolutionarily programmed</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.280" end="00:38:24.640" style="s2">all of a human can and there&#39;s this like</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.960" end="00:38:26.320" style="s2">incredible reductionism</p>
<p begin="00:38:24.640" end="00:38:27.839" style="s2">that we&#39;re just this like programmatic</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.320" end="00:38:30.079" style="s2">beings that can only be understood</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.839" end="00:38:30.880" style="s2">in this evolutionary lens then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.079" end="00:38:33.040" style="s2">this like</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.880" end="00:38:34.119" style="s2">other sect of youtube that&#39;s like oh</p>
<p begin="00:38:33.040" end="00:38:36.880" style="s2">it&#39;s all about</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.119" end="00:38:38.800" style="s2">neuroeconomics keep the doritos in your</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.880" end="00:38:40.400" style="s2">pantry out of sight it&#39;ll require less</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.800" end="00:38:43.040" style="s2">willpower therefore be able to do it</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.400" end="00:38:44.800" style="s2">easier and then jonathan hyde&#39;s work</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.040" end="00:38:46.400" style="s2">that we talked about which is</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.800" end="00:38:48.560" style="s2">you can really try to understand the</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.400" end="00:38:49.359" style="s2">relational aspects and justification and</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.560" end="00:38:52.000" style="s2">the social</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.359" end="00:38:53.280" style="s2">aspects of it am i right to understand</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.000" end="00:38:55.680" style="s2">the power of the tok</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.280" end="00:38:57.119" style="s2">is to see that a human is influenced at</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.680" end="00:39:00.000" style="s2">all of these levels</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.119" end="00:39:00.880" style="s2">it&#39;s not this is right or that it&#39;s hey</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.000" end="00:39:02.560" style="s2">you can understand</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.880" end="00:39:03.920" style="s2">me by looking at each of these levels</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.560" end="00:39:07.280" style="s2">how are the different ways</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.920" end="00:39:10.880" style="s2">my behavior is influenced and created</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.280" end="00:39:12.400" style="s2">yeah 100 uh so each what you have there</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.880" end="00:39:14.079" style="s2">is each you know i use the</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.400" end="00:39:16.000" style="s2">metaphor the elephant a lot you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:14.079" end="00:39:18.560" style="s2">blind men and the elephant okay</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.000" end="00:39:20.640" style="s2">uh that is that people develop paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.560" end="00:39:23.520" style="s2">to see particular lines of thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.640" end="00:39:24.079" style="s2">uh that are useful okay um but what we</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.520" end="00:39:26.240" style="s2">lack</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.079" end="00:39:27.280" style="s2">is a paradigm that actually interrelates</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.240" end="00:39:29.359" style="s2">those lines of thought</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.280" end="00:39:30.800" style="s2">and then makes them cohere and you hear</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.359" end="00:39:32.400" style="s2">that because then people could make</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.800" end="00:39:35.200" style="s2">these absolutist statements</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.400" end="00:39:37.040" style="s2">okay oh everything&#39;s due to evolution or</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.200" end="00:39:38.160" style="s2">everything&#39;s due to neuroeconomics or</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.040" end="00:39:39.280" style="s2">everything to do with social</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.160" end="00:39:42.560" style="s2">construction</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.280" end="00:39:45.680" style="s2">um and and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.560" end="00:39:47.920" style="s2">clearly not i mean just not</p>
<p begin="00:39:45.680" end="00:39:49.520" style="s2">you know that&#39;s not the way it works um</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.920" end="00:39:51.599" style="s2">what they what you have is you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.520" end="00:39:53.200" style="s2">you&#39;re a system uh that operates at</p>
<p begin="00:39:51.599" end="00:39:55.520" style="s2">multiple levels and dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.200" end="00:39:56.480" style="s2">okay uh you&#39;re an integrated system that</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.520" end="00:39:58.720" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.480" end="00:39:59.599" style="s2">is operating at all those dimensions</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.720" end="00:40:01.680" style="s2">coherently</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.599" end="00:40:03.200" style="s2">the question is how do you tease apart</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.680" end="00:40:04.240" style="s2">those dimensions and see their inner</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.200" end="00:40:06.160" style="s2">relation</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.240" end="00:40:07.359" style="s2">okay that&#39;s the issue so the social</p>
<p begin="00:40:06.160" end="00:40:08.720" style="s2">constructionist people make an</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.359" end="00:40:11.520" style="s2">unbelievably very</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.720" end="00:40:13.040" style="s2">point that that we come equipped as a as</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.520" end="00:40:15.680" style="s2">a cultural primate</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.040" end="00:40:16.240" style="s2">we come equipped to justify okay we</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.680" end="00:40:18.560" style="s2">don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.240" end="00:40:19.839" style="s2">content of justification but we do they</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.560" end="00:40:21.760" style="s2">don&#39;t make this point but they then</p>
<p begin="00:40:19.839" end="00:40:23.760" style="s2">basically say well oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.760" end="00:40:25.520" style="s2">if we&#39;re unbelievably sort of open at</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.760" end="00:40:28.160" style="s2">the level of justification then</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.520" end="00:40:29.920" style="s2">what our sociocultural constructs are</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.160" end="00:40:32.079" style="s2">then we&#39;ll play a huge role</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.920" end="00:40:34.160" style="s2">in how we dictate what&#39;s good what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.079" end="00:40:36.079" style="s2">valuable what men and women should do</p>
<p begin="00:40:34.160" end="00:40:37.680" style="s2">what do we feel about the races and of</p>
<p begin="00:40:36.079" end="00:40:39.599" style="s2">course that&#39;s true i mean</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.680" end="00:40:40.720" style="s2">look at you know i grew up in a</p>
<p begin="00:40:39.599" end="00:40:43.280" style="s2">particular time</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.720" end="00:40:44.079" style="s2">5 000 years ago if i grew up in siberia</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.280" end="00:40:45.839" style="s2">in russia</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.079" end="00:40:47.520" style="s2">my world view would be radically</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.839" end="00:40:49.119" style="s2">different right okay</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.520" end="00:40:50.880" style="s2">so my system of justification is</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.119" end="00:40:51.599" style="s2">enormously influenced by the cultural</p>
<p begin="00:40:50.880" end="00:40:54.079" style="s2">context</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.599" end="00:40:54.960" style="s2">at the same time i can go and look at</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.079" end="00:40:56.400" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.960" end="00:40:58.319" style="s2">across the wide variety of different</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.400" end="00:41:00.160" style="s2">domains and see look hey</p>
<p begin="00:40:58.319" end="00:41:01.760" style="s2">everywhere you go people care about sex</p>
<p begin="00:41:00.160" end="00:41:02.720" style="s2">they care about status they care about</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.760" end="00:41:04.480" style="s2">getting injured</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.720" end="00:41:07.359" style="s2">you know they worry about food there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:04.480" end="00:41:09.040" style="s2">an enormous amount of similarity too</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.359" end="00:41:10.640" style="s2">um and there are evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.040" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">similarities you know that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.640" end="00:41:13.119" style="s2">understand through a socio-biological</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:15.440" style="s2">level</p>
<p begin="00:41:13.119" end="00:41:17.200" style="s2">there are neuro-based similar realities</p>
<p begin="00:41:15.440" end="00:41:18.480" style="s2">there are operant realities that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:41:17.200" end="00:41:21.040" style="s2">scenario</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.480" end="00:41:22.319" style="s2">particular kind of view all of those are</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.040" end="00:41:25.440" style="s2">have validity</p>
<p begin="00:41:22.319" end="00:41:27.359" style="s2">in themselves okay for me the question</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.440" end="00:41:28.079" style="s2">is what&#39;s the interrelations between the</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.359" end="00:41:30.240" style="s2">paradigms</p>
<p begin="00:41:28.079" end="00:41:32.240" style="s2">that&#39;s the meta theoretical question and</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.240" end="00:41:34.000" style="s2">then the real philosophical question is</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.240" end="00:41:36.160" style="s2">what is your metaphysical language</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.000" end="00:41:37.040" style="s2">system that you can bring to bear and</p>
<p begin="00:41:36.160" end="00:41:39.200" style="s2">can you achieve</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.040" end="00:41:41.119" style="s2">coherence and clarity with your language</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.200" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">system those are the two things that i</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.119" end="00:41:43.839" style="s2">wrestle with most</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.960" end="00:41:48.319" style="s2">um we got some questions from the chat</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.680" end="00:41:49.839" style="s2">so there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.319" end="00:41:51.839" style="s2">three questions that are pretty similar</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.839" end="00:41:53.520" style="s2">rain ron and cadell</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.839" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">um so i&#39;m going to call him rain first</p>
<p begin="00:41:53.520" end="00:41:57.280" style="s2">but ron and cadel are you gonna go next</p>
<p begin="00:41:57.839" end="00:42:02.079" style="s2">thanks um obvious question what are the</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.319" end="00:42:05.680" style="s2">key differences between utah</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.079" end="00:42:08.960" style="s2">and integral theory ah okay</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.680" end="00:42:10.000" style="s2">um i i like a lot of integral theory a</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.960" end="00:42:11.680" style="s2">lot um</p>
<p begin="00:42:10.000" end="00:42:13.200" style="s2">and it&#39;s a couple of things that i</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.680" end="00:42:16.800" style="s2">really love about it um</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.200" end="00:42:18.960" style="s2">so i love ken wilbur&#39;s concern</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.800" end="00:42:19.920" style="s2">with the material flatland and what</p>
<p begin="00:42:18.960" end="00:42:23.200" style="s2">science did</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.920" end="00:42:24.720" style="s2">okay in relationship to splitting off</p>
<p begin="00:42:23.200" end="00:42:27.119" style="s2">our epistemologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.720" end="00:42:28.440" style="s2">uh over emphasizing exterior</p>
<p begin="00:42:27.119" end="00:42:30.480" style="s2">epistemologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.440" end="00:42:31.760" style="s2">sacrificing or the consequence they</p>
<p begin="00:42:30.480" end="00:42:33.440" style="s2">didn&#39;t do this really intentionally but</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.760" end="00:42:33.920" style="s2">the consequence of scientific language</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.440" end="00:42:36.319" style="s2">games</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.920" end="00:42:37.920" style="s2">was to essentially undervalue uh</p>
<p begin="00:42:36.319" end="00:42:39.520" style="s2">individual interior and collective</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.920" end="00:42:41.680" style="s2">interior epistemologies</p>
<p begin="00:42:39.520" end="00:42:43.280" style="s2">so so and the quadrants then return us</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.680" end="00:42:45.839" style="s2">to goodness truth and beauty</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.280" end="00:42:46.800" style="s2">as a holistic philosophy is required for</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.839" end="00:42:47.760" style="s2">our fulfillment</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.800" end="00:42:49.680" style="s2">right that&#39;s one thing you did</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.760" end="00:42:50.960" style="s2">brilliantly in my estimation the second</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.680" end="00:42:51.839" style="s2">thing that he does brilliantly in my</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.960" end="00:42:54.560" style="s2">estimation</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.839" end="00:42:56.560" style="s2">um is understand stages and developments</p>
<p begin="00:42:54.560" end="00:42:57.280" style="s2">and line you know the line stage and in</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.560" end="00:42:59.520" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:42:57.280" end="00:43:00.640" style="s2">sort of the ego development uh you know</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.520" end="00:43:03.520" style="s2">it gets a little</p>
<p begin="00:43:00.640" end="00:43:03.839" style="s2">uh simplistic at the color level okay uh</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.520" end="00:43:06.560" style="s2">but</p>
<p begin="00:43:03.839" end="00:43:07.200" style="s2">you know his analysis in 2017 i think it</p>
<p begin="00:43:06.560" end="00:43:10.000" style="s2">was about</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.200" end="00:43:11.599" style="s2">trump and uh post-modernism and you know</p>
<p begin="00:43:10.000" end="00:43:13.680" style="s2">about what we need is</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.599" end="00:43:15.200" style="s2">second tier is a little bit complicated</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.680" end="00:43:16.160" style="s2">because it talks down to people sticking</p>
<p begin="00:43:15.200" end="00:43:17.200" style="s2">to your consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.160" end="00:43:18.960" style="s2">all right that you&#39;ve got to go into</p>
<p begin="00:43:17.200" end="00:43:20.240" style="s2">teal and this creates all sorts of</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.960" end="00:43:21.520" style="s2">tensions because everybody are very</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.240" end="00:43:24.640" style="s2">sensitive to hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:43:21.520" end="00:43:27.359" style="s2">okay um but the idea that there&#39;s a pre</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.640" end="00:43:28.960" style="s2">a rational and a post-trans-rational</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.359" end="00:43:31.200" style="s2">developmental sequence</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.960" end="00:43:32.480" style="s2">that you can see people on those places</p>
<p begin="00:43:31.200" end="00:43:33.359" style="s2">that we want to cultivate that</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.480" end="00:43:36.240" style="s2">particular</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.359" end="00:43:37.839" style="s2">level of integration along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:43:36.240" end="00:43:40.000" style="s2">is absolutely brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.839" end="00:43:41.040" style="s2">so those are some real strengths i think</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.000" end="00:43:44.079" style="s2">that he is</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.040" end="00:43:46.000" style="s2">um i challenged some of him</p>
<p begin="00:43:44.079" end="00:43:48.880" style="s2">in terms of a couple of different places</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.000" end="00:43:52.079" style="s2">um his deep spiritual ontology</p>
<p begin="00:43:48.880" end="00:43:53.920" style="s2">i&#39;m more spiritually agnostic he makes</p>
<p begin="00:43:52.079" end="00:43:55.760" style="s2">certain kinds of spiritual claims my</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.920" end="00:43:56.880" style="s2">friend andre marquis is an integral</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.760" end="00:43:58.880" style="s2">scholar</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.880" end="00:44:00.240" style="s2">argues that he makes a bit of a category</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.880" end="00:44:02.160" style="s2">error based on his own</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.240" end="00:44:03.920" style="s2">subjective perceptions and then makes</p>
<p begin="00:44:02.160" end="00:44:06.079" style="s2">generalized claims about the nature of</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.920" end="00:44:09.200" style="s2">ultimate reality that&#39;s worthy of</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.079" end="00:44:11.119" style="s2">some critique um and i also uh</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.200" end="00:44:12.400" style="s2">basically i do a lot of work in upper</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.119" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">right okay</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.400" end="00:44:16.800" style="s2">so in quadrants if you speak quadrant</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:20.079" style="s2">language upper right what he calls</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.800" end="00:44:21.440" style="s2">he basically creates an a material flat</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.079" end="00:44:23.680" style="s2">land ontology</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.440" end="00:44:25.920" style="s2">for the upper right quadrant that is</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.680" end="00:44:28.240" style="s2">basically in my view a big mistake</p>
<p begin="00:44:25.920" end="00:44:29.599" style="s2">uh you want to change your thinking</p>
<p begin="00:44:28.240" end="00:44:32.960" style="s2">scientifically from</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.599" end="00:44:34.720" style="s2">physicalism to behaviorism and then once</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.960" end="00:44:36.000" style="s2">you go to behaviorism you can actually</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.720" end="00:44:37.920" style="s2">get a behavioral view</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.000" end="00:44:39.119" style="s2">of the upper right that corresponds to</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.920" end="00:44:41.280" style="s2">phenomenology</p>
<p begin="00:44:39.119" end="00:44:43.040" style="s2">um and social systems and culture in a</p>
<p begin="00:44:41.280" end="00:44:45.520" style="s2">much more coherent way</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.040" end="00:44:47.200" style="s2">so my contention is i&#39;ve got an ontology</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.520" end="00:44:49.119" style="s2">that matches epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.200" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">uh his ontology and epistemology</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.119" end="00:44:53.040" style="s2">relative to science is a little clunky</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.560" end="00:45:00.079" style="s2">seems very reasonable thank you sure</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.160" end="00:45:02.000" style="s2">um ron you&#39;re next and then after that</p>
<p begin="00:45:00.079" end="00:45:04.160" style="s2">it&#39;ll be cadell</p>
<p begin="00:45:02.000" end="00:45:06.240" style="s2">thanks hey greg this tags right on to</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.160" end="00:45:08.640" style="s2">what rayne was just asking you</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.240" end="00:45:09.359" style="s2">and it it&#39;s another wilbur comparison</p>
<p begin="00:45:08.640" end="00:45:12.000" style="s2">question</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.359" end="00:45:13.359" style="s2">um just and maybe you did answer this in</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.000" end="00:45:16.480" style="s2">a way and you were just</p>
<p begin="00:45:13.359" end="00:45:18.319" style="s2">kind of alluding to it but just in a</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.480" end="00:45:20.000" style="s2">very fundamental sense do you agree with</p>
<p begin="00:45:18.319" end="00:45:22.880" style="s2">wilbur&#39;s idea that</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.000" end="00:45:24.480" style="s2">consciousness goes all the way down</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.880" end="00:45:26.800" style="s2">versus the traditional perennial</p>
<p begin="00:45:24.480" end="00:45:29.760" style="s2">philosophy idea that consciousness only</p>
<p begin="00:45:26.800" end="00:45:32.400" style="s2">later emerges either when life emerges</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.760" end="00:45:34.400" style="s2">out of matter or mind emerges out of</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.400" end="00:45:35.680" style="s2">life you know his idea i think you know</p>
<p begin="00:45:34.400" end="00:45:37.920" style="s2">is that</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.680" end="00:45:40.160" style="s2">every holland has an exterior and an</p>
<p begin="00:45:37.920" end="00:45:41.760" style="s2">interior which is the way he puts it</p>
<p begin="00:45:40.160" end="00:45:43.200" style="s2">and that consciousness not only goes all</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.760" end="00:45:44.480" style="s2">the way down but is kind of like the</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.200" end="00:45:45.760" style="s2">origin</p>
<p begin="00:45:44.480" end="00:45:47.040" style="s2">and again it sounds like you were kind</p>
<p begin="00:45:45.760" end="00:45:47.599" style="s2">of critiquing that but i&#39;m wondering</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.040" end="00:45:50.960" style="s2">yeah i could</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.599" end="00:45:52.800" style="s2">give you that yeah no i i i&#39;m not i mean</p>
<p begin="00:45:50.960" end="00:45:54.400" style="s2">there are sophisticated versions of pan</p>
<p begin="00:45:52.800" end="00:45:56.079" style="s2">psychism that are</p>
<p begin="00:45:54.400" end="00:45:57.920" style="s2">close enough to naturalism that i&#39;m all</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.079" end="00:46:00.319" style="s2">right with um but</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.920" end="00:46:01.040" style="s2">there&#39;s no way in any level in my</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.319" end="00:46:02.960" style="s2">estimation</p>
<p begin="00:46:01.040" end="00:46:04.240" style="s2">uh it&#39;s not analogous to talk about a</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.960" end="00:46:06.720" style="s2">hydrogen atom</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.240" end="00:46:08.880" style="s2">having an interior i mean when we use</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.720" end="00:46:11.760" style="s2">the word as human beings consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:08.880" end="00:46:14.079" style="s2">okay uh when i talk about consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:11.760" end="00:46:16.240" style="s2">i talk about hey i&#39;m conscious now</p>
<p begin="00:46:14.079" end="00:46:17.359" style="s2">okay and it does mean i have an interior</p>
<p begin="00:46:16.240" end="00:46:19.200" style="s2">but tonight when i get</p>
<p begin="00:46:17.359" end="00:46:21.359" style="s2">but you know get buzzed and go to bed</p>
<p begin="00:46:19.200" end="00:46:22.880" style="s2">and then i&#39;m out okay that consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:46:21.359" end="00:46:26.000" style="s2">is gone so now i&#39;m asleep</p>
<p begin="00:46:22.880" end="00:46:27.920" style="s2">okay um and really yes okay i&#39;ll flicker</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.000" end="00:46:29.680" style="s2">my dreams will flicker on and off all</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.920" end="00:46:30.800" style="s2">right but you put me in a coma i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:46:29.680" end="00:46:33.280" style="s2">basically gone</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.800" end="00:46:34.319" style="s2">um and then the eye and so to me you</p>
<p begin="00:46:33.280" end="00:46:36.960" style="s2">need a brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.319" end="00:46:38.240" style="s2">okay to have phenomenology all right</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.960" end="00:46:40.000" style="s2">without a brain</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.240" end="00:46:42.000" style="s2">i&#39;m pretty suspect now you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.000" end="00:46:44.720" style="s2">absolutely have friends in</p>
<p begin="00:46:42.000" end="00:46:46.640" style="s2">physiologies do cell research you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.720" end="00:46:48.240" style="s2">say cells have cognition in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.640" end="00:46:49.680" style="s2">that they&#39;re complex adaptive systems</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.240" end="00:46:51.599" style="s2">that process information</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.680" end="00:46:53.520" style="s2">okay so i would argue that yeah they</p>
<p begin="00:46:51.599" end="00:46:55.040" style="s2">definitely have functional awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:46:53.520" end="00:46:56.640" style="s2">response and there are definite</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.040" end="00:46:58.560" style="s2">definitions of consciousness that go</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.640" end="00:47:00.079" style="s2">into functional awareness and response</p>
<p begin="00:46:58.560" end="00:47:01.599" style="s2">however i don&#39;t believe they have any</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.079" end="00:47:03.440" style="s2">experiential awareness</p>
<p begin="00:47:01.599" end="00:47:05.280" style="s2">and i believe that definitely it stops</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.440" end="00:47:06.079" style="s2">there so functional awareness and</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.280" end="00:47:08.160" style="s2">response</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.079" end="00:47:09.520" style="s2">happens with cells there&#39;s they have a</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.160" end="00:47:11.200" style="s2">sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:09.520" end="00:47:13.040" style="s2">they&#39;re robotic essentially in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.200" end="00:47:14.560" style="s2">that in my estimation they would have no</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.040" end="00:47:16.560" style="s2">it would have no phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.560" end="00:47:17.599" style="s2">interior but they do have a sense-making</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.560" end="00:47:20.079" style="s2">interior they do</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.599" end="00:47:22.000" style="s2">make decisions they have autopilot</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.079" end="00:47:24.400" style="s2">complex adaptive functions</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.000" end="00:47:26.240" style="s2">that they process but i don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:47:24.400" end="00:47:27.359" style="s2">to apply the word consciousness even in</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.240" end="00:47:30.400" style="s2">a small amount</p>
<p begin="00:47:27.359" end="00:47:32.720" style="s2">makes much sense um for me consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:47:30.400" end="00:47:34.960" style="s2">emerges out of the neural functionality</p>
<p begin="00:47:32.720" end="00:47:37.280" style="s2">uh of mental behavior which means it</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.960" end="00:47:39.839" style="s2">comes out of the animal mental dimension</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.280" end="00:47:41.839" style="s2">um and you know i think it happens</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.839" end="00:47:44.079" style="s2">actually at the cambrian explosion</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.839" end="00:47:45.359" style="s2">and it corresponds to operant behavior</p>
<p begin="00:47:44.079" end="00:47:47.440" style="s2">in animals basically</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.359" end="00:47:48.640" style="s2">and there are a lot of to me cutting</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.440" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">edge researchers that</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.640" end="00:47:53.839" style="s2">are explaining why that is right now</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.760" end="00:48:00.000" style="s2">did you have a follow-up ron no no that</p>
<p begin="00:47:58.720" end="00:48:02.880" style="s2">was that was helpful and</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.000" end="00:48:03.680" style="s2">and sort of what i suspected was close</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.880" end="00:48:06.000" style="s2">to your view</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.680" end="00:48:07.440" style="s2">so thank you sure thanks for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:06.000" end="00:48:10.480" style="s2">question great</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.440" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">um next is cadella and after that um</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.480" end="00:48:13.760" style="s2">i&#39;m going to read ernesto&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.920" end="00:48:20.160" style="s2">hi greg can you hear me i can cadel hey</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.440" end="00:48:20.880" style="s2">yeah great talk my main my main question</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.160" end="00:48:25.119" style="s2">i guess</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.880" end="00:48:27.040" style="s2">is about maybe at first i would ask</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.119" end="00:48:28.480" style="s2">do you consider theory of knowledge of</p>
<p begin="00:48:27.040" end="00:48:31.680" style="s2">meta language</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.480" end="00:48:34.559" style="s2">and if so how does it relate to other</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.680" end="00:48:36.079" style="s2">meta languages basically languages which</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.559" end="00:48:39.280" style="s2">attempt to map</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.079" end="00:48:40.880" style="s2">our own knowledge great</p>
<p begin="00:48:39.280" end="00:48:42.960" style="s2">yeah i mean i think that&#39;s a good way of</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.880" end="00:48:45.599" style="s2">describing it uh you know what</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.960" end="00:48:46.319" style="s2">what i i know you&#39;re familiar with big</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.599" end="00:48:49.200" style="s2">history</p>
<p begin="00:48:46.319" end="00:48:50.400" style="s2">um and you know i i&#39;m sympathetic to</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.200" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">what they&#39;re trying to do sort of</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.400" end="00:48:54.319" style="s2">develop a meta view of natural science</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:56.319" style="s2">i&#39;m basically</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.319" end="00:48:58.240" style="s2">with the tree of knowledge uh i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.319" end="00:49:00.319" style="s2">offering a more precise</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.240" end="00:49:01.599" style="s2">language system and one that solves the</p>
<p begin="00:49:00.319" end="00:49:03.920" style="s2">problem of psychology</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.599" end="00:49:04.800" style="s2">and then and then in doing that then we</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.920" end="00:49:06.960" style="s2">can say we can</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.800" end="00:49:08.400" style="s2">there is a way to talk about matter life</p>
<p begin="00:49:06.960" end="00:49:10.400" style="s2">mind and culture</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.400" end="00:49:11.760" style="s2">with consensual agreement we can talk</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.400" end="00:49:13.119" style="s2">about their inner relations in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.760" end="00:49:15.760" style="s2">particular way</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.119" end="00:49:17.440" style="s2">and uh you know i published a an article</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.760" end="00:49:18.640" style="s2">talking about yeah hey let&#39;s correspond</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.440" end="00:49:21.040" style="s2">this with big history</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.640" end="00:49:22.480" style="s2">um there are lots of then other language</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.040" end="00:49:23.680" style="s2">systems that i know you know that i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.480" end="00:49:26.000" style="s2">really interested in</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.680" end="00:49:26.720" style="s2">uh like uh well certainly integrals one</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.000" end="00:49:29.680" style="s2">example but</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.720" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">you know xyzac&#39;s uh language system uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.680" end="00:49:32.800" style="s2">you know you got me hooked on hegel i&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.280" end="00:49:34.720" style="s2">going back to hegel and making certain</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.800" end="00:49:37.760" style="s2">kinds of connections along those lines</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.720" end="00:49:40.480" style="s2">um but i do i really do see</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.760" end="00:49:41.119" style="s2">sort of this meta-modern uh sensibility</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.480" end="00:49:42.559" style="s2">happening</p>
<p begin="00:49:41.119" end="00:49:43.920" style="s2">where people are coming together with</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.559" end="00:49:45.839" style="s2">what i would call an integrated</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.920" end="00:49:47.280" style="s2">pluralistic sensibility and what i mean</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.839" end="00:49:47.839" style="s2">by that there&#39;s an appreciation for</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.280" end="00:49:50.720" style="s2">difference</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.839" end="00:49:51.599" style="s2">but there&#39;s also a central uh force of</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.720" end="00:49:53.440" style="s2">integration</p>
<p begin="00:49:51.599" end="00:49:55.200" style="s2">uh and looking to correspond uh</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.440" end="00:49:56.079" style="s2">different systems not so much in a</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.200" end="00:49:58.640" style="s2">competitive</p>
<p begin="00:49:56.079" end="00:49:59.920" style="s2">hey you have to talk this way but here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:58.640" end="00:50:02.000" style="s2">a system that makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.920" end="00:50:03.760" style="s2">do you see it your way you know what are</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.000" end="00:50:06.000" style="s2">the things that we&#39;re saying to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.760" end="00:50:07.200" style="s2">real what&#39;s the void uh to use the</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.000" end="00:50:07.599" style="s2">language you and i would be familiar</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.200" end="00:50:10.319" style="s2">with</p>
<p begin="00:50:07.599" end="00:50:11.599" style="s2">uh and then you know and knowing that no</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.319" end="00:50:12.160" style="s2">system is going to be sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.599" end="00:50:14.160" style="s2">absolute</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.160" end="00:50:15.520" style="s2">truth but the correspondence between</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.160" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">meta systems is something i&#39;m very</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.520" end="00:50:18.079" style="s2">interested in</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.160" end="00:50:24.400" style="s2">okay thanks that&#39;s that&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.079" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">points to go off in the future</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.400" end="00:50:27.839" style="s2">so thanks</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.319" end="00:50:32.800" style="s2">um i&#39;m going to read out the next</p>
<p begin="00:50:30.720" end="00:50:35.680" style="s2">questions from ernesto</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.800" end="00:50:37.280" style="s2">um it&#39;s a slightly different take this</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.680" end="00:50:39.359" style="s2">is going to be interesting</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.280" end="00:50:41.920" style="s2">um just a few days ago a nobel prize was</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.359" end="00:50:43.680" style="s2">a board awarded to roger penrose for his</p>
<p begin="00:50:41.920" end="00:50:46.800" style="s2">theories about the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:50:43.680" end="00:50:48.880" style="s2">not being the start of everything so far</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.800" end="00:50:49.359" style="s2">it would seem like the tok theory in all</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.880" end="00:50:51.040" style="s2">human</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.359" end="00:50:54.400" style="s2">scientific knowledge has been restricted</p>
<p begin="00:50:51.040" end="00:50:56.400" style="s2">to events after the big bang considering</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.400" end="00:50:57.040" style="s2">that the bible verses you showed suggest</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.400" end="00:50:59.760" style="s2">that god</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.040" end="00:51:01.040" style="s2">equals language and that those predate</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.760" end="00:51:03.520" style="s2">everything</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.040" end="00:51:04.640" style="s2">um and here&#39;s the question is religion</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.520" end="00:51:06.720" style="s2">the only way</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.640" end="00:51:08.720" style="s2">to work with that which could have</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.720" end="00:51:10.800" style="s2">existed since before</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.720" end="00:51:12.000" style="s2">or has given rise to current physical</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.800" end="00:51:13.760" style="s2">reality</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.000" end="00:51:15.280" style="s2">and any knowledge we can gather</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.760" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">scientifically</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.280" end="00:51:18.640" style="s2">or by means of our mind</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.200" end="00:51:23.359" style="s2">huh that&#39;s a okay that&#39;s a let me unpack</p>
<p begin="00:51:21.760" end="00:51:27.599" style="s2">that a little bit good question</p>
<p begin="00:51:23.359" end="00:51:30.000" style="s2">um so yeah let me</p>
<p begin="00:51:27.599" end="00:51:31.760" style="s2">well let me let me contextualize what i</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.000" end="00:51:32.160" style="s2">think of in terms of human knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:51:31.760" end="00:51:34.960" style="s2">this</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.160" end="00:51:37.119" style="s2">this can uh bridge off at cadell&#39;s point</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.960" end="00:51:38.640" style="s2">as i&#39;ve said many times</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.119" end="00:51:40.400" style="s2">it depends on what you mean by the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.640" end="00:51:42.400" style="s2">bang but if the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.400" end="00:51:44.160" style="s2">i&#39;ll start with one comment if the big</p>
<p begin="00:51:42.400" end="00:51:46.480" style="s2">bang turns out to be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.160" end="00:51:47.760" style="s2">okay much of the edifice of my</p>
<p begin="00:51:46.480" end="00:51:49.599" style="s2">justification system</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.760" end="00:51:51.040" style="s2">definitely is built on some of that and</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.599" end="00:51:52.240" style="s2">then my arguments are</p>
<p begin="00:51:51.040" end="00:51:54.240" style="s2">wrong or at least need to be</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.240" end="00:51:56.079" style="s2">significantly updated so the first thing</p>
<p begin="00:51:54.240" end="00:51:57.040" style="s2">i want to say is our knowledge systems</p>
<p begin="00:51:56.079" end="00:51:59.440" style="s2">are fallible</p>
<p begin="00:51:57.040" end="00:52:01.280" style="s2">um that&#39;s inevitable nature of science</p>
<p begin="00:51:59.440" end="00:52:03.119" style="s2">uh you make certain suppositions</p>
<p begin="00:52:01.280" end="00:52:04.480" style="s2">there are variants on the big bang i</p>
<p begin="00:52:03.119" end="00:52:07.040" style="s2">want to be clear that</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.480" end="00:52:07.920" style="s2">lots of different variants that would be</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.040" end="00:52:10.880" style="s2">legitimate</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.920" end="00:52:12.559" style="s2">um there are explorations now on what</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.880" end="00:52:15.440" style="s2">what is behind the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.559" end="00:52:16.960" style="s2">um can we actually understand that the</p>
<p begin="00:52:15.440" end="00:52:18.559" style="s2">universe is a function of matter</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.960" end="00:52:20.079" style="s2">anti-matter waves</p>
<p begin="00:52:18.559" end="00:52:21.920" style="s2">uh and just this is that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.079" end="00:52:24.400" style="s2">implosion and then an explosion</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.920" end="00:52:25.440" style="s2">you know that stuff is not stuff that i</p>
<p begin="00:52:24.400" end="00:52:28.240" style="s2">have followed</p>
<p begin="00:52:25.440" end="00:52:30.000" style="s2">for me right now sort of the uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.240" end="00:52:32.960" style="s2">basically the big bang seems to be an</p>
<p begin="00:52:30.000" end="00:52:35.280" style="s2">epistemological and ontological horizon</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.960" end="00:52:36.400" style="s2">um in relationship to the question of</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.280" end="00:52:39.040" style="s2">god um</p>
<p begin="00:52:36.400" end="00:52:40.800" style="s2">for me what what it what the big bang</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.040" end="00:52:42.880" style="s2">comes out of is the void</p>
<p begin="00:52:40.800" end="00:52:44.480" style="s2">okay um and that ontological</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.880" end="00:52:47.680" style="s2">epistemological horizon</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.480" end="00:52:48.960" style="s2">can then uh basically then is where god</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.680" end="00:52:52.480" style="s2">can be found</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.960" end="00:52:54.240" style="s2">uh as it were um in terms of my point</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.480" end="00:52:54.880" style="s2">about in the beginning there was the</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.240" end="00:52:57.280" style="s2">word</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.880" end="00:52:59.760" style="s2">um i was really making the reference uh</p>
<p begin="00:52:57.280" end="00:53:01.200" style="s2">which certainly does connect to god and</p>
<p begin="00:52:59.760" end="00:53:02.319" style="s2">and those kinds of elements i was really</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.200" end="00:53:03.280" style="s2">making the reference that jordan</p>
<p begin="00:53:02.319" end="00:53:06.800" style="s2">peterson did</p>
<p begin="00:53:03.280" end="00:53:08.720" style="s2">which is that the fall in in paradise</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.800" end="00:53:10.000" style="s2">and eating from the apple really is</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.720" end="00:53:12.640" style="s2">about the emergence</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.000" end="00:53:14.160" style="s2">in humans of self-consciousness and</p>
<p begin="00:53:12.640" end="00:53:16.480" style="s2">propositional knowledge</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.160" end="00:53:18.319" style="s2">and the judgment uh and justification</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.480" end="00:53:19.760" style="s2">about what is good and evil</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.319" end="00:53:21.760" style="s2">and of course then that&#39;s going to give</p>
<p begin="00:53:19.760" end="00:53:23.599" style="s2">rise to our narratives about god</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.760" end="00:53:25.680" style="s2">i wasn&#39;t necessarily making an</p>
<p begin="00:53:23.599" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">ontological or metaphysical claim about</p>
<p begin="00:53:25.680" end="00:53:29.839" style="s2">god per se</p>
<p begin="00:53:33.839" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">ernesto did you have a follow-up</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.760" end="00:53:47.280" style="s2">okay cool um</p>
<p begin="00:53:48.000" end="00:53:51.520" style="s2">greg this is a a little bit of a</p>
<p begin="00:53:50.319" end="00:53:53.599" style="s2">different question</p>
<p begin="00:53:51.520" end="00:53:55.920" style="s2">okay it&#39;s from and he&#39;s also asked for</p>
<p begin="00:53:53.599" end="00:53:59.280" style="s2">me to read it out</p>
<p begin="00:53:55.920" end="00:54:02.319" style="s2">this came up today in conversation if an</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.280" end="00:54:03.599" style="s2">animal has consciousness is it capable</p>
<p begin="00:54:02.319" end="00:54:06.960" style="s2">of aesthetic</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.599" end="00:54:08.839" style="s2">ethical and poetic processes are animals</p>
<p begin="00:54:06.960" end="00:54:11.200" style="s2">moral or</p>
<p begin="00:54:08.839" end="00:54:14.400" style="s2">amoral great</p>
<p begin="00:54:11.200" end="00:54:15.839" style="s2">great question um you know i generally</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.400" end="00:54:18.480" style="s2">think of animals as a</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.839" end="00:54:19.920" style="s2">moral um and and i think that for</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.480" end="00:54:22.880" style="s2">morality does require</p>
<p begin="00:54:19.920" end="00:54:24.480" style="s2">self-conscious justification on a social</p>
<p begin="00:54:22.880" end="00:54:27.680" style="s2">stage okay</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.480" end="00:54:29.200" style="s2">and what i mean by that is is that um</p>
<p begin="00:54:27.680" end="00:54:30.240" style="s2">you know there is something radically</p>
<p begin="00:54:29.200" end="00:54:31.520" style="s2">different that happens at the</p>
<p begin="00:54:30.240" end="00:54:33.119" style="s2">self-conscious level</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.520" end="00:54:34.319" style="s2">when you start to explain your actions</p>
<p begin="00:54:33.119" end="00:54:35.280" style="s2">to others and are forced to give</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.319" end="00:54:36.599" style="s2">accounts</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.280" end="00:54:38.960" style="s2">and while animals have very</p>
<p begin="00:54:36.599" end="00:54:40.720" style="s2">sophisticated</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.960" end="00:54:42.799" style="s2">communication systems and certainly</p>
<p begin="00:54:40.720" end="00:54:44.799" style="s2">engage in some levels of feedback</p>
<p begin="00:54:42.799" end="00:54:46.880" style="s2">there&#39;s nothing in my estimation in the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.799" end="00:54:49.760" style="s2">animal kingdom that has the flexibility</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.880" end="00:54:51.359" style="s2">openness and fluidity of human language</p>
<p begin="00:54:49.760" end="00:54:52.720" style="s2">nor is there much in the way of</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.359" end="00:54:54.319" style="s2">indication that the level of their</p>
<p begin="00:54:52.720" end="00:54:57.359" style="s2">self-conscious reflection</p>
<p begin="00:54:54.319" end="00:55:00.160" style="s2">uh would then enable questions and</p>
<p begin="00:54:57.359" end="00:55:03.760" style="s2">philosophies and ideas about morality</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.160" end="00:55:06.880" style="s2">okay now that said um i certainly see</p>
<p begin="00:55:03.760" end="00:55:08.880" style="s2">lots of proto-morality in</p>
<p begin="00:55:06.880" end="00:55:10.960" style="s2">primates and what i mean by that is</p>
<p begin="00:55:08.880" end="00:55:14.000" style="s2">there&#39;s definitely a distinction</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.960" end="00:55:14.559" style="s2">between an attitude of care of an idea</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.000" end="00:55:17.440" style="s2">about what</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.559" end="00:55:18.960" style="s2">fairness is an idea about reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.440" end="00:55:21.440" style="s2">ideas about self-deception</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.960" end="00:55:22.400" style="s2">and frustration um there&#39;s an enormous</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.440" end="00:55:24.400" style="s2">amount of</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.400" end="00:55:25.760" style="s2">what we would immediately identify as</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.400" end="00:55:28.559" style="s2">ethical behavior</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.760" end="00:55:30.319" style="s2">and uh less than ethical behavior uh and</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.559" end="00:55:32.480" style="s2">project on to that for example</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.319" end="00:55:34.720" style="s2">if you&#39;re familiar with bonobos bonobos</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.480" end="00:55:36.640" style="s2">are a particular kind of</p>
<p begin="00:55:34.720" end="00:55:38.160" style="s2">related to a chimpanzee but you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:36.640" end="00:55:38.799" style="s2">different they&#39;re much more matriarchal</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.160" end="00:55:40.960" style="s2">they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:55:38.799" end="00:55:42.480" style="s2">tend to be much more cooperative much</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.960" end="00:55:45.119" style="s2">more giving much less</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.480" end="00:55:46.960" style="s2">aggressive and vindictive uh male chimps</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.119" end="00:55:48.000" style="s2">can be really aggressive and vindictive</p>
<p begin="00:55:46.960" end="00:55:50.720" style="s2">and hostile and</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.000" end="00:55:52.559" style="s2">and manipulative in certain regards and</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.720" end="00:55:54.480" style="s2">and downright vicious at times</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.559" end="00:55:56.160" style="s2">um we can see and we can see the</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.480" end="00:55:59.119" style="s2">responses of other creatures</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.160" end="00:56:00.720" style="s2">of other bonobos and chimpanzees to</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.119" end="00:56:02.480" style="s2">those kinds of behaviors</p>
<p begin="00:56:00.720" end="00:56:04.880" style="s2">in ways that are more complicated than</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.480" end="00:56:05.200" style="s2">just operant uh reward there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:04.880" end="00:56:07.200" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.200" end="00:56:08.720" style="s2">fairness there&#39;s a sense of reciprocity</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.200" end="00:56:10.000" style="s2">there&#39;s a sense of trust there&#39;s a sense</p>
<p begin="00:56:08.720" end="00:56:12.319" style="s2">of pride and shame</p>
<p begin="00:56:10.000" end="00:56:13.920" style="s2">i think in these creatures i don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:56:12.319" end="00:56:16.240" style="s2">you need full self-consciousness for</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.920" end="00:56:18.079" style="s2">pride and shame i can explain why</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.240" end="00:56:21.200" style="s2">but all of that again gives rise to an</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.079" end="00:56:23.440" style="s2">intuitive affective phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.200" end="00:56:24.480" style="s2">element that grounds all of our senses</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.440" end="00:56:26.319" style="s2">of morality</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.480" end="00:56:28.079" style="s2">however what they don&#39;t have is an</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.319" end="00:56:29.920" style="s2">explicit system of justification</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.079" end="00:56:32.000" style="s2">that they can feed back on ask questions</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.920" end="00:56:34.319" style="s2">about well is this really moral or not</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.000" end="00:56:35.200" style="s2">and for me a full moral creature has got</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.319" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">to be</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.200" end="00:56:39.280" style="s2">operating at that level of explicit</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.839" end="00:56:48.720" style="s2">feedback</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.599" end="00:56:51.040" style="s2">um peter peters forrester dropped an</p>
<p begin="00:56:48.720" end="00:56:52.079" style="s2">article into the chat about there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:56:51.040" end="00:56:54.000" style="s2">recent study</p>
<p begin="00:56:52.079" end="00:56:55.359" style="s2">um crows are capable of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.000" end="00:56:57.760" style="s2">thought science demonstrates for the</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.359" end="00:57:00.319" style="s2">first time</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.760" end="00:57:01.760" style="s2">yeah unbelievable so yeah and by</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.319" end="00:57:06.000" style="s2">conscious thought there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.760" end="00:57:07.680" style="s2">so crows uh lots of animals demonstrate</p>
<p begin="00:57:06.000" end="00:57:10.079" style="s2">self-reflective awareness</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.680" end="00:57:11.680" style="s2">okay at the proto level uh and we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:57:10.079" end="00:57:15.040" style="s2">done that&#39;s uh gordon golov</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.680" end="00:57:16.799" style="s2">developed a test uh and for determining</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.040" end="00:57:17.359" style="s2">whether or not an animal can recognize</p>
<p begin="00:57:16.799" end="00:57:19.760" style="s2">itself</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.359" end="00:57:21.599" style="s2">in the mirror um that we are seeing the</p>
<p begin="00:57:19.760" end="00:57:23.839" style="s2">expansion of conscious</p>
<p begin="00:57:21.599" end="00:57:25.359" style="s2">thought and by that awareness of whether</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.839" end="00:57:27.599" style="s2">or not the animal knows or not</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.359" end="00:57:28.640" style="s2">uh there&#39;s a study with the bumblebees</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.599" end="00:57:30.720" style="s2">that just came out</p>
<p begin="00:57:28.640" end="00:57:31.839" style="s2">uh that bumblebees can do cross-modal</p>
<p begin="00:57:30.720" end="00:57:34.400" style="s2">sense recognition</p>
<p begin="00:57:31.839" end="00:57:35.040" style="s2">okay so if you if you if it touches</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.400" end="00:57:36.559" style="s2">something</p>
<p begin="00:57:35.040" end="00:57:38.559" style="s2">and then it sees something it can</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.559" end="00:57:41.440" style="s2">recognize the thing that it&#39;s touched</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.559" end="00:57:43.200" style="s2">by what it saw in a bumblebee okay so</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.440" end="00:57:46.400" style="s2">there&#39;s no doubt that we are seeing</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.200" end="00:57:48.160" style="s2">serious cognitive capacities and as far</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.400" end="00:57:50.000" style="s2">as i&#39;m concerned absolutely crows will</p>
<p begin="00:57:48.160" end="00:57:51.920" style="s2">have experiential consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:57:50.000" end="00:57:54.079" style="s2">they&#39;ll have deliberation they&#39;ll even</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.920" end="00:57:54.880" style="s2">be able to have some demonstration of i</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.079" end="00:57:57.040" style="s2">know this</p>
<p begin="00:57:54.880" end="00:57:58.880" style="s2">relative to this that&#39;s very different</p>
<p begin="00:57:57.040" end="00:57:59.200" style="s2">than self-conscious justification i will</p>
<p begin="00:57:58.880" end="00:58:00.960" style="s2">say</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.200" end="00:58:02.160" style="s2">okay so conscious thought does when they</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.960" end="00:58:02.480" style="s2">say they&#39;re conscious they don&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.160" end="00:58:04.079" style="s2">like</p>
<p begin="00:58:02.480" end="00:58:05.440" style="s2">conscious like i&#39;m right now saying well</p>
<p begin="00:58:04.079" end="00:58:06.880" style="s2">should i say this or should we go on to</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.440" end="00:58:07.440" style="s2">the next question i&#39;m gonna reflect on</p>
<p begin="00:58:06.880" end="00:58:10.319" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="00:58:07.440" end="00:58:11.200" style="s2">uh explicit intersubjective narration is</p>
<p begin="00:58:10.319" end="00:58:13.760" style="s2">very different</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.200" end="00:58:15.599" style="s2">but an intuition of self what one knows</p>
<p begin="00:58:13.760" end="00:58:16.240" style="s2">what one doesn&#39;t even deception of other</p>
<p begin="00:58:15.599" end="00:58:18.160" style="s2">animals</p>
<p begin="00:58:16.240" end="00:58:20.240" style="s2">uh the higher animals so that and crows</p>
<p begin="00:58:18.160" end="00:58:23.119" style="s2">are some of the smartest creatures</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.240" end="00:58:24.720" style="s2">around no doubt which is kind of</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.119" end="00:58:26.000" style="s2">surprising given the brain size i mean</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.720" end="00:58:27.760" style="s2">we&#39;re all trying to find out about this</p>
<p begin="00:58:26.000" end="00:58:29.440" style="s2">i mean this is you know ethology and</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.760" end="00:58:30.799" style="s2">comparative psycho i prefer the term</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.440" end="00:58:33.119" style="s2">comparative psychology</p>
<p begin="00:58:30.799" end="00:58:34.079" style="s2">um or now the term cognitive ethology is</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.119" end="00:58:36.720" style="s2">very common</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.079" end="00:58:37.280" style="s2">um but you know great stuff and and i</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.720" end="00:58:40.640" style="s2">think it</p>
<p begin="00:58:37.280" end="00:58:42.799" style="s2">behooves us to embrace we&#39;ve undershot</p>
<p begin="00:58:40.640" end="00:58:44.480" style="s2">uh generally animal cognitive conscious</p>
<p begin="00:58:42.799" end="00:58:46.240" style="s2">capacities in my estimation</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.480" end="00:58:48.160" style="s2">i think it behooves us to look and</p>
<p begin="00:58:46.240" end="00:58:49.920" style="s2">embrace uh but it&#39;s also the case</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.160" end="00:58:51.359" style="s2">sometimes people overshoot and say oh</p>
<p begin="00:58:49.920" end="00:58:52.720" style="s2">they&#39;re just as smart as also they have</p>
<p begin="00:58:51.359" end="00:58:55.200" style="s2">language with us it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.720" end="00:58:56.799" style="s2">no just look at the last 50 000 years</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.200" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">you know something was a game changer in</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.799" end="00:58:59.520" style="s2">the way we behaved</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.400" end="00:59:04.000" style="s2">alex had a question to that his question</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.040" end="00:59:06.960" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:59:04.000" end="00:59:08.400" style="s2">is language necessary for morality a lot</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.960" end="00:59:09.520" style="s2">of videos show animals helping each</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.400" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">other out even when it&#39;s in their</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.520" end="00:59:12.000" style="s2">species</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.640" end="00:59:16.319" style="s2">well again it depends a lot on what you</p>
<p begin="00:59:14.319" end="00:59:17.839" style="s2">define by morality you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:16.319" end="00:59:19.520" style="s2">some people talk about rightness some</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.839" end="00:59:20.960" style="s2">people talk about goodness people have</p>
<p begin="00:59:19.520" end="00:59:23.200" style="s2">different theories of ethics</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.960" end="00:59:24.880" style="s2">okay if you have an absolute view of</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.200" end="00:59:27.040" style="s2">ethics absolutist being</p>
<p begin="00:59:24.880" end="00:59:29.200" style="s2">that you know that throughout the</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.040" end="00:59:30.400" style="s2">universe good and evil have existed star</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.200" end="00:59:32.720" style="s2">wars has an absolute view</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.400" end="00:59:34.480" style="s2">of ethics there&#39;s a good life force</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.720" end="00:59:36.319" style="s2">where you make sacrifice for the good of</p>
<p begin="00:59:34.480" end="00:59:38.240" style="s2">the commons or good of other people</p>
<p begin="00:59:36.319" end="00:59:40.000" style="s2">uh the ability to do that and to care</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.240" end="00:59:40.559" style="s2">about others is the definition of the</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.000" end="00:59:42.400" style="s2">good</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.559" end="00:59:44.079" style="s2">if you&#39;re selfish and you injure and you</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.400" end="00:59:45.200" style="s2">injure others just for your own selfish</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.079" end="00:59:46.960" style="s2">and pleasurable game</p>
<p begin="00:59:45.200" end="00:59:49.359" style="s2">then you&#39;re part of the dark force if</p>
<p begin="00:59:46.960" end="00:59:51.119" style="s2">you have an idea that the cosmos is</p>
<p begin="00:59:49.359" end="00:59:52.960" style="s2">governed by an absolute</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.119" end="00:59:54.240" style="s2">force of ethics then of course animals</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.960" end="00:59:56.799" style="s2">demonstrate uh</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.240" end="00:59:58.640" style="s2">care uh they demonstrate you know</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.799" end="01:00:01.040" style="s2">morality in that sense</p>
<p begin="00:59:58.640" end="01:00:03.040" style="s2">um that&#39;s not necessarily my definition</p>
<p begin="01:00:01.040" end="01:00:04.559" style="s2">of morality i believe proto-morality</p>
<p begin="01:00:03.040" end="01:00:06.960" style="s2">emerges as a function of</p>
<p begin="01:00:04.559" end="01:00:08.000" style="s2">relationship dynamics around cooperation</p>
<p begin="01:00:06.960" end="01:00:10.160" style="s2">and competition</p>
<p begin="01:00:08.000" end="01:00:12.400" style="s2">about dialectics of self and other about</p>
<p begin="01:00:10.160" end="01:00:14.880" style="s2">capacities to empathize and willingness</p>
<p begin="01:00:12.400" end="01:00:17.839" style="s2">is to empathize uh an empathetic</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.880" end="01:00:19.839" style="s2">view that is self-sacrificing is the is</p>
<p begin="01:00:17.839" end="01:00:21.760" style="s2">the phenomenological ground of our</p>
<p begin="01:00:19.839" end="01:00:23.119" style="s2">morality but we want to then basically</p>
<p begin="01:00:21.760" end="01:00:25.599" style="s2">be able to say hey</p>
<p begin="01:00:23.119" end="01:00:27.440" style="s2">well what actually is moral uh and then</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.599" end="01:00:29.280" style="s2">once you do that and then you have a</p>
<p begin="01:00:27.440" end="01:00:30.640" style="s2">i have a universalist constructionist</p>
<p begin="01:00:29.280" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">view of morality</p>
<p begin="01:00:30.640" end="01:00:34.000" style="s2">which basically means we&#39;re grounded in</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:35.440" style="s2">this notion</p>
<p begin="01:00:34.000" end="01:00:37.119" style="s2">and that&#39;s why we can get an enormous</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.440" end="01:00:38.240" style="s2">amount of agreement among people about</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.119" end="01:00:40.400" style="s2">what is morality</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.240" end="01:00:41.839" style="s2">but it is also the case that we bring it</p>
<p begin="01:00:40.400" end="01:00:44.400" style="s2">into being</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.839" end="01:00:45.599" style="s2">and have the freedom to make judgments</p>
<p begin="01:00:44.400" end="01:00:48.079" style="s2">about what is morality</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.599" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">rather than we discover its essence as</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.079" end="01:00:51.920" style="s2">existing in the universe before we came</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.839" end="01:01:02.000" style="s2">along</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.760" end="01:01:05.040" style="s2">um we have a couple more questions but</p>
<p begin="01:01:02.000" end="01:01:07.119" style="s2">there&#39;s not so much more time today</p>
<p begin="01:01:05.040" end="01:01:08.079" style="s2">what were you thinking greg do you think</p>
<p begin="01:01:07.119" end="01:01:10.160" style="s2">getting back to</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.079" end="01:01:11.280" style="s2">the presentation would make sense today</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.160" end="01:01:14.559" style="s2">carrying it on</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.280" end="01:01:16.400" style="s2">next time let&#39;s keep talking all right</p>
<p begin="01:01:14.559" end="01:01:18.799" style="s2">we have 15 minutes let&#39;s keep talking</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.400" end="01:01:20.480" style="s2">and uh so i certainly if i don&#39;t know if</p>
<p begin="01:01:18.799" end="01:01:21.119" style="s2">there&#39;s a communication process but if</p>
<p begin="01:01:20.480" end="01:01:22.640" style="s2">people</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.119" end="01:01:24.160" style="s2">want to see the garden they want to talk</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.640" end="01:01:24.960" style="s2">about consciousness they want more tree</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.160" end="01:01:26.640" style="s2">of knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.960" end="01:01:28.480" style="s2">uh there&#39;s metasite tech you know the</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.640" end="01:01:31.040" style="s2">whole thing&#39;s available you know</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.480" end="01:01:32.319" style="s2">we can i do classes on this thing so</p>
<p begin="01:01:31.040" end="01:01:32.880" style="s2">there&#39;s a lot of different directions we</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.319" end="01:01:34.400" style="s2">can go</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.880" end="01:01:36.000" style="s2">i&#39;d love to be responsive to where</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.400" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">people&#39;s interests are what feels alive</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.000" end="01:01:39.920" style="s2">for them um</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.799" end="01:01:44.160" style="s2">if you guys want to drop it into the</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.079" end="01:01:45.680" style="s2">chat um greg was talking about the third</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.160" end="01:01:48.400" style="s2">session would be with zach so</p>
<p begin="01:01:45.680" end="01:01:49.760" style="s2">i think that leaves two other sessions</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.400" end="01:01:51.359" style="s2">um a few</p>
<p begin="01:01:49.760" end="01:01:53.760" style="s2">of the topics that greg&#39;s mentioned like</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.359" end="01:01:56.160" style="s2">the metapsych tech or the justification</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.760" end="01:01:57.440" style="s2">hypothesis well what speaks to mind i</p>
<p begin="01:01:56.160" end="01:01:58.079" style="s2">think that could be helpful as greg just</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.440" end="01:02:00.400" style="s2">said</p>
<p begin="01:01:58.079" end="01:02:00.400" style="s2">um</p>
<p begin="01:02:01.520" end="01:02:04.640" style="s2">peter sforza had a question that kind of</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.760" end="01:02:07.839" style="s2">takes it back</p>
<p begin="01:02:04.640" end="01:02:09.039" style="s2">to tok and psychology um you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.839" end="01:02:10.319" style="s2">if you don&#39;t mind fielding that</p>
<p begin="01:02:09.039" end="01:02:12.480" style="s2">uh peter did you want to ask you a</p>
<p begin="01:02:10.319" end="01:02:14.880" style="s2">question i&#39;d love to yeah</p>
<p begin="01:02:12.480" end="01:02:15.920" style="s2">thanks angen uh yeah i appreciate this</p>
<p begin="01:02:14.880" end="01:02:18.160" style="s2">greg</p>

<p begin="01:02:18.160" end="01:02:20.240" style="s2">being frustrated with sort of the limits</p>
<p begin="01:02:19.599" end="01:02:22.559" style="s2">of</p>
<p begin="01:02:20.240" end="01:02:23.760" style="s2">uh modeling simulation visualization and</p>

<p begin="01:02:23.760" end="01:02:27.280" style="s2">competing models and hypotheses and so i</p>
<p begin="01:02:26.720" end="01:02:29.599" style="s2">read your</p>
<p begin="01:02:27.280" end="01:02:31.039" style="s2">i found your paper which i think is part</p>
<p begin="01:02:29.599" end="01:02:32.400" style="s2">of the backstory to the tree of</p>
<p begin="01:02:31.039" end="01:02:34.720" style="s2">knowledge</p>
<p begin="01:02:32.400" end="01:02:35.760" style="s2">and i was wondering if you could speak</p>
<p begin="01:02:34.720" end="01:02:37.520" style="s2">to how</p>
<p begin="01:02:35.760" end="01:02:38.799" style="s2">within the field and discipline of</p>
<p begin="01:02:37.520" end="01:02:41.839" style="s2">psychology you</p>
<p begin="01:02:38.799" end="01:02:45.280" style="s2">saw two major competing hypotheses and</p>
<p begin="01:02:41.839" end="01:02:48.400" style="s2">paraphrasing and worked to resolve those</p>
<p begin="01:02:45.280" end="01:02:49.599" style="s2">that i think the method there is a</p>
<p begin="01:02:48.400" end="01:02:52.000" style="s2">useful</p>
<p begin="01:02:49.599" end="01:02:53.440" style="s2">and general purpose kind of sense-making</p>
<p begin="01:02:52.000" end="01:02:57.680" style="s2">and meaning</p>
<p begin="01:02:53.440" end="01:02:59.200" style="s2">tool yeah thanks for that and and so</p>
<p begin="01:02:57.680" end="01:03:00.400" style="s2">i do believe that that&#39;s the case i</p>
<p begin="01:02:59.200" end="01:03:01.520" style="s2">think you see it like in peter&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:00.400" end="01:03:03.599" style="s2">leadership here</p>
<p begin="01:03:01.520" end="01:03:05.039" style="s2">because what happened to me uh was as</p>
<p begin="01:03:03.599" end="01:03:08.880" style="s2">follows so i came up</p>
<p begin="01:03:05.039" end="01:03:10.960" style="s2">in my undergrad i bought the empirical</p>
<p begin="01:03:08.880" end="01:03:12.640" style="s2">version of reality for psychology</p>
<p begin="01:03:10.960" end="01:03:15.520" style="s2">okay so that&#39;s mainstream academic</p>
<p begin="01:03:12.640" end="01:03:17.440" style="s2">psychology you take a psych 101 course</p>
<p begin="01:03:15.520" end="01:03:19.119" style="s2">they say psychology is this field it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:03:17.440" end="01:03:19.760" style="s2">about the science of behavior and mental</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.119" end="01:03:20.960" style="s2">process</p>
<p begin="01:03:19.760" end="01:03:23.440" style="s2">and then they drop in and they</p>
<p begin="01:03:20.960" end="01:03:25.200" style="s2">immediately say well we don&#39;t you know</p>
<p begin="01:03:23.440" end="01:03:26.559" style="s2">now it&#39;s about science and then they</p>
<p begin="01:03:25.200" end="01:03:28.720" style="s2">basically teach you that</p>
<p begin="01:03:26.559" end="01:03:31.440" style="s2">science is about empirical epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:03:28.720" end="01:03:32.880" style="s2">okay which i love science i&#39;m a hardcore</p>
<p begin="01:03:31.440" end="01:03:36.400" style="s2">scientist at one level</p>
<p begin="01:03:32.880" end="01:03:40.000" style="s2">um but what you realize over time</p>
<p begin="01:03:36.400" end="01:03:43.200" style="s2">okay is that uh facts are theory laden</p>
<p begin="01:03:40.000" end="01:03:45.599" style="s2">okay that that facts don&#39;t just exist</p>
<p begin="01:03:43.200" end="01:03:47.760" style="s2">findings don&#39;t exist thomas kuhn of</p>
<p begin="01:03:45.599" end="01:03:49.440" style="s2">course made a famous philosopher</p>
<p begin="01:03:47.760" end="01:03:51.359" style="s2">historian of science you know talked</p>
<p begin="01:03:49.440" end="01:03:53.680" style="s2">about paradigms and really</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.359" end="01:03:55.359" style="s2">facts reside in paradigms i tell the</p>
<p begin="01:03:53.680" end="01:03:56.400" style="s2">story when i was at the university of</p>
<p begin="01:03:55.359" end="01:03:59.359" style="s2">pennsylvania</p>
<p begin="01:03:56.400" end="01:04:00.240" style="s2">um i worked under back uh and jr t beck</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.359" end="01:04:02.000" style="s2">he&#39;s a famous</p>
<p begin="01:04:00.240" end="01:04:03.680" style="s2">uh psychiatrist actually although he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.000" end="01:04:05.680" style="s2">totally influential in psychology</p>
<p begin="01:04:03.680" end="01:04:07.039" style="s2">for cognitive psychotherapy and we were</p>
<p begin="01:04:05.680" end="01:04:08.960" style="s2">treating individuals who</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.039" end="01:04:11.359" style="s2">made a suicide recently made a suicide</p>
<p begin="01:04:08.960" end="01:04:13.280" style="s2">attempt brought all those individuals in</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.359" end="01:04:14.400" style="s2">we ran the study for a year and it was a</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.280" end="01:04:17.280" style="s2">complete failure</p>
<p begin="01:04:14.400" end="01:04:17.680" style="s2">for a year um why these are individuals</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.280" end="01:04:20.079" style="s2">who were</p>
<p begin="01:04:17.680" end="01:04:21.359" style="s2">a quarter of them were homeless really</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.079" end="01:04:24.799" style="s2">really tough scenarios</p>
<p begin="01:04:21.359" end="01:04:26.400" style="s2">uh 75 percent made less than 15 000</p>
<p begin="01:04:24.799" end="01:04:27.920" style="s2">a year in philadelphia so think about</p>
<p begin="01:04:26.400" end="01:04:29.920" style="s2">living off of that um</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.920" end="01:04:31.440" style="s2">seventy-five percent uh had substance</p>
<p begin="01:04:29.920" end="01:04:33.200" style="s2">use problems multiple</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.440" end="01:04:34.640" style="s2">disorders and by definition they came in</p>
<p begin="01:04:33.200" end="01:04:37.359" style="s2">making a suicide attempt</p>
<p begin="01:04:34.640" end="01:04:38.799" style="s2">my job was to run this study um we ran</p>
<p begin="01:04:37.359" end="01:04:40.000" style="s2">it for a while i figured out a few</p>
<p begin="01:04:38.799" end="01:04:43.119" style="s2">things about how to get people</p>
<p begin="01:04:40.000" end="01:04:46.000" style="s2">in but then i couldn&#39;t get them in uh to</p>
<p begin="01:04:43.119" end="01:04:48.160" style="s2">uh stay and then bec learned about that</p>
<p begin="01:04:46.000" end="01:04:49.920" style="s2">sort of blew up we all had a big meeting</p>
<p begin="01:04:48.160" end="01:04:51.599" style="s2">and we changed the study in lots of</p>
<p begin="01:04:49.920" end="01:04:53.599" style="s2">different ways okay</p>
<p begin="01:04:51.599" end="01:04:55.039" style="s2">um and i&#39;ll get back to your peter your</p>
<p begin="01:04:53.599" end="01:04:55.520" style="s2">question in a second this just makes the</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.039" end="01:04:57.200" style="s2">point</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.520" end="01:04:58.720" style="s2">we changed the study in a wide variety</p>
<p begin="01:04:57.200" end="01:05:01.760" style="s2">of different ways uh</p>
<p begin="01:04:58.720" end="01:05:03.440" style="s2">and then we reinstituted it and lo and</p>
<p begin="01:05:01.760" end="01:05:04.960" style="s2">behold it was a success</p>
<p begin="01:05:03.440" end="01:05:07.039" style="s2">now how did we change the study well</p>
<p begin="01:05:04.960" end="01:05:09.200" style="s2">virtually everything we did had a social</p>
<p begin="01:05:07.039" end="01:05:11.039" style="s2">work or humanistic flavor to it</p>
<p begin="01:05:09.200" end="01:05:13.359" style="s2">okay that is we created wrap-around</p>
<p begin="01:05:11.039" end="01:05:14.960" style="s2">services we maintain contact with them</p>
<p begin="01:05:13.359" end="01:05:16.559" style="s2">i actually took over some of the therapy</p>
<p begin="01:05:14.960" end="01:05:19.200" style="s2">i hired and showed how to do</p>
<p begin="01:05:16.559" end="01:05:20.000" style="s2">people to do we did all of these things</p>
<p begin="01:05:19.200" end="01:05:22.000" style="s2">okay</p>
<p begin="01:05:20.000" end="01:05:24.000" style="s2">and if we had done all of those things</p>
<p begin="01:05:22.000" end="01:05:26.480" style="s2">in the context of say having consulted</p>
<p begin="01:05:24.000" end="01:05:28.160" style="s2">a professor of social work they would</p>
<p begin="01:05:26.480" end="01:05:29.760" style="s2">have come along and said oh my god</p>
<p begin="01:05:28.160" end="01:05:31.520" style="s2">the social work intervention is what</p>
<p begin="01:05:29.760" end="01:05:32.640" style="s2">makes all the difference i mean you have</p>
<p begin="01:05:31.520" end="01:05:35.839" style="s2">the data right there</p>
<p begin="01:05:32.640" end="01:05:37.839" style="s2">okay well in becky and the land when the</p>
<p begin="01:05:35.839" end="01:05:40.160" style="s2">focus is on becky and cognitive therapy</p>
<p begin="01:05:37.839" end="01:05:41.119" style="s2">all of those changes are interpreted as</p>
<p begin="01:05:40.160" end="01:05:43.359" style="s2">tweaks</p>
<p begin="01:05:41.119" end="01:05:44.640" style="s2">necessary to deliver the intervention so</p>
<p begin="01:05:43.359" end="01:05:46.000" style="s2">we didn&#39;t write them up at all</p>
<p begin="01:05:44.640" end="01:05:47.680" style="s2">i just talked about them when i made a</p>
<p begin="01:05:46.000" end="01:05:50.559" style="s2">presentation so</p>
<p begin="01:05:47.680" end="01:05:51.839" style="s2">all of those efforts were seen as error</p>
<p begin="01:05:50.559" end="01:05:53.839" style="s2">and necessary tweaks</p>
<p begin="01:05:51.839" end="01:05:55.280" style="s2">yet if we had a different paradigm we</p>
<p begin="01:05:53.839" end="01:05:56.319" style="s2">would have said that&#39;s the central</p>
<p begin="01:05:55.280" end="01:05:59.039" style="s2">intervention</p>
<p begin="01:05:56.319" end="01:06:00.799" style="s2">okay and so what that shows and then</p>
<p begin="01:05:59.039" end="01:06:01.760" style="s2">what i learned in my graduate training</p>
<p begin="01:06:00.799" end="01:06:03.440" style="s2">was gosh</p>
<p begin="01:06:01.760" end="01:06:05.200" style="s2">sometimes i look at somebody and yeah</p>
<p begin="01:06:03.440" end="01:06:07.200" style="s2">those negative thoughts really do seem</p>
<p begin="01:06:05.200" end="01:06:08.640" style="s2">to be feeding back on some people</p>
<p begin="01:06:07.200" end="01:06:10.400" style="s2">but sometimes i&#39;m working with somebody</p>
<p begin="01:06:08.640" end="01:06:11.119" style="s2">and their their thoughts seem okay but</p>
<p begin="01:06:10.400" end="01:06:13.599" style="s2">they&#39;re deep</p>
<p begin="01:06:11.119" end="01:06:14.400" style="s2">dark feelings they seem so defended</p>
<p begin="01:06:13.599" end="01:06:16.400" style="s2">against them</p>
<p begin="01:06:14.400" end="01:06:17.920" style="s2">okay that they seem really shallow in</p>
<p begin="01:06:16.400" end="01:06:18.960" style="s2">other words i want to go a deep dive</p>
<p begin="01:06:17.920" end="01:06:21.280" style="s2">into a young in</p>
<p begin="01:06:18.960" end="01:06:22.079" style="s2">depth psychology frame and other times</p>
<p begin="01:06:21.280" end="01:06:23.920" style="s2">the damn</p>
<p begin="01:06:22.079" end="01:06:25.280" style="s2">family system is so chaotic i think</p>
<p begin="01:06:23.920" end="01:06:26.000" style="s2">they&#39;re suffering you know if anybody</p>
<p begin="01:06:25.280" end="01:06:28.799" style="s2">saw the</p>
<p begin="01:06:26.000" end="01:06:30.000" style="s2">ordinary uh people it&#39;s a great movie in</p>
<p begin="01:06:28.799" end="01:06:32.079" style="s2">1980s like</p>
<p begin="01:06:30.000" end="01:06:34.000" style="s2">really the guy looks like he&#39;s this one</p>
<p begin="01:06:32.079" end="01:06:34.960" style="s2">that&#39;s got ptsd and depression but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.000" end="01:06:37.280" style="s2">the mom</p>
<p begin="01:06:34.960" end="01:06:39.119" style="s2">and the family system that&#39;s all f&#39;d up</p>
<p begin="01:06:37.280" end="01:06:40.160" style="s2">okay so family systems view is</p>
<p begin="01:06:39.119" end="01:06:42.240" style="s2">absolutely central</p>
<p begin="01:06:40.160" end="01:06:43.760" style="s2">so over and over again i saw all these</p>
<p begin="01:06:42.240" end="01:06:45.599" style="s2">different frames of reference</p>
<p begin="01:06:43.760" end="01:06:47.200" style="s2">uh sometimes they were sort of these</p>
<p begin="01:06:45.599" end="01:06:48.640" style="s2">iconic exemplars</p>
<p begin="01:06:47.200" end="01:06:50.880" style="s2">and then the question is well how do you</p>
<p begin="01:06:48.640" end="01:06:51.440" style="s2">move through them how do you steel man</p>
<p begin="01:06:50.880" end="01:06:54.160" style="s2">them</p>
<p begin="01:06:51.440" end="01:06:55.839" style="s2">okay how do you respect that perspective</p>
<p begin="01:06:54.160" end="01:06:57.440" style="s2">without necessarily getting trapped and</p>
<p begin="01:06:55.839" end="01:07:00.079" style="s2">then defined against</p>
<p begin="01:06:57.440" end="01:07:02.160" style="s2">okay and that&#39;s a really key area and i</p>
<p begin="01:07:00.079" end="01:07:04.240" style="s2">think that what like the soa tries to do</p>
<p begin="01:07:02.160" end="01:07:06.079" style="s2">and all these meme wars is everybody</p>
<p begin="01:07:04.240" end="01:07:08.240" style="s2">gets committed to their virgin reality</p>
<p begin="01:07:06.079" end="01:07:10.160" style="s2">as if it&#39;s the only version of reality</p>
<p begin="01:07:08.240" end="01:07:11.520" style="s2">no it&#39;s actually an island of a version</p>
<p begin="01:07:10.160" end="01:07:13.760" style="s2">of reality in a</p>
<p begin="01:07:11.520" end="01:07:15.680" style="s2">sea of different possible versions of</p>
<p begin="01:07:13.760" end="01:07:18.640" style="s2">reality so wake up to that</p>
<p begin="01:07:15.680" end="01:07:20.000" style="s2">okay now there that does you can&#39;t stop</p>
<p begin="01:07:18.640" end="01:07:22.240" style="s2">there from my vantage point because then</p>
<p begin="01:07:20.000" end="01:07:23.680" style="s2">all you basically get is eclectic chaos</p>
<p begin="01:07:22.240" end="01:07:26.000" style="s2">all right so then the question is is</p>
<p begin="01:07:23.680" end="01:07:29.039" style="s2">there a meta superordinate level</p>
<p begin="01:07:26.000" end="01:07:30.319" style="s2">upon which you can actually see themes</p>
<p begin="01:07:29.039" end="01:07:32.079" style="s2">you know so you have a thesis and</p>
<p begin="01:07:30.319" end="01:07:32.960" style="s2">antithesis is there any kind of</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.079" end="01:07:35.119" style="s2">synthesis</p>
<p begin="01:07:32.960" end="01:07:37.119" style="s2">uh and that&#39;s what i started hunting for</p>
<p begin="01:07:35.119" end="01:07:39.039" style="s2">uh for me my first step then was</p>
<p begin="01:07:37.119" end="01:07:40.720" style="s2">i had to get out of the psychotherapy</p>
<p begin="01:07:39.039" end="01:07:43.359" style="s2">and in back into the science</p>
<p begin="01:07:40.720" end="01:07:45.760" style="s2">i got back into evolutionary psychology</p>
<p begin="01:07:43.359" end="01:07:47.280" style="s2">um which then provided me a step back i</p>
<p begin="01:07:45.760" end="01:07:49.119" style="s2">was actually a meta so i could see</p>
<p begin="01:07:47.280" end="01:07:50.400" style="s2">actually all the major paradigms at</p>
<p begin="01:07:49.119" end="01:07:53.359" style="s2">least adopt him and</p>
<p begin="01:07:50.400" end="01:07:54.799" style="s2">so there&#39;s a line of agreement um</p>
<p begin="01:07:53.359" end="01:07:56.720" style="s2">unfortunately from my vantage point</p>
<p begin="01:07:54.799" end="01:07:58.480" style="s2">evolutionary psychology was committed to</p>
<p begin="01:07:56.720" end="01:08:00.400" style="s2">too many different</p>
<p begin="01:07:58.480" end="01:08:01.920" style="s2">assumptions that were rigid that got</p>
<p begin="01:08:00.400" end="01:08:02.799" style="s2">itself defined against like cultural</p>
<p begin="01:08:01.920" end="01:08:04.640" style="s2">psychology</p>
<p begin="01:08:02.799" end="01:08:06.799" style="s2">and behavioral learning psychology in</p>
<p begin="01:08:04.640" end="01:08:07.440" style="s2">problematic ways and so i tried to avoid</p>
<p begin="01:08:06.799" end="01:08:10.400" style="s2">that</p>
<p begin="01:08:07.440" end="01:08:11.280" style="s2">um and then i got lucky i had a set of</p>
<p begin="01:08:10.400" end="01:08:12.720" style="s2">insights and</p>
<p begin="01:08:11.280" end="01:08:14.720" style="s2">boom and then when the things were</p>
<p begin="01:08:12.720" end="01:08:16.480" style="s2">tweaked and then all of a sudden</p>
<p begin="01:08:14.720" end="01:08:18.560" style="s2">i could see that everybody was saying</p>
<p begin="01:08:16.480" end="01:08:20.080" style="s2">something valid um but at the same time</p>
<p begin="01:08:18.560" end="01:08:20.960" style="s2">i had a position where i could harmonize</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.080" end="01:08:22.799" style="s2">it well</p>
<p begin="01:08:20.960" end="01:08:25.520" style="s2">then that&#39;s where i&#39;d want to go i&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:08:22.799" end="01:08:27.279" style="s2">been very disappointed with the academy</p>
<p begin="01:08:25.520" end="01:08:28.640" style="s2">because the academy claims that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:08:27.279" end="01:08:30.239" style="s2">after these kinds of things</p>
<p begin="01:08:28.640" end="01:08:32.080" style="s2">but the fact of the matter is it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="01:08:30.239" end="01:08:33.440" style="s2">about the contingencies that the academy</p>
<p begin="01:08:32.080" end="01:08:36.080" style="s2">is now structured under</p>
<p begin="01:08:33.440" end="01:08:37.759" style="s2">okay so for me to come out and say you</p>
<p begin="01:08:36.080" end="01:08:39.359" style="s2">know psychology actually nobody knows</p>
<p begin="01:08:37.759" end="01:08:41.120" style="s2">what the f psychology is</p>
<p begin="01:08:39.359" end="01:08:42.880" style="s2">and its commitment to empirical</p>
<p begin="01:08:41.120" end="01:08:44.319" style="s2">eclecticism actually</p>
<p begin="01:08:42.880" end="01:08:46.080" style="s2">means that basically what you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="01:08:44.319" end="01:08:48.239" style="s2">is you&#39;re hiring full professors</p>
<p begin="01:08:46.080" end="01:08:49.440" style="s2">to build super sophisticated empirical</p>
<p begin="01:08:48.239" end="01:08:51.359" style="s2">sand castles</p>
<p begin="01:08:49.440" end="01:08:52.799" style="s2">okay what i mean by that is they have</p>
<p begin="01:08:51.359" end="01:08:54.640" style="s2">their operational definitions</p>
<p begin="01:08:52.799" end="01:08:56.000" style="s2">they find what they need they get all</p>
<p begin="01:08:54.640" end="01:08:57.359" style="s2">their funding they get their doc</p>
<p begin="01:08:56.000" end="01:08:58.719" style="s2">students and yeah you can get like</p>
<p begin="01:08:57.359" end="01:08:59.359" style="s2">growth mindset and it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="01:08:58.719" end="01:09:02.080" style="s2">interesting</p>
<p begin="01:08:59.359" end="01:09:03.359" style="s2">but it sits in a particular relatively</p>
<p begin="01:09:02.080" end="01:09:04.239" style="s2">narrow paradigm</p>
<p begin="01:09:03.359" end="01:09:05.359" style="s2">and then what&#39;s going to happen</p>
<p begin="01:09:04.239" end="01:09:06.960" style="s2">somebody&#39;s going to come along they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="01:09:05.359" end="01:09:07.920" style="s2">redefining i mean growth mindset</p>
<p begin="01:09:06.960" end="01:09:10.719" style="s2">basically is like</p>
<p begin="01:09:07.920" end="01:09:13.359" style="s2">interior locus of control that roger did</p>
<p begin="01:09:10.719" end="01:09:15.440" style="s2">back in 1955 for the love of god</p>
<p begin="01:09:13.359" end="01:09:17.440" style="s2">okay we&#39;ve known about this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:09:15.440" end="01:09:18.960" style="s2">stuff they just put it in to put the</p>
<p begin="01:09:17.440" end="01:09:20.560" style="s2">lips different lipstick on the pig and</p>
<p begin="01:09:18.960" end="01:09:21.920" style="s2">get it out there but the fact of the</p>
<p begin="01:09:20.560" end="01:09:22.480" style="s2">matter is that we&#39;re not getting</p>
<p begin="01:09:21.920" end="01:09:24.960" style="s2">different</p>
<p begin="01:09:22.480" end="01:09:25.600" style="s2">cumulative elements so my response to</p>
<p begin="01:09:24.960" end="01:09:27.359" style="s2">you is</p>
<p begin="01:09:25.600" end="01:09:28.960" style="s2">going to hold different positions want</p>
<p begin="01:09:27.359" end="01:09:31.120" style="s2">to do it non-defensively</p>
<p begin="01:09:28.960" end="01:09:32.719" style="s2">want to steal ban various elements when</p>
<p begin="01:09:31.120" end="01:09:34.960" style="s2">you see contradiction wonder</p>
<p begin="01:09:32.719" end="01:09:36.799" style="s2">about a higher order synthesis and also</p>
<p begin="01:09:34.960" end="01:09:39.120" style="s2">look at how trapped the academy is</p>
<p begin="01:09:36.799" end="01:09:40.400" style="s2">in relationships how entrenched it is</p>
<p begin="01:09:39.120" end="01:09:44.719" style="s2">and once it gets established</p>
<p begin="01:09:40.400" end="01:09:44.719" style="s2">man it&#39;s it&#39;s really really hard to move</p>
<p begin="01:09:46.839" end="01:09:52.000" style="s2">yeah yeah it sounds like um</p>
<p begin="01:09:50.319" end="01:09:53.839" style="s2">more towards like a pluralistic</p>
<p begin="01:09:52.000" end="01:09:56.080" style="s2">epistemology and</p>
<p begin="01:09:53.839" end="01:09:57.360" style="s2">i agree in the academy it&#39;s challenged</p>
<p begin="01:09:56.080" end="01:09:59.040" style="s2">with the incentive structures and</p>
<p begin="01:09:57.360" end="01:10:01.120" style="s2">whatnot um</p>
<p begin="01:09:59.040" end="01:10:02.800" style="s2">in the modeling simvis community we kind</p>
<p begin="01:10:01.120" end="01:10:05.440" style="s2">of think about composability</p>
<p begin="01:10:02.800" end="01:10:08.640" style="s2">interoperability as a grand challenge</p>
<p begin="01:10:05.440" end="01:10:11.360" style="s2">and so the follow up would be you showed</p>
<p begin="01:10:08.640" end="01:10:12.000" style="s2">in your gestalt uh the movement from</p>
<p begin="01:10:11.360" end="01:10:14.880" style="s2">data</p>
<p begin="01:10:12.000" end="01:10:16.320" style="s2">information knowledge wisdom and in the</p>
<p begin="01:10:14.880" end="01:10:18.400" style="s2">mod sim vis let&#39;s say we have</p>
<p begin="01:10:16.320" end="01:10:20.159" style="s2">architectures for data data</p>
<p begin="01:10:18.400" end="01:10:22.239" style="s2">architectures info architectures</p>
<p begin="01:10:20.159" end="01:10:23.679" style="s2">knowledge architectures</p>
<p begin="01:10:22.239" end="01:10:25.840" style="s2">what do you think about wisdom</p>
<p begin="01:10:23.679" end="01:10:28.239" style="s2">architectures in that</p>
<p begin="01:10:25.840" end="01:10:30.239" style="s2">um what would that mean in this kind of</p>
<p begin="01:10:28.239" end="01:10:32.640" style="s2">pluralistic epistemology</p>
<p begin="01:10:30.239" end="01:10:34.960" style="s2">sure uh i will say i want to be clear</p>
<p begin="01:10:32.640" end="01:10:37.360" style="s2">i&#39;m a meta-modernist not a postmodernist</p>
<p begin="01:10:34.960" end="01:10:38.320" style="s2">okay so post-modernism just embraces the</p>
<p begin="01:10:37.360" end="01:10:41.120" style="s2">pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:10:38.320" end="01:10:42.239" style="s2">uh but then it through usually a</p>
<p begin="01:10:41.120" end="01:10:44.400" style="s2">critique of</p>
<p begin="01:10:42.239" end="01:10:45.440" style="s2">modernism and the injustices that are</p>
<p begin="01:10:44.400" end="01:10:47.760" style="s2">associated with that</p>
<p begin="01:10:45.440" end="01:10:48.640" style="s2">and then that embraces marginalized</p>
<p begin="01:10:47.760" end="01:10:50.880" style="s2">pluralistic</p>
<p begin="01:10:48.640" end="01:10:51.840" style="s2">uh uh systems which at a justice level</p>
<p begin="01:10:50.880" end="01:10:53.760" style="s2">is good but</p>
<p begin="01:10:51.840" end="01:10:55.600" style="s2">in and of itself then it serves as a</p>
<p begin="01:10:53.760" end="01:10:57.440" style="s2">critique function and then it devolves</p>
<p begin="01:10:55.600" end="01:10:59.360" style="s2">uh ken wilber does this brilliantly he</p>
<p begin="01:10:57.440" end="01:11:00.719" style="s2">sees this we definitely need an</p>
<p begin="01:10:59.360" end="01:11:02.960" style="s2">integrated pluralism</p>
<p begin="01:11:00.719" end="01:11:04.800" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s an integrated pluralistic</p>
<p begin="01:11:02.960" end="01:11:05.280" style="s2">epistemology not everything goes it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:11:04.800" end="01:11:06.880" style="s2">not just</p>
<p begin="01:11:05.280" end="01:11:08.800" style="s2">whatever your epistemology it&#39;s got to</p>
<p begin="01:11:06.880" end="01:11:11.520" style="s2">be anchored to certain principles</p>
<p begin="01:11:08.800" end="01:11:13.040" style="s2">um for me what i then say is well what</p>
<p begin="01:11:11.520" end="01:11:14.960" style="s2">are the ultimate metacultural</p>
<p begin="01:11:13.040" end="01:11:16.880" style="s2">justification systems i have a</p>
<p begin="01:11:14.960" end="01:11:18.000" style="s2">saying that i use that organizes my</p>
<p begin="01:11:16.880" end="01:11:19.840" style="s2">thinking be</p>
<p begin="01:11:18.000" end="01:11:21.679" style="s2">that which enhances dignity and</p>
<p begin="01:11:19.840" end="01:11:24.800" style="s2">well-being with integrity</p>
<p begin="01:11:21.679" end="01:11:27.199" style="s2">okay uh that&#39;s in the garden uh dignity</p>
<p begin="01:11:24.800" end="01:11:28.560" style="s2">it comes from i&#39;ll say this quickly from</p>
<p begin="01:11:27.199" end="01:11:30.400" style="s2">the universal declaration of human</p>
<p begin="01:11:28.560" end="01:11:31.840" style="s2">rights the most uh consensual document</p>
<p begin="01:11:30.400" end="01:11:33.520" style="s2">ever agreed upon</p>
<p begin="01:11:31.840" end="01:11:36.000" style="s2">and what that does is it justifies</p>
<p begin="01:11:33.520" end="01:11:37.440" style="s2">people&#39;s respect uh respecting people</p>
<p begin="01:11:36.000" end="01:11:39.360" style="s2">and then that legitimizes</p>
<p begin="01:11:37.440" end="01:11:40.960" style="s2">justice and rights so it serves that</p>
<p begin="01:11:39.360" end="01:11:42.560" style="s2">unbelievably crucial function</p>
<p begin="01:11:40.960" end="01:11:44.159" style="s2">well-being is the mission of the world</p>
<p begin="01:11:42.560" end="01:11:45.600" style="s2">health organization took a hit and</p>
<p begin="01:11:44.159" end="01:11:47.760" style="s2">coveted but nonetheless</p>
<p begin="01:11:45.600" end="01:11:49.040" style="s2">um well-being is a complicated construct</p>
<p begin="01:11:47.760" end="01:11:50.880" style="s2">that i&#39;ve thought a lot about it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="01:11:49.040" end="01:11:52.480" style="s2">seventh branch on the tree is how do you</p>
<p begin="01:11:50.880" end="01:11:54.480" style="s2">define what well-being is</p>
<p begin="01:11:52.480" end="01:11:56.400" style="s2">human well-being and then we want to</p>
<p begin="01:11:54.480" end="01:11:58.159" style="s2">expand that out to well-being ultimately</p>
<p begin="01:11:56.400" end="01:11:59.120" style="s2">of gaia i.e the earth and all the</p>
<p begin="01:11:58.159" end="01:12:01.760" style="s2">creatures in it</p>
<p begin="01:11:59.120" end="01:12:02.800" style="s2">uh and then integrity refers to accuracy</p>
<p begin="01:12:01.760" end="01:12:05.760" style="s2">honor truth</p>
<p begin="01:12:02.800" end="01:12:07.120" style="s2">uh along those lines so uh for me what</p>
<p begin="01:12:05.760" end="01:12:07.679" style="s2">i&#39;m looking at when i&#39;m looking at a</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.120" end="01:12:09.600" style="s2">system</p>
<p begin="01:12:07.679" end="01:12:12.159" style="s2">ultimately is i&#39;m going to take a step</p>
<p begin="01:12:09.600" end="01:12:14.080" style="s2">and use my universal morality judgments</p>
<p begin="01:12:12.159" end="01:12:16.080" style="s2">along those values to see</p>
<p begin="01:12:14.080" end="01:12:17.440" style="s2">you know things that don&#39;t conform in a</p>
<p begin="01:12:16.080" end="01:12:19.280" style="s2">big way you know</p>
<p begin="01:12:17.440" end="01:12:20.880" style="s2">in no political without making a</p>
<p begin="01:12:19.280" end="01:12:23.679" style="s2">political statement at all i</p>
<p begin="01:12:20.880" end="01:12:25.440" style="s2">i cannot stand trump because he violates</p>
<p begin="01:12:23.679" end="01:12:27.679" style="s2">the intellectual integrity principle</p>
<p begin="01:12:25.440" end="01:12:28.640" style="s2">okay so it&#39;s a big three value and as a</p>
<p begin="01:12:27.679" end="01:12:30.560" style="s2">function of that</p>
<p begin="01:12:28.640" end="01:12:32.400" style="s2">uh then then i&#39;m al it&#39;s like oh my gosh</p>
<p begin="01:12:30.560" end="01:12:34.239" style="s2">so i for myself</p>
<p begin="01:12:32.400" end="01:12:35.760" style="s2">i do have a big three where i think you</p>
<p begin="01:12:34.239" end="01:12:36.080" style="s2">need and not everyone needs to have</p>
<p begin="01:12:35.760" end="01:12:37.679" style="s2">those</p>
