<p begin="00:00:00.230" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">so here look here&#39;s another proposition</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.210" end="00:00:17.699" style="s2">you can think about what we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:18.960" style="s2">doing so far in some way okay you can</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.699" end="00:00:21.300" style="s2">think about what we&#39;ve been doing so far</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.960" end="00:00:23.730" style="s2">in some way as trying to figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.300" end="00:00:25.560" style="s2">the world is made of and to answer that</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.730" end="00:00:27.390" style="s2">we have to think about what do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.560" end="00:00:29.340" style="s2">by the world and what do you mean by</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.390" end="00:00:31.380" style="s2">made of because those when you&#39;re asking</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.340" end="00:00:33.690" style="s2">a fundamental question like that the</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.380" end="00:00:36.329" style="s2">terms in the question have to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.690" end="00:00:38.460" style="s2">specified with a high degree of accuracy</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.329" end="00:00:41.340" style="s2">or you&#39;re just chasing you&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.460" end="00:00:43.770" style="s2">chasing ghosts around so we could say</p>
<p begin="00:00:41.340" end="00:00:45.030" style="s2">well on one at one level of analysis one</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.770" end="00:00:48.059" style="s2">level of resolution is pretty obvious</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.030" end="00:00:49.530" style="s2">that the world the objective world</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.059" end="00:00:52.800" style="s2">whatever that is is made out of atoms</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.530" end="00:00:54.420" style="s2">and Democritus said that a long time ago</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.800" end="00:00:56.280" style="s2">in Greece right he was the first guy</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.420" end="00:00:57.510" style="s2">that came up with the atomic theory but</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.280" end="00:00:58.859" style="s2">he didn&#39;t say that the world was made</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.510" end="00:01:01.980" style="s2">out of atoms he said that it was made</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.859" end="00:01:03.750" style="s2">out of atoms and space and you think</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.980" end="00:01:06.200" style="s2">well that&#39;s you know obvious it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.750" end="00:01:09.180" style="s2">no no no no it&#39;s not that obvious</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.200" end="00:01:12.479" style="s2">because as soon as you have fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.180" end="00:01:14.729" style="s2">particles and space you can array those</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.479" end="00:01:18.390" style="s2">particles in space and you can array</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.729" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">them in patterned ways and the patterned</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.390" end="00:01:25.140" style="s2">ways are real too the patterns are real</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:27.420" style="s2">too so and without without the space you</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.140" end="00:01:28.950" style="s2">can&#39;t do that so atoms plus space gives</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.420" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">rise to something else and really what</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.950" end="00:01:33.210" style="s2">it gives rise to as far as I can tell is</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.150" style="s2">something very much like information now</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.210" end="00:01:38.250" style="s2">information is a very complicated idea</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.150" end="00:01:40.799" style="s2">what information is but that&#39;s okay we</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.250" end="00:01:43.460" style="s2">won&#39;t go into that at the moment to</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.799" end="00:01:46.020" style="s2">think about music right music is like</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.460" end="00:01:48.360" style="s2">atoms of sound right because they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.020" end="00:01:50.909" style="s2">they&#39;re discrete quanta of sound</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.360" end="00:01:54.000" style="s2">essentially they&#39;re rainout in patterns</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.909" end="00:01:57.420" style="s2">across time and obviously the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.000" end="00:01:59.880" style="s2">the music is is not just the note it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.420" end="00:02:01.649" style="s2">the pattern across time okay so one of</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.880" end="00:02:03.390" style="s2">the things we might say is that well</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.649" end="00:02:03.990" style="s2">there&#39;s atoms in their space and there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.390" end="00:02:07.740" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.990" end="00:02:10.440" style="s2">okay so patterns now what are the most</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.740" end="00:02:11.819" style="s2">fundamental patterns okay so let&#39;s put</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.440" end="00:02:14.510" style="s2">it this way we&#39;re gonna say well what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.819" end="00:02:19.099" style="s2">your problem how to live in the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.510" end="00:02:23.459" style="s2">what&#39;s the world well roughly speaking</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.099" end="00:02:28.620" style="s2">the problem is how to live as an</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.459" end="00:02:31.170" style="s2">individual in society and nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.620" end="00:02:32.520" style="s2">something like that okay so then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.170" end="00:02:34.500" style="s2">gonna say okay if that&#39;s the actual</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.520" end="00:02:37.050" style="s2">problem the first thing you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.500" end="00:02:40.560" style="s2">to solve that is to conceptualize</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.050" end="00:02:42.390" style="s2">society in nature and conceptualize the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.560" end="00:02:42.860" style="s2">individual so you have to represent them</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.390" end="00:02:46.080" style="s2">somehow</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.860" end="00:02:48.720" style="s2">okay so how should you represent society</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.080" end="00:02:51.750" style="s2">and nature and the individual and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.720" end="00:02:53.940" style="s2">answer to that is that&#39;s complicated</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.750" end="00:02:56.069" style="s2">it&#39;s not obvious now we kind of know for</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.940" end="00:02:58.799" style="s2">example that one way of representing</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.069" end="00:03:00.330" style="s2">society is the dominance hierarchy you</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.799" end="00:03:02.160" style="s2">know that&#39;s not only a way of</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.330" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">representing and it&#39;s a way of being in</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.160" end="00:03:06.390" style="s2">this society right to talk about the</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:08.670" style="s2">dominance hierarchies to represent it to</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.390" end="00:03:10.730" style="s2">be in a dormant of turkeys to live it so</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.670" end="00:03:12.750" style="s2">we can think about a dominance hierarchy</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.730" end="00:03:14.250" style="s2">society is more than a dominance</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.750" end="00:03:16.590" style="s2">hierarchy but you know that&#39;s not a bad</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.250" end="00:03:19.500" style="s2">first approximation and then we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.590" end="00:03:21.810" style="s2">think of the place in which those</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.500" end="00:03:24.090" style="s2">dominance hierarchies exist we might</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.810" end="00:03:26.510" style="s2">think well that&#39;s for lack of a better</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.090" end="00:03:28.739" style="s2">way of conceptualizing its nature so</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.510" end="00:03:31.350" style="s2">it&#39;s complicated because you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.739" end="00:03:33.510" style="s2">actually sum these concepts up in single</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.350" end="00:03:35.549" style="s2">words as far as I can tell you have to</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.510" end="00:03:37.769" style="s2">use an array of words and an array of</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.549" end="00:03:40.799" style="s2">images because the categories are so</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.769" end="00:03:43.350" style="s2">broad that you just can&#39;t sum them up in</p>
<p begin="00:03:40.799" end="00:03:44.760" style="s2">a single concept okay so you can sum</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.350" end="00:03:46.620" style="s2">them up with words and you can sum them</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.760" end="00:03:49.829" style="s2">up with images and you can sum them up</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.620" end="00:03:51.989" style="s2">with stories and and that&#39;s that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.829" end="00:03:53.940" style="s2">we do as people so the quest no so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.989" end="00:03:56.700" style="s2">gonna say well is that if is that the</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.940" end="00:03:58.769" style="s2">fundamental question how to live as an</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.700" end="00:04:00.510" style="s2">individual in society in nature it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.769" end="00:04:02.400" style="s2">like well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.510" end="00:04:04.350" style="s2">fundamental question but it&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.400" end="00:04:06.530" style="s2">fundamental question so fine we&#39;ll go</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.350" end="00:04:06.530" style="s2">with that</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.819" end="00:04:17.200" style="s2">I&#39;ll go back over this a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.140" end="00:04:17.200" style="s2">later but all I&#39;ll start with this story</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.520" end="00:04:28.880" style="s2">yeah okay so we go back to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.930" end="00:04:30.889" style="s2">birthplace of civilization then we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.880" end="00:04:32.000" style="s2">gonna tell the variant of this story</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.889" end="00:04:36.050" style="s2">that was discovered in the late</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.000" end="00:04:39.350" style="s2">18-hundreds it&#39;s a story about this</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.050" end="00:04:44.690" style="s2">guard called time at or mardik so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.350" end="00:04:48.139" style="s2">the basic structure of the story you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.690" end="00:04:49.850" style="s2">got two primordial gods now the way that</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.139" end="00:04:51.500" style="s2">Mesopotamians conceptualized the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.850" end="00:04:53.600" style="s2">is they kind of thought about it you</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.500" end="00:04:55.450" style="s2">know how if you&#39;re out on a field it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.600" end="00:04:58.190" style="s2">flat and you kind of look at the world</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.450" end="00:05:01.460" style="s2">the world looks like a dome right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.190" end="00:05:03.139" style="s2">the sky on a disk so that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.460" end="00:05:04.910" style="s2">Mesopotamian world now it&#39;s kind of the</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.139" end="00:05:07.100" style="s2">world as conceptualized by the people</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.910" end="00:05:09.830" style="s2">who wrote Genesis as well it&#39;s a dome on</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.100" end="00:05:11.540" style="s2">a disk okay so the disk is land and</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.830" end="00:05:14.090" style="s2">underneath the land is water fresh water</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.540" end="00:05:16.310" style="s2">why well if you dig down in the land you</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.090" end="00:05:17.930" style="s2">hit fresh water and then underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.310" end="00:05:19.550" style="s2">is salt water and how do you know that</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.930" end="00:05:21.169" style="s2">well you know if you go out to the edges</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.550" end="00:05:23.960" style="s2">of the land and you fight an ocean it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.169" end="00:05:27.229" style="s2">salt water so that&#39;s the hypothesis okay</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.960" end="00:05:29.960" style="s2">so now as far as the Mesopotamians were</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.229" end="00:05:31.340" style="s2">concerned the salt water in the fresh</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.960" end="00:05:34.610" style="s2">water were two gods</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.340" end="00:05:36.830" style="s2">now what did they represent well one of</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.610" end="00:05:38.450" style="s2">them was male and one of them was female</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.830" end="00:05:40.760" style="s2">and the female one was the salt water</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.450" end="00:05:43.190" style="s2">the male one was the was the freshwater</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.760" end="00:05:44.870" style="s2">okay so now and they kind of</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.190" end="00:05:47.000" style="s2">conceptualize that as a kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.870" end="00:05:49.789" style="s2">formless chaos so you can kind of think</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.000" end="00:05:51.500" style="s2">of that water mixture as the chaos from</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.789" end="00:05:54.260" style="s2">which life emerged it&#39;s something like</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.500" end="00:05:56.360" style="s2">that but it&#39;s also the case and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.260" end="00:05:59.150" style="s2">should remember that well that life did</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.360" end="00:06:01.250" style="s2">emerge from water and that without water</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.150" end="00:06:02.810" style="s2">you don&#39;t live so it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.250" end="00:06:07.090" style="s2">stupid idea it&#39;s kind of low-resolution</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.810" end="00:06:10.039" style="s2">idea so is this chaotic intermingling of</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.090" end="00:06:11.930" style="s2">salt and fresh water so that&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.039" end="00:06:14.060" style="s2">the idea there&#39;s a chaos idea lurking at</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.930" end="00:06:17.240" style="s2">the bottom of that and so that&#39;s ab soup</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.060" end="00:06:19.520" style="s2">and time at now the Mesopotamians don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.240" end="00:06:22.400" style="s2">say much about ab soo and I kind of</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.520" end="00:06:25.940" style="s2">think that I think maybe that&#39;s because</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.400" end="00:06:28.400" style="s2">at that point society hadn&#39;t become so</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.940" end="00:06:31.340" style="s2">highly structured that and and</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.400" end="00:06:33.139" style="s2">long-lasting that that a great</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.340" end="00:06:34.400" style="s2">representation of it had been formed I</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.139" end="00:06:35.630" style="s2">don&#39;t think that happened until the</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.400" end="00:06:37.910" style="s2">Egyptians but I might be wrong about</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.630" end="00:06:39.410" style="s2">that but in any case the Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.910" end="00:06:42.320" style="s2">don&#39;t say much about apps ooh so what</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.410" end="00:06:43.970" style="s2">happens is ty Matt&#39;s down there in the</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.320" end="00:06:46.280" style="s2">depths sort of like the whale in</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.970" end="00:06:49.610" style="s2">Pinocchio fact very much like the whale</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.280" end="00:06:51.080" style="s2">in Pinocchio and absolute husband and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.610" end="00:06:53.630" style="s2">they&#39;re locked together in a sexual</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.080" end="00:06:55.820" style="s2">embrace and so part of the idea here is</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.630" end="00:06:57.889" style="s2">that well the union of opposites is</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.820" end="00:07:00.770" style="s2">necessary before something new can arise</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.889" end="00:07:03.590" style="s2">and that that union of opposites can be</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.770" end="00:07:05.510" style="s2">conceptualized in some way sexually you</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.590" end="00:07:07.220" style="s2">know using male and female because when</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.510" end="00:07:10.130" style="s2">male-female come together something new</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.220" end="00:07:12.199" style="s2">emerges out of that and that sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.130" end="00:07:13.760" style="s2">ideas like the matrix you know the</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.199" end="00:07:16.849" style="s2">matrix of things that&#39;s the mother</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.760" end="00:07:19.910" style="s2">matter mother things emerge out of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.849" end="00:07:21.770" style="s2">matrix so so anyways absolute I&#39;m out or</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.910" end="00:07:23.500" style="s2">down there in the depths and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.770" end="00:07:26.810" style="s2">locked together in a sexual embrace and</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.500" end="00:07:29.060" style="s2">they produce offspring and lots of them</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.810" end="00:07:31.400" style="s2">so that&#39;s the initial world of the gods</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.060" end="00:07:32.840" style="s2">now there&#39;s all sorts of gods they give</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.400" end="00:07:34.340" style="s2">rise to and we don&#39;t know a lot about</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.840" end="00:07:36.080" style="s2">them but I&#39;m going to make some</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.340" end="00:07:37.729" style="s2">hypotheses about the gods because you</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.080" end="00:07:41.599" style="s2">might think well what the hell are gods</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.729" end="00:07:43.280" style="s2">anyways you know and so I I think about</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.599" end="00:07:45.229" style="s2">them as personalities their</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.280" end="00:07:47.810" style="s2">personalities and their archetypal</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.229" end="00:07:50.180" style="s2">personalities and so it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.810" end="00:07:52.190" style="s2">Venus for example is the God of love and</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.180" end="00:07:54.590" style="s2">I&#39;ll show you some pictures of Venus so</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.190" end="00:07:57.229" style="s2">what does that mean exactly well it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.590" end="00:07:59.630" style="s2">like a complex of things Venus is how</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.229" end="00:08:01.610" style="s2">you act when you&#39;re in love Venus is</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.630" end="00:08:06.260" style="s2">what people find sexually attractive in</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.610" end="00:08:07.909" style="s2">women Venus is the the possession that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.260" end="00:08:09.710" style="s2">occurs when you&#39;re in love or when</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.909" end="00:08:11.060" style="s2">you&#39;re really attracted to someone it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.710" end="00:08:13.159" style="s2">all those things and so it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.060" end="00:08:16.400" style="s2">force that can invade you it&#39;s a way of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.159" end="00:08:19.039" style="s2">perceiving it&#39;s a superordinate instinct</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.400" end="00:08:21.680" style="s2">it&#39;s shared across not only human beings</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.039" end="00:08:25.070" style="s2">but birds and bees as we all know so</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.680" end="00:08:27.800" style="s2">it&#39;s this it&#39;s a transcendent property</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.070" end="00:08:30.139" style="s2">and it it can take personified form</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.800" end="00:08:31.820" style="s2">because it can inhabit you and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.139" end="00:08:33.440" style="s2">this thing that sort of objective and</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.820" end="00:08:35.539" style="s2">sort of subjective and it&#39;s also one of</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.440" end="00:08:36.410" style="s2">the fundamental elements of the world so</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.539" end="00:08:38.660" style="s2">you might say well</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.410" end="00:08:41.450" style="s2">Venus for example and there&#39;s Ares</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.660" end="00:08:43.370" style="s2">that&#39;s Mars so that&#39;s a God of War and</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.450" end="00:08:45.530" style="s2">he&#39;s usually masculine and he&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.370" end="00:08:49.550" style="s2">aggressive and so well he&#39;s like a he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.530" end="00:08:54.350" style="s2">like the personality of warrior like</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.550" end="00:08:55.880" style="s2">rage so so so I kind of think about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.350" end="00:08:58.280" style="s2">gods especially the more fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.880" end="00:09:00.920" style="s2">gods is something like primordial forces</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.280" end="00:09:04.280" style="s2">and here&#39;s a leap and I don&#39;t know about</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.920" end="00:09:07.240" style="s2">it but I think that it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.280" end="00:09:09.860" style="s2">recapitulation in some sense of</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.240" end="00:09:11.690" style="s2">individual socialization so I think that</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.860" end="00:09:14.690" style="s2">what happens to begin with is that you</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.690" end="00:09:16.940" style="s2">know you&#39;re as you emerge as an</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.690" end="00:09:19.820" style="s2">individual you start out in a chaotic</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.940" end="00:09:21.860" style="s2">and unformed manner and then these</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.820" end="00:09:23.180" style="s2">things come to life inside of you and</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.860" end="00:09:24.800" style="s2">those things are these fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.180" end="00:09:26.570" style="s2">motivational systems that we were</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.800" end="00:09:29.990" style="s2">talking about and so they&#39;re the first</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.570" end="00:09:31.600" style="s2">products of chaos and then those things</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.990" end="00:09:34.580" style="s2">have to get their act together okay so</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.600" end="00:09:37.160" style="s2">like I said that&#39;s a leap and I haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:34.580" end="00:09:43.550" style="s2">been able to completely fill in the gaps</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.160" end="00:09:45.650" style="s2">there but in any case all these gods and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.550" end="00:09:47.540" style="s2">goddesses get created by time at a nap</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.650" end="00:09:49.910" style="s2">soon right so then they&#39;re running</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.540" end="00:09:51.950" style="s2">around causing trouble the first gods</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.910" end="00:09:54.230" style="s2">they make a lot of racket they&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.950" end="00:09:56.150" style="s2">a lot of impulsive and crazy things and</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.230" end="00:09:57.740" style="s2">they make a lot of noise and they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.150" end="00:10:02.180" style="s2">very cautious and they make a big</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.740" end="00:10:05.270" style="s2">mistake they kill apps ooh and then they</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.180" end="00:10:07.070" style="s2">live on his body now that&#39;s a weird one</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.270" end="00:10:09.230" style="s2">name you think well okay what&#39;s going on</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.070" end="00:10:11.060" style="s2">there well absolute mass keulen and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.230" end="00:10:12.980" style="s2">the masculine thing seems to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.060" end="00:10:15.410" style="s2">associated in some way with like God the</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.980" end="00:10:17.210" style="s2">Father in the dominance hierarchy and so</p>
<p begin="00:10:15.410" end="00:10:19.480" style="s2">what does it mean if he&#39;s dead it means</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.210" end="00:10:22.520" style="s2">that all this chaotic activity that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.480" end="00:10:24.290" style="s2">disintegrated has killed the structure</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.520" end="00:10:26.920" style="s2">and so they&#39;re all down living on a</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.290" end="00:10:29.360" style="s2">corpse which is not a good thing and</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.920" end="00:10:32.870" style="s2">maybe they didn&#39;t know what they killed</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.360" end="00:10:34.010" style="s2">and so so imagine they&#39;re careless</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.870" end="00:10:35.090" style="s2">they&#39;re kind of clueless they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.010" end="00:10:37.220" style="s2">what the hell&#39;s going on they break a</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.090" end="00:10:40.160" style="s2">bunch of rules and they destroy the the</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.220" end="00:10:42.560" style="s2">the orderly element of what initially</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.160" end="00:10:44.030" style="s2">gave rise to them and then they live on</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.560" end="00:10:45.560" style="s2">its corpse another way of thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.030" end="00:10:47.480" style="s2">that is that that&#39;s what you guys do</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.560" end="00:10:49.010" style="s2">you&#39;re living on a corpse you&#39;re living</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.480" end="00:10:51.019" style="s2">on the corpse of the past</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.010" end="00:10:53.240" style="s2">right and it&#39;s the consequence of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.019" end="00:10:55.430" style="s2">activity of the dead and it&#39;s dead</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.240" end="00:10:58.310" style="s2">because it&#39;s the activity of the dead</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.430" end="00:11:00.649" style="s2">right I mean the library there&#39;s no life</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.310" end="00:11:03.529" style="s2">in a library except for the people in it</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.649" end="00:11:05.510" style="s2">the rest of its all ghosts so you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.529" end="00:11:07.790" style="s2">living on the dead shell of the past</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.510" end="00:11:09.110" style="s2">okay anyways these guards are all making</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.790" end="00:11:11.750" style="s2">all sorts of racket and running around</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.110" end="00:11:14.149" style="s2">and spinning up wind and dust and noise</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.750" end="00:11:16.010" style="s2">and it&#39;s really chaotic and then they</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.149" end="00:11:16.519" style="s2">kill apps ooh it&#39;s like mmm that&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.010" end="00:11:20.180" style="s2">good idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.519" end="00:11:21.589" style="s2">so absence also ordered and so what</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.180" end="00:11:25.160" style="s2">happens when you kill order when you</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.589" end="00:11:25.639" style="s2">destroy order what happens up comes</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.160" end="00:11:27.519" style="s2">chaos</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.639" end="00:11:31.600" style="s2">that&#39;s what happened in Iraq for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.519" end="00:11:33.620" style="s2">okay so time at comes up and she thinks</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.600" end="00:11:36.260" style="s2">well I don&#39;t know about these things I</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.620" end="00:11:40.430" style="s2">created it&#39;s like they&#39;re really noisy</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.260" end="00:11:41.839" style="s2">and and annoying and careless and they</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.430" end="00:11:44.120" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t killed absoutely she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.839" end="00:11:46.190" style="s2">he&#39;s my corn sardis necessary it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.120" end="00:11:48.500" style="s2">now for them they&#39;re gone I&#39;m gonna wipe</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.190" end="00:11:50.630" style="s2">them out sort of like God deciding to</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.500" end="00:11:52.430" style="s2">wipe out everybody with the flood it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.630" end="00:11:54.790" style="s2">the same idea these stories all came</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.430" end="00:11:57.170" style="s2">from the same area right so it&#39;s another</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.790" end="00:11:59.839" style="s2">representation of that idea it&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.170" end="00:12:01.399" style="s2">kind of a vengeful god idea now you</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.839" end="00:12:03.199" style="s2">might think well what about this</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.399" end="00:12:04.190" style="s2">vengeful god idea it&#39;s like well do you</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.199" end="00:12:05.420" style="s2">really want to have a god that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.190" end="00:12:07.579" style="s2">vengeful it&#39;s like that&#39;s a stupid</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.420" end="00:12:09.350" style="s2">question because you&#39;ve got one whether</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.579" end="00:12:11.660" style="s2">you want one or not so I can give you an</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.350" end="00:12:14.480" style="s2">example so let&#39;s think about New Orleans</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.660" end="00:12:16.069" style="s2">right so New Orleans got hit by a</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.480" end="00:12:17.779" style="s2">hurricane and it was a natural disaster</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.069" end="00:12:23.110" style="s2">and it wiped out a big chunk of the city</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.779" end="00:12:26.389" style="s2">right well no that isn&#39;t really right so</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.110" end="00:12:28.040" style="s2">the Dutch live underwater basically</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.389" end="00:12:30.170" style="s2">right the whole bloody country is below</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.040" end="00:12:33.230" style="s2">sea level so the Dutch make these huge</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.170" end="00:12:36.500" style="s2">dams and they maintain them like Matt</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.230" end="00:12:39.079" style="s2">and here&#39;s the Dutch rule we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.500" end="00:12:40.699" style="s2">try to calculate the worst possible</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.079" end="00:12:43.579" style="s2">storm that could possibly happen in</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.699" end="00:12:45.410" style="s2">10,000 years and then we&#39;re gonna build</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.579" end="00:12:49.699" style="s2">those damn dikes so if that storm comes</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.410" end="00:12:51.560" style="s2">we&#39;re safe okay so what happens Holland</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.699" end="00:12:54.050" style="s2">isn&#39;t underwater so there&#39;s no natural</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.560" end="00:12:55.550" style="s2">disaster so let&#39;s go to New Orleans it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.050" end="00:12:57.800" style="s2">like well why did New Orleans get wiped</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.550" end="00:12:59.329" style="s2">out well there was a hurricane it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.800" end="00:13:02.510" style="s2">did they know that there might be</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.329" end="00:13:02.930" style="s2">hurricanes yes did they know that the</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.510" end="00:13:04.610" style="s2">dikes</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.930" end="00:13:06.649" style="s2">big enough yes have they been</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.610" end="00:13:09.529" style="s2">complaining about it for a hundred years</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.649" end="00:13:11.960" style="s2">yes had there been things put in in</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.529" end="00:13:15.740" style="s2">place to try to get the dykes better yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.960" end="00:13:19.430" style="s2">did it work no why not because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.740" end="00:13:21.620" style="s2">corrupt it&#39;s a corrupt state now all the</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.430" end="00:13:23.930" style="s2">money they pour it in there to help the</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.620" end="00:13:25.760" style="s2">people after the after the flood that</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.930" end="00:13:28.730" style="s2">didn&#39;t help them it just disappeared and</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.760" end="00:13:31.339" style="s2">so you can&#39;t if the state is corrupt and</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.730" end="00:13:33.529" style="s2">the individuals within it are corrupt it</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.339" end="00:13:35.750" style="s2">means the structure the society is dead</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.529" end="00:13:37.370" style="s2">it&#39;s a corpse and what happens when you</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.750" end="00:13:39.649" style="s2">make a corpse out of your society a</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.370" end="00:13:41.990" style="s2">corrupt corpse well that&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.649" end="00:13:44.390" style="s2">mother nature comes back and takes what</p>
<p begin="00:13:41.990" end="00:13:45.980" style="s2">she has and then you think oh isn&#39;t the</p>

<p begin="00:13:48.350" end="00:13:58.459" style="s2">what happens it&#39;s part of it yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.790" end="00:14:01.160" style="s2">part of it so there&#39;s a whole tangled up</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.459" end="00:14:02.899" style="s2">idea of murders and so forth we&#39;ll get</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.160" end="00:14:05.779" style="s2">into that so anyway it&#39;s okay so time</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.899" end="00:14:07.850" style="s2">has had it she said well these things</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.779" end="00:14:09.200" style="s2">aren&#39;t worth preserving I&#39;m gonna go up</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.850" end="00:14:11.270" style="s2">and wipe them out and then everything be</p>

<p begin="00:14:11.270" end="00:14:14.959" style="s2">the guards they get wind of this you</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.459" end="00:14:17.870" style="s2">know and they&#39;re thinking hey this isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.959" end="00:14:19.760" style="s2">very good because like she&#39;s that&#39;s tire</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.870" end="00:14:21.470" style="s2">mat we&#39;re talking about here she&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.760" end="00:14:23.180" style="s2">Mother Nature like in that in her</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.470" end="00:14:25.070" style="s2">terrible sense and she creates</p>
<p begin="00:14:23.180" end="00:14:27.050" style="s2">everything and she kills everything and</p>
<p begin="00:14:25.070" end="00:14:28.820" style="s2">if he decides that were you know going</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.050" end="00:14:30.200" style="s2">back to where we came from that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:28.820" end="00:14:33.230" style="s2">probably what&#39;s gonna happen so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.200" end="00:14:35.330" style="s2">pretty I&#39;m worried about this so they</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.230" end="00:14:36.440" style="s2">get together in a kind of a council so</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.330" end="00:14:38.540" style="s2">they&#39;re trying to organize themselves</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.440" end="00:14:39.860" style="s2">say they get together in the council and</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.540" end="00:14:42.050" style="s2">they think oh well what are we gonna do</p>
<p begin="00:14:39.860" end="00:14:43.670" style="s2">about this and so they elect they take</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.050" end="00:14:45.529" style="s2">one of their gods and they say you why</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.670" end="00:14:49.370" style="s2">do you go out there and try to you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.529" end="00:14:52.490" style="s2">keep time out at bay straighten her out</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.370" end="00:14:54.770" style="s2">so one God goes out and has a big fight</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.490" end="00:14:56.150" style="s2">with time at and comes back and he he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.770" end="00:14:57.350" style="s2">all defeated and wiped out and that</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.150" end="00:15:00.260" style="s2">doesn&#39;t work and so then they send</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.350" end="00:15:01.970" style="s2">another God out and he&#39;s just completely</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.260" end="00:15:03.170" style="s2">useless that doesn&#39;t work he comes back</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.970" end="00:15:04.880" style="s2">and it&#39;s it&#39;s getting pretty damn</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.170" end="00:15:07.850" style="s2">desperate there in the realm of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.880" end="00:15:09.680" style="s2">original gods and so this is going on</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.850" end="00:15:11.690" style="s2">for quite a long time and while this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.680" end="00:15:13.160" style="s2">happening the gods are still marrying</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.690" end="00:15:15.230" style="s2">each other and producing offspring and</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.160" end="00:15:16.950" style="s2">so forth and one day this new sort of</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.230" end="00:15:19.170" style="s2">God appears</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.950" end="00:15:21.570" style="s2">the scenes and his name is marek and</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.170" end="00:15:23.280" style="s2">mardik is he&#39;s a new thing they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:15:21.570" end="00:15:25.830" style="s2">really sure what to do with him and he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.280" end="00:15:28.110" style="s2">got he can really hear and he can speak</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.830" end="00:15:29.820" style="s2">magic words and so what he says magic</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.110" end="00:15:32.160" style="s2">words the day appears in the night</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.820" end="00:15:34.500" style="s2">disappears and so he&#39;s got the power of</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.160" end="00:15:35.910" style="s2">speech that&#39;s a big deal and he&#39;s got</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.500" end="00:15:37.320" style="s2">eyes all the way around his head he can</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.910" end="00:15:40.350" style="s2">see everywhere it can really pay</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.320" end="00:15:41.760" style="s2">attention so you know and he&#39;s big and</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.350" end="00:15:43.620" style="s2">he&#39;s strong and he&#39;s tough and all those</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.760" end="00:15:45.450" style="s2">things but the big things is he can</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.620" end="00:15:49.680" style="s2">speak and he can really seek and really</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.450" end="00:15:51.210" style="s2">pay attention so the gods think hmm well</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.680" end="00:15:52.800" style="s2">he&#39;s kind of a new character we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.210" end="00:15:55.470" style="s2">thrown anything like that at time at yet</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.800" end="00:15:57.150" style="s2">so let&#39;s let&#39;s do it so they all get</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.470" end="00:15:58.500" style="s2">together in their Council and they bring</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.150" end="00:15:59.730" style="s2">Martic in and they say well you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:58.500" end="00:16:01.200" style="s2">we&#39;re kind of thinking to be a good idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.730" end="00:16:03.450" style="s2">if you went out and fought this terrible</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.200" end="00:16:04.950" style="s2">monster right and he thinks well you</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.450" end="00:16:07.740" style="s2">think that&#39;s a good idea but you know</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.950" end="00:16:11.550" style="s2">it&#39;s me on the line here so I need a</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.740" end="00:16:14.790" style="s2">price and so the price is you make me</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.550" end="00:16:16.680" style="s2">the determiner of destinies now that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.790" end="00:16:18.210" style="s2">an interesting phrase and we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.680" end="00:16:22.110" style="s2">exactly know what they meant but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.210" end="00:16:24.480" style="s2">something like what I am that&#39;s Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.110" end="00:16:28.080" style="s2">is now going to be the thing that</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.480" end="00:16:30.150" style="s2">determines how things unfold so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.080" end="00:16:31.740" style="s2">sort of like I&#39;m gonna be top god</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.150" end="00:16:34.710" style="s2">you mean if I&#39;m going off to fight time</p>
<p begin="00:16:31.740" end="00:16:37.410" style="s2">at I&#39;m top god in fact that&#39;s how you</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.710" end="00:16:40.140" style="s2">can define top god top god is the god</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.410" end="00:16:41.460" style="s2">that can go out and fight time at so the</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.140" end="00:16:42.600" style="s2">other you know the other gods they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.460" end="00:16:44.460" style="s2">not very happy about having to</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.600" end="00:16:45.810" style="s2">subordinate themselves to mardet but</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.460" end="00:16:48.210" style="s2">they think beats the hell out of being</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.810" end="00:16:51.180" style="s2">eaten by time at so they say yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.210" end="00:16:53.400" style="s2">if you win you get to be like top god</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.180" end="00:16:56.940" style="s2">you you have the tablets of destiny you</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.400" end="00:16:58.620" style="s2">can determine destiny fine fine so so</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.940" end="00:17:00.390" style="s2">fine Martin goes off and he gets his act</p>
<p begin="00:16:58.620" end="00:17:02.850" style="s2">together and he gets big net and he</p>
<p begin="00:17:00.390" end="00:17:05.459" style="s2">prepares himself and he rides forward</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.850" end="00:17:07.699" style="s2">and and encounters time at she&#39;s this</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.459" end="00:17:10.890" style="s2">great big dragon like monster thing</p>
<p begin="00:17:07.699" end="00:17:12.570" style="s2">that&#39;s her there on the on the right</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.890" end="00:17:17.040" style="s2">left so you can see she&#39;s kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.570" end="00:17:18.570" style="s2">dragon angel monster thing she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:17:17.040" end="00:17:21.540" style="s2">she is a monster and what she is is</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.570" end="00:17:24.390" style="s2">really an amalgam of frightening things</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.540" end="00:17:25.829" style="s2">essentially so and there&#39;s Marduk on the</p>
<p begin="00:17:24.390" end="00:17:27.870" style="s2">right and he&#39;s gonna go give her a good</p>
<p begin="00:17:25.829" end="00:17:29.070" style="s2">whacking and so he goes out there and</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.870" end="00:17:30.419" style="s2">the first thing he does and this is</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.070" end="00:17:33.720" style="s2">quite cool</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.419" end="00:17:34.799" style="s2">encapsulate her in a net no so think</p>
<p begin="00:17:33.720" end="00:17:37.679" style="s2">about that because she&#39;s basically</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.799" end="00:17:40.169" style="s2">natural chaos she&#39;s the productivity of</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.679" end="00:17:42.299" style="s2">natural chaos and so what Marduk does is</p>
<p begin="00:17:40.169" end="00:17:44.700" style="s2">encapsulate her in a net that&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.299" end="00:17:46.799" style="s2">conceptual scheme right he puts he puts</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.700" end="00:17:48.720" style="s2">boundaries around the chaos and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:46.799" end="00:17:50.700" style="s2">what mardik can do that&#39;s that&#39;s his</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.720" end="00:17:52.350" style="s2">ability with his ability to speak in his</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.700" end="00:17:53.519" style="s2">eyes and his capacity to pay attention</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.350" end="00:17:55.830" style="s2">so whoopee</p>
<p begin="00:17:53.519" end="00:17:56.970" style="s2">he encloses her right and so that&#39;s kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.830" end="00:17:58.950" style="s2">of hard on her she can&#39;t get out of the</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.970" end="00:18:00.809" style="s2">net and then he cuts her into pieces and</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.950" end="00:18:04.320" style="s2">then he makes the world out of the</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.809" end="00:18:07.230" style="s2">pieces and in fact one of Martok&#39;s names</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.320" end="00:18:09.690" style="s2">is he who fashions ingenious things out</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.230" end="00:18:11.820" style="s2">of the carcass of time at which is so</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.690" end="00:18:14.009" style="s2">cool because it&#39;s a tool use metaphor</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.820" end="00:18:15.600" style="s2">it&#39;s right how do you conquer nature</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.009" end="00:18:17.580" style="s2">well you go in there and you you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.600" end="00:18:18.929" style="s2">decompose it in many ways and you make</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.580" end="00:18:21.299" style="s2">weapons out of it you make cool things</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.929" end="00:18:24.029" style="s2">and that keeps it at bay and how do you</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.299" end="00:18:26.039" style="s2">do that by speaking and paying attention</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.029" end="00:18:27.480" style="s2">so that&#39;s what the Mesopotamians figured</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.039" end="00:18:30.269" style="s2">out now they didn&#39;t know that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.480" end="00:18:32.100" style="s2">what they figured out because like the</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.269" end="00:18:34.369" style="s2">idea was already there it was implicit</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.100" end="00:18:36.869" style="s2">in the dominance hierarchy in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.369" end="00:18:38.879" style="s2">but and they were observing the</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.869" end="00:18:40.019" style="s2">dominance hierarchy and well they got</p>
<p begin="00:18:38.879" end="00:18:41.759" style="s2">their Kingdom together they were</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.019" end="00:18:43.980" style="s2">bringing tribes in from all over right</p>
<p begin="00:18:41.759" end="00:18:46.019" style="s2">and all the tribes had their stories and</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.980" end="00:18:49.259" style="s2">then on all those stories had to fight</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.019" end="00:18:50.700" style="s2">and so that&#39;s like the Battle of gods in</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.259" end="00:18:52.350" style="s2">the Battle of the gods in heaven all</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.700" end="00:18:54.840" style="s2">those stories had to fight just like</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.350" end="00:18:57.509" style="s2">Islam and Christianity and Catholicism</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.840" end="00:18:58.889" style="s2">and Protestantism are all scrapping it</p>
<p begin="00:18:57.509" end="00:19:00.600" style="s2">all for dominance now they&#39;re fighting</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.889" end="00:19:02.690" style="s2">how do we make sense out of this mess</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.600" end="00:19:05.279" style="s2">maybe take several thousand years</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.690" end="00:19:06.840" style="s2">Mesopotamia gathered together all these</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.279" end="00:19:09.179" style="s2">tribes and their stories and then the</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.840" end="00:19:11.519" style="s2">stories fought and out of that fight</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.179" end="00:19:13.080" style="s2">emerged this story and that was a good</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.519" end="00:19:13.379" style="s2">enough story so everyone was happy with</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.080" end="00:19:18.299" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.379" end="00:19:22.019" style="s2">and the story was sorry I know we have</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.299" end="00:19:24.899" style="s2">to start the story was whatever mardik</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.019" end="00:19:28.590" style="s2">represents that&#39;s top god and so what</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.899" end="00:19:31.440" style="s2">did you represent vision attention and</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.590" end="00:19:33.119" style="s2">speech and so the Mesopotamia has</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.440" end="00:19:35.340" style="s2">already figured out everything else</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.119" end="00:19:38.489" style="s2">should be subordinate to vision</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.340" end="00:19:41.389" style="s2">attention and speech it&#39;s like good work</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.489" end="00:19:41.389" style="s2">Mesopotamians</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.460" end="00:19:46.440" style="s2">sorry it&#39;s my daughter she wants to pick</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.930" end="00:19:52.680" style="s2">me up</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.440" end="00:19:56.790" style="s2">hello hi there where are you ok but ok</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.680" end="00:19:59.910" style="s2">bye alright so one final thing</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.790" end="00:20:03.020" style="s2">the Mesopotamian Emperor our Emperor was</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.910" end="00:20:06.930" style="s2">charged with the imitation of Marduk</p>
<p begin="00:20:03.020" end="00:20:08.700" style="s2">that&#39;s what made him sovereign so so</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.930" end="00:20:09.990" style="s2">it&#39;s not arbitrary like if he was going</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.700" end="00:20:12.150" style="s2">to be sovereign and he was going to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.990" end="00:20:14.490" style="s2">good sovereign that meant he had to be a</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.150" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">good Marduk and we&#39;ll talk about that</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.490" end="00:20:17.120" style="s2">when we meet again</p>
