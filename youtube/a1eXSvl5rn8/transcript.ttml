<p begin="00:00:19.230" end="00:00:25.170" style="s2">of being in the zone where we go beyond</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.900" end="00:00:26.939" style="s2">ourselves I&#39;ve always been interested in</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.170" end="00:00:28.619" style="s2">sort of the esoteric and the places</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.939" end="00:00:31.439" style="s2">where the sort of the mainstream meets</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.619" end="00:00:33.840" style="s2">the alternative and what your book did</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.439" end="00:00:36.149" style="s2">really really well was sort of reframed</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.840" end="00:00:39.149" style="s2">that as the cutting edge which I thought</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.149" end="00:00:40.890" style="s2">was fascinating yeah that was a very</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.149" end="00:00:42.719" style="s2">that was a deliberate decision we made</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.890" end="00:00:45.930" style="s2">which was rather than saying hey</p>
<p begin="00:00:42.719" end="00:00:48.570" style="s2">esoteric techniques have some scientific</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.930" end="00:00:50.789" style="s2">validation now we said hey red bull</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.570" end="00:00:52.530" style="s2">extreme athletes and special operations</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.789" end="00:00:54.360" style="s2">military guys are using it and this is</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.530" end="00:00:57.539" style="s2">their secret sauce and so we</p>
<p begin="00:00:54.360" end="00:01:00.780" style="s2">deliberately smuggled in esoterica into</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.539" end="00:01:02.609" style="s2">you know undeniable heat performers that</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.780" end="00:01:04.710" style="s2">have a sort of a mainstream</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.609" end="00:01:06.659" style="s2">marketability and kind of halo effect</p>
<p begin="00:01:04.710" end="00:01:08.610" style="s2">and then say well if they&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.659" end="00:01:10.619" style="s2">you know maybe you could maybe you could</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.610" end="00:01:12.570" style="s2">you know wrap your head around it - mmm</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.619" end="00:01:14.280" style="s2">because in a way this is kind of like</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.570" end="00:01:15.990" style="s2">you say stealing fire is referencing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.280" end="00:01:18.150" style="s2">idea that Prometheus steals fire from</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.990" end="00:01:21.030" style="s2">the gods this is an eternal thing</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.150" end="00:01:23.210" style="s2">something this is something that happens</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.030" end="00:01:25.710" style="s2">throughout culture can you explain that</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.210" end="00:01:27.509" style="s2">yeah I mean I know you don&#39;t presume to</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.710" end="00:01:31.079" style="s2">have an answer on it but it does seem</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.509" end="00:01:33.600" style="s2">that anytime people pursue and cultivate</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.079" end="00:01:36.329" style="s2">and propagate ecstatic technologies just</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.600" end="00:01:39.090" style="s2">everything anything that raises energy</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.329" end="00:01:41.549" style="s2">levels enthusiasm inspiration all the</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.090" end="00:01:45.420" style="s2">way to transcendent and non-ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.549" end="00:01:48.920" style="s2">states via everything from dance and</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.420" end="00:01:52.740" style="s2">music to psychedelics or substances</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.920" end="00:01:54.390" style="s2">sexuality even charismatic transmission</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.740" end="00:01:55.649" style="s2">you know a specific person or something</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.390" end="00:01:59.490" style="s2">that can sort of light other people that</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.649" end="00:02:04.290" style="s2">and almost never ends well mhm and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.490" end="00:02:05.850" style="s2">so that recurring battle or dialectic</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.290" end="00:02:07.700" style="s2">between the sort of the priests that</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.850" end="00:02:09.539" style="s2">give the keepers of society and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.700" end="00:02:11.700" style="s2">inspiration and the Prometheans the</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.539" end="00:02:12.799" style="s2">folks looking to steal it and put it out</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.700" end="00:02:14.409" style="s2">there for the masses</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.799" end="00:02:17.390" style="s2">that just feels like a back-and-forth</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.409" end="00:02:21.650" style="s2">battle that&#39;s been going on for ages and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.390" end="00:02:23.269" style="s2">and so why that is is a whole you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.650" end="00:02:25.159" style="s2">that would be a life&#39;s work of inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.269" end="00:02:27.439" style="s2">my sense is this just it&#39;s a it&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.159" end="00:02:31.849" style="s2">unstable element you know that The</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.439" end="00:02:34.849" style="s2">Ecstatic is not designed to build houses</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.849" end="00:02:37.010" style="s2">with it&#39;s designed to burn them down and</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.849" end="00:02:39.200" style="s2">so that that very thing that makes it so</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.010" end="00:02:41.840" style="s2">magnetic and say what peeling also</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.200" end="00:02:44.299" style="s2">renders it very volatile and then the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.840" end="00:02:45.650" style="s2">other is just all the human stuff you</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.299" end="00:02:49.069" style="s2">know then when people latch on to this</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.650" end="00:02:51.200" style="s2">stuff I mean sex drugs money power you</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.069" end="00:02:52.970" style="s2">know they all become places where we</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.200" end="00:02:56.030" style="s2">stumble as we try to bring this into</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.970" end="00:02:58.040" style="s2">culture and it&#39;s very hard as the old</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.030" end="00:03:01.280" style="s2">lord acton you know absolute power</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.040" end="00:03:03.109" style="s2">corrupts absolutely yeah</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.280" end="00:03:04.760" style="s2">the one ring and and it&#39;s not just</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.109" end="00:03:07.370" style="s2">hobbits by the way they&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.760" end="00:03:08.930" style="s2">that thing so so I&#39;d say that mean</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.370" end="00:03:10.579" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a broad brush but we can</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.930" end="00:03:13.700" style="s2">we can we can start with that but you</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.579" end="00:03:16.250" style="s2">also say in the book that you think this</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.700" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">for the first time it could end better</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.250" end="00:03:21.650" style="s2">than it has in the past yeah and I just</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:23.090" style="s2">don&#39;t know I mean I mean I wrote that</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.650" end="00:03:26.299" style="s2">somewhat optimistically two and a half</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:28.280" style="s2">years ago and then had an increasingly</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.299" end="00:03:31.489" style="s2">and increasingly disillusioning series</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.280" end="00:03:33.620" style="s2">of experiences with the psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.489" end="00:03:34.909" style="s2">polyamorous Burning Man community let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.620" end="00:03:36.799" style="s2">say so so let&#39;s just say the</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.909" end="00:03:38.989" style="s2">intersection of sex drugs rock and roll</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.799" end="00:03:41.540" style="s2">and and and libertarian ideals and</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.989" end="00:03:43.849" style="s2">realize that those poor bastards can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.540" end="00:03:45.979" style="s2">get out of their own way to even just</p>
<p begin="00:03:43.849" end="00:03:51.139" style="s2">build something like cryptocurrency so</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.979" end="00:03:54.290" style="s2">so my concern these days is that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.139" end="00:03:56.239" style="s2">out of bullets like we&#39;ve tapped we have</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.290" end="00:03:58.310" style="s2">stolen fire from the gods who who we</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.239" end="00:04:01.069" style="s2">have absolutely taken ambrosia from</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.310" end="00:04:03.470" style="s2">Olympus and a meaning well just meaning</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.069" end="00:04:05.180" style="s2">the collective sort of you know quote</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.470" end="00:04:07.250" style="s2">unquote transformational culture and</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.180" end="00:04:08.479" style="s2">that&#39;s everything from EDM and</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.250" end="00:04:10.220" style="s2">transformational festivals to the</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.479" end="00:04:13.549" style="s2">Burning Man world to Silicon Valley</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.220" end="00:04:16.699" style="s2">high-tech space to psychedelic therapies</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.549" end="00:04:19.070" style="s2">to I would say anything other than just</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.699" end="00:04:21.229" style="s2">sort of MBSR mindfulness so sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.070" end="00:04:22.940" style="s2">actual mindfulness mindfulness practice</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.229" end="00:04:24.620" style="s2">is this some teeth and are actually</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.940" end="00:04:26.010" style="s2">still trying to get to non jewel states</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.620" end="00:04:27.690" style="s2">not just help work</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.010" end="00:04:31.560" style="s2">he&#39;s alleviate their stress and not</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.690" end="00:04:34.710" style="s2">calling sick so often and that we have</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.560" end="00:04:36.480" style="s2">access to the most potent aggregation of</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.710" end="00:04:38.970" style="s2">transformational tools and technologies</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.480" end="00:04:42.090" style="s2">that any humans anywhere on this planet</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.970" end="00:04:44.640" style="s2">have ever had and we&#39;re still crawling</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.090" end="00:04:47.670" style="s2">up our own asses into narcissistic</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.640" end="00:04:49.170" style="s2">feedback loops so so for me the analogy</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.670" end="00:04:51.420" style="s2">these days is you know particularly I</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.170" end="00:04:53.940" style="s2">mean well I would say sort of</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.420" end="00:04:55.290" style="s2">psychedelic Gnosticism is creating the</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.940" end="00:04:58.710" style="s2">same way over prescription of</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.290" end="00:05:00.720" style="s2">antibiotics created super flus we are</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.710" end="00:05:03.570" style="s2">sort of over prescribing ecstatic</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.720" end="00:05:05.940" style="s2">techniques and creating super egos so</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.570" end="00:05:08.550" style="s2">instead of eclipsing our senses of</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.940" end="00:05:10.350" style="s2">ourselves there are this you know 5%</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.550" end="00:05:11.640" style="s2">left and then you stop taking the</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.350" end="00:05:13.500" style="s2">medicine and then they come back</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.640" end="00:05:15.480" style="s2">stronger than ever and so now we have</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.500" end="00:05:16.500" style="s2">people thinking that they are the second</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.480" end="00:05:18.270" style="s2">coming things that they do have a</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.500" end="00:05:19.740" style="s2">hotline to divine intelligence think</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.270" end="00:05:20.850" style="s2">they know they do presume to say what</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.740" end="00:05:23.220" style="s2">the universe is about and how it</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.850" end="00:05:25.070" style="s2">operates thing they can in fact sell and</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.220" end="00:05:27.870" style="s2">sell workshops and enroll you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.070" end="00:05:29.040" style="s2">punters online to follow them around so</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.870" end="00:05:32.280" style="s2">so we&#39;ve ended up with a very</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.040" end="00:05:34.050" style="s2">problematic late stage issue which I</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.280" end="00:05:38.880" style="s2">never would have seen coming which is</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.050" end="00:05:42.270" style="s2">the resurgence of egoic virulence in the</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.880" end="00:05:44.250" style="s2">midst of transcendent technologies I</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.270" end="00:05:45.810" style="s2">actually posted something on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.250" end="00:05:49.410" style="s2">the other day that Jordan Pearson has</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.810" end="00:05:52.050" style="s2">said which was psychedelics can give you</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.410" end="00:05:54.480" style="s2">too much responsibility than you know</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.050" end="00:05:56.910" style="s2">what to deal with yeah and I mean even</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.480" end="00:05:59.280" style="s2">just phrase it that way implies that</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.910" end="00:06:01.170" style="s2">you&#39;re aware of the weight of it and the</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.280" end="00:06:03.240" style="s2">responsibility of it I think a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.170" end="00:06:05.250" style="s2">people James Fadiman the fellow who is</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.240" end="00:06:07.260" style="s2">the pioneer of micro dosing that he was</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.250" end="00:06:10.650" style="s2">on Tim Ferriss his podcast and he used</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.260" end="00:06:11.820" style="s2">the analogy of overexposing film and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.650" end="00:06:13.470" style="s2">sort of you know let&#39;s say there&#39;s one</p>

<p begin="00:06:13.470" end="00:06:17.010" style="s2">that&#39;s reality and then if you take a</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.180" end="00:06:18.810" style="s2">psychedelic that&#39;s another exposure so</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.010" end="00:06:20.340" style="s2">they said that bit of film has more</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.810" end="00:06:23.220" style="s2">information but if you keep doing if you</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.340" end="00:06:25.110" style="s2">do three four or five six times yes it</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.220" end="00:06:27.660" style="s2">has more information recorded on it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.110" end="00:06:29.690" style="s2">it&#39;s just a blurry mess and the ability</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.660" end="00:06:31.620" style="s2">to separate signal from noise or</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.690" end="00:06:33.390" style="s2">transcendence from imminence or what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.620" end="00:06:36.240" style="s2">hell do I do on Monday or am I still an</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.390" end="00:06:37.260" style="s2">asshole to my family those things get</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.240" end="00:06:39.990" style="s2">blurred out</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.260" end="00:06:41.670" style="s2">and so you know I think I think what</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.990" end="00:06:43.950" style="s2">Jordan Peterson is cautioning about is</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.670" end="00:06:46.530" style="s2">almost a fairly advanced and relatively</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.950" end="00:06:48.810" style="s2">mature stage which is that I&#39;ve seen</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.530" end="00:06:51.090" style="s2">more than I can handle but I acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.810" end="00:06:53.340" style="s2">both of those things and I&#39;m and I feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.090" end="00:06:55.800" style="s2">the weight but but I think there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.340" end="00:06:58.020" style="s2">whole degree of you know lowered levels</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.800" end="00:06:59.970" style="s2">of self-awareness where people are just</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.020" end="00:07:01.110" style="s2">getting lost in the fairy lights you</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.970" end="00:07:04.200" style="s2">know and there&#39;s sort of this cautions</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.110" end="00:07:06.270" style="s2">about that in a lot of mythological</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.200" end="00:07:08.070" style="s2">traditions you know whether it&#39;s sailors</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.270" end="00:07:09.960" style="s2">being seduced by the rapture of the deep</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.070" end="00:07:12.270" style="s2">and the mermaids and getting sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.960" end="00:07:14.070" style="s2">going off to their doom or you know in</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.270" end="00:07:15.900" style="s2">the sort of English tradition the Celtic</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.070" end="00:07:18.060" style="s2">tradition that the fairy lights in the</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.900" end="00:07:19.410" style="s2">forest and being enchanted by them and</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.060" end="00:07:21.510" style="s2">wandering off into the woods never to be</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.410" end="00:07:22.890" style="s2">seen seen again or come back and what</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.510" end="00:07:25.590" style="s2">only seemed like a minute and it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.890" end="00:07:27.890" style="s2">lifetime you know a way I think those</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.590" end="00:07:31.680" style="s2">are the kinds of the cautions that were</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.890" end="00:07:32.790" style="s2">facing and sort of freshly now I mean</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.680" end="00:07:34.590" style="s2">there was all the train wrecks of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.790" end="00:07:35.970" style="s2">sixties and all the cautionary tales</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.590" end="00:07:38.520" style="s2">about just following your bliss and</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.970" end="00:07:40.560" style="s2">doing that but we&#39;re coming back around</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.520" end="00:07:43.410" style="s2">to that point and going hey wait a tick</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.560" end="00:07:45.390" style="s2">you know there&#39;s baby more going on it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.410" end="00:07:47.880" style="s2">not just gonna be instant instant</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.390" end="00:07:50.040" style="s2">liberation for all yeah this is again</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.880" end="00:07:52.080" style="s2">fits very much with what I&#39;m saying at</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.040" end="00:07:53.670" style="s2">the moment it&#39;s like we&#39;re we&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.080" end="00:07:55.380" style="s2">another level of enthusiasm about</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.670" end="00:07:57.090" style="s2">psychedelic science for example I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.380" end="00:07:59.580" style="s2">I&#39;ve done stories about psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.090" end="00:08:00.450" style="s2">science and as far as I can tell most of</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.580" end="00:08:03.240" style="s2">the people who&#39;ve done stories about</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.450" end="00:08:04.410" style="s2">psychedelic science so far enthusiasts</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.240" end="00:08:05.460" style="s2">because those are the journalists who</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.410" end="00:08:07.050" style="s2">are following these stories they&#39;re the</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.460" end="00:08:08.640" style="s2">ones who are interested in it and so</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.050" end="00:08:11.880" style="s2">what you&#39;re actually seeing is a very</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.640" end="00:08:15.810" style="s2">one-sided again and one-sided tale of</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.880" end="00:08:17.850" style="s2">psychedelic science which is not showing</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.810" end="00:08:19.800" style="s2">the dangers that you can that they can</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.850" end="00:08:23.280" style="s2">create as well like psychedelics for</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.800" end="00:08:25.020" style="s2">example the the the kind of metaphor or</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.280" end="00:08:26.070" style="s2">the paradigm at the moment is that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.020" end="00:08:27.480" style="s2">could do a couple of psychedelic</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.070" end="00:08:29.580" style="s2">sessions and overcome your depression</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.480" end="00:08:31.669" style="s2">whereas actually what you generally do</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.580" end="00:08:33.660" style="s2">is a couple of psychic sessions may just</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.669" end="00:08:36.030" style="s2">overwhelm you with the stuff that you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.660" end="00:08:37.470" style="s2">haven&#39;t dealt with for example so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.030" end="00:08:39.599" style="s2">kind of this idea of the psychedelics as</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.470" end="00:08:40.680" style="s2">a magic pill it&#39;s kind of now coming</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.599" end="00:08:42.150" style="s2">back in the culture which just seems</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.680" end="00:08:44.460" style="s2">completely but we haven&#39;t learned</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.150" end="00:08:45.900" style="s2">anything from the 60s yeah and it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.460" end="00:08:49.200" style="s2">couched in the terms of better than</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.900" end="00:08:50.550" style="s2">Prozac which it clearly is but but</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.200" end="00:08:53.130" style="s2">certainly not a panacea</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.550" end="00:08:55.290" style="s2">I mean so in addition to the sort of</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.130" end="00:08:58.050" style="s2">psychedelic superflous idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.290" end="00:09:01.350" style="s2">I also wrestle with the notion of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.050" end="00:09:03.540" style="s2">sort of Assam the asymptote problem you</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.350" end="00:09:04.920" style="s2">know the idea that and we know and we</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.540" end="00:09:06.839" style="s2">report on these as well you know the two</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.920" end="00:09:08.070" style="s2">to three episodes with therapeutic</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.839" end="00:09:09.750" style="s2">interventions and structured</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.070" end="00:09:12.029" style="s2">environments have these amazing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.750" end="00:09:13.380" style="s2">life-saving impacts for people suffering</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.029" end="00:09:17.010" style="s2">trauma and depression and and</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.380" end="00:09:19.649" style="s2">end-of-life issues and yet you know what</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.010" end="00:09:22.620" style="s2">happens when you take it from 3 to 33</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.649" end="00:09:24.420" style="s2">and people now levitating are they</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.620" end="00:09:26.610" style="s2">demigods or they yoda is no they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.420" end="00:09:29.519" style="s2">they&#39;re just candy flipping ravers and</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.610" end="00:09:31.680" style="s2">so where where is the you know where is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.519" end="00:09:36.089" style="s2">the ROI and where should we actually say</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.680" end="00:09:38.029" style="s2">that&#39;s probably enough and and my sense</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.089" end="00:09:40.620" style="s2">is is that their problem there is</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.029" end="00:09:44.100" style="s2">highlighted and you know there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.620" end="00:09:46.019" style="s2">degree of sort of libertarian enthusiasm</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.100" end="00:09:47.790" style="s2">everyone should have access these have</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.019" end="00:09:49.980" style="s2">been repressed and controlled for a long</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.790" end="00:09:51.480" style="s2">time and now we&#39;re finally kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.980" end="00:09:53.339" style="s2">coming out of the Dark Ages or coming</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.480" end="00:09:55.589" style="s2">out of prohibition this is a renaissance</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.339" end="00:09:57.270" style="s2">and I think there&#39;s a whole bunch of</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.589" end="00:09:59.880" style="s2">reasons to be enthusiastic and hopeful</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.270" end="00:10:01.020" style="s2">about that and hat tip to maps and the</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.880" end="00:10:03.480" style="s2">folks that have been leading that charge</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.020" end="00:10:04.770" style="s2">long slow difficult work Robin cohort</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.480" end="00:10:07.649" style="s2">Harris or all the folks that are really</p>

<p begin="00:10:07.649" end="00:10:14.040" style="s2">rest of us and I&#39;m almost you know I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.510" end="00:10:17.010" style="s2">sort of sort of telegraphing ahead a few</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.040" end="00:10:20.450" style="s2">years and I&#39;m taking a stand probably</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.010" end="00:10:23.459" style="s2">now and increasingly clearly on</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.450" end="00:10:25.350" style="s2">regulation and restriction and that in</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.459" end="00:10:26.640" style="s2">fact there&#39;s probably 10% of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:26.640" end="00:10:30.089" style="s2">things there&#39;s probably only 10% of the</p>

<p begin="00:10:33.120" end="00:10:37.079" style="s2">a lifetime and there&#39;s a huge fat part</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.850" end="00:10:40.440" style="s2">of the bell curve that we should</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.079" end="00:10:42.209" style="s2">re-establish rites of passage so imagine</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.440" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">if and you know and obviously we know</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.209" end="00:10:45.029" style="s2">that confirmations and bar mitzvahs and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:47.490" style="s2">all these things have just basically</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.029" end="00:10:50.820" style="s2">fallen flat and we end up with a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.490" end="00:10:52.800" style="s2">of rudderless humans wandering in</p>
<p begin="00:10:50.820" end="00:10:54.870" style="s2">between chapters of life whether that&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:12:06.400" end="00:12:11.530" style="s2">of human history and culture but there</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.110" end="00:12:13.900" style="s2">was a tribe from New Guinea who</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.530" end="00:12:15.670" style="s2">basically had nine levels of initiation</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.900" end="00:12:17.590" style="s2">and it started with ginger so there were</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.670" end="00:12:19.420" style="s2">three levels of ginger and then three</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.590" end="00:12:22.810" style="s2">levels of tobacco and then three levels</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.420" end="00:12:24.910" style="s2">of mushrooms and each level became fewer</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.810" end="00:12:27.400" style="s2">and fewer people invited into that level</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.910" end="00:12:30.690" style="s2">until by the ninth level which was the</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.400" end="00:12:33.070" style="s2">highest octane psychedelic mushrooms</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.690" end="00:12:34.330" style="s2">basically whatever visions came out of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.070" end="00:12:36.820" style="s2">that was a literally equivalent of like</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.330" end="00:12:38.980" style="s2">a PhD and the spiritual practice of</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.820" end="00:12:40.240" style="s2">their culture but whatever came through</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.980" end="00:12:43.090" style="s2">in those visions was then considered</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.240" end="00:12:44.380" style="s2">living scripture and added to the</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.090" end="00:12:46.090" style="s2">equivalent of the Bible</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.380" end="00:12:47.680" style="s2">so rather than burning those fuckers at</p>

<p begin="00:12:47.680" end="00:12:51.550" style="s2">did like no no no no one gets to have</p>

<p begin="00:12:51.550" end="00:12:55.780" style="s2">tradition but it was also hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.890" end="00:12:57.160" style="s2">and selective so once you&#39;re introduced</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.780" end="00:12:58.960" style="s2">into a substance at the level you were</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.160" end="00:13:00.160" style="s2">initiated you had free free range and</p>

<p begin="00:18:27.370" end="00:18:32.740" style="s2">he&#39;s out there and I think that you know</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.600" end="00:18:34.510" style="s2">I mean I think at a minimum there&#39;s sort</p>

<p begin="00:18:36.430" end="00:18:40.630" style="s2">and academic which actually nobody ever</p>

<p begin="00:18:40.630" end="00:18:44.890" style="s2">kind of contrary and public intellectual</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.360" end="00:18:46.210" style="s2">which sort of you know kicked off in</p>

<p begin="00:18:46.210" end="00:18:50.230" style="s2">and then there&#39;s sort of Jordan Peterson</p>
<p begin="00:18:47.980" end="00:18:52.830" style="s2">sort of raw shot and a lot for the</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.230" end="00:18:55.690" style="s2">culture wars which both left and right</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.830" end="00:18:57.430" style="s2">wildly distort who he is what he&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:18:57.430" end="00:19:02.170" style="s2">them and so we get we get the the second</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.730" end="00:19:03.400" style="s2">and the third ones completely mixed</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.170" end="00:19:05.260" style="s2">although the first one you know</p>

<p begin="00:19:31.270" end="00:19:36.150" style="s2">well a good life well lived and now</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.600" end="00:19:40.960" style="s2">there I think there are there are</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.150" end="00:19:43.270" style="s2">problems in how in the age of soundbites</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.960" end="00:19:45.160" style="s2">and hundreds of hours of footage and</p>
<p begin="00:19:43.270" end="00:19:47.410" style="s2">tons of speaking and those kind of</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.160" end="00:19:49.750" style="s2">things that become problematic and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.410" end="00:19:51.310" style="s2">not in any way convinced that if i sat</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.750" end="00:19:53.140" style="s2">down with him and said hey mate what</p>
<p begin="00:19:51.310" end="00:19:55.480" style="s2">about this bit that he would actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.140" end="00:19:57.190" style="s2">stand a defendant but impressions I get</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.480" end="00:19:59.800" style="s2">would be that</p>
<p begin="00:19:57.190" end="00:20:02.110" style="s2">is I think he sometimes over</p>
<p begin="00:19:59.800" end="00:20:04.960" style="s2">catastrophize is the slippery slope to</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.110" end="00:20:06.610" style="s2">Marxism in the sense that that all that</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.960" end="00:20:08.620" style="s2">you know this way lies Stalinist death</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.610" end="00:20:14.500" style="s2">camps therefore we cannot give one inch</p>

<p begin="00:20:29.890" end="00:20:37.480" style="s2">peril I do I just think sometimes he</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:38.860" style="s2">uses the slippery slope argument maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.480" end="00:20:40.480" style="s2">think it pulls it out just sometimes a</p>

<p begin="00:21:43.480" end="00:21:47.190" style="s2">couple more there would be another one</p>
<p begin="00:21:44.590" end="00:21:49.840" style="s2">would just be where it where is his</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.190" end="00:21:51.010" style="s2">insight coming from and so we talking to</p>
<p begin="00:21:49.840" end="00:21:52.570" style="s2">you when you were describing hey you</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.010" end="00:21:54.460" style="s2">almost sound a little bit like Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.570" end="00:21:58.540" style="s2">pieces I mean in the sense of yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.460" end="00:22:01.350" style="s2">mean if I had to describe my worldview</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.540" end="00:22:02.920" style="s2">in a nutshell it would be sort of a</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.350" end="00:22:06.840" style="s2">Neoplatonic</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.920" end="00:22:09.640" style="s2">so there was a mere platonic stoic</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.840" end="00:22:12.250" style="s2">mystic Crist agnostic</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.640" end="00:22:13.720" style="s2">so the idea of Neoplatonic i believe i</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.250" end="00:22:16.840" style="s2">have always just sort of felt like there</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.720" end="00:22:18.610" style="s2">is a a realm of ideal forms stoic do the</p>
<p begin="00:22:16.840" end="00:22:21.580" style="s2">suck it up fat kid and do the hard thing</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.610" end="00:22:23.500" style="s2">hundred percent gnostic there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.580" end="00:22:26.020" style="s2">certain ineffable experience of being</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.500" end="00:22:28.600" style="s2">and then the mystic Christic is some</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.020" end="00:22:31.360" style="s2">some reflection on the judeo-christian</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.600" end="00:22:32.620" style="s2">Western tradition but nothing to do with</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.360" end="00:22:34.450" style="s2">2,000 years of bureaucratic</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.620" end="00:22:38.230" style="s2">administration and everything to do with</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.450" end="00:22:39.940" style="s2">what is nominally the metaphor of Kairos</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.230" end="00:22:42.210" style="s2">and Chronos the intersection of kind of</p>

<p begin="00:22:42.210" end="00:22:49.330" style="s2">in that respect yeah I would track with</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.130" end="00:22:54.040" style="s2">with Peterson my sense is for me my you</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.330" end="00:22:57.340" style="s2">know gnosis or understanding has come</p>
<p begin="00:22:54.040" end="00:23:00.940" style="s2">from X ptosis has come from peak</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.340" end="00:23:02.410" style="s2">experiences and my sense for him at</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.940" end="00:23:04.600" style="s2">least as he shares what he does of his</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.410" end="00:23:06.090" style="s2">life has come from catharsis has come</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.600" end="00:23:07.780" style="s2">from the suffering it&#39;s come from</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.090" end="00:23:10.809" style="s2">battling depression it&#39;s come from</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.780" end="00:23:12.010" style="s2">staring the abyss in the face versus the</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.809" end="00:23:14.620" style="s2">view from the summit and those are</p>
<p begin="00:23:12.010" end="00:23:15.790" style="s2">ideally come full circle and reinforce</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.620" end="00:23:18.190" style="s2">each other but if I had to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.790" end="00:23:20.620" style="s2">delineate maybe where is his</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.190" end="00:23:22.570" style="s2">transmission anchoring from it&#39;s maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.620" end="00:23:26.290" style="s2">little bit more the staring the abyss</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.570" end="00:23:28.090" style="s2">and and and surviving it then then</p>

<p begin="00:23:32.559" end="00:23:37.290" style="s2">darkweb concepts or just grow and become</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.110" end="00:23:39.429" style="s2">kind of mainstream yeah I mean that we</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.290" end="00:23:40.840" style="s2">interestingly the the glitch in the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.429" end="00:23:43.210" style="s2">matrix document show put out was</p>
<p begin="00:23:40.840" end="00:23:45.429" style="s2">subtitled intellectual dark web Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.210" end="00:23:49.120" style="s2">Peterson and the mainstream media two</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.429" end="00:23:51.340" style="s2">months ago and then the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:23:49.120" end="00:23:52.750" style="s2">did a profile on it and then we</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.340" end="00:23:54.850" style="s2">published something said that said the</p>
<p begin="00:23:52.750" end="00:23:56.140" style="s2">intellectual dart web is dead because</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.850" end="00:23:57.610" style="s2">did yeah</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.140" end="00:24:00.100" style="s2">because as soon as the New York Times</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.610" end="00:24:02.200" style="s2">published i publicize or something on it</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.100" end="00:24:07.299" style="s2">then there is no intellectual diet web</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.200" end="00:24:08.980" style="s2">it is now mainstream so I was actually</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.299" end="00:24:10.470" style="s2">in the process of kind of putting</p>
<p begin="00:24:08.980" end="00:24:13.000" style="s2">together an intellectual dark web</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.470" end="00:24:15.280" style="s2">documentary and then off the back of</p>
<p begin="00:24:13.000" end="00:24:17.320" style="s2">that we kind of had a thought about it</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.280" end="00:24:18.910" style="s2">and realized that for me the</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.320" end="00:24:22.900" style="s2">intellectual dark web so you&#39;ve got kind</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.910" end="00:24:23.170" style="s2">of like Dave Rubin the Weinsteins Ben</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.900" end="00:24:26.050" style="s2">chip</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.170" end="00:24:28.510" style="s2">Oh Jordan Peterson then I realized I was</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.050" end="00:24:30.940" style="s2">sort of starting to think about what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.510" end="00:24:33.300" style="s2">a deeper resolution like that that seems</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.940" end="00:24:35.020" style="s2">to me like a really important stage of</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.300" end="00:24:36.760" style="s2">surfacing this kind of level of</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.020" end="00:24:38.770" style="s2">conversation an integral conversation or</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.760" end="00:24:40.630" style="s2">something on that&#39;s emerging naturally</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.770" end="00:24:43.270" style="s2">and then we came up with a concept of</p>
<p begin="00:24:40.630" end="00:24:45.220" style="s2">the intellectual deep web so what are</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.270" end="00:24:46.720" style="s2">the and what are the knowledge what is</p>
<p begin="00:24:45.220" end="00:24:48.790" style="s2">the knowledge that that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.720" end="00:24:52.270" style="s2">integrated and I came up with names like</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.790" end="00:24:55.090" style="s2">Stan Grof Richard tarnis and I would</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.270" end="00:24:56.470" style="s2">also add your work into that what do you</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.090" end="00:25:00.940" style="s2">what do you think about that as an idea</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.470" end="00:25:03.520" style="s2">of there are thinkers who&#39;ve been who&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.940" end="00:25:05.260" style="s2">been doing really great work do you know</p>
<p begin="00:25:03.520" end="00:25:07.120" style="s2">Richard Hannes yeah we&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.260" end="00:25:09.460" style="s2">really great work on the fringes of our</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.120" end="00:25:11.470" style="s2">culture for an awfully long time and I</p>
<p begin="00:25:09.460" end="00:25:13.900" style="s2">personally I think these are the people</p>
<p begin="00:25:11.470" end="00:25:17.200" style="s2">we need to integrate to get us through</p>
<p begin="00:25:13.900" end="00:25:20.290" style="s2">the next five ten years yeah I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:17.200" end="00:25:22.480" style="s2">that&#39;s a neat distinction you&#39;re making</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.290" end="00:25:24.190" style="s2">I think I just read a piece in box I</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.480" end="00:25:26.290" style="s2">think this morning which was basically</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.190" end="00:25:27.460" style="s2">it was felt a little snarky and it was</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.290" end="00:25:29.170" style="s2">basically saying that the internet was</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.460" end="00:25:30.910" style="s2">response to the New York Times piece you</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.170" end="00:25:32.830" style="s2">know is basically saying oh the</p>
<p begin="00:25:30.910" end="00:25:35.020" style="s2">intellectual dark web were just a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.830" end="00:25:37.930" style="s2">of embittered losers on the on the outs</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.020" end="00:25:39.250" style="s2">and and and effectively they&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:25:37.930" end="00:25:41.200" style="s2">marginalized by the people who should</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.250" end="00:25:43.540" style="s2">have marginalize them and they&#39;re really</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.200" end="00:25:44.950" style="s2">just angry because they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:25:43.540" end="00:25:46.630" style="s2">been sort of knocked off their perch or</p>
<p begin="00:25:44.950" end="00:25:48.190" style="s2">denied a platform and that&#39;s just I mean</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.630" end="00:25:51.340" style="s2">I don&#39;t know I mean I bet we can do</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.190" end="00:25:54.280" style="s2">actually and a data analysis of this my</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.340" end="00:25:56.530" style="s2">sense of Jordan of Sam Harris of these</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.280" end="00:25:57.850" style="s2">guys is not that they are embittered and</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.530" end="00:25:59.950" style="s2">on the outside banging on the door</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.850" end="00:26:02.770" style="s2">they&#39;ve just done done on an end run and</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.950" end="00:26:05.140" style="s2">their actual reaches infinitely greater</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.770" end="00:26:07.780" style="s2">then I mean just retweets views clicks</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.140" end="00:26:10.990" style="s2">likes shares you name it any any social</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.780" end="00:26:16.000" style="s2">static my sense is that their reach is</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.990" end="00:26:17.200" style="s2">is exploding massively know that they&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:16.000" end="00:26:20.320" style="s2">been sort of shut out from the</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.200" end="00:26:22.030" style="s2">chattering classes so I think there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:20.320" end="00:26:24.730" style="s2">there a very there are and back to the</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.030" end="00:26:26.800" style="s2">Rorschach blot idea there was the sense</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.730" end="00:26:29.170" style="s2">of these guys are saying saying the</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.800" end="00:26:32.500" style="s2">unconscionable and should be shunned so</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.170" end="00:26:33.670" style="s2">the intellectual deep web is I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.500" end="00:26:35.290" style="s2">doesn&#39;t quite have the mystery of the</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.670" end="00:26:36.509" style="s2">dark web but but as far as like the</p>
<p begin="00:26:35.290" end="00:26:39.869" style="s2">distinctions of content</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.509" end="00:26:41.940" style="s2">I think it&#39;s really neat and we are we</p>
<p begin="00:26:39.869" end="00:26:44.759" style="s2">kind of saw this in the 2016 election</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.940" end="00:26:47.039" style="s2">both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump did</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.759" end="00:26:49.259" style="s2">an runs around the Democratic and DNC in</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.039" end="00:26:51.779" style="s2">the RNC and they said if we can reach</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.259" end="00:26:54.869" style="s2">our people via our own distributed</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.779" end="00:26:57.209" style="s2">economic platforms we are no longer the</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.869" end="00:26:59.099" style="s2">holdin to the donor class we were no</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.209" end="00:27:02.219" style="s2">longer beholding to established and</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.099" end="00:27:04.529" style="s2">entrenched you know political platforms</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.219" end="00:27:06.929" style="s2">and choice-making and we can just and we</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.529" end="00:27:09.209" style="s2">can make we can amplify via the</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.929" end="00:27:10.829" style="s2">democratic system our impact and i reach</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.209" end="00:27:12.779" style="s2">and you see that with musical artists</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.829" end="00:27:14.159" style="s2">these days you see that in email even</p>
<p begin="00:27:12.779" end="00:27:16.109" style="s2">with yoga teachers if you&#39;ve got a big</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.159" end="00:27:18.059" style="s2">following on Instagram and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.109" end="00:27:19.319" style="s2">need to kowtow to some lineage which you</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.059" end="00:27:21.989" style="s2">know has lots of problems as well</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.319" end="00:27:24.839" style="s2">because all of the vetting of the light</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.989" end="00:27:26.759" style="s2">web you know if the establishment did</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.839" end="00:27:29.219" style="s2">have a solid degree of quality control</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.759" end="00:27:31.679" style="s2">to it so you tended not to get absolute</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.219" end="00:27:33.509" style="s2">howling ly bad or irresponsible folks</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.679" end="00:27:36.690" style="s2">showing up in that space but you also</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.509" end="00:27:40.169" style="s2">missed a shit ton of innovation so you</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.690" end="00:27:42.509" style="s2">know to your query of is is the access</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.169" end="00:27:44.699" style="s2">to the intellectual deep web something</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.509" end="00:27:47.729" style="s2">that is going to be helpful in guiding</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.699" end="00:27:49.199" style="s2">our way forward my my I so I would I</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.729" end="00:27:50.999" style="s2">would go as far as saying that would be</p>
<p begin="00:27:49.199" end="00:27:52.979" style="s2">like my only hope for a kind of glorious</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.999" end="00:27:55.589" style="s2">of a revolution of us is a bloody reign</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.979" end="00:27:59.429" style="s2">of terror if we can simply if the people</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.589" end="00:28:01.649" style="s2">and the ideas and then the actions can</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.429" end="00:28:04.739" style="s2">just do an end run around the</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.649" end="00:28:06.779" style="s2">established balances of power and again</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.739" end="00:28:08.909" style="s2">you know but it would be an example like</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.779" end="00:28:10.649" style="s2">what is that true progressive centrist</p>
<p begin="00:28:08.909" end="00:28:12.979" style="s2">who is you know socially progressive and</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.649" end="00:28:14.489" style="s2">fiscally conservative and</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.979" end="00:28:16.589" style="s2">internationally</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.489" end="00:28:19.619" style="s2">I wouldn&#39;t say pacifist but certainly</p>
<p begin="00:28:16.589" end="00:28:21.569" style="s2">just ethical and globally concerned with</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.619" end="00:28:23.279" style="s2">interconnected issues like climate like</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.569" end="00:28:25.469" style="s2">refugees excetera how many people would</p>
<p begin="00:28:23.279" end="00:28:28.499" style="s2">sign up for that I think a lot I think a</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.469" end="00:28:30.629" style="s2">lot I don&#39;t think there would be a just</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.499" end="00:28:32.249" style="s2">forget third party candidates you would</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.629" end="00:28:33.989" style="s2">just end up with an uprising and the two</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.249" end="00:28:36.389" style="s2">existing parties would be left you know</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.989" end="00:28:39.419" style="s2">holding their dicks so the question</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.389" end="00:28:41.219" style="s2">becomes how do we do more of that and</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.419" end="00:28:44.579" style="s2">and how do we and how do we provide</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.219" end="00:28:46.859" style="s2">enough of a clarion call that people can</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.579" end="00:28:48.669" style="s2">reorient around those things you talked</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.859" end="00:28:50.919" style="s2">in your talk before</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.669" end="00:28:52.629" style="s2">it sounded quite pessimistic or almost</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.919" end="00:28:54.999" style="s2">quite apocalyptic about what might be</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.629" end="00:28:58.289" style="s2">about to come are you you pessimistic or</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.999" end="00:29:01.919" style="s2">optimistic hmm I would say I am highly</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.289" end="00:29:06.340" style="s2">pessimistic of human culture and</p>
<p begin="00:29:01.919" end="00:29:09.279" style="s2">optimistic of human nature and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.340" end="00:29:11.139" style="s2">Browder that&#39;s about as precise as I can</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.279" end="00:29:12.879" style="s2">get because if I if you if you run the</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.139" end="00:29:15.369" style="s2">maps and models and you see I mean the</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.879" end="00:29:19.570" style="s2">thing that blows me away about identity</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.369" end="00:29:22.619" style="s2">politics these days is you know we have</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.570" end="00:29:25.419" style="s2">some things to do people and if we</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.619" end="00:29:28.149" style="s2">quibbling and scrapping before we even</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.419" end="00:29:31.869" style="s2">get to the starting line of the race for</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.149" end="00:29:35.649" style="s2">our lives what&#39;s fucked and so you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.869" end="00:29:36.429" style="s2">as of last summer I went from well I</p>
<p begin="00:29:35.649" end="00:29:37.600" style="s2">mean that was soon of you know the</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.429" end="00:29:38.649" style="s2">steaming fire just come out there was</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.600" end="00:29:40.029" style="s2">all sorts of interesting companies</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.649" end="00:29:41.919" style="s2">conversations and that kind of thing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.029" end="00:29:44.919" style="s2">then I would say I had a fairly you know</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.919" end="00:29:47.320" style="s2">not dare I say it was my equivalent of</p>

<p begin="00:36:08.670" end="00:36:13.020" style="s2">funnily enough like that that&#39;s to me</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.410" end="00:36:18.120" style="s2">that that phrase actually was a little</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.020" end="00:36:20.280" style="s2">bit of an incantation so it&#39;s not even</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.120" end="00:36:26.040" style="s2">just in time like in the Nick kind of</p>

<p begin="00:37:52.020" end="00:37:57.450" style="s2">is that if if enough people can come to</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.140" end="00:37:59.910" style="s2">that realization then then we wake up</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.450" end="00:38:01.920" style="s2">and not in some bullshit evangelical</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.910" end="00:38:05.339" style="s2">megachurch kind of way of being born</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.920" end="00:38:07.290" style="s2">again but in in a truly initiatory way</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.339" end="00:38:09.660" style="s2">being born again of like I know my</p>

<p begin="00:38:26.580" end="00:38:30.990" style="s2">turn things on a dime if we do this</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.710" end="00:38:34.080" style="s2">incrementally if we get hung up around</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.990" end="00:38:36.240" style="s2">identity politics if we imagine that</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.080" end="00:38:37.710" style="s2">technological progressivism will save us</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.240" end="00:38:40.800" style="s2">at last man I think there&#39;s an all sorts</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.710" end="00:38:43.140" style="s2">of crumbs on that but if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.800" end="00:38:47.760" style="s2">chance to do it I you know ironically</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.140" end="00:38:49.859" style="s2">out of time in in that sacred space then</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.760" end="00:38:52.440" style="s2">we have a chance to do it in time you</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.859" end="00:38:55.290" style="s2">know well the clock is ticking yeah the</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.440" end="00:38:57.750" style="s2">people that I&#39;ve found who&#39;ve done the</p>
<p begin="00:38:55.290" end="00:38:59.520" style="s2">most or seem to have got at least far</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.750" end="00:39:01.050" style="s2">enough down the path those who&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.520" end="00:39:03.450" style="s2">through a sort of transformational</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.050" end="00:39:06.150" style="s2">community but the guy who as I who&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.450" end="00:39:07.920" style="s2">mentor guy called raffia was part of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.150" end="00:39:09.119" style="s2">Osho community for many years which was</p>
<p begin="00:39:07.920" end="00:39:10.530" style="s2">sort of experiment with all of these</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.119" end="00:39:12.330" style="s2">kind of transformational technologies</p>
<p begin="00:39:10.530" end="00:39:15.630" style="s2">but they were doing it within a</p>
<p begin="00:39:12.330" end="00:39:17.280" style="s2">community of people for two decades who</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.630" end="00:39:19.260" style="s2">were all refer who are all doing the</p>
<p begin="00:39:17.280" end="00:39:21.420" style="s2">same thing reflecting stuff back and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.260" end="00:39:24.720" style="s2">took it seems to have taken that level</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.420" end="00:39:27.060" style="s2">of intensity and reflection and shared</p>
<p begin="00:39:24.720" end="00:39:29.070" style="s2">purpose for them to have done the</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.060" end="00:39:31.410" style="s2">transformations that they have like</p>
<p begin="00:39:29.070" end="00:39:34.290" style="s2">they&#39;re almost know like it seems</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.410" end="00:39:35.970" style="s2">striking to me like how much work we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.290" end="00:39:38.550" style="s2">seemed to have to do to get to that</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.970" end="00:39:40.650" style="s2">place does that make sense</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.550" end="00:39:41.820" style="s2">like that sort of reflects back to what</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.650" end="00:39:44.280" style="s2">you were saying about sort of the</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.820" end="00:39:46.349" style="s2">psychedelic communities it&#39;s like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.280" end="00:39:49.290" style="s2">not the it&#39;s not the transcendence it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.349" end="00:39:52.040" style="s2">the deep interpersonal work that we have</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.290" end="00:39:54.920" style="s2">to do of intense interpersonal</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.040" end="00:39:56.210" style="s2">with with communities like I think we</p>
<p begin="00:39:54.920" end="00:39:58.970" style="s2">have to build that kind of community</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.210" end="00:40:01.250" style="s2">yeah for sure and that you know the</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.970" end="00:40:02.900" style="s2">catharsis plus communitas is another</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.250" end="00:40:05.750" style="s2">cul-de-sac I mean we know a number of</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.900" end="00:40:07.940" style="s2">communities they&#39;re very deeply into raw</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.750" end="00:40:09.740" style="s2">intimate inter subjective communication</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.940" end="00:40:10.760" style="s2">and a everybody ends up banging</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.740" end="00:40:12.650" style="s2">everybody and there&#39;s tons of drama</p>
<p begin="00:40:10.760" end="00:40:13.970" style="s2">around that and then be everybody you</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.650" end="00:40:15.260" style="s2">know if I can just getting your lunch</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.970" end="00:40:16.490" style="s2">takes an hour and a half because</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.260" end="00:40:18.770" style="s2">everyone&#39;s sharing how they&#39;re feeling</p>
<p begin="00:40:16.490" end="00:40:20.570" style="s2">in the moment and you&#39;re like okay that</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.770" end="00:40:24.859" style="s2">too is a necessary but not sufficient</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.570" end="00:40:27.410" style="s2">criteria and and that sense of you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:24.859" end="00:40:29.000" style="s2">back to the 80/20 I think what traps so</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.410" end="00:40:31.369" style="s2">many of the people who are into process</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.000" end="00:40:33.500" style="s2">based communities is that they get the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.369" end="00:40:35.990" style="s2">cathartic hit for the first you know</p>
<p begin="00:40:33.500" end="00:40:38.270" style="s2">they and that&#39;s 80% of the with their</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.990" end="00:40:40.490" style="s2">20% investment but they hang on and they</p>
<p begin="00:40:38.270" end="00:40:41.840" style="s2">keep going back to ring the same bow and</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.490" end="00:40:43.160" style="s2">I mean the same that&#39;s like no of course</p>
<p begin="00:40:41.840" end="00:40:44.510" style="s2">we need to be able to be aware of our</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.160" end="00:40:45.890" style="s2">feelings and of course we need to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.510" end="00:40:47.630" style="s2">able to process stuff and stay as clear</p>
<p begin="00:40:45.890" end="00:40:49.520" style="s2">as possible and of course we sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.630" end="00:40:51.020" style="s2">need to check in with infinite sin</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.520" end="00:40:53.900" style="s2">absolutes just to make sure we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.020" end="00:40:57.410" style="s2">keeping time and then there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:40:53.900" end="00:40:59.450" style="s2">element of integration and service yeah</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.410" end="00:41:01.460" style="s2">let&#39;s go slip the whole stay awake build</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.450" end="00:41:03.800" style="s2">stuff like if we&#39;re not if we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.460" end="00:41:06.560" style="s2">doing those two things in concert then</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.800" end="00:41:08.119" style="s2">the just staying awake just becomes an</p>

<p begin="00:41:08.119" end="00:41:13.820" style="s2">and if we&#39;re just building stuff but</p>
