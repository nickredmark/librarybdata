<p begin="00:01:19.950" end="00:01:26.280" style="s2">to combat misinformation specifically in</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.790" end="00:01:28.680" style="s2">politics and science but in just your</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.280" end="00:01:31.170" style="s2">general news and other areas as well but</p>

<p begin="00:02:06.420" end="00:02:11.180" style="s2">had this much technical difficulty yet</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.340" end="00:02:15.950" style="s2">so okay I think I&#39;m bad how</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.180" end="00:02:18.650" style="s2">this happens again I&#39;ll likes to pair to</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.950" end="00:02:22.549" style="s2">my cell phone and see if that helps okay</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.650" end="00:02:25.340" style="s2">so I&#39;m hoping it at least covered like</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.549" end="00:02:30.890" style="s2">the first very basic intro to wiki</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.340" end="00:02:32.290" style="s2">election yeah aspirations okay so first</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.890" end="00:02:34.760" style="s2">just as I was going through my</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.290" end="00:02:36.159" style="s2">aspirations I felt myself listing a lot</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.760" end="00:02:38.930" style="s2">of like the basic stuff that probably</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.159" end="00:02:41.810" style="s2">everyone that does this it&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.930" end="00:02:45.680" style="s2">have as an aspiration so I didn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.810" end="00:02:46.940" style="s2">those under the assumption that that</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.680" end="00:02:49.489" style="s2">would just sort of come out naturally</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.940" end="00:02:51.109" style="s2">and the two major assumptions that I had</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.489" end="00:02:52.760" style="s2">that I just wanted to make sure we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.109" end="00:02:55.129" style="s2">down or that one if there&#39;s any make</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.760" end="00:02:57.730" style="s2">major questions or concerns that anyone</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.129" end="00:03:01.069" style="s2">has with the project or a certain part</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.730" end="00:03:03.349" style="s2">that will get raised anyway and then as</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.069" end="00:03:04.849" style="s2">well if there&#39;s anything with the for</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.349" end="00:03:06.739" style="s2">luck of a better term the business model</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.849" end="00:03:08.750" style="s2">I&#39;m just like how things are structured</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.739" end="00:03:11.659" style="s2">if there&#39;s any major funding</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.750" end="00:03:13.700" style="s2">opportunities that I&#39;m overlooking that</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.659" end="00:03:19.730" style="s2">kind of thing that that will come out as</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.700" end="00:03:21.889" style="s2">well so my aspirations are one where to</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.730" end="00:03:24.949" style="s2">focus the explanation as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.889" end="00:03:26.449" style="s2">see as we go there&#39;s a lot to it and a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.949" end="00:03:28.430" style="s2">major part of the challenge for me is</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.449" end="00:03:32.150" style="s2">figuring out how to explain it to get</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.430" end="00:03:33.470" style="s2">people interested is that it everyone</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.150" end="00:03:34.699" style="s2">that I&#39;ve ever like sat down and had a</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.470" end="00:03:36.769" style="s2">conversation with seems to agree that</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.699" end="00:03:38.930" style="s2">it&#39;s you know they&#39;re a really important</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.769" end="00:03:41.000" style="s2">thing and that this seems like it should</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.930" end="00:03:42.530" style="s2">probably work but to actually sit down</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.000" end="00:03:44.989" style="s2">and have that conversation usually you</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.530" end="00:03:47.720" style="s2">know it&#39;s 20 30 minutes and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.989" end="00:03:53.000" style="s2">have that amount of time to get somebody</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.720" end="00:03:55.400" style="s2">interested you usually next as I&#39;m sure</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.000" end="00:03:58.250" style="s2">you&#39;ll see as we go through it</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.400" end="00:04:02.389" style="s2">Trust is incredibly important for what</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.250" end="00:04:04.069" style="s2">we&#39;re trying to do and so any ideas for</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.389" end="00:04:06.709" style="s2">either things that I can do or the</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.069" end="00:04:08.239" style="s2">organization or the project or anything</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.709" end="00:04:10.669" style="s2">that you think that either you</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.239" end="00:04:12.440" style="s2">personally are concerned about or that</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.669" end="00:04:13.819" style="s2">the public might have some concerns and</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.440" end="00:04:15.949" style="s2">things that we can do to sort of build</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.819" end="00:04:17.359" style="s2">trust that would be necessary for</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.949" end="00:04:21.709" style="s2">someone to believe a source like this</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:24.460" style="s2">and then finally ideas for like the</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.709" end="00:04:26.710" style="s2">levels of content needed before</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.460" end="00:04:29.080" style="s2">this is ready to really talk about to</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.710" end="00:04:32.919" style="s2">the general public which is kind of tied</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.080" end="00:04:34.990" style="s2">to the first thing on sort of where to</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.919" end="00:04:36.669" style="s2">focus the explanation but then a step</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.990" end="00:04:39.520" style="s2">more on what kind of content is needed</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.669" end="00:04:43.539" style="s2">is just like text that maybe some clips</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.520" end="00:04:45.210" style="s2">of this video okay or you know is it</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.539" end="00:04:48.389" style="s2">complex enough that it requires</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.210" end="00:04:50.320" style="s2">infographics and that type of thing</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.389" end="00:04:52.660" style="s2">alright thank you</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.320" end="00:04:55.900" style="s2">and now I&#39;m at a loss or how can you</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.660" end="00:04:58.360" style="s2">actually do that but that is the point</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.900" end="00:05:01.599" style="s2">of the aspiration so I have written here</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.360" end="00:05:03.580" style="s2">is to help you focus your explanation to</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.599" end="00:05:05.410" style="s2">explain it to get people interested I</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.580" end="00:05:07.930" style="s2">did have a question about that if anyone</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.410" end="00:05:10.539" style="s2">else is stepping in and then how Trust</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.930" end="00:05:13.509" style="s2">is important is how we need to how do we</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.539" end="00:05:16.050" style="s2">get people to trust in wiki elections so</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.509" end="00:05:16.050" style="s2">that it&#39;s useful</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.900" end="00:05:23.199" style="s2">and ideas for the levels of content so</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.310" end="00:05:25.150" style="s2">if anyone else has some questions or</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.199" end="00:05:28.840" style="s2">comments on that either in the comments</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.150" end="00:05:30.039" style="s2">or Eric yeah I mean well I&#39;ve got a</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.840" end="00:05:31.750" style="s2">couple of questions but I mean I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.039" end="00:05:33.039" style="s2">want to jump in in front of you Jubilee</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.750" end="00:05:34.180" style="s2">if you&#39;ve got something you go ahead but</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.039" end="00:05:39.010" style="s2">yeah I mean I do have a couple of things</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.180" end="00:05:40.930" style="s2">so question was when you said explain to</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.010" end="00:05:42.430" style="s2">get people interested what did people</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.930" end="00:05:44.080" style="s2">entrusted me does that mean people</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.430" end="00:05:46.419" style="s2">working on the project people using the</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.080" end="00:05:49.690" style="s2">project funding it what is your main</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.419" end="00:05:52.750" style="s2">focus for the interest or all of you um</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.690" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">I mean kind of all three initially so</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.750" end="00:05:58.030" style="s2">the goal of the project is I come from</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.080" end="00:05:59.349" style="s2">sort of the business software world so I</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.030" end="00:06:01.900" style="s2">would organize it&#39;s sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.349" end="00:06:03.759" style="s2">business project where my goal is to</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.900" end="00:06:05.650" style="s2">actually be able to fund it like a</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.759" end="00:06:09.190" style="s2">project and it you know paid developers</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.650" end="00:06:11.560" style="s2">to for their time that kind of thing so</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.190" end="00:06:13.509" style="s2">it&#39;s to be able to pay for it but also</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.560" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">even if we got a billion dollars</p>
<p begin="00:06:13.509" end="00:06:17.590" style="s2">tomorrow we would still need an army of</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.330" style="s2">people to give feedback because I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.590" end="00:06:21.400" style="s2">just want one group of people to give</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.330" end="00:06:23.740" style="s2">feedback that will help build their</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.400" end="00:06:25.150" style="s2">trust but then if you pick one group the</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.740" end="00:06:28.539" style="s2">group on the opposite side will feel</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.150" end="00:06:30.460" style="s2">sort of you know justifiably left out</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.539" end="00:06:32.620" style="s2">and like their sides not being</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.460" end="00:06:34.479" style="s2">represented in the conversation so to</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.620" end="00:06:37.419" style="s2">build a full community of people that</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.479" end="00:06:38.210" style="s2">are interested in even if not you know</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.419" end="00:06:40.509" style="s2">not everyone</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.210" end="00:06:43.039" style="s2">the community has to help fund it but</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.509" end="00:06:44.990" style="s2">participate in the development of it and</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.039" end="00:06:47.630" style="s2">during the early phases there&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.990" end="00:06:49.250" style="s2">be a lot of like we&#39;re reviewing content</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.630" end="00:06:51.259" style="s2">and sort of people chiming in and</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.250" end="00:06:55.280" style="s2">actually doing the work that will make</p>
<p begin="00:06:51.259" end="00:06:59.539" style="s2">what he let you look hopefully that</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.280" end="00:07:00.800" style="s2">answered your question yes yes Eric that</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.539" end="00:07:06.979" style="s2">was my only question we&#39;ve talked about</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.800" end="00:07:08.960" style="s2">this a lot so I forgive me but I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.979" end="00:07:10.430" style="s2">gonna I&#39;m gonna start a very sort of</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.960" end="00:07:12.789" style="s2">basic level just to be clear that I</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.430" end="00:07:15.919" style="s2">understand what it is first of all right</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.789" end="00:07:18.289" style="s2">so yeah so I&#39;m guessing this is some</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.919" end="00:07:21.199" style="s2">kind of a system of record-keeping of</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.289" end="00:07:24.349" style="s2">politicians or promises kept or broken</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.199" end="00:07:26.300" style="s2">how they vote in particular you know in</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.349" end="00:07:28.099" style="s2">particular policy areas that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.300" end="00:07:30.229" style="s2">thing right so they can&#39;t say one thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.099" end="00:07:32.000" style="s2">when in fact their record says something</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.229" end="00:07:33.620" style="s2">different is that it would that be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.000" end="00:07:37.180" style="s2">part of it that kind of thing they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.620" end="00:07:41.360" style="s2">feeling a part of it yeah right okay and</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.180" end="00:07:43.159" style="s2">the information would be updated by what</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.360" end="00:07:45.349" style="s2">potentially any user like a Wikipedia</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.159" end="00:07:46.550" style="s2">kind of thing so any user if they find</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.349" end="00:07:47.840" style="s2">something out about a particular</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.550" end="00:07:50.090" style="s2">politician that they&#39;ve done they could</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.840" end="00:07:53.229" style="s2">update the record of that politician in</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.090" end="00:07:55.760" style="s2">a similar way to the way Wikipedia works</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.229" end="00:07:58.729" style="s2">okay cut up for a second but I&#39;m pretty</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.760" end="00:08:00.470" style="s2">sure I got the gist of is it like</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.729" end="00:08:04.490" style="s2">anybody can go in there and add</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.470" end="00:08:06.949" style="s2">information like yes yes pedia not quite</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.490" end="00:08:08.889" style="s2">one of the important parts is we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.949" end="00:08:11.479" style="s2">gonna have multiple levels of</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.889" end="00:08:13.280" style="s2">verification so that you can&#39;t just go</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.479" end="00:08:16.430" style="s2">and create you know ten users and they</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.280" end="00:08:18.139" style="s2">all go in there and add content and vote</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.430" end="00:08:20.240" style="s2">on things there&#39;s a level of personal</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.139" end="00:08:22.400" style="s2">purification just are you the person</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.240" end="00:08:25.280" style="s2">that you say you are but then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.400" end="00:08:26.720" style="s2">also some level of like tracking your</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.280" end="00:08:28.970" style="s2">qualifications or tracking what you</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.720" end="00:08:30.830" style="s2">personally have like said this is true</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.970" end="00:08:33.529" style="s2">the best not true this seems like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.830" end="00:08:36.409" style="s2">you know where things will end up so</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.529" end="00:08:39.079" style="s2">that as you vote on things if let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.409" end="00:08:41.240" style="s2">you&#39;re a scientist you&#39;re then your</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.079" end="00:08:44.450" style="s2">opinion might be weighted more heavily</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.240" end="00:08:48.650" style="s2">in you know the areas that the human</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.450" end="00:08:52.130" style="s2">expert okay so the race sorry go ahead</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.650" end="00:08:54.529" style="s2">my girlhood good but technically anybody</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.130" end="00:08:57.380" style="s2">can sort of you know sign up and and</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.529" end="00:09:00.670" style="s2">take a look but for their sort of input</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.380" end="00:09:03.110" style="s2">to be given more weight the more</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.670" end="00:09:04.730" style="s2">verification they&#39;ve gone through and</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.110" end="00:09:07.399" style="s2">the more that we can sort of see that</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.730" end="00:09:09.110" style="s2">they know what what they&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.399" end="00:09:11.660" style="s2">about they have you know weight it will</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.110" end="00:09:13.399" style="s2">be it so the waiting would be based on</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.660" end="00:09:15.199" style="s2">basically two things firstly their</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.399" end="00:09:18.949" style="s2">credentials their expertise in that</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.199" end="00:09:21.769" style="s2">subject area and be on previous history</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.949" end="00:09:24.199" style="s2">of having made honest and truthful</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.769" end="00:09:27.139" style="s2">contributions right is that basically</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.199" end="00:09:29.740" style="s2">right is that the idea in my mind those</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.139" end="00:09:32.420" style="s2">are sort of two sides of the same like</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.740" end="00:09:35.060" style="s2">what are their credentials I personally</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.420" end="00:09:36.769" style="s2">don&#39;t care if somebody is a plumber and</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.060" end="00:09:38.000" style="s2">they&#39;re really good at science and they</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.769" end="00:09:39.740" style="s2">chime in to the conversation and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:41.630" style="s2">always right I want that person to have</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.740" end="00:09:41.839" style="s2">a spot in the conversation all I care</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.630" end="00:09:44.690" style="s2">about</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.839" end="00:09:46.850" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m just maybe getting a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.690" end="00:09:48.769" style="s2">too bogged down in detail there but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.850" end="00:09:51.069" style="s2">curious as to how this sort of threshold</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.769" end="00:09:53.870" style="s2">system might work you know how many</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.069" end="00:09:55.850" style="s2">contributions who judges whether or not</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.870" end="00:09:58.670" style="s2">it was a worthwhile contribution how</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.850" end="00:10:00.410" style="s2">worthwhile it was you know how are these</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.670" end="00:10:02.449" style="s2">things assesses it seems to me that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.410" end="00:10:03.829" style="s2">come back to at some point someone&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.449" end="00:10:05.540" style="s2">making a decision what about what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.829" end="00:10:08.540" style="s2">better than something else right right</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.540" end="00:10:10.939" style="s2">so a big part of it is it it&#39;s meant to</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.540" end="00:10:12.290" style="s2">be and this might be too broad it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.939" end="00:10:14.720" style="s2">meant to be having conversations through</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.290" end="00:10:16.160" style="s2">data instead of through words so instead</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.720" end="00:10:18.170" style="s2">of somebody just going and typing up</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.160" end="00:10:21.560" style="s2">like an essay and saying hey is this</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.170" end="00:10:23.600" style="s2">good and then people judging it at the</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.560" end="00:10:25.819" style="s2">very core level everything is about what</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.600" end="00:10:28.130" style="s2">I&#39;m calling the evidence so if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.819" end="00:10:29.750" style="s2">something scientific it&#39;s the scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.130" end="00:10:32.259" style="s2">studies it&#39;s the things that behind this</p>
<p begin="00:10:29.750" end="00:10:35.600" style="s2">actually send to each other and read and</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.259" end="00:10:38.920" style="s2">review to say you know what&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.600" end="00:10:41.569" style="s2">what&#39;s actually happening then that is</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.920" end="00:10:44.480" style="s2">split out into okay here&#39;s how we assess</p>
<p begin="00:10:41.569" end="00:10:46.189" style="s2">scientific articles but here is what</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.480" end="00:10:48.019" style="s2">makes a good scientific article here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.189" end="00:10:49.639" style="s2">woman it&#39;s a bad scientific article here</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.019" end="00:10:52.310" style="s2">are the things to to to watch out for</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.639" end="00:10:55.130" style="s2">and a system is built to sort of let the</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.310" end="00:10:58.850" style="s2">community assess in this case scientific</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.130" end="00:11:01.699" style="s2">articles Nam and then in that content</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.850" end="00:11:04.459" style="s2">the goal is to sort of have small tasks</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.699" end="00:11:05.840" style="s2">where you say okay read through this and</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.459" end="00:11:09.650" style="s2">you know</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.840" end="00:11:11.990" style="s2">find where the person wrote how they did</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.650" end="00:11:14.450" style="s2">they designed their their study okay so</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.990" end="00:11:17.900" style="s2">the people go through and howdy text the</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.450" end="00:11:20.570" style="s2">next part is go through and just look at</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.900" end="00:11:21.440" style="s2">how the person designed to study and say</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.570" end="00:11:25.790" style="s2">is there anything missing</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.440" end="00:11:28.790" style="s2">no is it so the these people would need</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.790" end="00:11:30.950" style="s2">some reasonable degree of expertise in</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.790" end="00:11:33.320" style="s2">experimental methodology for example</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.950" end="00:11:34.520" style="s2">right otherwise they&#39;re on I&#39;m not in a</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.320" end="00:11:36.110" style="s2">position to be able to make such an</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.520" end="00:11:38.210" style="s2">assessment right whether it was a valid</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.110" end="00:11:40.160" style="s2">methodology whether the sample size was</p>
<p begin="00:11:38.210" end="00:11:41.870" style="s2">big enough whether there were adequate</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.160" end="00:11:43.130" style="s2">controls in the experiment you know all</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.870" end="00:11:45.560" style="s2">of this kind of thing you know you need</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.130" end="00:11:47.330" style="s2">to have some understanding of how a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.560" end="00:11:50.870" style="s2">scientist likes Roman and that&#39;s it</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.330" end="00:11:52.790" style="s2">right absolutely and then to help both</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.870" end="00:11:56.570" style="s2">sort of validate that and help to</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.790" end="00:11:58.460" style="s2">counter bias among all of the things</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.570" end="00:12:01.310" style="s2">that the community would be reviewing</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.460" end="00:12:05.590" style="s2">there will be sort of tests or fake</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.310" end="00:12:05.590" style="s2">articles where it might take an existing</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.620" end="00:12:14.360" style="s2">one get through the testing system</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.670" end="00:12:15.740" style="s2">exactly like if it&#39;s you know something</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.360" end="00:12:17.870" style="s2">that you might agree or disagree with</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.740" end="00:12:18.710" style="s2">are you more strict on it if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.870" end="00:12:20.420" style="s2">know it&#39;s something that you would</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.710" end="00:12:22.550" style="s2">disagree with are you more lenient if</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.420" end="00:12:24.650" style="s2">you agree with it at the end of the day</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.550" end="00:12:26.360" style="s2">that article was created knowing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.650" end="00:12:28.490" style="s2">it&#39;s got a certain problem or that maybe</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.360" end="00:12:30.710" style="s2">it&#39;s perfect and and nobody should find</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.490" end="00:12:33.680" style="s2">a problem with it but you don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.710" end="00:12:35.990" style="s2">where your wish when you&#39;re doing it</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.680" end="00:12:38.510" style="s2">that&#39;s well probably one of the main</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.990" end="00:12:40.670" style="s2">methods to sort of help both validate</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.510" end="00:12:42.980" style="s2">people&#39;s you know you say that you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.670" end="00:12:45.260" style="s2">science and the experimental method</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.980" end="00:12:48.020" style="s2">great can you show us here and then also</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.260" end="00:12:49.720" style="s2">are you free of bias or you just doing</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.020" end="00:12:51.920" style="s2">this to try and skew things to your side</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.720" end="00:12:53.720" style="s2">yeah I mean I hear science it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:51.920" end="00:12:55.310" style="s2">supposed science is talking about things</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.720" end="00:12:56.630" style="s2">having been scientifically proven all</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.310" end="00:12:58.010" style="s2">the time right and that&#39;s straight away</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.630" end="00:12:59.450" style="s2">I don&#39;t want to listen to another word</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.010" end="00:13:00.440" style="s2">they have to say because if they can say</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.450" end="00:13:02.120" style="s2">something like that they have no idea</p>
<p begin="00:13:00.440" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">what science is all about right and so</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.120" end="00:13:07.730" style="s2">that&#39;s here a segue this lead so this</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:09.860" style="s2">feeds into the other thing I wanted to</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.730" end="00:13:12.440" style="s2">ask you about or mention anyway was your</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.860" end="00:13:14.720" style="s2">thinking was the notion about trust that</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.440" end="00:13:18.620" style="s2">people need to be able to trust the site</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.720" end="00:13:19.720" style="s2">right and so I think transparency in the</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.620" end="00:13:23.180" style="s2">ways in which</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.720" end="00:13:24.860" style="s2">information is assessed and you know put</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.180" end="00:13:26.660" style="s2">up and waited and so on I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.860" end="00:13:29.140" style="s2">transparency in this whole thing is</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.660" end="00:13:32.029" style="s2">gonna be crucial to that thing of trust</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.140" end="00:13:33.890" style="s2">absolutely I think there are some</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.029" end="00:13:37.640" style="s2">questions in the comments so I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.890" end="00:13:39.980" style="s2">gonna put it up on the screen from yogi</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.640" end="00:13:43.370" style="s2">Jonas I don&#39;t know how to pronounce</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.980" end="00:13:44.750" style="s2">their name but so that takes a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.370" end="00:13:47.209" style="s2">time to see whether some statement</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.750" end="00:13:49.670" style="s2">promise was accurate or being kept</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.209" end="00:13:52.610" style="s2">I apologize says I&#39;ll do X one can only</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.670" end="00:13:55.670" style="s2">assess whether X is good after a few</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.610" end="00:13:57.050" style="s2">years and then you&#39;re correct once a</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.670" end="00:13:58.610" style="s2">certain situation happens and there</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.050" end="00:14:02.570" style="s2">nesto has a comment as well that I&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.610" end="00:14:06.079" style="s2">wait okay so that is absolutely true</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.570" end="00:14:08.149" style="s2">the first step which we can do on on day</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.079" end="00:14:10.370" style="s2">one even during the the election is just</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.149" end="00:14:12.560" style="s2">to capture what do they actually promise</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.370" end="00:14:13.760" style="s2">because you know two years later you</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.560" end="00:14:16.880" style="s2">might hear some perspective I never</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.760" end="00:14:18.860" style="s2">promise that well we have you know ten</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.880" end="00:14:20.779" style="s2">different videos at ten different angles</p>
<p begin="00:14:18.860" end="00:14:22.339" style="s2">in a campaign rally of you promising</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.779" end="00:14:24.230" style="s2">that so it&#39;s actually collect the</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.339" end="00:14:27.320" style="s2">evidence of them making the promise in</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.230" end="00:14:30.050" style="s2">the first place then after that the goal</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.320" end="00:14:33.459" style="s2">is to track sort of what did they do to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.050" end="00:14:35.959" style="s2">try to achieve that there&#39;s multiple</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.459" end="00:14:38.149" style="s2">levels of they tried and they failed</p>
<p begin="00:14:35.959" end="00:14:40.640" style="s2">well at least you know they were kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.149" end="00:14:42.680" style="s2">they at least made an effort that there</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.640" end="00:14:45.440" style="s2">may have been things that either they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:14:42.680" end="00:14:46.730" style="s2">in it their lack of skill me I blocked</p>
<p begin="00:14:45.440" end="00:14:49.880" style="s2">them or there may have been outside</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.730" end="00:14:51.800" style="s2">factors working against them where maybe</p>
<p begin="00:14:49.880" end="00:14:53.180" style="s2">the community doesn&#39;t hold it up against</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.800" end="00:14:56.120" style="s2">them terribly and they said they</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.180" end="00:14:59.209" style="s2">actually did did try but this thing over</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.120" end="00:15:00.980" style="s2">here that they didn&#39;t control stop them</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.209" end="00:15:02.920" style="s2">that&#39;s still not perfect but it&#39;s maybe</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.980" end="00:15:05.990" style="s2">better than somebody that got like the</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.920" end="00:15:08.570" style="s2">promise and made no action towards</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.990" end="00:15:12.199" style="s2">whatsoever or even worse when the other</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.570" end="00:15:14.779" style="s2">direction so hopefully that answers your</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.199" end="00:15:16.760" style="s2">question we&#39;re a we were we distract it</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.779" end="00:15:18.230" style="s2">was said in the first place to act as</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.760" end="00:15:20.870" style="s2">evidence in case they ever go back on</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.230" end="00:15:22.399" style="s2">that and then once we actually have some</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.870" end="00:15:24.920" style="s2">information on what the outcome was</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.399" end="00:15:27.620" style="s2">start to track both their intent and</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.920" end="00:15:29.060" style="s2">then their actual action I love it</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.620" end="00:15:31.399" style="s2">because after the first election this is</p>
<p begin="00:15:29.060" end="00:15:32.630" style="s2">actually available in politicians of you</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.399" end="00:15:33.360" style="s2">like all I have to actually follow</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.630" end="00:15:36.089" style="s2">through</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.360" end="00:15:38.220" style="s2">laughter you&#39;re gonna be more stringent</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.089" end="00:15:40.290" style="s2">on what they promise because it makes</p>
<p begin="00:15:38.220" end="00:15:42.390" style="s2">more sense to promise less and deliver</p>
<p begin="00:15:40.290" end="00:15:44.370" style="s2">or than to promise everything and</p>
<p begin="00:15:42.390" end="00:15:46.649" style="s2">deliver nothing exactly this one is</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.370" end="00:15:48.660" style="s2">really easy promises to two different</p>
<p begin="00:15:46.649" end="00:15:51.269" style="s2">groups because a big part of this is in</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.660" end="00:15:52.769" style="s2">an election to be able to just say show</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.269" end="00:15:54.899" style="s2">me what every politician believes about</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.769" end="00:15:57.360" style="s2">this and then the community has gone</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.899" end="00:15:59.490" style="s2">through the content and ideally</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.360" end="00:16:00.750" style="s2">summarized okay this person believes</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.490" end="00:16:03.149" style="s2">that about health care or the</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.750" end="00:16:05.130" style="s2">environment or or whatever and to note</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.149" end="00:16:07.230" style="s2">oh this person&#39;s actually speaking at</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.130" end="00:16:09.269" style="s2">both sides of the their mouths here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.230" end="00:16:12.990" style="s2">one video they made I&#39;m Tuesday and</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.269" end="00:16:15.300" style="s2">here&#39;s a video you know they&#39;re yeah we</p>
<p begin="00:16:12.990" end="00:16:17.790" style="s2">record on Friday very different things</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.300" end="00:16:20.190" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get to our darkness toes is a</p>
<p begin="00:16:17.790" end="00:16:21.540" style="s2">suggestion but this is I think very</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.190" end="00:16:23.430" style="s2">relevant expecially in game be</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.540" end="00:16:25.579" style="s2">truthfulness versus truth truthfulness</p>
<p begin="00:16:23.430" end="00:16:27.630" style="s2">is critical to trust which is basically</p>
<p begin="00:16:25.579" end="00:16:30.870" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna butcher it if I try to explain</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.630" end="00:16:32.730" style="s2">truthfulness and Trust but it&#39;s what you</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.870" end="00:16:34.140" style="s2">do you believe what you&#39;re saying right</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.730" end="00:16:36.000" style="s2">do you believe what you&#39;re saying when</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.140" end="00:16:37.110" style="s2">you&#39;re saying it or is it not right why</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.000" end="00:16:38.370" style="s2">just because you believe what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.110" end="00:16:40.890" style="s2">saying doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:16:38.370" end="00:16:42.180" style="s2">accurate and true and so I won&#39;t say</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.890" end="00:16:44.910" style="s2">which was which because I can never keep</p>
<p begin="00:16:42.180" end="00:16:47.339" style="s2">them straight in my head to do with</p>
<p begin="00:16:44.910" end="00:16:49.019" style="s2">intent true is verifiable by some</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.339" end="00:16:51.990" style="s2">external means right that means that</p>
<p begin="00:16:49.019" end="00:16:53.970" style="s2">it&#39;s true it&#39;s factually true truthful</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.990" end="00:16:55.980" style="s2">means that you know as far as you are</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.970" end="00:16:57.240" style="s2">concerned what you are saying maps to</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.980" end="00:17:01.140" style="s2">what you believe right that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.240" end="00:17:03.779" style="s2">reference that&#39;s kind of the the lowest</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.140" end="00:17:04.319" style="s2">bar hopefully you at least believe what</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.779" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">you&#39;re saying</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.319" end="00:17:10.410" style="s2">even if it&#39;s wrong hopefully you believe</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:12.299" style="s2">it to say listen this is what I think is</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.410" end="00:17:13.890" style="s2">the case I don&#39;t know if or absolute law</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.299" end="00:17:16.650" style="s2">but this is what I think you know that</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.890" end="00:17:18.809" style="s2">is both truthful and true insofar as</p>
<p begin="00:17:16.650" end="00:17:22.919" style="s2">you&#39;re not making an absolute claim of</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.809" end="00:17:25.490" style="s2">truth right right you know for his</p>

<p begin="00:17:36.510" end="00:17:39.390" style="s2">can propagate these points through the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.919" end="00:17:42.780" style="s2">people you know and if people accumulate</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.390" end="00:17:44.280" style="s2">those ways up the tree education can</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.780" end="00:17:47.450" style="s2">work as a multiplier of those points you</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.280" end="00:17:50.250" style="s2">have in the according area</p>

<p begin="00:18:01.760" end="00:18:07.410" style="s2">but a bit more specialized like not just</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.430" end="00:18:09.570" style="s2">one group of I&#39;m gonna trust this person</p>
<p begin="00:18:07.410" end="00:18:11.310" style="s2">with everything but hey that person</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.570" end="00:18:12.960" style="s2">knows about science a lot more than I do</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.310" end="00:18:14.700" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna trust them but they don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.960" end="00:18:16.620" style="s2">anything about let&#39;s say the economy so</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.700" end="00:18:19.710" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna trust that person instead so</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.620" end="00:18:21.660" style="s2">you can split up who you want to sort of</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.710" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">handle your point and then they can pick</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.660" end="00:18:27.000" style="s2">their person that has the most until you</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:28.530" style="s2">end up with one person that you know had</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.000" end="00:18:31.200" style="s2">a chain two people trust them with let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.530" end="00:18:33.030" style="s2">say science is that I think that is what</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.200" end="00:18:34.770" style="s2">he is saying if not that&#39;s awesome and</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.030" end="00:18:36.720" style="s2">that&#39;s what we like if you&#39;re gonna have</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.770" end="00:18:42.960" style="s2">something like a truthfulness site with</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.720" end="00:18:45.590" style="s2">meritocracy of it needs to be their</p>
<p begin="00:18:42.960" end="00:18:48.300" style="s2">acute oh yeah I&#39;m just</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.590" end="00:18:51.300" style="s2">there&#39;s two things that slightly trouble</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.300" end="00:18:53.100" style="s2">me about this meritocracy I mean in</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.300" end="00:18:54.480" style="s2">principle I&#39;m all for meritocracies</p>
<p begin="00:18:53.100" end="00:18:56.940" style="s2">don&#39;t get me where I&#39;m not I don&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:18:54.480" end="00:18:58.590" style="s2">an ideological issue with it but just in</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.940" end="00:19:00.390" style="s2">a practical sense there&#39;s there&#39;s two</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.590" end="00:19:02.520" style="s2">things that bother me about it firstly</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.390" end="00:19:06.840" style="s2">and they&#39;re sort of opposite sides of</p>
<p begin="00:19:02.520" end="00:19:09.570" style="s2">the same coin firstly is there not a</p>
<p begin="00:19:06.840" end="00:19:13.170" style="s2">danger at least in the early stages that</p>
<p begin="00:19:09.570" end="00:19:16.140" style="s2">well you know well opinioned people with</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.170" end="00:19:18.600" style="s2">good sense in that particular area but</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.140" end="00:19:21.060" style="s2">with no track record necessary no formal</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.600" end="00:19:22.920" style="s2">track record that their insights will be</p>
<p begin="00:19:21.060" end="00:19:25.500" style="s2">ignored right because they they have no</p>
<p begin="00:19:22.920" end="00:19:26.430" style="s2">obvious credentials to make do you know</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.500" end="00:19:28.200" style="s2">what I mean and so they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.430" end="00:19:30.330" style="s2">they&#39;re their insights their input could</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.200" end="00:19:33.270" style="s2">could be ignored or downgraded down</p>
<p begin="00:19:30.330" end="00:19:34.860" style="s2">waited unnecessarily and on the other</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.270" end="00:19:37.230" style="s2">side of that coin just because people</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.860" end="00:19:38.310" style="s2">have a good track record doesn&#39;t mean</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.230" end="00:19:39.690" style="s2">the next thing that they&#39;re going to do</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.310" end="00:19:42.930" style="s2">is be gonna be particularly insightful</p>
<p begin="00:19:39.690" end="00:19:45.750" style="s2">or useful right so I I just see some</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.930" end="00:19:47.760" style="s2">practical dangers with with the</p>
<p begin="00:19:45.750" end="00:19:49.200" style="s2">applicator well with this would the idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.760" end="00:19:50.730" style="s2">of the system the application needs to</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.200" end="00:19:52.980" style="s2">take those into account is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.730" end="00:19:56.640" style="s2">saying yeah that&#39;s also our nestos idea</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.980" end="00:19:58.530" style="s2">I&#39;m not necessarily there a question in</p>
<p begin="00:19:56.640" end="00:20:00.909" style="s2">there so I understand that it&#39;s sort of</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.530" end="00:20:04.749" style="s2">like a variant on liquid markers</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.909" end="00:20:06.820" style="s2">but yeah well it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:20:04.749" end="00:20:09.220" style="s2">concern that I I did I that I see these</p>
<p begin="00:20:06.820" end="00:20:12.249" style="s2">as potential pitfalls of this way of</p>
<p begin="00:20:09.220" end="00:20:14.859" style="s2">promotion yeah so part of it is like</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.249" end="00:20:15.759" style="s2">this won&#39;t actually help people like</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.859" end="00:20:17.859" style="s2">it&#39;s not gonna help</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.759" end="00:20:21.179" style="s2">I guess distribute power or anything</p>
<p begin="00:20:17.859" end="00:20:36.129" style="s2">this is purely an information platform</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.179" end="00:20:39.340" style="s2">granted you were cut up there again so</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.129" end="00:20:41.169" style="s2">one of the the goals here is to not have</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.340" end="00:20:43.119" style="s2">this you can&#39;t always just say that</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.169" end="00:20:44.590" style="s2">somebody is right or wrong like</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.119" end="00:20:47.019" style="s2">especially as you start to get into</p>
<p begin="00:20:44.590" end="00:20:49.149" style="s2">science versus religion it&#39;s more like</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.019" end="00:20:51.129" style="s2">what does the the proof show up what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.149" end="00:20:53.049" style="s2">the actual sides saying and what are</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.129" end="00:20:55.179" style="s2">sort of the highest level here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.049" end="00:20:57.759" style="s2">the really disagreeing on sometimes you</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.179" end="00:21:01.960" style="s2">won&#39;t be able to ya know it&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:20:57.759" end="00:21:03.429" style="s2">useful is right it is useful value a lot</p>
<p begin="00:21:01.960" end="00:21:05.409" style="s2">of this will have to do with sort of</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.429" end="00:21:07.720" style="s2">categorizing what a certain topic is</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.409" end="00:21:09.999" style="s2">about and then individual users can say</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.720" end="00:21:12.070" style="s2">what they&#39;re interested in so like even</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.999" end="00:21:14.440" style="s2">with politicians a lot of times you you</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.070" end="00:21:16.090" style="s2">know you won&#39;t be able to say this one&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.440" end="00:21:17.919" style="s2">good and that one&#39;s bad you might be</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.090" end="00:21:20.440" style="s2">able to say with a lot of evidence this</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.919" end="00:21:24.039" style="s2">one values business this one does the</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.440" end="00:21:27.279" style="s2">environment and then you can decide what</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.039" end="00:21:29.019" style="s2">you value and react accordingly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.279" end="00:21:32.409" style="s2">gonna end up being more involved in that</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.019" end="00:21:34.440" style="s2">I&#39;m sure but the end goal being it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.409" end="00:21:37.269" style="s2">supposed to say you know that person is</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.440" end="00:21:39.340" style="s2">terrible it might say you know 38</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.269" end="00:21:42.639" style="s2">percent of the things they say are not</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.340" end="00:21:45.970" style="s2">true that&#39;s probably not good for either</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.639" end="00:21:48.279" style="s2">side but the end goal being to have some</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.970" end="00:21:50.379" style="s2">sort of categorization where the goal</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.279" end="00:21:53.320" style="s2">isn&#39;t to tell you who to vote for and</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.379" end="00:21:55.269" style="s2">what the value is to say you know here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.320" end="00:21:57.999" style="s2">what the community has said this person</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.269" end="00:22:02.499" style="s2">values and you know what they do and</p>
<p begin="00:21:57.999" end="00:22:03.940" style="s2">sort of what the evidence shows you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:02.499" end="00:22:05.979" style="s2">then sort of tell that what you value</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.940" end="00:22:08.109" style="s2">and it says oh based on those criteria</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.979" end="00:22:11.080" style="s2">other people with similar values have</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.109" end="00:22:13.809" style="s2">voted you know have voted the underlying</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.080" end="00:22:16.049" style="s2">information in this way yeah if that</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.809" end="00:22:16.049" style="s2">makes sense</p>
<p begin="00:22:17.529" end="00:22:24.279" style="s2">there&#39;s been a bunch of comments but I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.479" end="00:22:28.009" style="s2">gonna focus it back to your aspirations</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.279" end="00:22:30.799" style="s2">as to how we help him focus the</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.009" end="00:22:34.609" style="s2">explanation of what this this is to get</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.799" end="00:22:40.429" style="s2">people interested of the language maybe</p>
<p begin="00:22:34.609" end="00:22:43.609" style="s2">around it on the power and necessity of</p>
<p begin="00:22:40.429" end="00:22:47.479" style="s2">having something for a politics imbd</p>
<p begin="00:22:43.609" end="00:22:49.489" style="s2">right to be able to compare politicians</p>
<p begin="00:22:47.479" end="00:22:51.679" style="s2">to one another independent of whether</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.489" end="00:22:53.449" style="s2">you&#39;re right or left or central right</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.679" end="00:22:56.659" style="s2">like how do you trust someone and how do</p>
<p begin="00:22:53.449" end="00:23:00.109" style="s2">we see the truth in what they promised</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.659" end="00:23:02.089" style="s2">without how did yeah anyway I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.109" end="00:23:03.469" style="s2">grateful language so other people good</p>
<p begin="00:23:02.089" end="00:23:06.159" style="s2">not the other thing is the trust I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.469" end="00:23:08.749" style="s2">we have touched a lot on the trust and</p>
<p begin="00:23:06.159" end="00:23:11.779" style="s2">ideas for level of content like what can</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.749" end="00:23:13.219" style="s2">be on that page so that we we can trust</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.779" end="00:23:14.629" style="s2">it cuz I know we&#39;ve brainstormed that</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.219" end="00:23:17.479" style="s2">and talked about it but other people are</p>
<p begin="00:23:14.629" end="00:23:19.549" style="s2">gonna have different right a secure</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.479" end="00:23:22.249" style="s2">politician and I guess specifically what</p>
<p begin="00:23:19.549" end="00:23:23.899" style="s2">kind of content is needed to start going</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.249" end="00:23:25.969" style="s2">out and talking to this about people</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.899" end="00:23:27.440" style="s2">like at a mass scale right like the goal</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.969" end="00:23:31.039" style="s2">is to you know post things on Reddit and</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.440" end="00:23:32.239" style="s2">to get feedback the short term is to</p>
<p begin="00:23:31.039" end="00:23:35.179" style="s2">possibly have something like a</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.239" end="00:23:36.649" style="s2">Kickstarter or there&#39;s enough content so</p>
<p begin="00:23:35.179" end="00:23:39.009" style="s2">that people can and look at that and say</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.649" end="00:23:42.109" style="s2">yeah that&#39;s interesting I want to know I</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.009" end="00:23:44.959" style="s2">want to make sure that gets built and</p>
<p begin="00:23:42.109" end="00:23:46.429" style="s2">we&#39;re on a time crunch because there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:23:44.959" end="00:23:48.889" style="s2">big election coming up that is</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.429" end="00:23:50.299" style="s2">world-changing and it needs to I mean I</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.889" end="00:23:54.859" style="s2">don&#39;t know if it can even exist by it</p>
<p begin="00:23:50.299" end="00:23:56.569" style="s2">yeah time in follow but it can with the</p>
<p begin="00:23:54.859" end="00:23:58.759" style="s2">right people involved right if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:23:56.569" end="00:24:01.159" style="s2">gave you like if somebody if this was</p>
<p begin="00:23:58.759" end="00:24:03.139" style="s2">your full-time job if this was you know</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.159" end="00:24:05.349" style="s2">if this was something that someone could</p>
<p begin="00:24:03.139" end="00:24:09.859" style="s2">help with a video to make it go viral</p>
<p begin="00:24:05.349" end="00:24:11.929" style="s2">that would be huge like yeah and if that</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.859" end="00:24:14.659" style="s2">were like if that were an option then</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.929" end="00:24:16.759" style="s2">we&#39;d focus on making like not altogether</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.659" end="00:24:18.919" style="s2">scalable but like a specific prototype</p>
<p begin="00:24:16.759" end="00:24:20.569" style="s2">for that to say let&#39;s actually prove</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.919" end="00:24:22.399" style="s2">some of these concepts build as</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.569" end="00:24:26.329" style="s2">bare-bones as we can and just get people</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.399" end="00:24:28.380" style="s2">gathering content and and because a lot</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.329" end="00:24:30.330" style="s2">of it is just collecting though</p>
<p begin="00:24:28.380" end="00:24:32.130" style="s2">buckets of content and saying like what</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.330" end="00:24:35.130" style="s2">are each politician saying about these</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.130" end="00:24:37.470" style="s2">did these different these different</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.130" end="00:24:41.820" style="s2">topics and then displaying that in a</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.470" end="00:24:44.490" style="s2">useful way and I&#39;m not very versed on</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.820" end="00:24:46.200" style="s2">American like how the actual political</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.490" end="00:24:49.530" style="s2">system works I know much more how our</p>
<p begin="00:24:46.200" end="00:24:51.179" style="s2">Canadian one does but like I know they</p>
<p begin="00:24:49.530" end="00:24:53.220" style="s2">have you&#39;re voting for your local</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.179" end="00:24:56.780" style="s2">politician and the president I believe I</p>
<p begin="00:24:53.220" end="00:24:56.780" style="s2">believe they&#39;re two separate so you can</p>
<p begin="00:24:56.990" end="00:25:01.140" style="s2">theoretically there&#39;s going to be two</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.039" end="00:25:02.970" style="s2">people running for president and maybe a</p>
<p begin="00:25:01.140" end="00:25:05.130" style="s2">third independent how do you had like</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.970" end="00:25:07.020" style="s2">how do we focus on those two people</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.130" end="00:25:07.919" style="s2">right now we don&#39;t because there&#39;s a lot</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.020" end="00:25:10.169" style="s2">of people running for the Democratic</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.919" end="00:25:14.669" style="s2">side but once that one person&#39;s picked</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.169" end="00:25:16.470" style="s2">how do you without villainizing Trump</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.669" end="00:25:18.360" style="s2">and without you know it like which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.470" end="00:25:20.070" style="s2">more our side of the pollen political</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.360" end="00:25:21.539" style="s2">spectrum how do you get to truth right</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.070" end="00:25:23.570" style="s2">and I think a big piece of that he was</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.539" end="00:25:26.159" style="s2">having people who are Trump supporters</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.570" end="00:25:27.690" style="s2">part of that right and like already one</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.159" end="00:25:32.669" style="s2">of those people in how do you draw</p>
<p begin="00:25:27.690" end="00:25:34.799" style="s2">people in to work with people who work</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.669" end="00:25:36.000" style="s2">with the left right how do you how do</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.799" end="00:25:38.429" style="s2">you have both the right and the left</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.000" end="00:25:41.330" style="s2">work on truth together on the</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.429" end="00:25:45.179" style="s2">underlining truth seeking instead of</p>
<p begin="00:25:41.330" end="00:25:46.860" style="s2">with my views all not as like Trump has</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.179" end="00:25:48.030" style="s2">literally said this thirty seconds ago</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.860" end="00:25:49.919" style="s2">and then like you don&#39;t even need to</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.030" end="00:25:53.700" style="s2">look back very far to discount what he</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.919" end="00:25:55.409" style="s2">said he knows that I mean he does it all</p>
<p begin="00:25:53.700" end="00:25:56.820" style="s2">the time right everybody knows that he</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.409" end="00:25:57.780" style="s2">says one thing one minute ones that are</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.820" end="00:25:59.880" style="s2">different thing the next minute</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.780" end="00:26:01.590" style="s2">everybody knows own yet he&#39;s still on</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.880" end="00:26:05.250" style="s2">the election right it&#39;s not this is this</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.590" end="00:26:08.130" style="s2">is this is not news unfortunately right</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.250" end="00:26:10.140" style="s2">well I mean regardless of what you you</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.130" end="00:26:13.200" style="s2">think about Trump you ran a very good</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.140" end="00:26:14.880" style="s2">election and if you actually if that was</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.200" end="00:26:18.860" style="s2">your side they did a really good job of</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.880" end="00:26:21.600" style="s2">countering the claims against Trump like</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.860" end="00:26:23.520" style="s2">but my point is you&#39;ll say he&#39;ll say one</p>
<p begin="00:26:21.600" end="00:26:24.809" style="s2">thing about Korea for example one minute</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.520" end="00:26:26.700" style="s2">and he&#39;ll say something completely that</p>
<p begin="00:26:24.809" end="00:26:28.530" style="s2">contradicts there a couple of days later</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.700" end="00:26:30.960" style="s2">right and and nobody picks them up on it</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.530" end="00:26:32.429" style="s2">so you know part a part a big part of</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.960" end="00:26:34.140" style="s2">this needs to there needs to be some</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.429" end="00:26:36.210" style="s2">teeth at the end of it you know what I</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.140" end="00:26:41.830" style="s2">mean there needs to be a broadcast</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.210" end="00:26:45.650" style="s2">network that actually I don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.830" end="00:26:48.020" style="s2">the the Lord&#39;s those that do what they</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.650" end="00:26:49.910" style="s2">say and really shines a light on those</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.020" end="00:26:53.120" style="s2">that do not do what they say do you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:49.910" end="00:26:54.530" style="s2">does that make sense well this is our</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.120" end="00:26:56.480" style="s2">just a passive repository of information</p>
<p begin="00:26:54.530" end="00:26:59.300" style="s2">that people can access if they wish it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.480" end="00:27:00.920" style="s2">not broadcasting in any way sorry we</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.300" end="00:27:02.360" style="s2">just cut out for like 20 seconds I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.920" end="00:27:03.710" style="s2">just gonna switch my internet connection</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.360" end="00:27:06.740" style="s2">all right you search your inter</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.710" end="00:27:08.600" style="s2">connection well so and then Eric won&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:06.740" end="00:27:16.310" style="s2">have to repeat the question of</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.600" end="00:27:20.330" style="s2">broadcasting yeah and yoky also says I</p>
<p begin="00:27:16.310" end="00:27:21.860" style="s2">can put it up here the train of thought</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.330" end="00:27:23.420" style="s2">how do we get enough information about a</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.860" end="00:27:24.770" style="s2">candidate for an election that the</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.420" end="00:27:25.310" style="s2">person hasn&#39;t been in the public for</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.770" end="00:27:27.530" style="s2">long ie</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.310" end="00:27:31.070" style="s2">Trump in the last election right he has</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.530" end="00:27:34.760" style="s2">a different backgrounds right he has a</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.070" end="00:27:36.650" style="s2">business background that does have stuff</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.760" end="00:27:39.230" style="s2">in the public view of like did he follow</p>
<p begin="00:27:36.650" end="00:27:41.560" style="s2">through on contracts did he but that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:39.230" end="00:27:45.440" style="s2">not gonna be necessarily be able to be</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.560" end="00:27:47.330" style="s2">shown as easily as with the other and</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.440" end="00:27:51.530" style="s2">it&#39;s just all the way all the way to</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.330" end="00:27:56.720" style="s2">frozen broadcast for a moment back and</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.530" end="00:27:59.200" style="s2">then put it back in broken promises yeah</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.720" end="00:28:04.040" style="s2">I think also like as part of it also</p>
<p begin="00:27:59.200" end="00:28:05.510" style="s2">until he gets back is that like we will</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.040" end="00:28:06.920" style="s2">promise things and they don&#39;t it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.510" end="00:28:09.140" style="s2">oh I&#39;m gonna fix the environment because</p>
<p begin="00:28:06.920" end="00:28:12.170" style="s2">the environment is important how how are</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.140" end="00:28:14.060" style="s2">you actually gonna do it maybe you</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.170" end="00:28:17.300" style="s2">didn&#39;t because that piece was impossible</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.060" end="00:28:18.680" style="s2">but how do you actually ya figure and</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.300" end="00:28:20.530" style="s2">figure that out so I&#39;m gonna let Eric</p>
<p begin="00:28:18.680" end="00:28:24.890" style="s2">ask his question again about right okay</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.530" end="00:28:27.350" style="s2">yeah well no it was I mean I&#39;ve got so</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.890" end="00:28:30.290" style="s2">I&#39;ve got I&#39;ve still got I&#39;ve still got a</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.350" end="00:28:33.680" style="s2">bit of a problem with the information</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.290" end="00:28:38.690" style="s2">ecology in this I&#39;m not entirely clear</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.680" end="00:28:42.200" style="s2">how it&#39;s how it&#39;s how it stays clean</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.690" end="00:28:44.960" style="s2">because on the one hand you&#39;ve got</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.200" end="00:28:47.930" style="s2">people with you know who who may have</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.960" end="00:28:49.910" style="s2">useful information to put up there right</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.930" end="00:28:51.710" style="s2">which which would be which would be not</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.910" end="00:28:54.340" style="s2">only interesting but valuable for</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.710" end="00:28:56.590" style="s2">potential for electors to read and yet</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.340" end="00:28:57.880" style="s2">they don&#39;t have a track record or any</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.590" end="00:29:00.400" style="s2">particular credentials in that</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.880" end="00:29:03.279" style="s2">particular field of study their</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.400" end="00:29:04.419" style="s2">information gets wasted very lightly and</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.279" end="00:29:05.620" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t you know it doesn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.419" end="00:29:07.659" style="s2">doesn&#39;t get very high up the priority</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.620" end="00:29:09.730" style="s2">list and so it doesn&#39;t get seen on the</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.659" end="00:29:12.070" style="s2">other hand people with a track record</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.730" end="00:29:13.570" style="s2">can post information and theirs and it</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.070" end="00:29:15.880" style="s2">automatically gets weighted heavily</p>
<p begin="00:29:13.570" end="00:29:17.590" style="s2">because of their track record so I think</p>
<p begin="00:29:15.880" end="00:29:22.630" style="s2">that&#39;s open to hacking the other thing</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.590" end="00:29:23.740" style="s2">that troubles me is that there&#39;s no this</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.630" end="00:29:27.419" style="s2">is this is what I was trying to say</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.740" end="00:29:29.559" style="s2">about this is this is a passive</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.419" end="00:29:31.990" style="s2">repository of information right which</p>
<p begin="00:29:29.559" end="00:29:37.059" style="s2">people can go to and access but it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:31.990" end="00:29:38.740" style="s2">making any connections and therefore if</p>
<p begin="00:29:37.059" end="00:29:41.289" style="s2">you write judgments or broadcasts of its</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.740" end="00:29:43.570" style="s2">own right so it&#39;s not saying it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.289" end="00:29:45.669" style="s2">there&#39;s no like banner headlines yeah</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.570" end="00:29:47.020" style="s2">this politician tells the truth 98% of</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.669" end="00:29:49.390" style="s2">the time or follows up on their promises</p>
<p begin="00:29:47.020" end="00:29:54.399" style="s2">98 I&#39;m this way that&#39;s the end goal if</p>
<p begin="00:29:49.390" end="00:29:56.110" style="s2">they have that right element to it as</p>
<p begin="00:29:54.399" end="00:29:59.020" style="s2">well it&#39;s not just a passive repository</p>
<p begin="00:29:56.110" end="00:30:00.820" style="s2">there isn&#39;t so they Broadcom okay yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.020" end="00:30:03.190" style="s2">mean I more think of it as like a</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.820" end="00:30:05.590" style="s2">summarization or an aggregate where</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.190" end="00:30:08.260" style="s2">those individual pieces of content</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.590" end="00:30:10.120" style="s2">they&#39;re important but it&#39;s less about</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.260" end="00:30:12.789" style="s2">each individual thing and more about</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.120" end="00:30:15.010" style="s2">okay there&#39;s ten pieces of evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.789" end="00:30:17.169" style="s2">agree with this point they&#39;ve all been</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.010" end="00:30:19.090" style="s2">reviewed by experts and the community</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.169" end="00:30:23.230" style="s2">and everyone agrees they&#39;re good pieces</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.090" end="00:30:25.120" style="s2">of evidence they all agree on this point</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.230" end="00:30:27.630" style="s2">so that point is the main thing that</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.120" end="00:30:31.179" style="s2">gets presented and if you want you can</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.630" end="00:30:33.399" style="s2">dig deep right in a lot of sources of</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.179" end="00:30:36.010" style="s2">media that we&#39;re used to now they bring</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.399" end="00:30:38.200" style="s2">out you know an expert which could be</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.010" end="00:30:39.940" style="s2">the only person in that field that</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.200" end="00:30:42.120" style="s2">agrees with that thing or they actually</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.940" end="00:30:44.380" style="s2">could be an expert that everybody should</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.120" end="00:30:47.409" style="s2">listen to you we don&#39;t really have a</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.380" end="00:30:49.570" style="s2">good way of telling the part but they&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:30:47.409" end="00:30:52.510" style="s2">say something you know 38% of people do</p>
<p begin="00:30:49.570" end="00:30:54.070" style="s2">X and that&#39;s all they say and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.510" end="00:30:55.990" style="s2">there&#39;s some underlying study there that</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.070" end="00:30:58.720" style="s2">we as people viewing it or just supposed</p>
<p begin="00:30:55.990" end="00:31:01.440" style="s2">to believe and or if we want to go and</p>
<p begin="00:30:58.720" end="00:31:06.330" style="s2">validate it good luck with that</p>

<p begin="00:31:08.330" end="00:31:12.529" style="s2">okay&#39;s the random number that he picks</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.769" end="00:31:14.269" style="s2">is gonna just cuz I like it</p>
<p begin="00:31:12.529" end="00:31:16.879" style="s2">although I think it&#39;s more of a count up</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.269" end="00:31:18.709" style="s2">timer than a countdown timer of like I</p>
<p begin="00:31:16.879" end="00:31:20.690" style="s2">say I&#39;m gonna fix the environment to</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.709" end="00:31:22.759" style="s2">invite you by the fourth year and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:20.690" end="00:31:24.919" style="s2">like so that&#39;s my promise and then once</p>
<p begin="00:31:22.759" end="00:31:26.479" style="s2">it hits it it starts counting up like</p>
<p begin="00:31:24.919" end="00:31:29.749" style="s2">you&#39;re you know for six months behind</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.479" end="00:31:32.989" style="s2">and every time you talk on screen it</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.749" end="00:31:35.959" style="s2">showcases it&#39;s like well you made these</p>
<p begin="00:31:32.989" end="00:31:38.119" style="s2">promises where are they where is our</p>
<p begin="00:31:35.959" end="00:31:39.440" style="s2">election reform Justin Trudeau although</p>
<p begin="00:31:38.119" end="00:31:41.239" style="s2">he didn&#39;t promise at this time around so</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.440" end="00:31:44.899" style="s2">I guess that&#39;s that&#39;s for last time and</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.239" end="00:31:48.190" style="s2">they got elected again yes</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.899" end="00:31:51.109" style="s2">so yours phase and then color-coded</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.190" end="00:31:54.289" style="s2">whether they capture broken promises I</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.109" end="00:31:56.839" style="s2">think that is in that right we like we</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.289" end="00:31:59.149" style="s2">like visual red-green so one of the</p>
<p begin="00:31:56.839" end="00:32:02.749" style="s2">things I think it actually got that the</p>

<p begin="00:32:07.940" end="00:32:12.019" style="s2">campaign speech and you know for two</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.589" end="00:32:14.059" style="s2">minutes the person talks about you know</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.019" end="00:32:15.919" style="s2">the the environment whether they&#39;re you</p>
<p begin="00:32:14.059" end="00:32:17.570" style="s2">know they believe in climate change or</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.919" end="00:32:19.700" style="s2">not or however they&#39;re talking about it</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.570" end="00:32:20.809" style="s2">the goal is what they talk about during</p>
<p begin="00:32:19.700" end="00:32:24.469" style="s2">that point in time like if they quote a</p>
<p begin="00:32:20.809" end="00:32:25.820" style="s2">certain you know a certain study while</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.469" end="00:32:27.950" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about that is other</p>
<p begin="00:32:25.820" end="00:32:29.299" style="s2">timelines sort of talks about what</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.950" end="00:32:32.869" style="s2">they&#39;re talking about at that point in</p>
<p begin="00:32:29.299" end="00:32:34.999" style="s2">time so again going through that step of</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.869" end="00:32:37.339" style="s2">the first goal is the community just</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.999" end="00:32:39.709" style="s2">highlights was a claim made here or you</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.339" end="00:32:41.859" style="s2">know is this is this just a story is</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.709" end="00:32:44.329" style="s2">there something bit verifiable here</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.859" end="00:32:46.369" style="s2">right so if 52 percent of people blah</p>
<p begin="00:32:44.329" end="00:32:49.549" style="s2">blah blah okay that that&#39;s now a claim</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.369" end="00:32:51.139" style="s2">like that and then it goes to the next</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.549" end="00:32:54.679" style="s2">step or it says okay so what study did</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.139" end="00:32:56.749" style="s2">it does that come from - you did to the</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.679" end="00:32:59.570" style="s2">ground it might be nobody can find the</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.749" end="00:33:01.219" style="s2">study okay that&#39;s worth knowing as far</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.570" end="00:33:03.919" style="s2">as what we know this doesn&#39;t have any</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.219" end="00:33:06.499" style="s2">actual textual basis we talk to to that</p>
<p begin="00:33:03.919" end="00:33:08.269" style="s2">campaign theaters drown nobody knows 52</p>
<p begin="00:33:06.499" end="00:33:10.309" style="s2">percent that didn&#39;t come from anywhere</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.269" end="00:33:12.499" style="s2">or it does come from somewhere great</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.309" end="00:33:15.979" style="s2">let&#39;s point to walk to where that is is</p>
<p begin="00:33:12.499" end="00:33:18.200" style="s2">that study good right did did it</p>
<p begin="00:33:15.979" end="00:33:21.600" style="s2">actually pass what was a properly</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.200" end="00:33:24.630" style="s2">designed study and so on</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.600" end="00:33:27.240" style="s2">has it since been discredited for</p>
<p begin="00:33:24.630" end="00:33:29.700" style="s2">whatever reason if it is good great did</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.240" end="00:33:32.040" style="s2">they cite it properly right is it like</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.700" end="00:33:35.310" style="s2">yeah the number 52 is in there but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:33:32.040" end="00:33:37.560" style="s2">three layers down and it&#39;s you know not</p>
<p begin="00:33:35.310" end="00:33:41.550" style="s2">used accurately in that context so it</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.560" end="00:33:43.320" style="s2">lets people tell this story of I guess</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.550" end="00:33:45.270" style="s2">that&#39;s probably like the truth for the</p>
<p begin="00:33:43.320" end="00:33:47.370" style="s2">true versus truthfulness thing where</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.270" end="00:33:50.340" style="s2">it&#39;s did they think it&#39;s true and then</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.370" end="00:33:51.860" style="s2">does the community both the the wiki</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.340" end="00:33:54.960" style="s2">legend community and the expert</p>
<p begin="00:33:51.860" end="00:33:57.600" style="s2">community do they agree like yeah that</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.960" end="00:33:59.040" style="s2">that that&#39;s true or at the very least</p>
<p begin="00:33:57.600" end="00:34:01.350" style="s2">this person seems to think it&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.040" end="00:34:03.000" style="s2">because they keep saying it and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:01.350" end="00:34:04.980" style="s2">true and then that&#39;s available across</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.000" end="00:34:06.810" style="s2">all of their videos and you can start to</p>
<p begin="00:34:04.980" end="00:34:09.630" style="s2">see what sort of claims did they make</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.810" end="00:34:11.970" style="s2">and you can start to get that number of</p>
<p begin="00:34:09.630" end="00:34:15.240" style="s2">okay of all the claims that we have on</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.970" end="00:34:18.480" style="s2">file for this person 22% of them end up</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.240" end="00:34:20.850" style="s2">not being true or not being verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:34:18.480" end="00:34:25.050" style="s2">that kind of thing I think you already</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.850" end="00:34:26.610" style="s2">talked about if you already talked about</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.050" end="00:34:28.200" style="s2">it if you&#39;ve already answered it if</p>
<p begin="00:34:26.610" end="00:34:30.480" style="s2">people can go back and watch it for the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.200" end="00:34:32.250" style="s2">beginning buddy did you who validates</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.480" end="00:34:37.530" style="s2">users contributions right we already</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.250" end="00:34:40.440" style="s2">talked about this one right right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:37.530" end="00:34:42.000" style="s2">and with a lot of this I mean I by no</p>
<p begin="00:34:40.440" end="00:34:43.620" style="s2">means things that I&#39;ve got this idea</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.000" end="00:34:46.080" style="s2">that could take on all of the very</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.620" end="00:34:49.140" style="s2">complex misinformation systems out there</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.080" end="00:34:51.510" style="s2">one of the key parts is that system of</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.140" end="00:34:53.400" style="s2">kind of intentionally fake news and</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.510" end="00:34:57.270" style="s2">faked like big scientific articles</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.400" end="00:35:02.700" style="s2">geared to be you know true or not true</p>
<p begin="00:34:57.270" end="00:35:05.310" style="s2">or or meet certain crook or criteria but</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.700" end="00:35:07.290" style="s2">there will end up being multiple layers</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.310" end="00:35:09.870" style="s2">of that and will end up a particular</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.290" end="00:35:11.490" style="s2">houses new ideas I&#39;m not so sure what</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.870" end="00:35:13.440" style="s2">you know how to use cryptocurrency for</p>
<p begin="00:35:11.490" end="00:35:15.870" style="s2">it but that&#39;s also like part of it is I</p>
<p begin="00:35:13.440" end="00:35:17.100" style="s2">know your projects more very different</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.870" end="00:35:18.960" style="s2">than mine as far as how it&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.100" end="00:35:21.510" style="s2">implemented but having stuff that is</p>
<p begin="00:35:18.960" end="00:35:24.150" style="s2">more transparent and more community</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.510" end="00:35:25.890" style="s2">driven is people can can already have</p>
<p begin="00:35:24.150" end="00:35:27.570" style="s2">trust in that system as they create it</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.890" end="00:35:29.070" style="s2">together to say cuz I know you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.570" end="00:35:31.260" style="s2">know cryptic weren&#39;t like crypto stuff</p>
<p begin="00:35:29.070" end="00:35:33.859" style="s2">enough to implement that right now but</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.260" end="00:35:36.529" style="s2">other people do right and other people</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.859" end="00:35:39.619" style="s2">bring that table and create that within</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.529" end="00:35:42.680" style="s2">it yeah and if there ends up being like</p>
<p begin="00:35:39.619" end="00:35:45.440" style="s2">a really key thing and that gives the</p>
<p begin="00:35:42.680" end="00:35:47.089" style="s2">project I would absolutely want oh I</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.440" end="00:35:49.099" style="s2">mean I think they&#39;re absolutely possible</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.089" end="00:35:50.509" style="s2">because blockchain or whether it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.099" end="00:35:52.150" style="s2">blockchain or hash graph or whatever but</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.509" end="00:35:54.319" style="s2">Kryptos is all about peer-to-peer</p>
<p begin="00:35:52.150" end="00:35:56.390" style="s2">verification and consensus reaching</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.319" end="00:35:57.980" style="s2">right so and that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:35:56.390" end="00:35:59.630" style="s2">attempting to do is it&#39;s create a peer</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.980" end="00:36:01.249" style="s2">to be community that reaches a consensus</p>
<p begin="00:35:59.630" end="00:36:02.869" style="s2">on information so you know they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:36:01.249" end="00:36:04.789" style="s2">reaching a consensus on transactions</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.869" end="00:36:07.400" style="s2">completed you&#39;re reaching a consensus on</p>
<p begin="00:36:04.789" end="00:36:09.920" style="s2">valid validity of information or quality</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.400" end="00:36:11.329" style="s2">of information so yeah I absolutely so I</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.920" end="00:36:15.470" style="s2">mean I don&#39;t really understand how it</p>
<p begin="00:36:11.329" end="00:36:18.289" style="s2">works I have some understanding but yeah</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.470" end="00:36:22.099" style="s2">I have a very small nod and to any</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.289" end="00:36:25.400" style="s2">extent where because as I&#39;m sure like on</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.099" end="00:36:26.869" style="s2">the trust and truthfulness side there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.400" end="00:36:28.759" style="s2">gonna be a lot of sort of security</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.869" end="00:36:30.349" style="s2">concerns with a project like this but</p>
<p begin="00:36:28.759" end="00:36:32.660" style="s2">whether just directly you know people</p>
<p begin="00:36:30.349" end="00:36:34.849" style="s2">trying to hack it or if it actually</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.660" end="00:36:37.039" style="s2">starts to gain steam groups whose goal</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.849" end="00:36:40.690" style="s2">is to put things that aren&#39;t true in</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.039" end="00:36:43.009" style="s2">there to skew things in in their favor</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.690" end="00:36:44.900" style="s2">and so it&#39;s going to be that balance of</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.009" end="00:36:47.150" style="s2">having it&#39;s sort of designed to avoid</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.900" end="00:36:49.819" style="s2">that and being as secure as possible but</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.150" end="00:36:52.910" style="s2">then also anything that makes it sort of</p>
<p begin="00:36:49.819" end="00:36:55.880" style="s2">transparent and trustworthy because</p>
<p begin="00:36:52.910" end="00:36:57.499" style="s2">those aren&#39;t always the trustworthy is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:55.880" end="00:36:59.210" style="s2">global you know that has to be across</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.499" end="00:37:02.869" style="s2">the whole thing but there&#39;s sort of that</p>
<p begin="00:36:59.210" end="00:37:05.299" style="s2">balance of security and transparency</p>
<p begin="00:37:02.869" end="00:37:07.249" style="s2">it&#39;s really enough of it isn&#39;t it that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.299" end="00:37:11.509" style="s2">really it really is the nub of the whole</p>
<p begin="00:37:07.249" end="00:37:14.210" style="s2">thing is is the trust in the information</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.509" end="00:37:16.369" style="s2">which is on there by the users therefore</p>
<p begin="00:37:14.210" end="00:37:18.829" style="s2">the process by which the information is</p>
<p begin="00:37:16.369" end="00:37:22.130" style="s2">arrived that has to be transparent and</p>
<p begin="00:37:18.829" end="00:37:23.599" style="s2">and secure and hack free because you</p>
<p begin="00:37:22.130" end="00:37:25.220" style="s2">know while there is so much power in</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.599" end="00:37:26.779" style="s2">politics and so much money sloshing</p>
<p begin="00:37:25.220" end="00:37:28.640" style="s2">around in politics the incentives for</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.779" end="00:37:31.039" style="s2">people to figure out a way to hack a</p>
<p begin="00:37:28.640" end="00:37:33.079" style="s2">system such as this are very very strong</p>
<p begin="00:37:31.039" end="00:37:34.759" style="s2">and so it needs to be pretty much proof</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.079" end="00:37:37.460" style="s2">yeah yeah yeah exactly</p>
<p begin="00:37:34.759" end="00:37:39.230" style="s2">also having one one deposit of</p>
<p begin="00:37:37.460" end="00:37:42.559" style="s2">information for things like political</p>
<p begin="00:37:39.230" end="00:37:44.869" style="s2">videos for so that they can&#39;t be deep</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.559" end="00:37:46.339" style="s2">fakes like how snoops I think is one of</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.869" end="00:37:47.330" style="s2">the ones that people go to and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.339" end="00:37:49.490" style="s2">what is this thing real</p>
<p begin="00:37:47.330" end="00:37:50.870" style="s2">not real happy in one place for it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.490" end="00:37:53.060" style="s2">like no matter where it is on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.870" end="00:37:54.590" style="s2">someone else can post it to this if you</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.060" end="00:37:56.420" style="s2">like all that&#39;s been proven fake or like</p>
<p begin="00:37:54.590" end="00:37:59.330" style="s2">yeah that was a given by the election</p>
<p begin="00:37:56.420" end="00:38:01.100" style="s2">campaign to us as like the primary video</p>
<p begin="00:37:59.330" end="00:38:04.160" style="s2">when it was recorded they can&#39;t go back</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.100" end="00:38:05.630" style="s2">and say yeah and so having those and</p>
<p begin="00:38:04.160" end="00:38:07.820" style="s2">then having other people in the video in</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.630" end="00:38:10.100" style="s2">the audience with cameras showcasing</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.820" end="00:38:12.920" style="s2">with a tank GPS like you around there</p>
<p begin="00:38:10.100" end="00:38:14.470" style="s2">it&#39;s clearly clearly real and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.920" end="00:38:17.120" style="s2">all doing it right from different a</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.470" end="00:38:18.680" style="s2">little bit harder yes there&#39;s that part</p>

<p begin="00:38:18.680" end="00:38:22.520" style="s2">fake we have 12 two different camera</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.570" end="00:38:25.400" style="s2">angles from different people like no</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.520" end="00:38:27.050" style="s2">it&#39;s that one is 100% real and there</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.400" end="00:38:28.550" style="s2">there might be some videos now that we</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.050" end="00:38:32.660" style="s2">all think are true that end up being</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.550" end="00:38:34.130" style="s2">deep fakes so part of it is and this</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.660" end="00:38:36.650" style="s2">will end up being a part of it for each</p>
<p begin="00:38:34.130" end="00:38:40.220" style="s2">kind of evidence the end goal is to be</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.650" end="00:38:42.050" style="s2">sort of world-class in verifying that</p>
<p begin="00:38:40.220" end="00:38:43.670" style="s2">kind of evidence so one of it is there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.050" end="00:38:47.090" style="s2">gonna have to be some systems in place</p>
<p begin="00:38:43.670" end="00:38:49.160" style="s2">to spot deep fakes then also to spot if</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.090" end="00:38:51.170" style="s2">there&#39;s let&#39;s say a video on Facebook</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.160" end="00:38:53.600" style="s2">and at this point I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.170" end="00:38:54.560" style="s2">Facebook is likely to play ball so this</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.600" end="00:38:56.120" style="s2">would probably end up being like a</p>
<p begin="00:38:54.560" end="00:38:57.560" style="s2">browser extension that sees the video</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.120" end="00:39:00.500" style="s2">you&#39;re playing an ad sort of its own</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.560" end="00:39:02.480" style="s2">overlay where it says hey we know that</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.500" end="00:39:04.040" style="s2">video here&#39;s what the community has said</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.480" end="00:39:07.550" style="s2">about that video and you can even do the</p>
<p begin="00:39:04.040" end="00:39:09.140" style="s2">the same timeline of oh here&#39;s a spot in</p>

<p begin="00:39:09.140" end="00:39:13.010" style="s2">here&#39;s what we&#39;ve learned about that</p>

<p begin="00:39:23.570" end="00:39:30.230" style="s2">deep fake so for it to be able to say</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.870" end="00:39:36.800" style="s2">that on all the videos that it has that</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.230" end="00:39:38.990" style="s2">kind of information about alright there</p>
<p begin="00:39:36.800" end="00:39:42.830" style="s2">was something that was said earlier that</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.990" end="00:39:44.810" style="s2">I think is important i but i don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.830" end="00:39:47.090" style="s2">if it&#39;s gonna really it kind of goes to</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.810" end="00:39:49.490" style="s2">left versus right trouble truth is most</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.090" end="00:39:51.790" style="s2">important intense authoring leads to our</p>

<p begin="00:40:41.150" end="00:40:45.020" style="s2">gonna do all this if I mentally great</p>

<p begin="00:40:45.020" end="00:40:47.780" style="s2">actually seem love something that could</p>
<p begin="00:40:46.490" end="00:40:49.910" style="s2">theoretically do it if they applied</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.780" end="00:40:52.760" style="s2">themselves and then to does their track</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.910" end="00:40:54.560" style="s2">record show they would they&#39;re people</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.760" end="00:40:55.640" style="s2">who were well-connected and intelligent</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.560" end="00:40:56.690" style="s2">enough to solve this kind of problem is</p>
<p begin="00:40:55.640" end="00:40:59.450" style="s2">but you&#39;re like there&#39;s no way they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.690" end="00:41:01.849" style="s2">going to or I think there will</p>
<p begin="00:40:59.450" end="00:41:03.740" style="s2">intentioned I don&#39;t think that they like</p>
<p begin="00:41:01.849" end="00:41:07.609" style="s2">vid they&#39;ll try and they&#39;ll probably</p>
<p begin="00:41:03.740" end="00:41:08.930" style="s2">fail right if the community feels that</p>
<p begin="00:41:07.609" end="00:41:10.819" style="s2">that&#39;s important to know</p>
<p begin="00:41:08.930" end="00:41:12.380" style="s2">okay I feel like there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.819" end="00:41:14.690" style="s2">missing from your statement in the</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.380" end="00:41:16.310" style="s2">middle because there was this who would</p>
<p begin="00:41:14.690" end="00:41:18.560" style="s2">validate user contribution so we talked</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.310" end="00:41:20.900" style="s2">about and your next one is if Adriel</p>
<p begin="00:41:18.560" end="00:41:21.829" style="s2">knows that site I just found it I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.900" end="00:41:24.319" style="s2">know which one you&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.829" end="00:41:26.380" style="s2">this is evoke so yeah post it and</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.319" end="00:41:29.180" style="s2">hopeful I can always send him the link</p>
<p begin="00:41:26.380" end="00:41:29.900" style="s2">from here after whatever but I just</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.180" end="00:41:33.380" style="s2">don&#39;t know what&#39;s that you&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.900" end="00:41:34.609" style="s2">about in reference to that but any sites</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.380" end="00:41:37.069" style="s2">that already exists that are about</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.609" end="00:41:47.060" style="s2">verifying information would be very</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.069" end="00:41:48.920" style="s2">useful yep and that video only has the</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.060" end="00:41:52.180" style="s2">deep into the are yours video will be</p>
<p begin="00:41:48.920" end="00:41:55.750" style="s2">almost like paper photographs today</p>
<p begin="00:41:52.180" end="00:42:01.730" style="s2">video right it&#39;s just a very nice video</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.750" end="00:42:04.339" style="s2">is it can you deep fake VR in its like</p>
<p begin="00:42:01.730" end="00:42:06.079" style="s2">the other just two different videos one</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.339" end="00:42:08.210" style="s2">for each eye that&#39;s basically and then</p>
<p begin="00:42:06.079" end="00:42:09.980" style="s2">made from a certain camera angle to</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.210" end="00:42:11.780" style="s2">support a being like you looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.980" end="00:42:14.440" style="s2">so in theory it might be a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:42:11.780" end="00:42:16.970" style="s2">harder but still totally do</p>
<p begin="00:42:14.440" end="00:42:20.660" style="s2">deep pickable I would think uh I do</p>
<p begin="00:42:16.970" end="00:42:22.970" style="s2">think our minds will be more easily able</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.660" end="00:42:24.230" style="s2">to accept VR versus the other one</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.970" end="00:42:25.910" style="s2">because you feel like you were actually</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.230" end="00:42:29.660" style="s2">there right you&#39;re like no I saw the</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.910" end="00:42:35.930" style="s2">speech it was like I was there no I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:42:29.660" end="00:42:37.520" style="s2">still better video tools now the</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.930" end="00:42:40.100" style="s2">politics is going in VR whoever said</p>
<p begin="00:42:37.520" end="00:42:42.170" style="s2">really released and I don&#39;t know if it</p>
<p begin="00:42:40.100" end="00:42:43.880" style="s2">is because you do you have to ME baby</p>
<p begin="00:42:42.170" end="00:42:45.830" style="s2">because maybe we get to the point where</p>
<p begin="00:42:43.880" end="00:42:47.300" style="s2">you don&#39;t need special equipment to do</p>
<p begin="00:42:45.830" end="00:42:49.730" style="s2">VR but as soon as soon as you need</p>
<p begin="00:42:47.300" end="00:42:51.410" style="s2">special equipment to do something it has</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.730" end="00:42:53.600" style="s2">to reach the population it has to be</p>
<p begin="00:42:51.410" end="00:42:56.900" style="s2">like 80% of people have it right in</p>
<p begin="00:42:53.600" end="00:42:59.510" style="s2">order for not to be the the the tool</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.900" end="00:43:01.580" style="s2">like even we do have the our televisions</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.510" end="00:43:04.610" style="s2">right or like 3d televisions not VR and</p>
<p begin="00:43:01.580" end="00:43:07.280" style="s2">they didn&#39;t really gain that much</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.610" end="00:43:11.260" style="s2">traction like 3d and movies even more</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.280" end="00:43:14.780" style="s2">like and you know like it&#39;s not as cool</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.260" end="00:43:16.400" style="s2">it&#39;s just a gimmick believe it if that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:43:14.780" end="00:43:18.170" style="s2">true that it that it does go over your I</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.400" end="00:43:20.030" style="s2">don&#39;t see as we&#39;ve just said I don&#39;t see</p>
<p begin="00:43:18.170" end="00:43:24.500" style="s2">BR being fundamentally different video</p>
<p begin="00:43:20.030" end="00:43:26.000" style="s2">exactly there would be some challenges I</p>
<p begin="00:43:24.500" end="00:43:27.380" style="s2">guess like with the interface cuz you</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.000" end="00:43:28.730" style="s2">would probably have to screw with the VR</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.380" end="00:43:30.740" style="s2">and make it kind of ugly or you might</p>
<p begin="00:43:28.730" end="00:43:32.120" style="s2">like have a different kind of overlay</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.740" end="00:43:33.920" style="s2">then the guys the person is talking you</p>
<p begin="00:43:32.120" end="00:43:35.570" style="s2">have some weird like Minority Report</p>
<p begin="00:43:33.920" end="00:43:37.310" style="s2">style like a box and then a bubble</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.570" end="00:43:38.780" style="s2">coming up there with the stats you have</p>
<p begin="00:43:37.310" end="00:43:41.660" style="s2">to figure out how to make it look decent</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.780" end="00:43:42.860" style="s2">so they wouldn&#39;t turn people off but at</p>
<p begin="00:43:41.660" end="00:43:45.260" style="s2">the end of the day it&#39;s just another</p>
<p begin="00:43:42.860" end="00:43:46.700" style="s2">kind of content you&#39;re focusing on VR</p>
<p begin="00:43:45.260" end="00:43:49.310" style="s2">instead a video which I think we are</p>
<p begin="00:43:46.700" end="00:43:51.140" style="s2">like including it but then also that</p>
<p begin="00:43:49.310" end="00:43:53.240" style="s2">real title be the only authentication</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.140" end="00:43:55.430" style="s2">method people will trust I&#39;m not so sure</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.240" end="00:43:58.250" style="s2">that would even maybe be true because if</p>
<p begin="00:43:55.430" end="00:44:00.320" style="s2">your VR is a live stream the same like</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.250" end="00:44:03.560" style="s2">being there if they can be deep like a</p>
<p begin="00:44:00.320" end="00:44:04.940" style="s2">live stream VR is like oh look I&#39;m in</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.560" end="00:44:09.310" style="s2">Paris I know I&#39;m not actually in Paris</p>
<p begin="00:44:04.940" end="00:44:11.390" style="s2">so how does that become a verifiable</p>
<p begin="00:44:09.310" end="00:44:13.520" style="s2">definite I think there might be some</p>
<p begin="00:44:11.390" end="00:44:14.480" style="s2">like as air can to like people might be</p>
<p begin="00:44:13.520" end="00:44:16.190" style="s2">more inclined to believe that because</p>
<p begin="00:44:14.480" end="00:44:17.780" style="s2">they put on it like I I think I&#39;m there</p>
<p begin="00:44:16.190" end="00:44:19.640" style="s2">but really it&#39;s just filming it with two</p>
<p begin="00:44:17.780" end="00:44:21.920" style="s2">cameras instead of one and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:44:19.640" end="00:44:24.860" style="s2">streaming it a slightly different way at</p>
<p begin="00:44:21.920" end="00:44:26.630" style="s2">the end the whole goal of this is to be</p>
<p begin="00:44:24.860" end="00:44:27.690" style="s2">able to do whatever people need to do to</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.630" end="00:44:30.300" style="s2">be able to trust information</p>
<p begin="00:44:27.690" end="00:44:32.940" style="s2">yep build something from the ground up</p>
<p begin="00:44:30.300" end="00:44:34.369" style="s2">the specializes in VR once we are dis</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.940" end="00:44:37.349" style="s2">popular or not we&#39;d absolutely do that</p>
<p begin="00:44:34.369" end="00:44:40.770" style="s2">that&#39;s the end goal for all this this is</p>
<p begin="00:44:37.349" end="00:44:43.079" style="s2">just like the the tactics to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.770" end="00:44:44.579" style="s2">get to the endpoint of can a person</p>
<p begin="00:44:43.079" end="00:44:47.569" style="s2">trustus do they have enough information</p>
<p begin="00:44:44.579" end="00:44:50.670" style="s2">have they seen a track record of the</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.569" end="00:44:53.010" style="s2">site not showing biased and saying like</p>
<p begin="00:44:50.670" end="00:44:55.410" style="s2">it&#39;s agree with me it&#39;s disagree with me</p>
<p begin="00:44:53.010" end="00:44:56.730" style="s2">it&#39;s you know torn down people did like</p>
<p begin="00:44:55.410" end="00:44:58.200" style="s2">but it&#39;s also turned on people that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:56.730" end="00:45:01.589" style="s2">don&#39;t like so there&#39;s some amount of</p>
<p begin="00:44:58.200" end="00:45:04.290" style="s2">okay it does seem fair having all of</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.589" end="00:45:06.150" style="s2">that enough to be able to support that</p>
<p begin="00:45:04.290" end="00:45:10.349" style="s2">concept of as many people as possible</p>
<p begin="00:45:06.150" end="00:45:11.910" style="s2">see it and say I trust that it says like</p>
<p begin="00:45:10.349" end="00:45:14.430" style="s2">enough people have reviewed it I can dig</p>
<p begin="00:45:11.910" end="00:45:16.910" style="s2">as deep as I want into the evidence that</p>
<p begin="00:45:14.430" end="00:45:22.050" style="s2">people use to say it was true or not</p>
<p begin="00:45:16.910" end="00:45:23.940" style="s2">there&#39;s no hiding anything yeah you</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.050" end="00:45:25.319" style="s2">paraphrase a certain stream of data is</p>
<p begin="00:45:23.940" end="00:45:27.450" style="s2">being created in real-time using a</p>
<p begin="00:45:25.319" end="00:45:29.010" style="s2">crypto like method yeah that will be</p>
<p begin="00:45:27.450" end="00:45:31.020" style="s2">powerful and that&#39;s where I think having</p>
<p begin="00:45:29.010" end="00:45:32.670" style="s2">the base of people that are the ones who</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.020" end="00:45:35.640" style="s2">are supposed to trust it I eat all of us</p>
<p begin="00:45:32.670" end="00:45:39.180" style="s2">are is important to have that be part of</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.640" end="00:45:41.069" style="s2">the system to create it to say hey how</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.180" end="00:45:42.690" style="s2">do I trust this right like if you create</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.069" end="00:45:43.890" style="s2">something that&#39;s absolutely amazing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:42.690" end="00:45:47.250" style="s2">all this information out there people</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.890" end="00:45:49.859" style="s2">don&#39;t trust it it&#39;s not useful and and</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.250" end="00:45:51.540" style="s2">part of it is like you it would cost so</p>
<p begin="00:45:49.859" end="00:45:53.280" style="s2">much money to do this all yourself right</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.540" end="00:45:56.220" style="s2">to put all the information in for one</p>
<p begin="00:45:53.280" end="00:45:58.319" style="s2">person or to pay people to put it in is</p>
<p begin="00:45:56.220" end="00:46:00.690" style="s2">an astronomical cost especially moving</p>
<p begin="00:45:58.319" end="00:46:02.880" style="s2">forward because this is work people will</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.690" end="00:46:04.829" style="s2">and want to do for free because they</p>
<p begin="00:46:02.880" end="00:46:06.359" style="s2">want access to the information and</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.829" end="00:46:10.680" style="s2">because they want to be able to be part</p>
<p begin="00:46:06.359" end="00:46:12.060" style="s2">of that trust economy they you know what</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.680" end="00:46:13.560" style="s2">I mean that being part of that but then</p>
<p begin="00:46:12.060" end="00:46:18.150" style="s2">there will also be people in there that</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.560" end="00:46:20.700" style="s2">are there any way you can avoid bias</p>
<p begin="00:46:18.150" end="00:46:23.190" style="s2">right is to have it distributed I mean</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.700" end="00:46:24.690" style="s2">however well-intentioned one person or</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.190" end="00:46:27.270" style="s2">one group of people is I mean however</p>
<p begin="00:46:24.690" end="00:46:28.890" style="s2">genuine their hearts are they will have</p>
<p begin="00:46:27.270" end="00:46:31.310" style="s2">biases right and the information that</p>
<p begin="00:46:28.890" end="00:46:35.869" style="s2">they gather in the way in which it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:46:31.310" end="00:46:38.119" style="s2">real might have biases of cost</p>
<p begin="00:46:35.869" end="00:46:39.859" style="s2">the person I don&#39;t want any person who</p>
<p begin="00:46:38.119" end="00:46:40.249" style="s2">is urgent to say that&#39;s true that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.859" end="00:46:46.970" style="s2">true</p>
<p begin="00:46:40.249" end="00:46:48.710" style="s2">absolutely I want to be able to speak up</p>
<p begin="00:46:46.970" end="00:46:52.460" style="s2">for me and my discernment but not to be</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.710" end="00:46:54.079" style="s2">propagated everywhere else like Oh like</p>
<p begin="00:46:52.460" end="00:46:55.579" style="s2">talking about it has to be video or VR</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.079" end="00:46:56.749" style="s2">the whole point is to have as much</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.579" end="00:46:59.749" style="s2">content as possible</p>
<p begin="00:46:56.749" end="00:47:02.599" style="s2">so it&#39;s you can still fake VR you can</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.749" end="00:47:04.279" style="s2">still fake like you can&#39;t fake once it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:02.599" end="00:47:05.569" style="s2">been added to blockchain my</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.279" end="00:47:08.029" style="s2">understanding is that sort of a winna</p>
<p begin="00:47:05.569" end="00:47:10.190" style="s2">gets secured but if the source that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.029" end="00:47:12.230" style="s2">feeding it in was like you know some</p>
<p begin="00:47:10.190" end="00:47:13.339" style="s2">sort of an advanced live deep thing yeah</p>
<p begin="00:47:12.230" end="00:47:16.549" style="s2">that&#39;s alright needs to be verified</p>
<p begin="00:47:13.339" end="00:47:18.680" style="s2">before it goes into the block drafts if</p>
<p begin="00:47:16.549" end="00:47:21.349" style="s2">the like one of the end goals is to have</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.680" end="00:47:22.609" style="s2">an app where the community knows one of</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.349" end="00:47:25.519" style="s2">the things that we wanted as many</p>
<p begin="00:47:22.609" end="00:47:28.789" style="s2">different sources of content as possible</p>
<p begin="00:47:25.519" end="00:47:31.640" style="s2">so at the end of the day what I want to</p>
<p begin="00:47:28.789" end="00:47:33.700" style="s2">see is if you see any you know campaign</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.640" end="00:47:35.900" style="s2">rally there&#39;s 30 people in the audience</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.700" end="00:47:38.119" style="s2">holding up a phone not that different</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.900" end="00:47:40.130" style="s2">from right now but the difference is a</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.119" end="00:47:41.569" style="s2">bunch of them are using some app that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:40.130" end="00:47:43.220" style="s2">feeding into the same source saying</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.569" end="00:47:46.039" style="s2">here&#39;s the same thing happening at the</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.220" end="00:47:46.460" style="s2">same time from 73 different camera</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.039" end="00:47:50.119" style="s2">angles</p>
<p begin="00:47:46.460" end="00:47:51.710" style="s2">good luck saying that&#39;s fake yeah maybe</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.119" end="00:47:53.960" style="s2">of two of them people are being sketchy</p>
<p begin="00:47:51.710" end="00:47:55.309" style="s2">and faking it okay we&#39;ve got two camera</p>
<p begin="00:47:53.960" end="00:47:56.989" style="s2">angles where we can you know use</p>
<p begin="00:47:55.309" end="00:47:59.839" style="s2">technology to spot how they&#39;re fake but</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.989" end="00:48:01.430" style="s2">also here&#39;s this massive amount of</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.839" end="00:48:03.319" style="s2">contents and every camera angle the</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.430" end="00:48:05.390" style="s2">audio all lines up perfectly every</p>
<p begin="00:48:03.319" end="00:48:07.369" style="s2">different angle agrees with each other</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.390" end="00:48:09.559" style="s2">experts have reviewed it and say yep</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.369" end="00:48:10.759" style="s2">this all says it&#39;s the same thing that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:48:09.559" end="00:48:14.480" style="s2">what that would look like from that</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.759" end="00:48:17.180" style="s2">camera angle that&#39;s why and I think this</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.480" end="00:48:18.410" style="s2">goes to also just what TRICARE is saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:17.180" end="00:48:19.819" style="s2">there will be another group of people</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.410" end="00:48:22.160" style="s2">who will hone in and focus on those</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.819" end="00:48:23.900" style="s2">biases that there will it like you need</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.160" end="00:48:25.549" style="s2">that you need people of different prices</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.900" end="00:48:28.369" style="s2">for to know Charles Vyse sake different</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.549" end="00:48:30.319" style="s2">Hamelin camera angle right they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.369" end="00:48:33.109" style="s2">people who do a lot of the work because</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.319" end="00:48:34.700" style="s2">they they care about a certain thing so</p>
<p begin="00:48:33.109" end="00:48:37.190" style="s2">if you really care about the environment</p>
<p begin="00:48:34.700" end="00:48:38.630" style="s2">and that&#39;s where your bias lies great go</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.190" end="00:48:40.630" style="s2">ahead and add as much of the media</p>
<p begin="00:48:38.630" end="00:48:42.710" style="s2">content you want it&#39;s still going to</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.630" end="00:48:44.359" style="s2">filter through the same systems and</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.710" end="00:48:47.660" style="s2">hopefully filter as much of your bias</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.359" end="00:48:49.520" style="s2">off as possible but most people who are</p>
<p begin="00:48:47.660" end="00:48:51.980" style="s2">like the really sort of neutral and</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.520" end="00:48:53.360" style="s2">looking at it from both sides they</p>
<p begin="00:48:51.980" end="00:48:54.650" style="s2">aren&#39;t gonna be that interested in</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.360" end="00:48:56.510" style="s2">solving it like I&#39;m gonna do all this</p>
<p begin="00:48:54.650" end="00:48:58.880" style="s2">work to maybe find out which side is</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.510" end="00:49:01.040" style="s2">true even though I&#39;m not terribly</p>
<p begin="00:48:58.880" end="00:49:04.160" style="s2">concerned I think they&#39;ll sort of be</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.040" end="00:49:05.780" style="s2">some of the filters but the people who</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.160" end="00:49:12.710" style="s2">really submit the content and do a lot</p>
<p begin="00:49:05.780" end="00:49:14.090" style="s2">of the work will be devised people you</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.710" end="00:49:15.890" style="s2">know I just rewind a little bit you guys</p>
<p begin="00:49:14.090" end="00:49:18.050" style="s2">were talking earlier maybe 20 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.890" end="00:49:19.910" style="s2">ago you were talking about seeing as how</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.050" end="00:49:21.500" style="s2">there&#39;s an actual election coming up in</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.910" end="00:49:23.390" style="s2">America very soon it&#39;s a shame that</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.500" end="00:49:27.050" style="s2">something like this isn&#39;t in place for</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.390" end="00:49:28.910" style="s2">that right and I think I think it was</p>
<p begin="00:49:27.050" end="00:49:30.800" style="s2">you Adriel mentioned something along the</p>
<p begin="00:49:28.910" end="00:49:33.020" style="s2">lines of you know be good to maybe just</p>
<p begin="00:49:30.800" end="00:49:35.780" style="s2">have one element of it to trial some</p>
<p begin="00:49:33.020" end="00:49:37.460" style="s2">sort of thing but what about what you</p>
<p begin="00:49:35.780" end="00:49:39.980" style="s2">mentioned earlier on the at the notion</p>
<p begin="00:49:37.460" end="00:49:42.260" style="s2">of because this doesn&#39;t require any</p>
<p begin="00:49:39.980" end="00:49:43.820" style="s2">history at all but talking to one</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.260" end="00:49:45.800" style="s2">audience and saying one thing about a</p>
<p begin="00:49:43.820" end="00:49:47.570" style="s2">particular topic or a particular policy</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.800" end="00:49:49.160" style="s2">area and then talking to a different</p>
<p begin="00:49:47.570" end="00:49:52.790" style="s2">audience and saying a different thing</p>
<p begin="00:49:49.160" end="00:49:54.410" style="s2">that would be relatively easy to track I</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.790" end="00:49:55.850" style="s2">think there must be transcripts of all</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.410" end="00:49:57.950" style="s2">of these speech I mean time-consuming</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.850" end="00:50:00.470" style="s2">but but nevertheless relatively easy and</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.950" end="00:50:02.150" style="s2">that&#39;s something that could be done get</p>
<p begin="00:50:00.470" end="00:50:05.060" style="s2">started straight away it just needs</p>
<p begin="00:50:02.150" end="00:50:06.890" style="s2">manpower and that could be posted</p>
<p begin="00:50:05.060" end="00:50:08.570" style="s2">relatively easily and it doesn&#39;t require</p>
<p begin="00:50:06.890" end="00:50:12.860" style="s2">verification because it&#39;s a it&#39;s all</p>
<p begin="00:50:08.570" end="00:50:14.990" style="s2">transcripted so yeah and and and then</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.860" end="00:50:17.900" style="s2">you could as I say you could at least</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.990" end="00:50:20.300" style="s2">highlight the double stand at the</p>
<p begin="00:50:17.900" end="00:50:22.430" style="s2">hypocrisy the two-faced adness within</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.300" end="00:50:24.770" style="s2">the campaign of any image that would be</p>
<p begin="00:50:22.430" end="00:50:26.270" style="s2">really helpful for I mean if you need</p>
<p begin="00:50:24.770" end="00:50:29.540" style="s2">people to do it and there&#39;s only seven</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.270" end="00:50:31.490" style="s2">people watching but like right now with</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.540" end="00:50:34.210" style="s2">a democratic election with what a</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.490" end="00:50:37.790" style="s2">primaries right like like Bernie Sanders</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.210" end="00:50:40.130" style="s2">I think has held pretty stru to his</p>
<p begin="00:50:37.790" end="00:50:42.850" style="s2">values back to the sixties right like he</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.130" end="00:50:45.050" style="s2">wasn&#39;t like oops I was I was racist and</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.850" end="00:50:47.350" style="s2">sexist homophobic but I&#39;ve seen the</p>
<p begin="00:50:45.050" end="00:50:49.490" style="s2">light and I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.350" end="00:50:50.930" style="s2">don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily a character</p>
<p begin="00:50:49.490" end="00:50:52.850" style="s2">flaw to have been that and now aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:50:50.930" end="00:50:54.590" style="s2">like I think the changing is something</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.850" end="00:50:56.800" style="s2">that&#39;s important but that&#39;s not the same</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.590" end="00:50:59.240" style="s2">as like during this election cycle</p>
<p begin="00:50:56.800" end="00:51:00.980" style="s2">saying to one audience hey I&#39;m a</p>
<p begin="00:50:59.240" end="00:51:03.710" style="s2">socialist into another audio like</p>
<p begin="00:51:00.980" end="00:51:05.690" style="s2">he&#39;s we know who Bernie that&#39;s right</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.710" end="00:51:07.220" style="s2">he&#39;s not changing he&#39;s like yeah I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:05.690" end="00:51:10.310" style="s2">against for I don&#39;t care what more it is</p>
<p begin="00:51:07.220" end="00:51:11.780" style="s2">up against it and having that be like</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.310" end="00:51:13.640" style="s2">how do I don&#39;t know I kind of think of</p>
<p begin="00:51:11.780" end="00:51:17.090" style="s2">like Elizabeth Warren I think also has a</p>
<p begin="00:51:13.640" end="00:51:19.070" style="s2">more of a track record of but she&#39;s she</p>
<p begin="00:51:17.090" end="00:51:22.040" style="s2">her history was not democratic right I</p>
<p begin="00:51:19.070" end="00:51:24.230" style="s2">think her history was in like if she did</p>
<p begin="00:51:22.040" end="00:51:26.570" style="s2">kind of switch sides she was Republican</p>
<p begin="00:51:24.230" end="00:51:29.510" style="s2">earlier on did submission like Oh</p>
<p begin="00:51:26.570" end="00:51:30.770" style="s2">like sort of to help backup the credit</p>
<p begin="00:51:29.510" end="00:51:32.450" style="s2">card companies to help us stuff and she</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.770" end="00:51:35.720" style="s2">learned Oh a lot of bankruptcies are</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.450" end="00:51:37.190" style="s2">caused by like by medical debt and then</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.720" end="00:51:38.720" style="s2">she actually kind of that switched her</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.190" end="00:51:40.040" style="s2">sighs she&#39;s like oh this is a super</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.720" end="00:51:44.690" style="s2">important topic and then started to</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.040" end="00:51:47.060" style="s2">campaign against medical debt which is</p>
<p begin="00:51:44.690" end="00:51:48.590" style="s2">good to note with I&#39;ve seen people pitch</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.060" end="00:51:49.850" style="s2">that as a negative but I&#39;ve also seen</p>
<p begin="00:51:48.590" end="00:51:52.430" style="s2">people say wait that sounds amazing</p>
<p begin="00:51:49.850" end="00:51:53.540" style="s2">somebody read data it disagree with with</p>
<p begin="00:51:52.430" end="00:52:04.340" style="s2">what they said and then they switch</p>
<p begin="00:51:53.540" end="00:52:06.080" style="s2">sides causes weakness though isn&#39;t it in</p>
<p begin="00:52:04.340" end="00:52:07.940" style="s2">modern politics if you change your mind</p>
<p begin="00:52:06.080" end="00:52:10.730" style="s2">it&#39;s seen as a u-turn and it&#39;s seen as a</p>
<p begin="00:52:07.940" end="00:52:12.080" style="s2">sign of weakness right not having the</p>
<p begin="00:52:10.730" end="00:52:13.970" style="s2">courage of your convictions kind of</p>
<p begin="00:52:12.080" end="00:52:16.460" style="s2">thing is such all right</p>
<p begin="00:52:13.970" end="00:52:20.030" style="s2">well it&#39;s a rare thing it depends how</p>
<p begin="00:52:16.460" end="00:52:21.800" style="s2">often it happens and what the trigger</p>
<p begin="00:52:20.030" end="00:52:23.300" style="s2">was like if you&#39;re either going back and</p>
<p begin="00:52:21.800" end="00:52:26.450" style="s2">forth back and forth that is a weakness</p>
<p begin="00:52:23.300" end="00:52:28.220" style="s2">like do your research if it&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:52:26.450" end="00:52:29.510" style="s2">defining thing if you did your research</p>
<p begin="00:52:28.220" end="00:52:31.280" style="s2">you&#39;re on one side you said wait a</p>
<p begin="00:52:29.510" end="00:52:32.270" style="s2">minute that doesn&#39;t line up all the</p>
<p begin="00:52:31.280" end="00:52:34.040" style="s2">information is pointing in the other</p>
<p begin="00:52:32.270" end="00:52:35.359" style="s2">directions and then you switch once I</p>
<p begin="00:52:34.040" end="00:52:37.040" style="s2">think that&#39;s a huge strength</p>
<p begin="00:52:35.359" end="00:52:39.530" style="s2">all right great I think that shows</p>
<p begin="00:52:37.040" end="00:52:42.170" style="s2">character and what&#39;s the word integrity</p>
<p begin="00:52:39.530" end="00:52:44.540" style="s2">yeah right yeah and so we have about</p>
<p begin="00:52:42.170" end="00:52:45.890" style="s2">five minutes left as far as is there</p>
<p begin="00:52:44.540" end="00:52:47.060" style="s2">anything else you would like to focus on</p>
<p begin="00:52:45.890" end="00:52:48.980" style="s2">or get out of this and then I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:52:47.060" end="00:52:52.850" style="s2">save the last two or three minutes for</p>
<p begin="00:52:48.980" end="00:52:54.650" style="s2">to discuss the process itself okay so I</p>
<p begin="00:52:52.850" end="00:52:55.730" style="s2">think a lot of this was just enough so</p>
<p begin="00:52:54.650" end="00:53:00.820" style="s2">that you and the audience sort of</p>
<p begin="00:52:55.730" end="00:53:00.820" style="s2">understood once you understand so far</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.300" end="00:53:06.560" style="s2">where is the best spot to focus like</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.790" end="00:53:08.960" style="s2">what could I do that</p>
<p begin="00:53:06.560" end="00:53:10.940" style="s2">like what what slice of this could I</p>
<p begin="00:53:08.960" end="00:53:13.100" style="s2">talk about to get people interested or</p>
<p begin="00:53:10.940" end="00:53:14.299" style="s2">just sort of how everything works</p>
<p begin="00:53:13.100" end="00:53:16.249" style="s2">together like there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:53:14.299" end="00:53:18.979" style="s2">basis of evidence we didn&#39;t even talk</p>
<p begin="00:53:16.249" end="00:53:21.109" style="s2">about the scientific part where instead</p>
<p begin="00:53:18.979" end="00:53:22.489" style="s2">of just assessing politicians the end</p>
<p begin="00:53:21.109" end="00:53:24.109" style="s2">goal is also to be able to look at</p>
<p begin="00:53:22.489" end="00:53:26.359" style="s2">things like climate change in vaccines</p>
<p begin="00:53:24.109" end="00:53:28.459" style="s2">and stuff like that look at all of the</p>
<p begin="00:53:26.359" end="00:53:30.859" style="s2">available data have people summarized it</p>
<p begin="00:53:28.459" end="00:53:32.599" style="s2">again using that sort of we&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:53:30.859" end="00:53:34.910" style="s2">have some fake studies in there and some</p>
<p begin="00:53:32.599" end="00:53:37.189" style="s2">fake things to say like okay even if</p>
<p begin="00:53:34.910" end="00:53:41.630" style="s2">you&#39;re Pro vaccine and the study is anti</p>
<p begin="00:53:37.189" end="00:53:43.670" style="s2">vaccine did they design it properly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:53:41.630" end="00:53:46.039" style="s2">not okay say where they didn&#39;t if they</p>
<p begin="00:53:43.670" end="00:53:49.249" style="s2">did great you can say they designed it</p>
<p begin="00:53:46.039" end="00:53:52.160" style="s2">it it properly and then it can still be</p>
<p begin="00:53:49.249" end="00:53:54.949" style="s2">you know fall somewhere else but the the</p>
<p begin="00:53:52.160" end="00:53:57.739" style="s2">end point is is that spot true and then</p>
<p begin="00:53:54.949" end="00:53:59.239" style="s2">in that way if somebody says no I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:53:57.739" end="00:54:00.920" style="s2">even going to give this the time of day</p>
<p begin="00:53:59.239" end="00:54:03.079" style="s2">as soon as it says anything that could</p>
<p begin="00:54:00.920" end="00:54:05.869" style="s2">be construed as anti vaccine I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:54:03.079" end="00:54:07.969" style="s2">say it&#39;s bad well that&#39;s bias that would</p>
<p begin="00:54:05.869" end="00:54:10.489" style="s2">then filter out that part of it somebody</p>
<p begin="00:54:07.969" end="00:54:13.219" style="s2">is willing to look at it and sort of see</p>
<p begin="00:54:10.489" end="00:54:14.179" style="s2">the these studies that do and don&#39;t meet</p>
<p begin="00:54:13.219" end="00:54:15.979" style="s2">certain criteria</p>
<p begin="00:54:14.179" end="00:54:18.979" style="s2">the end goal there is also to be able to</p>
<p begin="00:54:15.979" end="00:54:21.229" style="s2">get some amount of kind of consensus is</p>
<p begin="00:54:18.979" end="00:54:23.449" style="s2">the right word but to at least see where</p>
<p begin="00:54:21.229" end="00:54:24.799" style="s2">the the science points and you can go</p>
<p begin="00:54:23.449" end="00:54:26.929" style="s2">out again as deep as you want and read</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.799" end="00:54:34.160" style="s2">the designs of their study if you feel</p>
<p begin="00:54:26.929" end="00:54:35.719" style="s2">so inclined if your is your focus if you</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.160" end="00:54:37.549" style="s2">could choose between them would you</p>
<p begin="00:54:35.719" end="00:54:39.170" style="s2">rather focus on the scientific part or</p>
<p begin="00:54:37.549" end="00:54:43.009" style="s2">the politics part simply focusing this</p>
<p begin="00:54:39.170" end="00:54:44.779" style="s2">hour on the politics part and my gut</p>
<p begin="00:54:43.009" end="00:54:46.009" style="s2">like what I want you to focus on is the</p>
<p begin="00:54:44.779" end="00:54:47.929" style="s2">politics part because it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:54:46.009" end="00:54:51.799" style="s2">important right now right this year</p>
<p begin="00:54:47.929" end="00:54:53.869" style="s2">specifically but what is your focus what</p>
<p begin="00:54:51.799" end="00:54:56.839" style="s2">is it you want our field culture I mean</p>
<p begin="00:54:53.869" end="00:54:58.489" style="s2">I I think in my mind they&#39;re they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:54:56.839" end="00:55:00.829" style="s2">linked in a way that can&#39;t be pulled</p>
<p begin="00:54:58.489" end="00:55:02.299" style="s2">apart because the politicians talked so</p>
<p begin="00:55:00.829" end="00:55:04.369" style="s2">much about what climate change says this</p>
<p begin="00:55:02.299" end="00:55:07.119" style="s2">is I just say that an economist say this</p>
<p begin="00:55:04.369" end="00:55:10.009" style="s2">and we start to say I hope they&#39;re right</p>
<p begin="00:55:07.119" end="00:55:12.349" style="s2">there&#39;s this part where they it does</p>
<p begin="00:55:10.009" end="00:55:14.539" style="s2">have to happen sort of in the same</p>
<p begin="00:55:12.349" end="00:55:18.439" style="s2">system I think the election part is a</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.539" end="00:55:21.109" style="s2">bit easier to reach because I as Eric</p>
<p begin="00:55:18.439" end="00:55:24.049" style="s2">said there&#39;s some amount of you can just</p>
<p begin="00:55:21.109" end="00:55:26.569" style="s2">collect the the content do a little bit</p>
<p begin="00:55:24.049" end="00:55:28.160" style="s2">of assessing it to make it useful and to</p>
<p begin="00:55:26.569" end="00:55:30.710" style="s2">sort of show people a summary</p>
<p begin="00:55:28.160" end="00:55:32.000" style="s2">here I think you&#39;re not thinking big</p>
<p begin="00:55:30.710" end="00:55:33.650" style="s2">enough either over you it&#39;s not about</p>
<p begin="00:55:32.000" end="00:55:35.840" style="s2">policy it&#39;s not about science it&#39;s about</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.650" end="00:55:37.160" style="s2">cleaning up the entire</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.840" end="00:55:40.190" style="s2">information ecology is what it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:55:37.160" end="00:55:42.020" style="s2">actually about right so this goes</p>
<p begin="00:55:40.190" end="00:55:44.120" style="s2">everywhere those fingers go into</p>
<p begin="00:55:42.020" end="00:55:45.530" style="s2">absolutely everything so I all me begin</p>
<p begin="00:55:44.120" end="00:55:47.510" style="s2">with politics because let&#39;s face it</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.530" end="00:55:49.940" style="s2">right it&#39;s a stink there</p>
<p begin="00:55:47.510" end="00:55:52.820" style="s2">Ryan there&#39;s no shortage and mess to</p>
<p begin="00:55:49.940" end="00:55:54.650" style="s2">clean up in their area but finally clean</p>
<p begin="00:55:52.820" end="00:55:58.250" style="s2">up politics politics touches everything</p>
<p begin="00:55:54.650" end="00:56:02.660" style="s2">right the economy and all the parts of</p>
<p begin="00:55:58.250" end="00:56:05.420" style="s2">that and business and into I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:02.660" end="00:56:07.370" style="s2">politics is the way it is because of the</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.420" end="00:56:09.890" style="s2">absolute filthy nature of the entire</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.370" end="00:56:11.030" style="s2">information ecology allows them to get</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.890" end="00:56:13.280" style="s2">away with the that they get away</p>
<p begin="00:56:11.030" end="00:56:14.660" style="s2">with right have you know any better we</p>
<p begin="00:56:13.280" end="00:56:18.320" style="s2">don&#39;t know how to call them out on it</p>
<p begin="00:56:14.660" end="00:56:19.670" style="s2">though you know I I yes I sort of agree</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.320" end="00:56:21.140" style="s2">but I see it as the other way around I</p>
<p begin="00:56:19.670" end="00:56:24.110" style="s2">think everything feeds into politics</p>
<p begin="00:56:21.140" end="00:56:26.450" style="s2">rather than politics no yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:56:24.110" end="00:56:29.450" style="s2">politics is sort of a summary of because</p>
<p begin="00:56:26.450" end="00:56:31.130" style="s2">you guys it does all the things that</p>
<p begin="00:56:29.450" end="00:56:32.630" style="s2">people care about which are all these</p>
<p begin="00:56:31.130" end="00:56:34.610" style="s2">different topics politicians try to</p>
<p begin="00:56:32.630" end="00:56:35.450" style="s2">touch on them just to get people for</p>
<p begin="00:56:34.610" end="00:56:37.700" style="s2">putting for them</p>
<p begin="00:56:35.450" end="00:56:40.280" style="s2">politics feeds off of that huge</p>
<p begin="00:56:37.700" end="00:56:42.710" style="s2">information yeah I mean this actually</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.280" end="00:56:45.020" style="s2">has the potential if this if this really</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.710" end="00:56:47.510" style="s2">got going like Wikipedia did you know me</p>
<p begin="00:56:45.020" end="00:56:50.000" style="s2">if this becomes like Wikipedia then this</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.510" end="00:56:53.450" style="s2">has the potential to absolutely smash</p>
<p begin="00:56:50.000" end="00:56:55.340" style="s2">the entire system of politics as we</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.450" end="00:56:59.120" style="s2">understand it you know the party</p>
<p begin="00:56:55.340" end="00:57:00.800" style="s2">affiliations and these these Yepsen you</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.120" end="00:57:03.740" style="s2">know it can actually be a policy by</p>
<p begin="00:57:00.800" end="00:57:05.540" style="s2">policy evaluation voting would be out</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.740" end="00:57:07.760" style="s2">the window right there that consensus</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.540" end="00:57:09.950" style="s2">would be reached through this network of</p>
<p begin="00:57:07.760" end="00:57:11.540" style="s2">information exchange and validation and</p>
<p begin="00:57:09.950" end="00:57:13.460" style="s2">purification right all the</p>
<p begin="00:57:11.540" end="00:57:15.290" style="s2">would be discarded and then the best</p>
<p begin="00:57:13.460" end="00:57:17.420" style="s2">course of action would be I think very</p>
<p begin="00:57:15.290" end="00:57:18.920" style="s2">often pretty clear once you discard all</p>
<p begin="00:57:17.420" end="00:57:20.960" style="s2">the and all that&#39;s left is</p>
<p begin="00:57:18.920" end="00:57:22.850" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s important and real there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.960" end="00:57:24.830" style="s2">a parent the best course of action will</p>
<p begin="00:57:22.850" end="00:57:25.450" style="s2">be I think pretty obvious a lot at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.830" end="00:57:29.390" style="s2">time</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.450" end="00:57:34.760" style="s2">that&#39;s my helper and I can answer this</p>
<p begin="00:57:29.390" end="00:57:36.410" style="s2">for him but he can&#39;t so initially I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:57:34.760" end="00:57:37.580" style="s2">gonna focus on the US and Canada cuz</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.410" end="00:57:39.590" style="s2">that&#39;s what I know and it&#39;s an English</p>
<p begin="00:57:37.580" end="00:57:41.600" style="s2">the only language I speak but the end</p>
<p begin="00:57:39.590" end="00:57:43.790" style="s2">goal is to have this be global</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.600" end="00:57:45.890" style="s2">to have this touch every country that</p>
<p begin="00:57:43.790" end="00:57:46.190" style="s2">needs you know some help with arranging</p>
<p begin="00:57:45.890" end="00:57:49.280" style="s2">its</p>

<p begin="00:57:51.470" end="00:57:55.370" style="s2">voting for people on your City Council</p>
<p begin="00:57:53.150" end="00:57:57.710" style="s2">all the way up to voting for you know</p>
<p begin="00:57:55.370" end="00:57:58.610" style="s2">the president or the leader edge like</p>

<p begin="00:57:58.610" end="00:58:03.530" style="s2">okay if you can put the information in</p>
<p begin="00:58:00.980" end="00:58:05.840" style="s2">and what one of the things we haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:03.530" end="00:58:08.270" style="s2">touched on that Eric kind of was like</p>
<p begin="00:58:05.840" end="00:58:09.890" style="s2">the power of this even in a little way</p>
<p begin="00:58:08.270" end="00:58:11.660" style="s2">in our current political system when</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.890" end="00:58:14.540" style="s2">this gets big enough or something like</p>
<p begin="00:58:11.660" end="00:58:17.420" style="s2">it gets big enough and we&#39;re able to up</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.540" end="00:58:19.370" style="s2">vote our questions to politicians</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.420" end="00:58:21.380" style="s2">we&#39;re the ones who focus the</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.370" end="00:58:23.780" style="s2">conversation commedia right if i think</p>
<p begin="00:58:21.380" end="00:58:25.550" style="s2">you right so they don&#39;t answer it you</p>
<p begin="00:58:23.780" end="00:58:27.470" style="s2">assume they don&#39;t agree with you you</p>
<p begin="00:58:25.550" end="00:58:29.870" style="s2">assume that they&#39;re anti climate if they</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.470" end="00:58:31.460" style="s2">haven&#39;t talked about it right so if we</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.870" end="00:58:32.990" style="s2">up vote them and they all have to answer</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.460" end="00:58:34.880" style="s2">it that&#39;s not gonna happen when there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:58:32.990" end="00:58:36.260" style="s2">40 people on the site when there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:58:34.880" end="00:58:38.090" style="s2">million people on this site and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.260" end="00:58:41.120" style="s2">like hey you didn&#39;t answer these a no</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.090" end="00:58:43.640" style="s2">answer is a is a negative answer yeah</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.120" end="00:58:45.050" style="s2">for the there&#39;s so many parts that we</p>
<p begin="00:58:43.640" end="00:58:48.920" style="s2">didn&#39;t talk about because it&#39;s so easy</p>
<p begin="00:58:45.050" end="00:58:50.990" style="s2">to things but on the election part</p>
<p begin="00:58:48.920" end="00:58:53.180" style="s2">that&#39;s a huge part of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.990" end="00:58:55.700" style="s2">community can decide on what the</p>
<p begin="00:58:53.180" end="00:58:57.770" style="s2">important election issues are then they</p>
<p begin="00:58:55.700" end="00:59:00.050" style="s2">go and gather content to support it but</p>
<p begin="00:58:57.770" end="00:59:02.240" style="s2">the ideal thing is that the actual</p>
<p begin="00:59:00.050" end="00:59:03.890" style="s2">politician or their team responds and</p>
<p begin="00:59:02.240" end="00:59:06.380" style="s2">say here&#39;s the official response from</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.890" end="00:59:08.390" style="s2">that team here&#39;s a video yours links to</p>
<p begin="00:59:06.380" end="00:59:09.680" style="s2">the website here&#39;s all the stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:59:08.390" end="00:59:12.380" style="s2">then like well this person hasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.680" end="00:59:13.760" style="s2">replied yet but here&#39;s four videos we</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.380" end="00:59:15.770" style="s2">have of them talking at a campaign rally</p>
<p begin="00:59:13.760" end="00:59:17.600" style="s2">they all seem to say the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.770" end="00:59:20.030" style="s2">click that you know it&#39;s at least still</p>
<p begin="00:59:17.600" end="00:59:22.430" style="s2">consistent and we have a basic idea of</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.030" end="00:59:23.870" style="s2">where they stand on that topic and then</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.430" end="00:59:27.470" style="s2">the community can vote things up and</p>
<p begin="00:59:23.870" end="00:59:29.090" style="s2">down and sort of say these election</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.470" end="00:59:30.770" style="s2">issues are for a certain topic you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:59:29.090" end="00:59:33.470" style="s2">said you care about this topic these are</p>
<p begin="00:59:30.770" end="00:59:35.810" style="s2">probably be the election issues that you</p>
<p begin="00:59:33.470" end="00:59:38.780" style="s2">care about but to your point Jubilee if</p>
<p begin="00:59:35.810" end="00:59:40.280" style="s2">the media is ignoring a certain topic at</p>
<p begin="00:59:38.780" end="00:59:42.230" style="s2">the end of the day you can say hey</p>
<p begin="00:59:40.280" end="00:59:44.420" style="s2">politician you know three million people</p>
<p begin="00:59:42.230" end="00:59:47.420" style="s2">want to answer to this question who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:44.420" end="00:59:48.830" style="s2">going to answer it is the earth flat we</p>
<p begin="00:59:47.420" end="00:59:51.380" style="s2">need to know you&#39;re from Stephan stuff</p>
<p begin="00:59:48.830" end="00:59:52.930" style="s2">that you didn&#39;t answer it&#39;s clear that</p>
<p begin="00:59:51.380" end="00:59:54.940" style="s2">the earth is flat what</p>
<p begin="00:59:52.930" end="00:59:56.290" style="s2">so there are the two sides to it there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:54.940" end="00:59:57.730" style="s2">if they&#39;ve ever talked about it we&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:59:56.290" end="00:59:59.290" style="s2">have some record and the community can</p>
<p begin="00:59:57.730" end="01:00:05.290" style="s2">say they&#39;ve said they think that the</p>
<p begin="00:59:59.290" end="01:00:07.329" style="s2">earth is round okay cool but still have</p>
<p begin="01:00:05.290" end="01:00:09.369" style="s2">those videos as proof in case the person</p>
<p begin="01:00:07.329" end="01:00:11.890" style="s2">gives a different answer yes I think the</p>
<p begin="01:00:09.369" end="01:00:14.890" style="s2">elders round okay but we have 38 videos</p>
<p begin="01:00:11.890" end="01:00:25.900" style="s2">of you saying it&#39;s flat so what was up</p>
<p begin="01:00:14.890" end="01:00:28.210" style="s2">with that because it is there is this</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.900" end="01:00:31.480" style="s2">like information ecology where it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.210" end="01:00:32.710" style="s2">to get I&#39;ve been a nun not the Flat</p>
<p begin="01:00:31.480" end="01:00:33.880" style="s2">Earth campaign because I watched those</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.710" end="01:00:35.230" style="s2">documentaries I&#39;m like there&#39;s not an</p>
<p begin="01:00:33.880" end="01:00:36.880" style="s2">ounce of truth here there&#39;s at least</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.230" end="01:00:38.740" style="s2">some truth and a lot of conspiracy</p>
<p begin="01:00:36.880" end="01:00:41.530" style="s2">theories I do not know what this is but</p>
<p begin="01:00:38.740" end="01:00:43.510" style="s2">it is not truth but anyway</p>
<p begin="01:00:41.530" end="01:00:46.059" style="s2">it&#39;s not based on science none of the</p>
<p begin="01:00:43.510" end="01:00:48.040" style="s2">experiments work but there&#39;s other ways</p>
<p begin="01:00:46.059" end="01:00:51.010" style="s2">where I am on that other but I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.040" end="01:00:52.990" style="s2">the world thinks one way and I am like</p>
<p begin="01:00:51.010" end="01:00:54.579" style="s2">you haven&#39;t looked into it and so you</p>
<p begin="01:00:52.990" end="01:00:57.640" style="s2">aren&#39;t actually having a conversation</p>
<p begin="01:00:54.579" end="01:00:59.619" style="s2">based on understanding and I want tools</p>
<p begin="01:00:57.640" end="01:01:01.720" style="s2">like this to be able to say hey here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:00:59.619" end="01:01:03.520" style="s2">the actual science and here are these</p>
<p begin="01:01:01.720" end="01:01:08.170" style="s2">things I&#39;m word passed them in apart I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.520" end="01:01:09.849" style="s2">really bad at keeping time um so what is</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.170" end="01:01:11.109" style="s2">how was this for you and what could be</p>
<p begin="01:01:09.849" end="01:01:13.450" style="s2">improved what was good</p>
<p begin="01:01:11.109" end="01:01:15.250" style="s2">um I mean it was good it was nice to</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.450" end="01:01:16.750" style="s2">sort of you know get some my feedback</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.250" end="01:01:19.150" style="s2">and had people chatting and have Eric&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:01:16.750" end="01:01:21.040" style="s2">insight and it was helpful to have</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.150" end="01:01:22.690" style="s2">somebody that had never heard a wiki</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.040" end="01:01:24.520" style="s2">election before cuz Jubilee you you</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.690" end="01:01:26.559" style="s2">can&#39;t have talked for hours on this</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.520" end="01:01:28.720" style="s2">topic so you already had a bunch of</p>
<p begin="01:01:26.559" end="01:01:30.250" style="s2">existing knowledge it was useful to come</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.720" end="01:01:32.020" style="s2">in and sort of have to pitch the idea</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.250" end="01:01:34.329" style="s2">and have somebody that came from a clean</p>
<p begin="01:01:32.020" end="01:01:36.400" style="s2">slate of like I&#39;ve never had having</p>
<p begin="01:01:34.329" end="01:01:38.230" style="s2">heard that and the initial questions of</p>
<p begin="01:01:36.400" end="01:01:39.910" style="s2">like how do you verify the content and</p>
<p begin="01:01:38.230" end="01:01:44.309" style="s2">that sort of thing to actually have to</p>
<p begin="01:01:39.910" end="01:01:46.990" style="s2">go through it I do find that we sort of</p>
<p begin="01:01:44.309" end="01:01:50.020" style="s2">scrolled on certain topics and and went</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.990" end="01:01:51.220" style="s2">super deep and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="01:01:50.020" end="01:01:53.049" style="s2">really touched on many of the</p>
<p begin="01:01:51.220" end="01:01:55.270" style="s2">aspirations I think it was a lot of it</p>
<p begin="01:01:53.049" end="01:01:57.339" style="s2">was trying to vet out certain certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:55.270" end="01:02:00.130" style="s2">topics and the community and Eric so I</p>
<p begin="01:01:57.339" end="01:02:03.970" style="s2">had the did a lot of the same questions</p>
<p begin="01:02:00.130" end="01:02:07.089" style="s2">trying to understand it more deeply is</p>
<p begin="01:02:03.970" end="01:02:11.319" style="s2">the key though isn&#39;t it the the</p>
<p begin="01:02:07.089" end="01:02:13.299" style="s2">gathering and sifting and quality</p>
<p begin="01:02:11.319" end="01:02:16.779" style="s2">control of the information it&#39;s nice the</p>
<p begin="01:02:13.299" end="01:02:18.880" style="s2">whole thing yeah and to your point like</p>

<p begin="01:03:47.289" end="01:03:51.190" style="s2">community that&#39;s okay with actually</p>
<p begin="01:03:48.640" end="01:03:54.190" style="s2">pitching in to pay for the yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="01:03:51.190" end="01:03:55.960" style="s2">developers and hosting costs and so on</p>
<p begin="01:03:54.190" end="01:03:57.579" style="s2">oh you put your idea to practice will</p>

<p begin="01:03:57.579" end="01:04:01.480" style="s2">funders WikiLeaks might be actually a</p>
<p begin="01:03:59.770" end="01:04:02.829" style="s2">really great funder well this cannot be</p>
<p begin="01:04:01.480" end="01:04:04.990" style="s2">one of the person or one person</p>
<p begin="01:04:02.829" end="01:04:07.359" style="s2">undertaking right yeah it absolutely can</p>
<p begin="01:04:04.990" end="01:04:09.789" style="s2">the end goal is to use crowdfunding like</p>
<p begin="01:04:07.359" end="01:04:11.920" style="s2">it can&#39;t be one like it definitely can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="01:04:09.789" end="01:04:13.480" style="s2">be a corporation like a for-profit</p>
<p begin="01:04:11.920" end="01:04:15.880" style="s2">corporation because that instantly</p>
<p begin="01:04:13.480" end="01:04:18.309" style="s2">there&#39;s so much distrust there the end</p>
<p begin="01:04:15.880" end="01:04:20.380" style="s2">goal is for like initially Kickstarter</p>
<p begin="01:04:18.309" end="01:04:22.170" style="s2">and patreon will it be sort of the two</p>
<p begin="01:04:20.380" end="01:04:24.519" style="s2">and then eventually just direct</p>

<p begin="01:04:24.519" end="01:04:28.479" style="s2">also people right people who want to put</p>
<p begin="01:04:27.069" end="01:04:31.140" style="s2">in stuff into the system it would be</p>
<p begin="01:04:28.479" end="01:04:33.369" style="s2">helpful for you to have a weekly</p>
<p begin="01:04:31.140" end="01:04:36.249" style="s2">conversation not with me but like this</p>

<p begin="01:04:52.720" end="01:04:56.739" style="s2">common things that patrons get is that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="01:04:55.359" end="01:04:59.079" style="s2">kind of like a weekly or a monthly</p>
<p begin="01:04:56.739" end="01:05:02.559" style="s2">meetup where you can talk about it and</p>
