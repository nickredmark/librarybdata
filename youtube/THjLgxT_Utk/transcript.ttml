<p begin="00:00:55.820" end="00:01:00.620" style="s2">have been using this for facet model</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.670" end="00:01:03.650" style="s2">from Interpol which we could explore to</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.620" end="00:01:07.059" style="s2">at least start the orientation of many</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.650" end="00:01:07.059" style="s2">of these conversations that I&#39;m having</p>
<p begin="00:01:07.960" end="00:01:16.490" style="s2">and I&#39;m trying to not have too many</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.630" end="00:01:20.840" style="s2">assumptions as I go into the</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.490" end="00:01:23.600" style="s2">conversations that I&#39;m having you know</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.840" end="00:01:26.450" style="s2">where I would like it to go is to feel</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.600" end="00:01:28.909" style="s2">confident in producing an ecology of</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.450" end="00:01:30.500" style="s2">practices with an Associated ethos that</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.909" end="00:01:33.890" style="s2">can actually do what we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.500" end="00:01:37.240" style="s2">right like take somebody from a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:33.890" end="00:01:43.189" style="s2">trapped liberal humanist human to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.240" end="00:01:48.259" style="s2">liberated servant of life and how to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.189" end="00:01:50.259" style="s2">that I have some suspicions but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.259" end="00:01:53.119" style="s2">yet know I don&#39;t think that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.259" end="00:01:54.369" style="s2">think that anybody yet knows I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.119" end="00:01:57.560" style="s2">that we&#39;re all figuring this out</p>
<p begin="00:01:54.369" end="00:01:58.909" style="s2">together because the context is quite</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.560" end="00:02:00.439" style="s2">different now than it than it once was</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.909" end="00:02:01.759" style="s2">when a lot of these practices were</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.439" end="00:02:05.119" style="s2">originally developed and so they have to</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.759" end="00:02:07.520" style="s2">kind of evolve or adjust I think given</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.119" end="00:02:10.130" style="s2">that new context that new culture that</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.520" end="00:02:11.900" style="s2">new and that new that new challenge of</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.130" end="00:02:15.130" style="s2">uninstalling liberal humanism which is</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.900" end="00:02:18.440" style="s2">one of the most powerful and pervasive</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.130" end="00:02:19.240" style="s2">ideologies or metaphysics of the world</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.440" end="00:02:22.090" style="s2">has ever seen</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.240" end="00:02:24.680" style="s2">yeah constant and is constantly being</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.090" end="00:02:26.830" style="s2">rewoven into our psyches through all of</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.680" end="00:02:29.630" style="s2">the systems that we participate in</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.830" end="00:02:31.040" style="s2">is there a mirror an echoing of them</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.630" end="00:02:34.750" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.040" end="00:02:39.409" style="s2">do you think it&#39;s possible to do that</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.750" end="00:02:46.069" style="s2">rewiring without some significant period</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.409" end="00:02:49.990" style="s2">and say the darkness or confusion I mean</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.069" end="00:02:51.880" style="s2">I just I wonder I mean I guess so I I</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.990" end="00:02:53.680" style="s2">I think from my own life part of why</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.880" end="00:02:55.420" style="s2">I&#39;ve wound up here where we are having</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.680" end="00:02:57.190" style="s2">these conversations is because I grew up</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.420" end="00:03:00.850" style="s2">and from about the age I started</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.190" end="00:03:02.920" style="s2">thinking about things I could sense that</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.850" end="00:03:06.100" style="s2">something was off but I think that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.920" end="00:03:08.560" style="s2">what worked because my parents were</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.100" end="00:03:10.420" style="s2">deeply unhappy with one another and I</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.560" end="00:03:13.300" style="s2">could see my sense of the adult world</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.420" end="00:03:15.460" style="s2">was like well that looks like it really</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.300" end="00:03:17.860" style="s2">sucks but they constantly told me that</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.460" end="00:03:19.480" style="s2">you got to go to school and get a good</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.860" end="00:03:20.770" style="s2">degree so you can get a good job and</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.480" end="00:03:23.020" style="s2">then you can have a good out of life and</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.770" end="00:03:32.770" style="s2">I was like well if that&#39;s the part look</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.020" end="00:03:34.750" style="s2">she took me down such a big complex</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.770" end="00:03:36.490" style="s2">painful rabbit hole and I finally feel</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.750" end="00:03:39.790" style="s2">like I&#39;d found my way out the other side</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.490" end="00:03:42.280" style="s2">but I&#39;m not mental actually hmm there is</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.790" end="00:03:44.650" style="s2">a world of people who are thinking</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.280" end="00:03:47.340" style="s2">beyond that liberal humanist capitalist</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.650" end="00:03:51.760" style="s2">world of status and wealth declaration</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.340" end="00:03:55.090" style="s2">hmm but to go back to my original</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.760" end="00:03:57.430" style="s2">question it&#39;s like if if there is a</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.090" end="00:03:59.900" style="s2">sense that unplugging from that is what</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.430" end="00:04:01.519" style="s2">is needed</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.900" end="00:04:06.769" style="s2">question is like how do we facilitate</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.519" end="00:04:10.879" style="s2">that in the most stress-free way that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.769" end="00:04:11.959" style="s2">not the right Matt hmm yeah I&#39;m cured</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.879" end="00:04:14.689" style="s2">I&#39;m curious like what&#39;s underneath that</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.959" end="00:04:16.519" style="s2">question like why why why why are we do</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.689" end="00:04:19.419" style="s2">it in a stress-free way er I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:04:16.519" end="00:04:19.419" style="s2">disagreeing with you I&#39;m just curious</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.180" end="00:04:28.050" style="s2">maybe because because part of me is</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.210" end="00:04:30.910" style="s2">still averse to pain and it&#39;s like I</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.050" end="00:04:33.280" style="s2">don&#39;t want other people to go through</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.910" end="00:04:36.130" style="s2">pain and maybe that&#39;s actually just</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.280" end="00:04:39.730" style="s2">reflection more of me than it is of the</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.130" end="00:04:42.220" style="s2">process well I I mean I I don&#39;t think</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.730" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">it&#39;s not just you that&#39;s a big pain you</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.220" end="00:04:47.160" style="s2">know it&#39;s like it&#39;s very I love so I</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.090" end="00:04:55.480" style="s2">love people who are trying to make this</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.320" end="00:04:56.770" style="s2">path if we call it this path knowing</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.480" end="00:04:59.680" style="s2">that it&#39;s not one path it&#39;s probably</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.770" end="00:05:02.250" style="s2">maybe at many different paths but like</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.680" end="00:05:07.810" style="s2">let&#39;s say human transformation more</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.250" end="00:05:11.380" style="s2">available efficacious safe ease full you</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.810" end="00:05:12.850" style="s2">know I am somebody who&#39;s work I&#39;m quite</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.380" end="00:05:15.130" style="s2">familiar with if this teacher Shinzon</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.850" end="00:05:16.930" style="s2">young and if you&#39;re familiar with shins</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.130" end="00:05:18.670" style="s2">and yeah I know the name but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.930" end="00:05:20.470" style="s2">really know you yeah he&#39;s really cool</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.670" end="00:05:23.920" style="s2">cool do it he&#39;s done a lot of work to</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.470" end="00:05:26.080" style="s2">sort of bring science and deep</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.920" end="00:05:27.640" style="s2">contemplative practice together alright</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.080" end="00:05:29.560" style="s2">so he&#39;s created a whole pedagogy of</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.640" end="00:05:31.360" style="s2">contemplative practice it&#39;s like very</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.560" end="00:05:33.550" style="s2">clear very rigorous with like very</p>
<p begin="00:05:31.360" end="00:05:38.950" style="s2">strict definitions and it works really</p>
<p begin="00:05:33.550" end="00:05:41.710" style="s2">well and now he&#39;s working on a low</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.950" end="00:05:43.540" style="s2">frequency ultrasound device which if I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.710" end="00:05:46.270" style="s2">remembering correctly it targets the</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.540" end="00:05:48.490" style="s2">basal ganglia which they think is kind</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.270" end="00:05:51.100" style="s2">of connected to a cluster of networks</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.490" end="00:05:53.470" style="s2">which are which deactivate upon</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.100" end="00:05:55.060" style="s2">awakening upon enlightenment and so in</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.470" end="00:05:56.980" style="s2">one things we&#39;ve discovered over the</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.060" end="00:05:58.990" style="s2">past 15 years or something like that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.980" end="00:06:01.060" style="s2">that awakening is more about the</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.990" end="00:06:03.010" style="s2">deactivation of regions of the brain</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.060" end="00:06:06.220" style="s2">rather than like something new coming</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.010" end="00:06:09.100" style="s2">online and so using the device that you</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.220" end="00:06:11.770" style="s2">attach to your head you kind of ping</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.100" end="00:06:14.200" style="s2">this part of your brain with ultrasound</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.770" end="00:06:18.010" style="s2">waves and it can turn off and people</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.200" end="00:06:20.680" style="s2">report being bumped into just through</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.010" end="00:06:22.900" style="s2">this process like long periods of</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.680" end="00:06:24.640" style="s2">non-dual experience right where the</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.900" end="00:06:27.640" style="s2">world appears completely new to them</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.640" end="00:06:30.790" style="s2">like the shedding of the personal self</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.640" end="00:06:33.240" style="s2">and so on you know classical mystical</p>
<p begin="00:06:30.790" end="00:06:34.979" style="s2">experiences not so</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.240" end="00:06:37.259" style="s2">different than psychedelics and things</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.979" end="00:06:39.750" style="s2">like that and so you know does it have</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.259" end="00:06:42.270" style="s2">to be hard I think it probably should be</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.750" end="00:06:44.340" style="s2">hard I think it probably there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.270" end="00:06:46.289" style="s2">degree to which it ought to be hard I</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.340" end="00:06:49.050" style="s2">think that builds like a degree of like</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.289" end="00:06:50.580" style="s2">character and willingness to do the hard</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.050" end="00:06:53.910" style="s2">thing I think that&#39;s one of the things</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.580" end="00:06:57.270" style="s2">that I am most grateful for what the</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.910" end="00:07:00.960" style="s2">monastic Academy has given me is like</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.270" end="00:07:02.960" style="s2">this kind of quality of being where I</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.960" end="00:07:06.210" style="s2">will just do what needs to be done</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.960" end="00:07:09.930" style="s2">regardless of how I feel right in one of</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.210" end="00:07:12.000" style="s2">the I think assumptions or Consequences</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.930" end="00:07:15.000" style="s2">of liberal humanism is this sense that</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.000" end="00:07:16.620" style="s2">how I feel matters and perhaps it</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.000" end="00:07:18.479" style="s2">matters like it&#39;s a most like that</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.620" end="00:07:20.490" style="s2">that&#39;s the most important thing I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.479" end="00:07:23.069" style="s2">want to be trapped in that way and in</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.490" end="00:07:26.610" style="s2">order to escape that there is a degree I</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.069" end="00:07:30.080" style="s2">think of discomfort required you have to</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.610" end="00:07:32.849" style="s2">be able to go beyond feeling good and I</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.080" end="00:07:34.289" style="s2">appreciate that and I suspect that might</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.849" end="00:07:35.909" style="s2">be one of the core components of the</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.289" end="00:07:39.050" style="s2">pedagogy that kind of can really take</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.909" end="00:07:42.090" style="s2">people towards a robust freedom and</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.050" end="00:07:43.680" style="s2">capacity to serve but also like we</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.090" end="00:07:45.570" style="s2">should let Ivan my opinion we should</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.680" end="00:07:47.909" style="s2">leverage psychedelics we should leverage</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.570" end="00:07:50.490" style="s2">contemplatively we should leverage</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.909" end="00:07:52.280" style="s2">whatever we can to accelerate this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.490" end="00:07:56.669" style="s2">and make it more available and less</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.280" end="00:07:58.020" style="s2">painful because man taking I mean I feel</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.669" end="00:08:00.539" style="s2">like I&#39;m just getting started and I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.020" end="00:08:03.659" style="s2">been on this path for like 12 years and</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.539" end="00:08:05.940" style="s2">you know since like thousands of hours</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.659" end="00:08:09.300" style="s2">of silent practice and a lot of that has</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.940" end="00:08:11.849" style="s2">been deeply fundamentally unpleasant you</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.300" end="00:08:14.699" style="s2">know it&#39;s just like we can&#39;t that can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.849" end="00:08:16.319" style="s2">be the way it is for everybody mmm we</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.699" end="00:08:18.719" style="s2">don&#39;t have time for that well that</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.319" end="00:08:22.250" style="s2">brings me to something I was thinking as</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.719" end="00:08:22.250" style="s2">you were speaking which is that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.380" end="00:08:28.980" style="s2">if a degree of transformation is going</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.990" end="00:08:31.170" style="s2">to be necessary to bring us forwards but</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.980" end="00:08:34.770" style="s2">and this is a big but but it may happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.170" end="00:08:36.750" style="s2">if we go through some kind of seriously</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.770" end="00:08:40.410" style="s2">shitty social breakdowns at the same</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.750" end="00:08:43.500" style="s2">time we end up with this like fork it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.410" end="00:08:45.690" style="s2">like does the collapse push more people</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.500" end="00:08:48.060" style="s2">in what perhaps into this what we might</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.690" end="00:08:50.100" style="s2">call that like liminal dark night of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.060" end="00:08:52.470" style="s2">soul type space from which they can grow</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.100" end="00:08:54.930" style="s2">or will it just put us back into every</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.470" end="00:08:57.600" style="s2">man for is valve style tribal survival</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.930" end="00:08:59.820" style="s2">and then there&#39;s what that needs to be</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.600" end="00:09:01.890" style="s2">done just to build back to that baseline</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.820" end="00:09:04.230" style="s2">that we have now which is a kind of</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.890" end="00:09:06.150" style="s2">perhaps existential discomfort but</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.230" end="00:09:10.410" style="s2">material comfort that allows us to</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.150" end="00:09:13.010" style="s2">explore existential discomfort yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.410" end="00:09:13.010" style="s2">end for me</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.329" end="00:09:19.299" style="s2">uh and this is some emma2 a workshop</p>
<p begin="00:09:16.420" end="00:09:21.429" style="s2">with this person this amazing person Joe</p>
<p begin="00:09:19.299" end="00:09:24.189" style="s2">Brewer you did a workshop on planetary</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.429" end="00:09:26.110" style="s2">collapse so he&#39;s been studying you know</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.189" end="00:09:29.279" style="s2">well what what happened when systems</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.110" end="00:09:33.819" style="s2">collapsed and how do we understand this</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.279" end="00:09:35.319" style="s2">well I mean he&#39;s very cheap firm you</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.819" end="00:09:36.970" style="s2">know we are in the midst of a planetary</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.319" end="00:09:39.129" style="s2">collapse and that unraveling of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.970" end="00:09:41.649" style="s2">system you know it doesn&#39;t look like we</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.129" end="00:09:44.079" style="s2">expect it to when we see movies about</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.649" end="00:09:46.929" style="s2">how goes down right it&#39;s like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.079" end="00:09:49.899" style="s2">little fraying of the various fabrics</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.929" end="00:09:54.129" style="s2">that hold everything together punctuated</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.899" end="00:09:56.999" style="s2">by crisis and his sense is that one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.129" end="00:09:59.170" style="s2">the reasons we train is so that when</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.999" end="00:10:01.629" style="s2">something does something very</p>
<p begin="00:09:59.170" end="00:10:04.299" style="s2">fundamental does break there are those</p>
<p begin="00:10:01.629" end="00:10:07.629" style="s2">of us who are available to step into</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.299" end="00:10:09.579" style="s2">those crises in a way that does shift us</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.629" end="00:10:11.589" style="s2">towards a greater sense of coherence and</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.579" end="00:10:14.529" style="s2">togetherness I guess when hits the</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.589" end="00:10:16.329" style="s2">fan that we get that there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.529" end="00:10:20.769" style="s2">opportunity there right that&#39;s when</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.329" end="00:10:24.279" style="s2">heroes come forth right and so I think</p>
<p begin="00:10:20.769" end="00:10:26.619" style="s2">that can also be an accelerant right</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.279" end="00:10:30.819" style="s2">like that could that could be a time</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.619" end="00:10:33.279" style="s2">when people burst forth out of the kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.819" end="00:10:35.980" style="s2">of confusion and we might say</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.279" end="00:10:39.059" style="s2">sleepwalking of the dominant paradigm as</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.980" end="00:10:43.389" style="s2">long as there are actors agents</p>
<p begin="00:10:39.059" end="00:10:45.819" style="s2">available to kind of be present to not</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.389" end="00:10:48.309" style="s2">completely lose their to be</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.819" end="00:10:52.299" style="s2">emotionally available and like skillful</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.309" end="00:10:55.720" style="s2">and mature and and willing to do that</p>
<p begin="00:10:52.299" end="00:10:57.939" style="s2">and I mean that&#39;s a lot of the reason or</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.720" end="00:10:59.230" style="s2">you know that possible future is a lot</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.939" end="00:11:01.179" style="s2">of the reason that I do my training is</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.230" end="00:11:04.239" style="s2">so that I can come you know to be quite</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.179" end="00:11:05.679" style="s2">personal like I&#39;m here at my mom&#39;s house</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.239" end="00:11:08.919" style="s2">in upstate New York right now I&#39;m not at</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.679" end="00:11:10.540" style="s2">the monastery but I see one possible</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.919" end="00:11:12.639" style="s2">future I imagine a possible future where</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.540" end="00:11:17.049" style="s2">social structures do start to break down</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.639" end="00:11:21.009" style="s2">and that I could come back to my</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.049" end="00:11:24.970" style="s2">hometown and play a role of kind of</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.009" end="00:11:27.190" style="s2">consciousness and wisdom and clarity and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.970" end="00:11:30.100" style="s2">energy and kindness</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.190" end="00:11:32.560" style="s2">and support people in navigating this</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.100" end="00:11:35.260" style="s2">transition in a way that makes</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.560" end="00:11:37.900" style="s2">everything work better for everybody</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.260" end="00:11:41.020" style="s2">then it could have if I wasn&#39;t here like</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.900" end="00:11:43.900" style="s2">that&#39;s very I feels really good like</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.020" end="00:11:45.730" style="s2">that possibility not that I want to</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.900" end="00:11:48.850" style="s2">go down but to play that role if it does</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.730" end="00:12:01.330" style="s2">like I love that at Ross Warner house</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.850" end="00:12:04.330" style="s2">before yeah that&#39;s what am I thinking</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.330" end="00:12:06.940" style="s2">now well I&#39;m actually wondering about</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.330" end="00:12:09.550" style="s2">something that that came up when we last</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.940" end="00:12:13.900" style="s2">spoke in London and I&#39;m wondering if we</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.550" end="00:12:16.330" style="s2">can tie this in a little bit so just the</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.900" end="00:12:21.640" style="s2">idea came up actually around this idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.330" end="00:12:24.190" style="s2">of the spiritual class system which I</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.640" end="00:12:28.890" style="s2">found very interesting and we didn&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.190" end="00:12:33.460" style="s2">to unpack it really I mean I guess</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.890" end="00:12:35.650" style="s2">perhaps the shorthand that perhaps you</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.460" end="00:12:37.570" style="s2">outlined to me was that like you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.650" end="00:12:40.750" style="s2">you&#39;ve got the elite who have access to</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.570" end="00:12:42.220" style="s2">the the top tiered gurus and personal</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.750" end="00:12:45.010" style="s2">development coaches and actually have</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.220" end="00:12:47.010" style="s2">like a real deep integrated embodied</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.010" end="00:12:49.510" style="s2">spirituality and then you perhaps have</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.010" end="00:12:53.380" style="s2">the spiritual middle-class you read</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.510" end="00:12:56.710" style="s2">Eckhart Tolle a and a couple of those</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.380" end="00:13:01.270" style="s2">are those kind of bestseller spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.710" end="00:13:04.800" style="s2">geezers and then you&#39;ve got what you</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.270" end="00:13:08.250" style="s2">might call astrology stones crystals</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.800" end="00:13:15.310" style="s2">down I&#39;ll stay down at the bottom</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.250" end="00:13:18.010" style="s2">but what I&#39;m thinking is that does seem</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.310" end="00:13:20.560" style="s2">to suggest that that if in a time of</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.010" end="00:13:22.089" style="s2">crisis people did stand up and all of a</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.560" end="00:13:24.040" style="s2">sudden there were more people to follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.089" end="00:13:25.340" style="s2">then there actually might be a degree to</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.040" end="00:13:28.340" style="s2">which</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.340" end="00:13:29.960" style="s2">that there&#39;s gonna say a market for it</p>
<p begin="00:13:28.340" end="00:13:32.450" style="s2">but that just shows again being trapped</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.960" end="00:13:36.260" style="s2">within hmm I&#39;m not a market for what I</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.450" end="00:13:39.910" style="s2">don&#39;t know verb form or on-the-ground</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.260" end="00:13:43.870" style="s2">spiritual guidance hmm you know I think</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.910" end="00:13:43.870" style="s2">there is a degree to which</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.089" end="00:13:46.999" style="s2">we&#39;re still caught within like people</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.709" end="00:13:49.160" style="s2">will be happy having a personal</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.999" end="00:13:50.930" style="s2">spirituality as long as they do it</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.160" end="00:13:54.980" style="s2">themselves and maybe read a few books on</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.930" end="00:14:05.499" style="s2">it but don&#39;t have that much integration</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.980" end="00:14:05.499" style="s2">with like a community yes any thoughts</p>
<p begin="00:14:06.220" end="00:14:13.129" style="s2">you know I think for me part of how I</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.629" end="00:14:17.629" style="s2">imagine the work that I&#39;m doing at the</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.129" end="00:14:19.490" style="s2">monastic Academy is as an attempt to was</p>
<p begin="00:14:17.629" end="00:14:22.370" style="s2">with the equivalent like kind of</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.490" end="00:14:24.589" style="s2">restructure the distribution of these</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.370" end="00:14:27.529" style="s2">very powerful and elite teachings to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.589" end="00:14:30.439" style="s2">make them more available for all as</p>
<p begin="00:14:27.529" end="00:14:33.069" style="s2">whoever can you know bring themselves to</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.439" end="00:14:36.170" style="s2">come to a place like that right his</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.069" end="00:14:38.779" style="s2">you&#39;re right it&#39;s like very hard there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.170" end="00:14:41.569" style="s2">many different reasons why we might not</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.779" end="00:14:43.009" style="s2">counter the really good good stuff and</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.569" end="00:14:47.559" style="s2">there&#39;s really really good good stuff</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.009" end="00:14:51.259" style="s2">you know out there and yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.559" end="00:14:55.339" style="s2">there is a deep hunger for this and</p>
<p begin="00:14:51.259" end="00:14:59.899" style="s2">there&#39;s a tremendous amount of noise in</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.339" end="00:15:01.399" style="s2">the information ecology around the whole</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.899" end="00:15:03.620" style="s2">genre of things we might call</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.399" end="00:15:07.189" style="s2">self-development or wisdom teachings</p>
<p begin="00:15:03.620" end="00:15:10.009" style="s2">that make it extremely difficult to</p>
<p begin="00:15:07.189" end="00:15:11.269" style="s2">navigate unless you dedicate your unless</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.009" end="00:15:13.459" style="s2">you get really lucky and you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.269" end="00:15:16.550" style="s2">somebody who has already navigated it or</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.459" end="00:15:18.110" style="s2">you dedicate a tremendous amount of time</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.550" end="00:15:20.360" style="s2">and are also typically quite well</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.110" end="00:15:24.050" style="s2">educated but you also need all that free</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.360" end="00:15:26.870" style="s2">time right to navigate it and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:24.050" end="00:15:28.339" style="s2">quite broken right now and partly it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.870" end="00:15:30.350" style="s2">because of the incentive structures of</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.339" end="00:15:32.749" style="s2">capitalism that kind of distort the way</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.350" end="00:15:36.879" style="s2">that these flows of information happen</p>
<p begin="00:15:32.749" end="00:15:39.679" style="s2">but yeah I&#39;m very passionate about</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.879" end="00:15:43.389" style="s2">repackaging and redistributing these</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.679" end="00:15:47.449" style="s2">teachings in a way that is clearly</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.389" end="00:15:49.579" style="s2">trustworthy and you know that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.449" end="00:15:51.019" style="s2">passion of mine I&#39;m not sure I do a very</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.579" end="00:15:53.209" style="s2">good job or have done a very good job</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.019" end="00:15:56.760" style="s2">but it&#39;s something I would love to see</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.209" end="00:16:01.680" style="s2">more of is</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.760" end="00:16:04.250" style="s2">funny like we live in a world that tends</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.680" end="00:16:08.520" style="s2">towards I think decentralization and</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.250" end="00:16:14.130" style="s2">distribution of more or less everything</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.520" end="00:16:15.870" style="s2">which has its perks but also its</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.130" end="00:16:18.330" style="s2">drawbacks some of the drawbacks being</p>
<p begin="00:16:15.870" end="00:16:21.390" style="s2">the fact that I think to take one</p>
<p begin="00:16:18.330" end="00:16:22.860" style="s2">example say yoga so anyone can do yoga</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.390" end="00:16:24.330" style="s2">for three years and then become a yoga</p>
<p begin="00:16:22.860" end="00:16:28.770" style="s2">teacher and then pronounce that they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.330" end="00:16:30.810" style="s2">a yogi and have students and on the one</p>
<p begin="00:16:28.770" end="00:16:34.020" style="s2">hand I mean perhaps yeah and if they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.810" end="00:16:37.170" style="s2">teaching physical movement in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:16:34.020" end="00:16:40.490" style="s2">gives people love it ruins people&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:16:37.170" end="00:16:43.920" style="s2">physical health and it it&#39;s great but</p>
<p begin="00:16:40.490" end="00:16:46.230" style="s2">yeah there&#39;s a degree to which like it</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.920" end="00:16:47.640" style="s2">like I could easily go to ten sessions</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.230" end="00:16:48.990" style="s2">with someone who&#39;s done three years of</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.640" end="00:16:53.070" style="s2">yoga and then walk around saying like</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.990" end="00:16:55.080" style="s2">now I&#39;m a yogi and oh sure I understand</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.070" end="00:16:57.030" style="s2">or not like even say I understand but</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.080" end="00:16:59.070" style="s2">even don&#39;t even have a conception of</p>
<p begin="00:16:57.030" end="00:17:03.270" style="s2">that there is a depth to the tradition</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.070" end="00:17:06.680" style="s2">yeah so true yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s the kind</p>
<p begin="00:17:03.270" end="00:17:10.020" style="s2">of there&#39;s the tricky thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.680" end="00:17:14.839" style="s2">decentralization of culture is that loss</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.020" end="00:17:19.790" style="s2">of the access to the depth and the real</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.839" end="00:17:22.460" style="s2">wisdom that can only accrue over time</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.790" end="00:17:26.090" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.460" end="00:17:29.150" style="s2">I feel bad very strongly is something as</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.090" end="00:17:32.030" style="s2">well that I kind of realized through</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.150" end="00:17:36.380" style="s2">hanging out with with Alexander in his</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.030" end="00:17:37.910" style="s2">nose it&#39;s like this idea that because we</p>
<p begin="00:17:36.380" end="00:17:39.530" style="s2">live in a world where so much is</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.910" end="00:17:42.740" style="s2">instantly available online through</p>
<p begin="00:17:39.530" end="00:17:44.000" style="s2">Wikipedia there&#39;s an ability to get it</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.740" end="00:17:45.950" style="s2">into your head that everything is</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.000" end="00:17:51.440" style="s2">available online mmm</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.950" end="00:17:52.670" style="s2">which is total yep and that was</p>
<p begin="00:17:51.440" end="00:17:57.620" style="s2">on this moment there&#39;s like a light bulb</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.670" end="00:18:00.950" style="s2">moment I&#39;m like I&#39;ve been lied to and</p>
<p begin="00:17:57.620" end="00:18:04.190" style="s2">actually that there is there are</p>
<p begin="00:18:00.950" end="00:18:06.070" style="s2">increasingly groups of people with</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.190" end="00:18:08.210" style="s2">knowledge er like no this isn&#39;t going</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.070" end="00:18:09.680" style="s2">public and I suppose that&#39;s always been</p>
<p begin="00:18:08.210" end="00:18:11.750" style="s2">the case with business perhaps because</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.680" end="00:18:14.450" style="s2">business is still competing but even</p>
<p begin="00:18:11.750" end="00:18:16.580" style="s2">with things like like traditions like</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.450" end="00:18:19.220" style="s2">I&#39;ve heard Alexander speaking about like</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.580" end="00:18:21.470" style="s2">he&#39;s Austrian networks and they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:19.220" end="00:18:24.200" style="s2">want to popularize or Astron ISM to the</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.470" end="00:18:25.850" style="s2">public right but it might be the same</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.200" end="00:18:27.680" style="s2">route that certain strands of Buddhism</p>
<p begin="00:18:25.850" end="00:18:30.520" style="s2">have gone in the way which is as we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.680" end="00:18:32.990" style="s2">said has become the kind of hegemony</p>
<p begin="00:18:30.520" end="00:18:34.580" style="s2">hegemonic ideology is that now we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:32.990" end="00:18:36.920" style="s2">want that for us hmm</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.580" end="00:18:40.550" style="s2">there&#39;s something there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.920" end="00:18:43.400" style="s2">valuable about it being behind closed</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.550" end="00:18:45.650" style="s2">doors and only accessible to to those</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.400" end="00:18:49.550" style="s2">who are actually driven by something</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.650" end="00:18:55.310" style="s2">more than a desire for a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.550" end="00:19:01.490" style="s2">paracetamol by summoning mmhmm yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.310" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">I love what you&#39;re saying I think I yeah</p>
<p begin="00:19:01.490" end="00:19:04.000" style="s2">I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.120" end="00:19:15.210" style="s2">it took me years of daily relating with</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.180" end="00:19:17.580" style="s2">somebody at the teacher at the monastery</p>
<p begin="00:19:15.210" end="00:19:20.370" style="s2">who is actually deep who had actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.580" end="00:19:23.400" style="s2">done the work who&#39;d actually transformed</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.370" end="00:19:26.130" style="s2">himself in a radical way for me to like</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.400" end="00:19:29.820" style="s2">actually admit to myself how deep this</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.130" end="00:19:31.890" style="s2">stuff goes right and there is this as</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.820" end="00:19:34.980" style="s2">you say it&#39;s kind of debasing of the</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.890" end="00:19:36.090" style="s2">currency of depth that&#39;s happening in</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.980" end="00:19:37.110" style="s2">our culture right now and in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:36.090" end="00:19:40.980" style="s2">spiritual culture of France</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.110" end="00:19:44.850" style="s2">it&#39;s very alarming it&#39;s very alarming to</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.980" end="00:19:50.240" style="s2">me and because I it&#39;s kind of like there</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.850" end="00:19:52.560" style="s2">it&#39;s similar to when we monoculture a</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.240" end="00:19:55.790" style="s2">forest or something like that we don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.560" end="00:20:00.180" style="s2">actually even know what we&#39;re losing and</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.790" end="00:20:01.170" style="s2">part of me is quite scared that in a</p>
<p begin="00:20:00.180" end="00:20:05.420" style="s2">generation</p>
<p begin="00:20:01.170" end="00:20:08.730" style="s2">we could lose so much of the depth of</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.420" end="00:20:10.560" style="s2">the teachings that has perhaps survived</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.730" end="00:20:12.960" style="s2">through human to human lineage and</p>
<p begin="00:20:10.560" end="00:20:16.800" style="s2">transmission for thousands and thousands</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.960" end="00:20:18.810" style="s2">of years because it you know again if we</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.800" end="00:20:20.610" style="s2">think about the incentives like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.810" end="00:20:23.940" style="s2">hard to get to that realization of</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.610" end="00:20:29.160" style="s2">you&#39;ve had it&#39;s there&#39;s so much working</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.940" end="00:20:33.720" style="s2">against us to see that to kind of admit</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.160" end="00:20:35.190" style="s2">our own arrogance and open up to kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.720" end="00:20:37.770" style="s2">the kind of humility I feel that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.190" end="00:20:39.390" style="s2">pointing to and why would we do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.770" end="00:20:43.080" style="s2">when there&#39;s a ten week course that</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.390" end="00:20:45.240" style="s2">promises that 80% of people who take it</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.080" end="00:20:50.970" style="s2">get enlightened or why would we do that</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.240" end="00:20:53.490" style="s2">when you know talk is cheap and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.970" end="00:20:54.630" style="s2">something I don&#39;t know it&#39;s scary to me</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.490" end="00:20:56.730" style="s2">but when you&#39;re in it when you&#39;re in an</p>
<p begin="00:20:54.630" end="00:20:58.470" style="s2">actual when you&#39;re in a when you&#39;re with</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.730" end="00:21:03.930" style="s2">somebody when you&#39;re with somebody who&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.470" end="00:21:06.270" style="s2">really different you you know you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.930" end="00:21:07.740" style="s2">they&#39;re different yeah you feel it you</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.270" end="00:21:09.390" style="s2">hear you admit it to yourself you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.740" end="00:21:11.130" style="s2">like hmm they&#39;re not like that yoga</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.390" end="00:21:12.630" style="s2">teacher that I take yoga from what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.130" end="00:21:14.700" style="s2">going down here like what&#39;s actually</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.630" end="00:21:16.660" style="s2">happening here you know there&#39;s that</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.700" end="00:21:19.540" style="s2">kind of like you can follow your nose</p>
<p begin="00:21:16.660" end="00:21:21.250" style="s2">there&#39;s something there and I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.540" end="00:21:22.960" style="s2">that&#39;s enough you know I hope that</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.250" end="00:21:24.190" style="s2">people could we collectively have enough</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.960" end="00:21:27.910" style="s2">integrity to follow that and acknowledge</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.190" end="00:21:31.870" style="s2">that and admit that to keep this stuff</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.910" end="00:21:33.670" style="s2">get Bali yeah there&#39;s a very that&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:21:31.870" end="00:21:34.210" style="s2">very real fear for me glad that you have</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.670" end="00:21:37.060" style="s2">made</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.210" end="00:21:39.760" style="s2">it&#39;s nice that you brought up that idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.060" end="00:21:42.730" style="s2">of humility and what I&#39;m thinking in</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.760" end="00:21:45.070" style="s2">connection with that is is the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.730" end="00:21:47.500" style="s2">I think we the system structure that we</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.070" end="00:21:50.440" style="s2">now live on is is actually set up for</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.500" end="00:21:53.710" style="s2">the complete opposite of that really</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.440" end="00:21:55.960" style="s2">from a young age it&#39;s like tests and</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.710" end="00:21:58.530" style="s2">test scores and this is me thinking Zach</p>
<p begin="00:21:55.960" end="00:22:01.120" style="s2">Stein&#39;s work again now but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.530" end="00:22:05.050" style="s2">everyone has a badge to their name</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.120" end="00:22:08.290" style="s2">signifying their their competencies with</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.050" end="00:22:10.180" style="s2">a view to putting you supposedly in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:08.290" end="00:22:12.250" style="s2">position where you will be able to do</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.180" end="00:22:14.410" style="s2">the maximum amount of good based on what</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.250" end="00:22:18.040" style="s2">you&#39;re qualified to do and then there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.410" end="00:22:21.280" style="s2">also within that the incentive structure</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.040" end="00:22:23.080" style="s2">for schools to show off about how</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.280" end="00:22:24.850" style="s2">high-performing their kids are for</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.080" end="00:22:27.450" style="s2">universities to do the same from</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.850" end="00:22:30.070" style="s2">companies to want to show everybody that</p>
<p begin="00:22:27.450" end="00:22:32.080" style="s2">we&#39;ve got the most high performing this</p>
<p begin="00:22:30.070" end="00:22:36.100" style="s2">team we&#39;ve got the best new CEO we&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:32.080" end="00:22:38.290" style="s2">got I mean LinkedIn especially I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.100" end="00:22:39.760" style="s2">spend much time on LinkedIn that social</p>

<p begin="00:24:57.990" end="00:25:04.830" style="s2">think social media kind of hyper</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.690" end="00:25:06.629" style="s2">intensifies that tendency and normalizes</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.830" end="00:25:08.940" style="s2">it right because you have to find your</p>

<p begin="00:25:44.750" end="00:25:49.520" style="s2">thinking of a conversation that was</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.250" end="00:25:51.020" style="s2">happening with someone two days ago is</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.520" end="00:25:54.289" style="s2">someone I&#39;d met when I was out in the</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.020" end="00:25:56.120" style="s2">pub and she was talking about how she</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.289" end="00:25:58.600" style="s2">had a job a she&#39;s working in consulting</p>
<p begin="00:25:56.120" end="00:26:02.200" style="s2">but she wanted to go into the</p>
<p begin="00:25:58.600" end="00:26:05.000" style="s2">not-for-profit sector mmm saying well</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.200" end="00:26:06.620" style="s2">I&#39;m staying where I am for now because I</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.000" end="00:26:08.510" style="s2">wanted to make sure that I can turn</p>
<p begin="00:26:06.620" end="00:26:11.539" style="s2">myself into an asset so when I go into</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.510" end="00:26:13.730" style="s2">that sector I can do good work there and</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.539" end="00:26:15.440" style="s2">I was like okay I get your point</p>
<p begin="00:26:13.730" end="00:26:18.320" style="s2">but it&#39;s interesting the language you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.440" end="00:26:19.700" style="s2">used there mm-hmm and I pulled her up on</p>
<p begin="00:26:18.320" end="00:26:23.630" style="s2">it and I think it freaked her out a bit</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.700" end="00:26:25.159" style="s2">because I mean she is what she said like</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.630" end="00:26:27.620" style="s2">I&#39;m not used to thinking that bad things</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.159" end="00:26:29.929" style="s2">from this what would you call it and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.620" end="00:26:31.070" style="s2">guess like philosophical inquiry</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.929" end="00:26:33.830" style="s2">perspective cuz to me I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.070" end="00:26:36.409" style="s2">well that just did that betrays this</p>
<p begin="00:26:33.830" end="00:26:38.990" style="s2">this fact that we&#39;re trained to think of</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.409" end="00:26:41.450" style="s2">ourselves as like a commodity yes</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.990" end="00:26:44.270" style="s2">I&#39;m an asset to this room and she&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.450" end="00:26:50.360" style="s2">I&#39;m something that can be tapped on with</p>
<p begin="00:26:44.270" end="00:26:51.530" style="s2">a certain degree of absque ills and</p>
<p begin="00:26:50.360" end="00:26:53.930" style="s2">be able to do something that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.530" end="00:26:57.560" style="s2">completely true but it&#39;s just partial</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.930" end="00:26:59.210" style="s2">okay thank you I think I mean I say to</p>
<p begin="00:26:57.560" end="00:27:00.440" style="s2">people like if you feel like you want to</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.210" end="00:27:02.510" style="s2">go and do something like working in</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.440" end="00:27:05.990" style="s2">they&#39;re not prefer profits then go and</p>
<p begin="00:27:02.510" end="00:27:09.850" style="s2">do it and then sit here thinking when</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.990" end="00:27:14.090" style="s2">I&#39;m not gonna do it yet I&#39;m gonna wait</p>
<p begin="00:27:09.850" end="00:27:18.380" style="s2">because again there and just start</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.090" end="00:27:22.880" style="s2">learning anyway yeah yeah that is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:27:18.380" end="00:27:25.010" style="s2">I think that&#39;s probably in something</p>
<p begin="00:27:22.880" end="00:27:29.690" style="s2">young was just throw yourself in and</p>
<p begin="00:27:25.010" end="00:27:33.290" style="s2">start doing yeah totally yeah yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.690" end="00:27:34.910" style="s2">mean that&#39;s I think it&#39;s hard to say but</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.290" end="00:27:37.430" style="s2">like one of the one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.910" end="00:27:42.200" style="s2">important trainings at the monastic</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.430" end="00:27:43.850" style="s2">Academy is just that right it&#39;s like and</p>
<p begin="00:27:42.200" end="00:27:48.110" style="s2">and I think this might be actually why</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.850" end="00:27:51.170" style="s2">the discomfort is so necessary right</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.110" end="00:27:55.580" style="s2">because I know for me a lot of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:51.170" end="00:27:57.950" style="s2">reasons why I in the past wouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.580" end="00:28:00.770" style="s2">the thing that my heart was calling me</p>
<p begin="00:27:57.950" end="00:28:03.530" style="s2">to do the reason I wouldn&#39;t do them was</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.770" end="00:28:05.930" style="s2">because I was afraid of what life would</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.530" end="00:28:07.940" style="s2">be like if I did like that I would lose</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.930" end="00:28:11.540" style="s2">some of what I have come to value and</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.940" end="00:28:15.830" style="s2">depend on whether it&#39;s like my apartment</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.540" end="00:28:17.960" style="s2">or my particular relationships or access</p>
<p begin="00:28:15.830" end="00:28:24.110" style="s2">to what I consider to be healthy food or</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.960" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">whatever and once we live in a place and</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.110" end="00:28:27.740" style="s2">we subject ourselves to enough</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:29.600" style="s2">discomforts and I think that it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:27.740" end="00:28:30.980" style="s2">Stoics also have practices like this</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.600" end="00:28:33.890" style="s2">when they defend periods of time just</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.980" end="00:28:37.610" style="s2">like wearing a hair shirt and like not</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.890" end="00:28:39.110" style="s2">you know doing anything for fun like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.610" end="00:28:41.450" style="s2">think there&#39;s like the what are the</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.110" end="00:28:44.030" style="s2">dopamine fasts are now very popular in</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.450" end="00:28:47.570" style="s2">Silicon Valley but that you sort of like</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.030" end="00:28:50.960" style="s2">realize that you&#39;re fine like you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.570" end="00:28:55.130" style="s2">eat what you think is not great food you</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.960" end="00:28:56.930" style="s2">can like have a worse apartment you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.130" end="00:28:58.670" style="s2">figure it out if you&#39;re actually</p>
<p begin="00:28:56.930" end="00:29:00.770" style="s2">listening to this conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.670" end="00:29:02.540" style="s2">we&#39;re having right now you are in the</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.770" end="00:29:08.350" style="s2">scope of the planet one of the most</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.540" end="00:29:12.050" style="s2">privileged people alive right and like</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.350" end="00:29:14.170" style="s2">you the wiggle room like how or maybe</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.050" end="00:29:18.500" style="s2">another way to put it is like if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.170" end="00:29:22.010" style="s2">making an assessment and deciding what</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.500" end="00:29:25.040" style="s2">to do and you have on the one hand the</p>
<p begin="00:29:22.010" end="00:29:27.560" style="s2">possibility of discomfort or that I</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.040" end="00:29:30.050" style="s2">might hurt how I see myself and my</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.560" end="00:29:32.540" style="s2">identity and myself you and the other</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.050" end="00:29:36.600" style="s2">hand you have that which you your heart</p>
<p begin="00:29:32.540" end="00:29:39.240" style="s2">knows it needs to do that what you</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.600" end="00:29:41.820" style="s2">like most called to do when your most</p>
<p begin="00:29:39.240" end="00:29:46.440" style="s2">honest with yourself like how do you</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.820" end="00:29:48.090" style="s2">increase the weight of that like make</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.440" end="00:29:50.730" style="s2">that be but have a much more powerful</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.090" end="00:29:52.890" style="s2">pull on you and decrease the weight that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.730" end="00:29:59.610" style="s2">your self view and your desires for</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.890" end="00:30:04.440" style="s2">comfort have on you and that seems like</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.610" end="00:30:06.810" style="s2">an endlessly good you know choice to</p>
<p begin="00:30:04.440" end="00:30:11.460" style="s2">make is anything that makes that have</p>
<p begin="00:30:06.810" end="00:30:13.860" style="s2">urine the other lighter and yeah it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:11.460" end="00:30:16.200" style="s2">it&#39;s easy it&#39;s easy to be fooled into</p>
<p begin="00:30:13.860" end="00:30:23.340" style="s2">thinking that we ought to wait and then</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.200" end="00:30:25.230" style="s2">our life becomes waiting this is cool I</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.340" end="00:30:27.690" style="s2">think I can loop us back down to where</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.230" end="00:30:32.460" style="s2">we started now to bring systems because</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.690" end="00:30:34.470" style="s2">I think well I think one of the insights</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.460" end="00:30:36.240" style="s2">of studying systems is systems sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:30:34.470" end="00:30:38.910" style="s2">have a tendency towards just homeostasis</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.240" end="00:30:41.970" style="s2">and staying in the same way of doing</p>
<p begin="00:30:38.910" end="00:30:43.560" style="s2">things not because it&#39;s necessarily the</p>
<p begin="00:30:41.970" end="00:30:45.300" style="s2">best way of doing it because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.560" end="00:30:46.740" style="s2">because it&#39;s the most energetically</p>
<p begin="00:30:45.300" end="00:30:48.690" style="s2">efficient way of doing things</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.740" end="00:30:50.450" style="s2">and that seems to be exactly what</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.690" end="00:30:52.740" style="s2">happens when you&#39;re in that position of</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.450" end="00:30:54.030" style="s2">knowing you want to go over here but</p>
<p begin="00:30:52.740" end="00:30:56.850" style="s2">you&#39;re here and it&#39;s comfortable here</p>
<p begin="00:30:54.030" end="00:30:59.550" style="s2">because going over here means as you</p>
<p begin="00:30:56.850" end="00:31:02.670" style="s2">said maybe it means sacrificing the</p>
<p begin="00:30:59.550" end="00:31:06.300" style="s2">appointment or the friendship groups or</p>
<p begin="00:31:02.670" end="00:31:11.190" style="s2">the relationship or the job with the</p>
<p begin="00:31:06.300" end="00:31:13.560" style="s2">Christie salary any number of things and</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.190" end="00:31:15.630" style="s2">although that sacrifice will actually</p>
<p begin="00:31:13.560" end="00:31:18.150" style="s2">open up something up here and I think</p>
<p begin="00:31:15.630" end="00:31:23.130" style="s2">that can be felt there&#39;s also just so</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.150" end="00:31:26.190" style="s2">much that just goes yeah but not it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.130" end="00:31:29.370" style="s2">exactly the same thing that plays out on</p>
<p begin="00:31:26.190" end="00:31:33.020" style="s2">the global scale when we say see global</p>
<p begin="00:31:29.370" end="00:31:37.890" style="s2">warming it&#39;s like well if we could just</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.020" end="00:31:39.300" style="s2">cut down total them yes like wouldn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.890" end="00:31:41.100" style="s2">solve everything but if we could</p>
<p begin="00:31:39.300" end="00:31:43.190" style="s2">actually all just pay lip service to the</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.100" end="00:31:44.269" style="s2">things that we think we should do</p>
<p begin="00:31:43.190" end="00:31:46.609" style="s2">everyone</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.269" end="00:31:48.589" style="s2">just like I don&#39;t know stop buying</p>
<p begin="00:31:46.609" end="00:31:50.299" style="s2">plastic because they could or at least</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.589" end="00:31:53.989" style="s2">massively cut down on plastic minutes</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.299" end="00:31:55.669" style="s2">convenient and that&#39;s the thing there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.989" end="00:31:58.369" style="s2">some times where I get a bit wound up</p>
<p begin="00:31:55.669" end="00:32:00.889" style="s2">with say the protest movement around</p>
<p begin="00:31:58.369" end="00:32:02.690" style="s2">their stuff because you can go and shout</p>
<p begin="00:32:00.889" end="00:32:04.820" style="s2">about it and then go back into just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:02.690" end="00:32:06.919" style="s2">same the same cycle of life but the</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.820" end="00:32:08.899" style="s2">thing is it&#39;s not even individuals fault</p>
<p begin="00:32:06.919" end="00:32:10.339" style="s2">because the systems themselves are again</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.899" end="00:32:12.409" style="s2">they&#39;re set up that way the systems are</p>
<p begin="00:32:10.339" end="00:32:13.909" style="s2">hard to change you have to go to work</p>
<p begin="00:32:12.409" end="00:32:15.289" style="s2">which means you have to get to work</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.909" end="00:32:16.999" style="s2">which means you have to consume energy</p>
<p begin="00:32:15.289" end="00:32:18.709" style="s2">to get to work and the most efficient</p>
<p begin="00:32:16.999" end="00:32:24.919" style="s2">way to do that is probably to use it</p>
<p begin="00:32:18.709" end="00:32:28.219" style="s2">petrol guzzling machine hmm but again I</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.919" end="00:32:31.129" style="s2">guess this is personal transformation</p>
<p begin="00:32:28.219" end="00:32:32.749" style="s2">right why I think it can be so key for</p>
<p begin="00:32:31.129" end="00:32:34.789" style="s2">this system level change because if on</p>
<p begin="00:32:32.749" end="00:32:38.989" style="s2">that micro level you can break the</p>
<p begin="00:32:34.789" end="00:32:40.519" style="s2">system and go there then that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.989" end="00:32:41.989" style="s2">presumably a skill that can be learned</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.519" end="00:32:46.099" style="s2">and the next time you want to break out</p>
<p begin="00:32:41.989" end="00:32:49.149" style="s2">there and go there it&#39;s 2% easier yes</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.099" end="00:32:51.379" style="s2">and I mean now I&#39;m starting to think of</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.149" end="00:32:53.869" style="s2">this reminds me of Jordan green Hall</p>
<p begin="00:32:51.379" end="00:32:55.070" style="s2">right among me I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:53.869" end="00:32:56.419" style="s2">spoken about it he must have done</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.070" end="00:32:58.429" style="s2">explicitly that&#39;s why I&#39;m thinking about</p>
<p begin="00:32:56.419" end="00:32:59.869" style="s2">it but like learning to learn or</p>
<p begin="00:32:58.429" end="00:33:05.320" style="s2">learning to get better at learning</p>
<p begin="00:32:59.869" end="00:33:08.119" style="s2">learning that cycle yes yeah yeah yeah</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.320" end="00:33:10.219" style="s2">yeah I mean that that I think we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.119" end="00:33:14.599" style="s2">hitting upon one of the fundamental ways</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.219" end="00:33:18.979" style="s2">of looking at what this possible form of</p>
<p begin="00:33:14.599" end="00:33:23.299" style="s2">Education that I want to create should</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.979" end="00:33:25.570" style="s2">do right where it dampens and uninstalls</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.299" end="00:33:27.879" style="s2">that which keeps us in this homeostatic</p>
<p begin="00:33:25.570" end="00:33:33.379" style="s2">relationship with the larger system and</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.879" end="00:33:36.409" style="s2">amplifies increases the the courage the</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.379" end="00:33:38.839" style="s2">call of the world and our heart to</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.409" end="00:33:41.419" style="s2">become that which we must be in order to</p>
<p begin="00:33:38.839" end="00:33:44.810" style="s2">step forth as heroes of our time right</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.419" end="00:33:47.240" style="s2">and so whatever we can do</p>
<p begin="00:33:44.810" end="00:33:49.970" style="s2">simplify that and down regulate the</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.240" end="00:33:54.620" style="s2">other like that seems like a simple</p>
<p begin="00:33:49.970" end="00:33:56.990" style="s2">version of what I&#39;m I&#39;m wanting and I</p>
<p begin="00:33:54.620" end="00:33:58.970" style="s2">remember when I had my first</p>
<p begin="00:33:56.990" end="00:34:00.890" style="s2">conversation with the teacher at the</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.970" end="00:34:05.330" style="s2">monastic Academy his name is sore you</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.890" end="00:34:08.060" style="s2">for all and I talked to me about what</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.330" end="00:34:10.520" style="s2">the vision for the organization was and</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.060" end="00:34:13.100" style="s2">part of it was that we could create a</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.520" end="00:34:17.780" style="s2">mutually reinforcing feedback loop</p>
<p begin="00:34:13.100" end="00:34:21.409" style="s2">between wisdom love and power right and</p>
<p begin="00:34:17.780" end="00:34:24.710" style="s2">so the idea here would be that somehow</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.409" end="00:34:27.020" style="s2">those who are wise and loving would also</p>
<p begin="00:34:24.710" end="00:34:29.630" style="s2">get power in a world that in our system</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.020" end="00:34:32.270" style="s2">and part of that is a part of power is</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.630" end="00:34:34.130" style="s2">gathering resources right getting</p>
<p begin="00:34:32.270" end="00:34:36.110" style="s2">resources and specifically in our world</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.130" end="00:34:39.770" style="s2">today that means mostly money money and</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.110" end="00:34:41.330" style="s2">attention money and so you know part of</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.770" end="00:34:42.740" style="s2">the ideal is like okay what how do like</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.330" end="00:34:44.690" style="s2">what&#39;s the business model of such a</p>
<p begin="00:34:42.740" end="00:34:47.720" style="s2">place like how do we gather resources</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.690" end="00:34:51.470" style="s2">and I said to him I remember on a first</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.720" end="00:34:54.550" style="s2">call I said well like what if there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.470" end="00:34:59.740" style="s2">way to get resources without</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.550" end="00:35:05.030" style="s2">compromising your integrity and he said</p>
<p begin="00:34:59.740" end="00:35:07.460" style="s2">if the world is not willing if if the</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.030" end="00:35:10.880" style="s2">world is not willing to give me what I</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.460" end="00:35:15.040" style="s2">need to live my vow then I&#39;ll just sit</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.880" end="00:35:19.100" style="s2">down and die right that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.040" end="00:35:21.160" style="s2">uncompromising integrity like totally</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.100" end="00:35:25.580" style="s2">dedicated to what he knew was right</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.160" end="00:35:27.710" style="s2">totally unwilling to just like give it</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.580" end="00:35:31.700" style="s2">an inch and then perhaps give it a mile</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.710" end="00:35:33.830" style="s2">later that was I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.700" end="00:35:35.690" style="s2">always pragmatically like always the</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.830" end="00:35:38.000" style="s2">best way of looking at things but it</p>
<p begin="00:35:35.690" end="00:35:40.760" style="s2">really called to my my heart and really</p>
<p begin="00:35:38.000" end="00:35:44.990" style="s2">like inspired me and I just so</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.760" end="00:35:47.240" style="s2">appreciate that capacity and it just</p>
<p begin="00:35:44.990" end="00:35:50.060" style="s2">seems like from where I&#39;m sitting that</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.240" end="00:35:55.070" style="s2">that that capacity whatever that is it</p>
<p begin="00:35:50.060" end="00:35:58.760" style="s2">was courage integrity that&#39;s what we</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.070" end="00:36:00.890" style="s2">need more of and in this world going for</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.760" end="00:36:03.500" style="s2">I think there&#39;s something really</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.890" end="00:36:06.530" style="s2">beautiful about the idea of holding your</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.500" end="00:36:09.440" style="s2">ground on something and actually like</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.530" end="00:36:12.500" style="s2">digging in and saying no this is my line</p>
<p begin="00:36:09.440" end="00:36:15.410" style="s2">I think you know I wonder if it speaks</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.500" end="00:36:17.660" style="s2">to trust as men in particular like</p>
<p begin="00:36:15.410" end="00:36:21.290" style="s2">warriors who once upon a time would have</p>
<p begin="00:36:17.660" end="00:36:25.550" style="s2">been called to fight and to defend</p>
<p begin="00:36:21.290" end="00:36:27.260" style="s2">territory and now I think it&#39;s a good</p>
<p begin="00:36:25.550" end="00:36:29.780" style="s2">thing that we don&#39;t have these wars</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.260" end="00:36:33.230" style="s2">because we had big scale Wars now we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.780" end="00:36:37.550" style="s2">just annihilate ourselves but that that</p>
<p begin="00:36:33.230" end="00:36:40.430" style="s2">exists within us still that will to to</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.550" end="00:36:42.830" style="s2">defend and to to be willing to sacrifice</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.430" end="00:36:44.390" style="s2">for something and it doesn&#39;t just have</p>
<p begin="00:36:42.830" end="00:36:46.010" style="s2">to beat men really I don&#39;t have to</p>
<p begin="00:36:44.390" end="00:36:53.300" style="s2">exclude women from this but I just</p>
<p begin="00:36:46.010" end="00:36:56.869" style="s2">wonder if because men historically have</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.300" end="00:36:58.250" style="s2">been the Warriors to fighters maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:56.869" end="00:37:00.260" style="s2">because I feel it really speaking when</p>
<p begin="00:36:58.250" end="00:37:00.530" style="s2">you&#39;re speaking now is like yes I like</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.260" end="00:37:04.280" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.530" end="00:37:06.260" style="s2">mmm I mean maybe there&#39;ll be chicks</p>
<p begin="00:37:04.280" end="00:37:08.570" style="s2">listening to this and they&#39;ll say yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:37:06.260" end="00:37:10.760" style="s2">want to dig in and yet dig in like we</p>
<p begin="00:37:08.570" end="00:37:13.900" style="s2">don&#39;t have to be exclusive the point is</p>
<p begin="00:37:10.760" end="00:37:15.490" style="s2">on that yeah</p>
<p begin="00:37:13.900" end="00:37:17.320" style="s2">digging it fine</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.490" end="00:37:19.780" style="s2">not thing that&#39;s worth holding to as</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.320" end="00:37:21.190" style="s2">well yes yeah well that&#39;s thick that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:37:19.780" end="00:37:23.710" style="s2">the key right because you could date</p>
<p begin="00:37:21.190" end="00:37:26.200" style="s2">people dig in all the time could they</p>
<p begin="00:37:23.710" end="00:37:33.910" style="s2">dig in to protect that which ought not</p>
<p begin="00:37:26.200" end="00:37:38.200" style="s2">be protected yeah difference yeah it</p>
<p begin="00:37:33.910" end="00:37:40.240" style="s2">sure is it&#39;s like what how do we find</p>
<p begin="00:37:38.200" end="00:37:42.880" style="s2">what is worth fighting over</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.240" end="00:37:43.630" style="s2">yes what is worth fighting for was worth</p>
<p begin="00:37:42.880" end="00:37:46.450" style="s2">dying for</p>
<p begin="00:37:43.630" end="00:37:50.070" style="s2">right what is worth dying for what would</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.450" end="00:37:50.070" style="s2">you be willing to stake your life on</p>
<p begin="00:37:50.160" end="00:37:53.430" style="s2">and that for me is such like I can even</p>
<p begin="00:37:51.780" end="00:37:55.410" style="s2">feel as I say that question like my body</p>
<p begin="00:37:53.430" end="00:37:57.349" style="s2">kind of like resonates like I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.410" end="00:38:01.530" style="s2">some kind of attunements kind of</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.349" end="00:38:05.130" style="s2">residents there I think for me there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:01.530" end="00:38:07.390" style="s2">such a deep desire to give myself to</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.130" end="00:38:12.190" style="s2">something more than me</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.390" end="00:38:14.770" style="s2">and the problem is that so many so much</p>
<p begin="00:38:12.190" end="00:38:16.980" style="s2">of the world that is asking us to give</p>
<p begin="00:38:14.770" end="00:38:20.260" style="s2">ourselves to kind of sacrifice ourselves</p>
<p begin="00:38:16.980" end="00:38:22.240" style="s2">it&#39;s for totally bankrupt and moral</p>
<p begin="00:38:20.260" end="00:38:25.210" style="s2">reasons you know give yourself for the</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.240" end="00:38:27.820" style="s2">good of the company no you shouldn&#39;t do</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.210" end="00:38:30.580" style="s2">that you shouldn&#39;t do that it&#39;s a bad</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.820" end="00:38:32.260" style="s2">trade but there are such things that are</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.580" end="00:38:35.410" style="s2">worth giving your life to we know that</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.260" end="00:38:36.790" style="s2">and like it is worth doing whatever it</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.410" end="00:38:38.380" style="s2">takes to find that and then give</p>
<p begin="00:38:36.790" end="00:38:41.800" style="s2">yourself completely to it at least</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.380" end="00:38:44.020" style="s2">that&#39;s how I with my life and it strikes</p>
<p begin="00:38:41.800" end="00:38:46.800" style="s2">me that that itself can be a spiritual</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.020" end="00:38:49.330" style="s2">part of the spiritual discipline I think</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.800" end="00:38:52.150" style="s2">yeah Thomas Merton there&#39;s a great line</p>
<p begin="00:38:49.330" end="00:38:53.680" style="s2">is that he is like a something he I</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.150" end="00:38:57.940" style="s2">think he opens his meditation with his</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.680" end="00:39:00.120" style="s2">places that none of me belongs to anyone</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.940" end="00:39:03.070" style="s2">but you</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.120" end="00:39:05.530" style="s2">he&#39;s talking to God in this case he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.070" end="00:39:11.790" style="s2">gone there&#39;s something in that this</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.530" end="00:39:16.630" style="s2">willingness to give it all away that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.790" end="00:39:20.050" style="s2">such a shift from thinking that I belong</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.630" end="00:39:23.950" style="s2">to me and my purpose is to satisfy those</p>
<p begin="00:39:20.050" end="00:39:27.680" style="s2">whom is the pertain and pop up yeah I</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.950" end="00:39:30.349" style="s2">know like we bill</p>
<p begin="00:39:27.680" end="00:39:31.790" style="s2">to that which is beyond and a simple way</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.349" end="00:39:33.440" style="s2">to just check in with that and really</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.790" end="00:39:35.030" style="s2">make it obvious I think it&#39;s just to</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.440" end="00:39:37.550" style="s2">remind yourself that all the little bits</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.030" end="00:39:40.099" style="s2">of matter in our bodies but the hair</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.550" end="00:39:41.660" style="s2">before either of us came into being as</p>
<p begin="00:39:40.099" end="00:39:44.720" style="s2">consciousnesses and will be there after</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.660" end="00:39:50.390" style="s2">we die and we kind of on loan from the</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.720" end="00:39:59.359" style="s2">universe mm-hmm yeah did yeah yeah and</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.390" end="00:40:01.609" style="s2">you know I love that there&#39;s yes and it</p>
<p begin="00:39:59.359" end="00:40:04.160" style="s2">seems from where I&#39;m sitting that it</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.609" end="00:40:07.730" style="s2">takes a hell of a lot of work to embody</p>
<p begin="00:40:04.160" end="00:40:08.900" style="s2">that what you just said to really embody</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.730" end="00:40:09.980" style="s2">that as because of all the things we</p>
<p begin="00:40:08.900" end="00:40:13.369" style="s2">were just talking about right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.980" end="00:40:17.150" style="s2">like it seems like again from where I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:40:13.369" end="00:40:18.589" style="s2">sitting and that the whole of the world</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.150" end="00:40:21.880" style="s2">the whole of the human world were</p>
<p begin="00:40:18.589" end="00:40:25.480" style="s2">participating in more or less is</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.880" end="00:40:29.960" style="s2">attempting to affirm the opposite of</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.480" end="00:40:32.930" style="s2">that and I think it&#39;s important that</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.960" end="00:40:37.760" style="s2">we&#39;d be clear about the almost like</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.930" end="00:40:44.089" style="s2">Herculean task of totally leaving that</p>
<p begin="00:40:37.760" end="00:40:49.280" style="s2">and giving it away as very not that is</p>
<p begin="00:40:44.089" end="00:40:51.349" style="s2">not easy to fool ourselves is very easy</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.280" end="00:40:54.319" style="s2">to fool ourselves hey I was going to say</p>
<p begin="00:40:51.349" end="00:40:57.079" style="s2">this again I have fooled myself over and</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.319" end="00:41:02.589" style="s2">over and over again I&#39;m a servant of</p>
<p begin="00:40:57.079" end="00:41:02.589" style="s2">peace and God now yeah by the way</p>
<p begin="00:41:02.980" end="00:41:09.349" style="s2">tweeted about it or I posted on my</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.119" end="00:41:11.839" style="s2">facebook you know it&#39;s like yeah I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:09.349" end="00:41:14.390" style="s2">I&#39;ve seen a lot of Facebook posts like</p>

<p begin="00:41:14.390" end="00:41:19.069" style="s2">communities and this there&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.970" end="00:41:21.859" style="s2">sweet about it but also something just</p>
<p begin="00:41:19.069" end="00:41:25.339" style="s2">like I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to make a</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.859" end="00:41:27.680" style="s2">post about it yeah well again you know</p>
<p begin="00:41:25.339" end="00:41:30.650" style="s2">whenever you&#39;re posting something you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.680" end="00:41:33.020" style="s2">participating in the information ecology</p>
<p begin="00:41:30.650" end="00:41:35.180" style="s2">of the world and you gotta be I think</p>
<p begin="00:41:33.020" end="00:41:37.760" style="s2">for me I consider all these things to be</p>
<p begin="00:41:35.180" end="00:41:39.980" style="s2">very very sacred very very important and</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.760" end="00:41:41.010" style="s2">so I attempt to be very thoughtful and</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.980" end="00:41:42.960" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.010" end="00:41:45.840" style="s2">the rules that I have for myself is that</p>
<p begin="00:41:42.960" end="00:41:50.540" style="s2">I will never say anything in a public</p>
<p begin="00:41:45.840" end="00:41:55.410" style="s2">forum that is not my actual experience</p>
<p begin="00:41:50.540" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">and I try to stay true to that I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.410" end="00:41:58.880" style="s2">know if other people have that same</p>
<p begin="00:41:59.660" end="00:42:04.590" style="s2">principle in terms of how they speak</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.070" end="00:42:08.220" style="s2">about these things and that&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:42:04.590" end="00:42:09.990" style="s2">that again the teachers or you this</p>
<p begin="00:42:08.220" end="00:42:13.980" style="s2">drills into us he&#39;s like do not be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:09.990" end="00:42:15.960" style="s2">hypocrite do not be a hypocrite</p>
<p begin="00:42:13.980" end="00:42:17.970" style="s2">the spiritual like these are the one</p>
<p begin="00:42:15.960" end="00:42:20.070" style="s2">things that you really should not be a</p>
<p begin="00:42:17.970" end="00:42:22.070" style="s2">hypocrite because that&#39;s how we&#39;d to</p>
<p begin="00:42:20.070" end="00:42:24.060" style="s2">base the the kind of currency of debt</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.070" end="00:42:25.740" style="s2">everybody&#39;s saying oh yes everything&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.060" end="00:42:34.170" style="s2">perfect I&#39;m a servant of God</p>
<p begin="00:42:25.740" end="00:42:35.790" style="s2">oh yes really the only thing I tack on</p>
<p begin="00:42:34.170" end="00:42:41.970" style="s2">to that is what if like you&#39;re trying</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.790" end="00:42:44.190" style="s2">out ideas yeah is because I think like</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.970" end="00:42:46.320" style="s2">often when I&#39;m engaging on Twitter for</p>
<p begin="00:42:44.190" end="00:42:49.440" style="s2">example there&#39;s a kind of speculation a</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.320" end="00:42:54.330" style="s2">kind of playful creativity to it mm-hmm</p>
<p begin="00:42:49.440" end="00:42:56.160" style="s2">but I think well I guess what has to</p>

<p begin="00:43:00.630" end="00:43:03.300" style="s2">like if I&#39;m saying something and some</p>

<p begin="00:43:03.300" end="00:43:07.920" style="s2">conversation about it rather than being</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.619" end="00:43:10.460" style="s2">wedded to something so purely that it</p>
<p begin="00:43:07.920" end="00:43:10.460" style="s2">can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:43:11.280" end="00:43:17.820" style="s2">go of mm-hmm yeah I want to come up with</p>

<p begin="00:43:24.150" end="00:43:29.510" style="s2">like this is a provisional frame or way</p>
<p begin="00:43:27.030" end="00:43:32.880" style="s2">of seeing that I am playing with and</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.510" end="00:43:34.470" style="s2">then you say what you say he is then</p>
