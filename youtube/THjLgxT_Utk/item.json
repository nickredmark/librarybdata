    "title": "Cultural Decentralisation and Spiritual Class Structure",
    "description": "This is part 2 of our conversation with Daniel Thorson. We explore: the end of liberal humanism as a political and personal philosophy; confronting pain and escaping entrapment in oneâ€™s feelings; how times of collapse open a space for new leaders to step forwards; the spiritual class structure (for instance, an elite with money, education, time and exposure to top teachers and traditions, a middle class practicing yoga and reading Eckhart Tolle and other spiritual bestsellers, and a lower class dabbling in astrology and crystals); how cultural decentralization and the ability to access information online creates the illusion that we can learn everything online, preventing access to (and even awareness of) wisdom that can only be imparted via human transmission; how contemporary culture conditions us to advertise our superiority, in the form of CVs, qualifications etc.; and the value of being in service to something higher than yourself. \n\nDaniel can be found here\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dthorson\n\nAnd his excellent Emerge podcast here\n\nhttp://www.whatisemerging.com/emergepodcast\n\nFind the Monastic Academy here\n\nhttps://www.monasticacademy.com/",
