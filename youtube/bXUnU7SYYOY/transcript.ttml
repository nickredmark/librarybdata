<p begin="00:01:10.409" end="00:01:14.189" style="s2">today on being actually autistic but I</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.630" end="00:01:18.240" style="s2">want to put a little more thought into</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.189" end="00:01:20.670" style="s2">that one and make some notes and because</p>
<p begin="00:01:18.240" end="00:01:22.979" style="s2">I got into a discussion debate this</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.670" end="00:01:25.770" style="s2">morning with someone who was a mom to an</p>
<p begin="00:01:22.979" end="00:01:28.170" style="s2">autistic boy and talking about the like</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.770" end="00:01:29.909" style="s2">hashtag actually autistic and one of the</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.170" end="00:01:31.799" style="s2">things was like self diagnosis is not</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.909" end="00:01:35.040" style="s2">okay it&#39;s dangerous and I was like well</p>
<p begin="00:01:31.799" end="00:01:38.460" style="s2">actually and so I want to talk about my</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.040" end="00:01:42.060" style="s2">self diagnosis and why I think self</p>
<p begin="00:01:38.460" end="00:01:43.590" style="s2">diagnosis is empowering and right and I</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.060" end="00:01:45.060" style="s2">don&#39;t just feel that way about autism I</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.590" end="00:01:48.060" style="s2">feel that way about basically anything</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.060" end="00:01:49.920" style="s2">that is considered if you&#39;re just gonna</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.060" end="00:01:52.229" style="s2">check off symptoms in order to diagnose</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.920" end="00:01:53.880" style="s2">someone why can&#39;t the person do it</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.229" end="00:01:56.909" style="s2">themselves I know that flies in the face</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.880" end="00:01:58.619" style="s2">of our medical expertise and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.909" end="00:02:00.420" style="s2">hierarchy doctors just to have over our</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.619" end="00:02:02.969" style="s2">lives and over our diagnosis ease and</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.420" end="00:02:05.579" style="s2">yes that is what I intend to do that is</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.969" end="00:02:07.380" style="s2">absolutely I plan on putting more power</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.579" end="00:02:07.979" style="s2">back in the hands of patients over our</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.380" end="00:02:10.170" style="s2">own bodies</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.979" end="00:02:12.630" style="s2">that doesn&#39;t mean discounting doctors</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.170" end="00:02:14.640" style="s2">but it does mean flipping the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.630" end="00:02:16.620" style="s2">because a doctor said it when they can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.640" end="00:02:20.000" style="s2">even all agree which is whatever that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.620" end="00:02:23.250" style="s2">a whole I was also gonna this week do a</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.000" end="00:02:25.250" style="s2">welcome to my brain video this is my</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.250" end="00:02:28.440" style="s2">brain story this is its journey this is</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.250" end="00:02:29.760" style="s2">what I can and can&#39;t do and I will also</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.440" end="00:02:32.340" style="s2">be doing that one in the next week</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.760" end="00:02:33.510" style="s2">hopefully I also want to put more</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.340" end="00:02:37.710" style="s2">thought into that they&#39;re very tied</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.510" end="00:02:40.580" style="s2">together having but the co-operative</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.710" end="00:02:42.510" style="s2">itself I feel like for the first time I</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.580" end="00:02:43.920" style="s2">was talking about this at dinner the</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.510" end="00:02:46.020" style="s2">other day I&#39;m like I&#39;m so happy my</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.920" end="00:02:50.400" style="s2">youtube channels getting actual like</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.020" end="00:02:53.460" style="s2">comments my subscribers went up by 10</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.400" end="00:02:55.230" style="s2">which when you&#39;re in I had it at 24 so</p>
<p begin="00:02:53.460" end="00:02:57.780" style="s2">long and then finally this last week I</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.230" end="00:03:01.160" style="s2">got like 10 which is like a 30% increase</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.780" end="00:03:04.110" style="s2">and is amazing I mean even gotten 13</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.160" end="00:03:06.390" style="s2">whatever that&#39;s not the point the point</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.110" end="00:03:10.230" style="s2">is is to allow myself to be happy even</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.390" end="00:03:12.330" style="s2">with that not to tie my sense of self in</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.230" end="00:03:14.010" style="s2">any way towards how much traction I am</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.330" end="00:03:15.750" style="s2">getting on social media with this idea</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.010" end="00:03:18.650" style="s2">because I get that social media</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.750" end="00:03:22.080" style="s2">platforms aren&#39;t designed to create a</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.650" end="00:03:24.390" style="s2">world-changing idea they&#39;re designed to</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.080" end="00:03:28.350" style="s2">have one go viral if you have it in a</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.390" end="00:03:29.640" style="s2">perfect presentable package maybe but</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.350" end="00:03:32.640" style="s2">even then they&#39;re not designed to have</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.640" end="00:03:34.320" style="s2">people sign up for it be a part of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.640" end="00:03:35.750" style="s2">and that is what we are doing we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.320" end="00:03:39.180" style="s2">going to create the global cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.750" end="00:03:41.250" style="s2">that focuses on creating the technology</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.180" end="00:03:43.709" style="s2">we need to collaborate focuses on the</p>

<p begin="00:03:54.600" end="00:03:58.620" style="s2">that&#39;s brainstorming tech solutions that</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.030" end="00:04:01.560" style="s2">actually like I&#39;m not eating healthy</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.620" end="00:04:03.110" style="s2">well there&#39;s you can have there&#39;s nearly</p>

<p begin="00:04:03.110" end="00:04:07.110" style="s2">focusing on which ones are gonna impact</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.190" end="00:04:08.730" style="s2">most people focusing on which ones you</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.110" end="00:04:11.040" style="s2">want to co-create together with other</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.730" end="00:04:13.350" style="s2">people is what we&#39;re gonna be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.040" end="00:04:14.940" style="s2">give people and then even in that one</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.350" end="00:04:18.620" style="s2">area of being able to eat better and</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.940" end="00:04:22.140" style="s2">having access to better food we all get</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.620" end="00:04:23.970" style="s2">access to most of the solutions that are</p>
<p begin="00:04:22.140" end="00:04:25.110" style="s2">created some of the solutions might</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.970" end="00:04:25.990" style="s2">decide that they don&#39;t want other people</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.110" end="00:04:27.190" style="s2">in them they</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.990" end="00:04:28.990" style="s2">only want the people who co-created it</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.190" end="00:04:32.050" style="s2">together but most of them will be yeah</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.990" end="00:04:34.030" style="s2">we created this come on board bring we</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.050" end="00:04:37.300" style="s2">don&#39;t want to keep diluting our efforts</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.030" end="00:04:38.620" style="s2">so if we create a food app we don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.300" end="00:04:40.330" style="s2">everyone to have to create a food app</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.620" end="00:04:41.650" style="s2">we&#39;re not gonna spend our pool of money</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.330" end="00:04:44.050" style="s2">on that we&#39;re not gonna spend our pool</p>
<p begin="00:04:41.650" end="00:04:46.509" style="s2">brainpower on that but having one and</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.050" end="00:04:49.020" style="s2">then having um add-ons that we can add</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.509" end="00:04:51.580" style="s2">that are more niche that are more um</p>
<p begin="00:04:49.020" end="00:04:52.810" style="s2">like we want one pool of recipes we</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.580" end="00:04:54.960" style="s2">don&#39;t want each one to have to redo</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.810" end="00:04:59.919" style="s2">every recipe we want one pool of</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.960" end="00:05:02.710" style="s2">information when you input products yet</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.919" end="00:05:04.210" style="s2">we can still have it have individual and</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.710" end="00:05:04.900" style="s2">yeah I&#39;m gonna explain that right now</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.210" end="00:05:15.970" style="s2">because coffee</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.900" end="00:05:17.740" style="s2">I am excited by the idea of this thing</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.970" end="00:05:19.210" style="s2">going somewhere no mic I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.740" end="00:05:21.750" style="s2">it for a really long time but I&#39;ve had</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.210" end="00:05:24.479" style="s2">the feeling that once I was able to</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.750" end="00:05:26.620" style="s2">focus on the YouTube channel</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.479" end="00:05:29.139" style="s2">authentically without it being something</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.620" end="00:05:30.909" style="s2">that I felt forced to do and that has</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.139" end="00:05:35.050" style="s2">now occurred like I&#39;m like okay postie</p>

<p begin="00:06:11.919" end="00:06:15.759" style="s2">we are going to design one to do but I</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.139" end="00:06:17.919" style="s2">can use it to the best of my ability and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.759" end="00:06:19.719" style="s2">it is fairly good I&#39;ve been using</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.919" end="00:06:22.509" style="s2">periscope and I&#39;ve enjoyed that but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:19.719" end="00:06:23.949" style="s2">not like people watch the replay and</p>

<p begin="00:06:42.340" end="00:06:47.560" style="s2">create this idea and more people hear</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.490" end="00:06:49.360" style="s2">about it and want to come and be a part</p>
<p begin="00:06:47.560" end="00:06:52.270" style="s2">of it even if I don&#39;t currently know</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.360" end="00:06:53.890" style="s2">what that looks like I&#39;d like someone oh</p>

<p begin="00:06:53.890" end="00:07:00.220" style="s2">an update it&#39;s a great update um someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.710" end="00:07:02.290" style="s2">is creating a website for me I&#39;ve said</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.220" end="00:07:06.850" style="s2">it on several videos but why not explain</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.290" end="00:07:08.380" style="s2">it during a weekly update one that I put</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.850" end="00:07:10.300" style="s2">an ad on Craigslist saying like I need</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.380" end="00:07:12.930" style="s2">someone to make my Wix website into a</p>
<p begin="00:07:10.300" end="00:07:16.180" style="s2">WordPress one I don&#39;t have money and</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.930" end="00:07:19.930" style="s2">there&#39;s a bit of my vision and so she is</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.180" end="00:07:22.090" style="s2">creating that she&#39;s creating it for free</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.930" end="00:07:23.530" style="s2">which is amazing it goes there&#39;s an</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.090" end="00:07:27.280" style="s2">alignment with everything we are doing</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.530" end="00:07:30.720" style="s2">together tapping into what people are</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.280" end="00:07:33.940" style="s2">here to do often requires less payment</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.720" end="00:07:36.430" style="s2">every time requires less payment than</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.940" end="00:07:39.010" style="s2">creating something that people need to</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.430" end="00:07:42.490" style="s2">get payment for the incentive of money</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.010" end="00:07:44.380" style="s2">for work is a incentive it is not the</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.490" end="00:07:48.010" style="s2">only one and it&#39;s not even the best one</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.380" end="00:07:51.340" style="s2">for most people and I&#39;ve also I wrote</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.010" end="00:07:54.550" style="s2">the FA cues that a lot of people have</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.340" end="00:07:56.680" style="s2">commented on things in the last few</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.550" end="00:07:58.360" style="s2">weeks and ongoing that were the same</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.680" end="00:08:00.130" style="s2">they bring up the same issues again and</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.360" end="00:08:01.870" style="s2">again so I&#39;m like okay that was the idea</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.130" end="00:08:03.100" style="s2">of having the FAQ on the website but</p>
<p begin="00:08:01.870" end="00:08:05.230" style="s2">I&#39;ve never actually written enough that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.100" end="00:08:06.610" style="s2">just says hey please submit questions</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.230" end="00:08:08.320" style="s2">and no one has submitted them in that</p>
<p begin="00:08:06.610" end="00:08:10.600" style="s2">format but they have submitted them</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.320" end="00:08:12.730" style="s2">online as I&#39;ve talked about it I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.600" end="00:08:14.380" style="s2">saying hey like I tell you the many</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.730" end="00:08:16.690" style="s2">amount of times but like tech is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.380" end="00:08:21.220" style="s2">problem not the solution I&#39;m like we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.690" end="00:08:23.620" style="s2">on tech having that conversation so</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.220" end="00:08:26.290" style="s2">what&#39;s the option we let it continue as</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.620" end="00:08:28.330" style="s2">it is week or whatever that&#39;ll be in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.290" end="00:08:31.780" style="s2">FAQ so I&#39;m gonna try doing videos on</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:34.360" style="s2">each of the FAQ s so that one there&#39;s I</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.780" end="00:08:36.430" style="s2">can put that on the website itself if</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.360" end="00:08:41.830" style="s2">people would rather watch a video as I</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.430" end="00:08:43.870" style="s2">often would um and also just so they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.830" end="00:08:46.900" style="s2">on video people never want to go to the</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.870" end="00:08:49.720" style="s2">website they can see what the what</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.900" end="00:08:51.160" style="s2">videos to watch that more topic yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.720" end="00:08:52.540" style="s2">I decided I was giving the center ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.160" end="00:08:53.320" style="s2">minutes I don&#39;t ramble the last ten</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.540" end="00:08:58.000" style="s2">minutes if this one</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.320" end="00:09:01.090" style="s2">a non live video I would redo it</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.000" end="00:09:03.640" style="s2">and keep it to two minutes but it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.090" end="00:09:07.390" style="s2">and it is what it is right now and I</p>
