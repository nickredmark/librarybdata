<p begin="00:00:08.400" end="00:00:12.660" style="s2">good to see you again David so just a</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.920" end="00:00:15.210" style="s2">little bit of backstory we&#39;ve been</p>
<p begin="00:00:12.660" end="00:00:19.050" style="s2">putting out a few pieces recently with</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.210" end="00:00:21.390" style="s2">Brett Weinstein a lot to do with his</p>
<p begin="00:00:19.050" end="00:00:25.230" style="s2">discussion with Richard Dawkins in</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.390" end="00:00:27.359" style="s2">Chicago where he I think the consensus</p>
<p begin="00:00:25.230" end="00:00:30.660" style="s2">is that he certainly challenged Dawkins</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.359" end="00:00:33.000" style="s2">pretty solidly on his sort of new</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.660" end="00:00:34.350" style="s2">atheist dismissal of religion a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.000" end="00:00:36.390" style="s2">people seem to have been persuaded by</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.350" end="00:00:38.579" style="s2">that and then another couple of pieces</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.390" end="00:00:40.920" style="s2">as well where he was reflecting on the</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.579" end="00:00:43.890" style="s2">sam harris and jordan peterson debates i</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.920" end="00:00:46.500" style="s2">am really interested so often after that</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.890" end="00:00:48.510" style="s2">you got in touch with me to say let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:00:46.500" end="00:00:49.800" style="s2">catch up because i know we both think</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.510" end="00:00:53.399" style="s2">that this conversation is really really</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.800" end="00:00:55.379" style="s2">important and why did you get in touch</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.399" end="00:00:57.059" style="s2">what what what did you feel sort of</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.379" end="00:01:00.210" style="s2">watching those brett those interviews</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.059" end="00:01:01.649" style="s2">with brett well I think that the I think</p>
<p begin="00:01:00.210" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">it&#39;s very anyway I&#39;m very happy that</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.649" end="00:01:05.790" style="s2">that discussion with Dawkins happened</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:08.850" style="s2">but I think I&#39;m left kind of a bit I</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.790" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">would say not frustrated or feeling like</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.850" end="00:01:14.250" style="s2">this isn&#39;t going far enough and the</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:15.330" style="s2">sense that I get from Brett because I</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.250" end="00:01:17.340" style="s2">listened to the interviews that you did</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.330" end="00:01:19.290" style="s2">with him is the same impression that I</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.340" end="00:01:20.850" style="s2">got when I had a discussion with him in</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.290" end="00:01:24.840" style="s2">Vancouver about was a year and a half</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.850" end="00:01:27.590" style="s2">ago now um is that he views religion</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.840" end="00:01:29.520" style="s2">let&#39;s say as a series of heuristic</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.590" end="00:01:32.579" style="s2">formulations that you could call the</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.520" end="00:01:35.130" style="s2">rules that if you follow them then you</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.579" end="00:01:37.950" style="s2">have a better chance to survive let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.130" end="00:01:40.950" style="s2">say but I think what&#39;s missing is to</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.950" end="00:01:42.600" style="s2">understand just how deep religion what</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.950" end="00:01:44.909" style="s2">religion is addressing is not so much a</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.600" end="00:01:48.000" style="s2">bunch of rules but is rather structural</p>
<p begin="00:01:44.909" end="00:01:50.759" style="s2">that is it is it is representing the</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.000" end="00:01:52.560" style="s2">very structure of reality in the manner</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.759" end="00:01:55.229" style="s2">in which consciousness engages with</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.560" end="00:01:58.350" style="s2">reality and so it&#39;s a far deeper issue</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.229" end="00:02:00.810" style="s2">that&#39;s we&#39;re dealing with and so when I</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.350" end="00:02:02.549" style="s2">hear Rhett saying things like you know</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.810" end="00:02:04.409" style="s2">we can&#39;t rely on these old texts because</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.549" end="00:02:05.369" style="s2">you know they&#39;re all dated and they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.409" end="00:02:06.930" style="s2">talking about things that aren&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:02:05.369" end="00:02:08.879" style="s2">relevant it&#39;s because he&#39;s looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:06.930" end="00:02:11.129" style="s2">the surface rules he&#39;s looking at the</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.879" end="00:02:12.930" style="s2">surface details but he&#39;s not looking at</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.129" end="00:02:13.470" style="s2">the patterns of behavior and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.930" end="00:02:15.540" style="s2">patterns</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.470" end="00:02:17.100" style="s2">in the stories and in the rituals which</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.540" end="00:02:20.670" style="s2">are there to rather do things like</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.100" end="00:02:22.710" style="s2">establish space establish time establish</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.670" end="00:02:26.070" style="s2">hierarchy establish our relationships to</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.710" end="00:02:27.750" style="s2">others within a unity and so all of that</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.070" end="00:02:31.350" style="s2">is really what religion is dealing with</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.750" end="00:02:33.150" style="s2">I guess you&#39;d you&#39;d agree that he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.350" end="00:02:35.580" style="s2">going further than someone like Sam</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.150" end="00:02:38.790" style="s2">Harris was for example I think so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.580" end="00:02:41.040" style="s2">think that Brett is able to see at least</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.790" end="00:02:42.780" style="s2">the utility of religion or at least a</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.040" end="00:02:44.550" style="s2">utility that religion religion has had</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.780" end="00:02:47.190" style="s2">in the past and so that&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.550" end="00:02:49.320" style="s2">something that he wants to offer up to</p>
<p begin="00:02:47.190" end="00:02:50.910" style="s2">religious people hoping in a way that</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.320" end="00:02:54.540" style="s2">then religious people will feel less</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.910" end="00:02:56.010" style="s2">offended by evolutionary theory so I</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.540" end="00:02:58.170" style="s2">think that in a way he&#39;s kind of lending</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.010" end="00:02:59.640" style="s2">a hand out but there&#39;s something in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.170" end="00:03:01.560" style="s2">way that he lends his hand out that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.640" end="00:03:03.930" style="s2">also kind of condescending because he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.560" end="00:03:05.970" style="s2">saying you know religion is this but</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.930" end="00:03:07.800" style="s2">people who have thought deeply about and</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.970" end="00:03:09.180" style="s2">some people do think that it&#39;s true if</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.800" end="00:03:11.940" style="s2">you meet some common person on the</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.180" end="00:03:13.170" style="s2">street they might think some those types</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.940" end="00:03:14.880" style="s2">of things about religion just like if</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.170" end="00:03:16.550" style="s2">you ask them about evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.880" end="00:03:19.550" style="s2">they&#39;ll have silly ideas about evolution</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.550" end="00:03:21.840" style="s2">the problem is that religion isn&#39;t isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.550" end="00:03:24.030" style="s2">democratic there&#39;s something that is</p>
<p begin="00:03:21.840" end="00:03:25.140" style="s2">kind of the patterns in them although</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.030" end="00:03:27.480" style="s2">they can be discussed they&#39;re rather</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.140" end="00:03:29.070" style="s2">stable um and so I always get the</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.480" end="00:03:30.390" style="s2">feeling like no you&#39;re not you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.070" end="00:03:32.730" style="s2">dealing with what it&#39;s really about</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.390" end="00:03:35.489" style="s2">which is this more structural element of</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.730" end="00:03:37.440" style="s2">human consciousness because what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.489" end="00:03:41.160" style="s2">really interesting is you posted on</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.440" end="00:03:42.900" style="s2">Facebook a clip from Jordan Peterson he</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.160" end="00:03:44.040" style="s2">was on the Dave Rubin show quite</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.900" end="00:03:46.769" style="s2">recently with Ben Shapiro</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.040" end="00:03:49.470" style="s2">and it was a brilliant clip and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.769" end="00:03:51.900" style="s2">gonna play it in a second and it was</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.470" end="00:03:54.360" style="s2">about five minutes or so where he talks</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.900" end="00:03:58.730" style="s2">about it&#39;s as if there&#39;s a structure</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.360" end="00:04:02.269" style="s2">underlying being and it&#39;s a brilliant</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.730" end="00:04:05.760" style="s2">enunciation of sort of a religious</p>
<p begin="00:04:02.269" end="00:04:07.500" style="s2">understanding of the world and you</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.760" end="00:04:09.209" style="s2">posted it and I think you said something</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.500" end="00:04:11.700" style="s2">like wow he goes deeper than he&#39;s ever</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.209" end="00:04:13.739" style="s2">gone before or something like that and I</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.700" end="00:04:15.660" style="s2">sent it to Brett because I talked to</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.739" end="00:04:19.560" style="s2">Brett quite a lot about these questions</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.660" end="00:04:21.479" style="s2">on an off-camera in Portland and said</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.560" end="00:04:24.620" style="s2">what do you make of this and Brett&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.479" end="00:04:26.350" style="s2">pretty much said yeah I completely agree</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.620" end="00:04:30.370" style="s2">Jordan is pretty much</p>
<p begin="00:04:26.350" end="00:04:32.260" style="s2">supporting my position on this and so</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.370" end="00:04:34.930" style="s2">this is really fascinating you both had</p>
<p begin="00:04:32.260" end="00:04:36.400" style="s2">such a strong reaction or a different</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.930" end="00:04:38.020" style="s2">reaction to the exactly the same piece</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.400" end="00:04:39.880" style="s2">let&#39;s play it now and then we&#39;ll pick up</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.020" end="00:04:43.930" style="s2">off the back of that well so here&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.880" end="00:04:46.060" style="s2">here&#39;s the idea and it bears on your</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.930" end="00:04:48.880" style="s2">question although I don&#39;t exactly know</p>
<p begin="00:04:46.060" end="00:04:50.980" style="s2">how it&#39;s as if there&#39;s a spirit at the</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.880" end="00:04:53.560" style="s2">bottom of things that is that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.980" end="00:04:57.490" style="s2">involved in the in the in the bringing</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.560" end="00:05:02.110" style="s2">to being of everything so like so for</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:05:04.720" style="s2">example people talk about evolution as a</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.110" end="00:05:07.990" style="s2">random process but that&#39;s not true it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.720" end="00:05:09.310" style="s2">not true the mutations are random but</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.990" end="00:05:11.860" style="s2">there&#39;s also a lot of sources other</p>
<p begin="00:05:09.310" end="00:05:13.830" style="s2">sources of genetic variant variation but</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.860" end="00:05:16.660" style="s2">the selection mechanisms are not random</p>
<p begin="00:05:13.830" end="00:05:19.150" style="s2">so now then the question is what are the</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.660" end="00:05:22.420" style="s2">selection mechanisms so I&#39;m going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.150" end="00:05:25.630" style="s2">have to go a bunch of well here&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.420" end="00:05:27.370" style="s2">selection mechanism it&#39;s like so human</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.630" end="00:05:30.280" style="s2">females are very sexually selective</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.370" end="00:05:32.440" style="s2">that&#39;s why you have twice as many female</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.280" end="00:05:34.480" style="s2">ancestors as male ancestors so the male</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.440" end="00:05:36.940" style="s2">failure rate for reproduction is twice</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.480" end="00:05:39.730" style="s2">that of the females okay so the question</p>
<p begin="00:05:36.940" end="00:05:41.800" style="s2">is well how is it that males succeed</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.730" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">differentially and the first answer is</p>
<p begin="00:05:41.800" end="00:05:46.300" style="s2">well females reject if human females</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:48.730" style="s2">reject but then the question might be</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.300" end="00:05:50.800" style="s2">well they reject on the basis of what</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.730" end="00:05:52.720" style="s2">and the answer is well it&#39;s something</p>
<p begin="00:05:50.800" end="00:05:54.670" style="s2">like competence and then the question is</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.720" end="00:05:56.470" style="s2">well how is competence defined and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.670" end="00:05:57.910" style="s2">the answer to that is well men put</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.470" end="00:05:59.830" style="s2">themselves in hierarchies and they vote</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.910" end="00:06:01.750" style="s2">on each other&#39;s competence and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.830" end="00:06:03.640" style="s2">really counterintuitive in some sense</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.750" end="00:06:06.040" style="s2">from a evolutionary perspective because</p>
<p begin="00:06:03.640" end="00:06:08.200" style="s2">you&#39;d have to ask yourself why would men</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.040" end="00:06:11.080" style="s2">put themselves in positions where they</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.200" end="00:06:12.670" style="s2">elevate some men in status and then give</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.080" end="00:06:14.500" style="s2">them a huge rep reductive advantage</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.670" end="00:06:17.860" style="s2">given that that&#39;s to their reproductive</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.500" end="00:06:20.530" style="s2">disadvantage in some sense ok and there</p>
<p begin="00:06:17.860" end="00:06:22.240" style="s2">are reasons part of that might be let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.530" end="00:06:25.210" style="s2">say you decide to follow the best leader</p>
<p begin="00:06:22.240" end="00:06:26.920" style="s2">in a battle well then you don&#39;t die like</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.210" end="00:06:28.390" style="s2">he might get all the women but you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:06:26.920" end="00:06:29.500" style="s2">die so at least you&#39;re still in the game</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.390" end="00:06:31.270" style="s2">and it might be the same if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.500" end="00:06:32.620" style="s2">following the greatest hunter and the</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.270" end="00:06:34.240" style="s2">greatest hunter wouldn&#39;t be the person</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.620" end="00:06:35.770" style="s2">who was best at bringing down the game</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.240" end="00:06:37.870" style="s2">it would be the person who is best at</p>
<p begin="00:06:35.770" end="00:06:39.330" style="s2">bringing down the game and sharing it</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.870" end="00:06:41.159" style="s2">and organizing the next hunt</p>
<p begin="00:06:39.330" end="00:06:42.659" style="s2">all of that right and so men will</p>
<p begin="00:06:41.159" end="00:06:44.909" style="s2">organize themselves into groups and</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.659" end="00:06:46.770" style="s2">privilege certain men and that puts them</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.909" end="00:06:48.719" style="s2">ahead in the reproductive hierarchy and</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.770" end="00:06:52.370" style="s2">so what that means to some degree is</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.719" end="00:06:55.800" style="s2">that there&#39;s a spirit of masculinity</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.370" end="00:06:58.319" style="s2">that&#39;s shaping the entire structure of</p>
<p begin="00:06:55.800" end="00:07:00.180" style="s2">human evolutionary history that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.319" end="00:07:02.939" style="s2">that means and then I think okay well</p>
<p begin="00:07:00.180" end="00:07:05.189" style="s2">that might just be a biological epic</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.939" end="00:07:07.169" style="s2">phenomenon and so it would be a spirit</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.189" end="00:07:09.979" style="s2">that it&#39;s the spirit of positive</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.169" end="00:07:13.020" style="s2">masculinity that manifests itself across</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.979" end="00:07:14.729" style="s2">epochal ages millions of years perhaps</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.020" end="00:07:16.860" style="s2">and it actually has shaped our</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.729" end="00:07:18.690" style="s2">consciousness actually and so you can</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.860" end="00:07:20.219" style="s2">think about that as a figure and it</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.690" end="00:07:23.699" style="s2">would be the figure that emerges it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.219" end="00:07:25.500" style="s2">like it&#39;s like the it&#39;s like this it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.699" end="00:07:26.849" style="s2">like the essential spirit of all the</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.500" end="00:07:29.729" style="s2">great men who defined what greatness</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.849" end="00:07:31.469" style="s2">constituted that&#39;s a spirit okay now</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.729" end="00:07:32.819" style="s2">that&#39;s a purely biological explanation</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.469" end="00:07:34.409" style="s2">you could say well that&#39;s gone for all</p>
<p begin="00:07:32.819" end="00:07:36.449" style="s2">intents and purposes you might have an</p>
<p begin="00:07:34.409" end="00:07:37.919" style="s2">image of that built right into you even</p>
<p begin="00:07:36.449" end="00:07:40.650" style="s2">the sense that you can experience</p>
<p begin="00:07:37.919" end="00:07:42.479" style="s2">something divine and paternal might be</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.650" end="00:07:44.340" style="s2">merely a reflection of that evolutionary</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.479" end="00:07:46.469" style="s2">process so that would be a biologically</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.340" end="00:07:48.690" style="s2">reductive argument for the existence of</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.469" end="00:07:50.430" style="s2">what we experience as God but then</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.690" end="00:07:52.379" style="s2">there&#39;s another possibility too which is</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.430" end="00:07:54.930" style="s2">that that&#39;s actually reflective of a</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.379" end="00:07:55.830" style="s2">deeper metaphysical reality that has to</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.930" end="00:07:58.110" style="s2">do with the nature of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.830" end="00:08:00.389" style="s2">itself and I would say that I think</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.110" end="00:08:02.250" style="s2">that&#39;s true is I believe the biological</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.389" end="00:08:03.690" style="s2">case and I believe the biologically</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.250" end="00:08:05.339" style="s2">reductive case but I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.690" end="00:08:08.310" style="s2">exhausts it I think that there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.339" end="00:08:10.529" style="s2">metaphysical layer underneath that that</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.310" end="00:08:12.569" style="s2">the bile or that the biology is a</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.529" end="00:08:14.219" style="s2">genuine reflection of and that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.569" end="00:08:16.409" style="s2">sort of the macrocosm above and the</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.219" end="00:08:18.659" style="s2">microcosm below that we that we are</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.409" end="00:08:20.520" style="s2">really reflective including in our</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.659" end="00:08:22.379" style="s2">consciousness of something about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.520" end="00:08:25.259" style="s2">structure of reality itself and that</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.379" end="00:08:28.199" style="s2">might involve whatever whatever it is</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.259" end="00:08:29.789" style="s2">that God is I think that in the</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.199" end="00:08:32.130" style="s2">discussion that&#39;s been a that&#39;s been</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.789" end="00:08:34.140" style="s2">going along with Jordan and the new</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.130" end="00:08:35.490" style="s2">atheist and Jordan you know based on</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.140" end="00:08:37.500" style="s2">discussions that I have it privately</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.490" end="00:08:39.240" style="s2">with him I felt like this is something</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.500" end="00:08:41.099" style="s2">that he had never really said in public</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.240" end="00:08:43.349" style="s2">which he had enunciated in private think</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.099" end="00:08:45.720" style="s2">that he was tyent trying to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.349" end="00:08:49.529" style="s2">which is that he&#39;s been able to build</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.720" end="00:08:51.329" style="s2">this bottom up case for let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.529" end="00:08:52.860" style="s2">structures of religion or the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.329" end="00:08:55.440" style="s2">deities or the or the notion</p>
<p begin="00:08:52.860" end="00:08:57.330" style="s2">of the the Heavenly Father let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.440" end="00:09:01.950" style="s2">he&#39;s been able to build it up and</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.330" end="00:09:04.350" style="s2">explain quite well how you know certain</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.950" end="00:09:07.530" style="s2">biological processes will lead to this</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.350" end="00:09:09.270" style="s2">this formulation or to these images but</p>
<p begin="00:09:07.530" end="00:09:13.080" style="s2">what he hasn&#39;t done so much when he was</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.270" end="00:09:15.930" style="s2">doing that there is to say the reason</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.080" end="00:09:18.030" style="s2">why those patterns brought about these</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.930" end="00:09:20.580" style="s2">images in the first place is because</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.030" end="00:09:23.700" style="s2">they necessarily have to be a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.580" end="00:09:25.710" style="s2">representation of reality itself or at</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.700" end="00:09:27.930" style="s2">the reality to the extent that we can</p>
<p begin="00:09:25.710" end="00:09:30.570" style="s2">engage with it and so the notion is that</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.930" end="00:09:33.230" style="s2">the reason why this images pops up and</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.570" end="00:09:35.520" style="s2">comes up bottom-up is because it is</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.230" end="00:09:39.030" style="s2">participating ended up the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.520" end="00:09:42.540" style="s2">reality itself and so the image of of</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.030" end="00:09:46.080" style="s2">deities of deities or of God or of the</p>
<p begin="00:09:42.540" end="00:09:47.970" style="s2">transcendent they are capturing</p>
<p begin="00:09:46.080" end="00:09:51.420" style="s2">something about the manner in which</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.970" end="00:09:54.390" style="s2">reality works itself so that&#39;s why when</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.420" end="00:09:56.820" style="s2">we engage in those patterns in those</p>
<p begin="00:09:54.390" end="00:10:00.720" style="s2">structures that&#39;s why they then become a</p>
<p begin="00:09:56.820" end="00:10:03.090" style="s2">a way to make the dates for Humanity to</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.720" end="00:10:05.850" style="s2">thrive or for the human species to to</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.090" end="00:10:07.950" style="s2">continue I know if that makes sense well</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.850" end="00:10:11.970" style="s2">I mean the question that comes up I</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.950" end="00:10:13.890" style="s2">guess is that that may be true and I</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.970" end="00:10:16.310" style="s2">think I think in that he also says that</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.890" end="00:10:19.020" style="s2">the danger here is that you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.310" end="00:10:21.720" style="s2">explaining religion versus explaining</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.020" end="00:10:23.880" style="s2">religion away and I think Jordan in that</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.720" end="00:10:26.160" style="s2">clip says something about you can</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.880" end="00:10:28.500" style="s2">explain it this way it is a pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.160" end="00:10:30.000" style="s2">being that doesn&#39;t exhaust the</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.500" end="00:10:32.580" style="s2">possibility that there&#39;s a metaphysical</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.000" end="00:10:35.340" style="s2">structural there&#39;s a metaphysical aspect</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.580" end="00:10:37.950" style="s2">to it as well and I guess but the idea</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.340" end="00:10:40.080" style="s2">is that why is there this pattern of</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.950" end="00:10:42.030" style="s2">being that&#39;s what we got kind of come</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.080" end="00:10:45.090" style="s2">back to is that why does reality lay</p>
<p begin="00:10:42.030" end="00:10:47.160" style="s2">itself out this way why does and and he</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.090" end="00:10:49.950" style="s2">hits the nail right at the right place</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.160" end="00:10:51.690" style="s2">which is he talks about how it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.950" end="00:10:54.570" style="s2">basically the structure of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.690" end="00:10:56.220" style="s2">so this hierarchy that this higher key</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.570" end="00:10:58.080" style="s2">that he sets up is the structure of</p>
<p begin="00:10:56.220" end="00:10:59.580" style="s2">consciousness and so that&#39;s why there</p>
<p begin="00:10:58.080" end="00:11:01.350" style="s2">are analogies that say between the</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.580" end="00:11:03.120" style="s2">hierarchy sets up in terms of this idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.350" end="00:11:05.310" style="s2">of the spirit of the Father which kind</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.120" end="00:11:06.480" style="s2">of rises up and manifests itself as this</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.310" end="00:11:08.850" style="s2">transcendent father</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.480" end="00:11:10.680" style="s2">and also it&#39;s an it&#39;s analogous to the</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.850" end="00:11:12.449" style="s2">idea of space which is you know you</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.680" end="00:11:14.399" style="s2">create a center of space and then you</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.449" end="00:11:16.529" style="s2">lay out a space around it the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.399" end="00:11:18.779" style="s2">a center of time around which a cycle</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.529" end="00:11:20.970" style="s2">will will then proceed and so all these</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.779" end="00:11:23.310" style="s2">are at the center of a community in</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.970" end="00:11:25.019" style="s2">terms of a chief or in terms of an ideal</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.310" end="00:11:27.060" style="s2">that everybody gathers around and</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.019" end="00:11:31.079" style="s2">creates unity around this this thing</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.060" end="00:11:32.970" style="s2">that is above them and so that this idea</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.079" end="00:11:34.709" style="s2">is that the reason why this is is</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.970" end="00:11:39.500" style="s2">because it&#39;s the shape of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.709" end="00:11:42.870" style="s2">and consciousness becomes the analogy to</p>
<p begin="00:11:39.500" end="00:11:44.670" style="s2">the structure of the cosmos sets up</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.870" end="00:11:47.100" style="s2">where this are the way in which we</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.670" end="00:11:50.940" style="s2">interact with what causes the universe</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.100" end="00:11:54.240" style="s2">to exist if the idea is that the pattern</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.940" end="00:11:56.339" style="s2">is not arbitrary it has it&#39;s not it</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.240" end="00:11:58.949" style="s2">could not have been in another way it</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.339" end="00:12:00.810" style="s2">that&#39;s the pattern of reality but I mean</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.949" end="00:12:04.019" style="s2">I guess I can follow you up to a point</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.810" end="00:12:06.540" style="s2">my what I am wondering about is why is</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.019" end="00:12:07.980" style="s2">that specifically Christian in in that</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.540" end="00:12:09.870" style="s2">sense what do you are it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.980" end="00:12:11.610" style="s2">specifically Christian it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.870" end="00:12:14.760" style="s2">receiving Christian it all I think that</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.610" end="00:12:16.980" style="s2">all religions are addressing this</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.760" end="00:12:18.120" style="s2">mystery are dealing with this mystery in</p>
<p begin="00:12:16.980" end="00:12:20.519" style="s2">a way that&#39;s why there are so many</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.120" end="00:12:22.050" style="s2">analogies in in all the different</p>
<p begin="00:12:20.519" end="00:12:23.699" style="s2">religions that&#39;s why you know for</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.050" end="00:12:25.740" style="s2">example this idea of centered space this</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.699" end="00:12:29.069" style="s2">notion of centered time the idea of</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.740" end="00:12:34.010" style="s2">rituals of establishment are there in in</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.069" end="00:12:36.630" style="s2">all religions I think that in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.010" end="00:12:40.290" style="s2">Christianity would it let&#39;s say what it</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.630" end="00:12:42.810" style="s2">has offered is the let&#39;s say them this</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.290" end="00:12:44.970" style="s2">point or this this bringing it all</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.810" end="00:12:46.800" style="s2">together in the you know in the person</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.970" end="00:12:48.990" style="s2">of Christ but doing that in a manner</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.800" end="00:12:50.819" style="s2">which also brings it back into us which</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.990" end="00:12:52.829" style="s2">you know st. Paul talks about Christ in</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.819" end="00:12:54.720" style="s2">us that that&#39;s that that Christ has</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.829" end="00:12:56.339" style="s2">revealed to us the mystery hidden from</p>
<p begin="00:12:54.720" end="00:12:59.100" style="s2">the beginning of time which is Christ in</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.339" end="00:13:02.699" style="s2">you and so Christ also brings it into</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.100" end="00:13:04.620" style="s2">the the person and and so you have this</p>
<p begin="00:13:02.699" end="00:13:08.160" style="s2">possibility of participating in the life</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.620" end="00:13:10.319" style="s2">of God and so the idea most let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.160" end="00:13:11.699" style="s2">even at the early stages of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.319" end="00:13:15.300" style="s2">you know people like Justin Martyr</p>
<p begin="00:13:11.699" end="00:13:17.100" style="s2">talked about how Socrates how Plato were</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.300" end="00:13:19.860" style="s2">Christians before Christ in the sense</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.100" end="00:13:20.490" style="s2">that they they participated in the life</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.860" end="00:13:22.230" style="s2">of the low</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.490" end="00:13:23.820" style="s2">and so it&#39;s not a strange thing for</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.230" end="00:13:27.750" style="s2">Christians to believe that Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.820" end="00:13:29.970" style="s2">is kind of the is is is a combination of</p>
<p begin="00:13:27.750" end="00:13:32.970" style="s2">this story and so it&#39;s all religions</p>
<p begin="00:13:29.970" end="00:13:36.840" style="s2">somehow participate in that story hmm</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.970" end="00:13:38.370" style="s2">and you you&#39;ve said before just before</p>
<p begin="00:13:36.840" end="00:13:40.050" style="s2">we started recording you think this is</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.370" end="00:13:43.950" style="s2">where this conversation needs to go I</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.050" end="00:13:47.730" style="s2">mean I&#39;ve got a sense of there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.950" end="00:13:51.290" style="s2">there&#39;s either an expansion of the word</p>
<p begin="00:13:47.730" end="00:13:53.850" style="s2">atheist to to say okay</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.290" end="00:13:55.920" style="s2">atheism doesn&#39;t mean believing in a God</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.850" end="00:13:58.080" style="s2">outside of space and time creating</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.920" end="00:14:00.690" style="s2">something but it could mean an imminent</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.080" end="00:14:03.330" style="s2">and in an imminent creative principle</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.690" end="00:14:05.340" style="s2">that that doesn&#39;t need to have a sort of</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.330" end="00:14:07.710" style="s2">religious substructure or do you not</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.340" end="00:14:09.960" style="s2">think that&#39;s possible well I think that</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.710" end="00:14:13.380" style="s2">the first thing that needs to happen is</p>
<p begin="00:14:09.960" end="00:14:15.480" style="s2">I think that atheism needs to grapple</p>
<p begin="00:14:13.380" end="00:14:20.070" style="s2">with classical theism needs to grapple</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.480" end="00:14:21.750" style="s2">not with kind of modern visions of kind</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.070" end="00:14:24.090" style="s2">of modern evangelical and modern</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.750" end="00:14:26.670" style="s2">fundamentalist thinking but needs to</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.090" end="00:14:30.600" style="s2">grapple with a more profound mystical</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.670" end="00:14:33.120" style="s2">vision of theism which is that it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.600" end="00:14:36.270" style="s2">so much that we understand God as this</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.120" end="00:14:38.460" style="s2">being that&#39;s outside of the world who</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.270" end="00:14:41.310" style="s2">created it and almost like he&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.460" end="00:14:43.410" style="s2">this very very big invisible being who</p>
<p begin="00:14:41.310" end="00:14:46.020" style="s2">creates the world that is not what what</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.410" end="00:14:48.720" style="s2">traditional Christians believe they they</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.020" end="00:14:50.450" style="s2">believe that God is transcends all of</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.720" end="00:14:52.440" style="s2">creation because he&#39;s the source of all</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.450" end="00:14:54.390" style="s2">manifestation he&#39;s the he&#39;s the source</p>
<p begin="00:14:52.440" end="00:14:57.360" style="s2">of everything that happens but he&#39;s also</p>
<p begin="00:14:54.390" end="00:14:59.580" style="s2">within he&#39;s also the root let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:14:57.360" end="00:15:02.130" style="s2">ground of being you would say he&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:14:59.580" end="00:15:04.470" style="s2">root of all things that as they appear</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.130" end="00:15:09.030" style="s2">and then he&#39;s also hidden in each aspect</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.470" end="00:15:11.010" style="s2">of manifestation and so the logos is the</p>
<p begin="00:15:09.030" end="00:15:14.370" style="s2">purpose of things or the logos of things</p>
<p begin="00:15:11.010" end="00:15:17.520" style="s2">is hidden in all all manifestation</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.370" end="00:15:20.220" style="s2">without a center without a purpose</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.520" end="00:15:22.440" style="s2">without a logos the world doesn&#39;t exist</p>
<p begin="00:15:20.220" end="00:15:26.070" style="s2">and that&#39;s where we get into this idea</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.440" end="00:15:28.710" style="s2">of attention and the notion of you know</p>
<p begin="00:15:26.070" end="00:15:30.030" style="s2">this notion of salience and and this new</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.710" end="00:15:33.090" style="s2">kind of consciousness science which</p>
<p begin="00:15:30.030" end="00:15:34.380" style="s2">which notice is how in order for us to</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.090" end="00:15:36.030" style="s2">perceive something</p>
<p begin="00:15:34.380" end="00:15:37.410" style="s2">there needs to be kind of this coming</p>
<p begin="00:15:36.030" end="00:15:39.330" style="s2">together and just you know these these</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.410" end="00:15:41.430" style="s2">uh you know like for me to perceive a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.330" end="00:15:44.730" style="s2">microphone there&#39;s some strange magical</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.430" end="00:15:45.960" style="s2">thing which needs me makes me capable of</p>
<p begin="00:15:44.730" end="00:15:48.870" style="s2">perceiving that all the parts of the</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.960" end="00:15:50.760" style="s2">microphone somehow cohere into something</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.870" end="00:15:52.650" style="s2">which is above all its parts that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.760" end="00:15:54.690" style="s2">actually a description of something that</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.650" end="00:15:57.450" style="s2">sank lights st. Maximus would talk about</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.690" end="00:16:00.180" style="s2">that hidden in all manifestation that</p>
<p begin="00:15:57.450" end="00:16:02.490" style="s2">all level is are these hidden sparks</p>
<p begin="00:16:00.180" end="00:16:05.370" style="s2">these hidden purposes that human</p>
<p begin="00:16:02.490" end="00:16:07.800" style="s2">consciousness engages with and the human</p>
<p begin="00:16:05.370" end="00:16:09.540" style="s2">being becomes the laboratory into which</p>
<p begin="00:16:07.800" end="00:16:11.420" style="s2">all of these things come together we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.540" end="00:16:13.890" style="s2">kind of co-creators we participate in</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.420" end="00:16:16.170" style="s2">the existence of the world through</p>
<p begin="00:16:13.890" end="00:16:20.400" style="s2">through through our capacity for logos</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.170" end="00:16:24.510" style="s2">and reason and and consciousness and in</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.400" end="00:16:26.490" style="s2">that conception is is God identified</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.510" end="00:16:30.750" style="s2">with the totality of everything or is it</p>
<p begin="00:16:26.490" end="00:16:33.540" style="s2">you know God God is God has to God has</p>
<p begin="00:16:30.750" end="00:16:36.150" style="s2">to both transcend everything but then</p>
<p begin="00:16:33.540" end="00:16:39.360" style="s2">also underlie everything and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.150" end="00:16:43.080" style="s2">you the problem with talking about God</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.360" end="00:16:45.030" style="s2">is a totality of everything is a that</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.080" end="00:16:46.830" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like this quantitative</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.030" end="00:16:48.600" style="s2">thing it&#39;s almost like you take the</p>
<p begin="00:16:46.830" end="00:16:51.690" style="s2">entire universe and that would be God</p>
<p begin="00:16:48.600" end="00:16:53.550" style="s2">but then how does that also come how</p>
<p begin="00:16:51.690" end="00:16:56.520" style="s2">does everything come into one how can</p>
<p begin="00:16:53.550" end="00:16:59.370" style="s2">you even say everything and so above</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.520" end="00:17:04.199" style="s2">that everything appears this infinite</p>
<p begin="00:16:59.370" end="00:17:06.360" style="s2">non sayable unmentionable possibility</p>
<p begin="00:17:04.199" end="00:17:09.089" style="s2">which is you know the divine essence or</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.360" end="00:17:10.709" style="s2">you know that I always say the infinite</p>
<p begin="00:17:09.089" end="00:17:12.900" style="s2">is the best way to talk about it and</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.709" end="00:17:14.610" style="s2">that&#39;s the highest vision of God in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:12.900" end="00:17:18.630" style="s2">kind of traditional theistic way in a</p>
<p begin="00:17:14.610" end="00:17:21.240" style="s2">vision and how do you think this</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.630" end="00:17:23.370" style="s2">conversation should move on well I think</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.240" end="00:17:26.939" style="s2">I think that there are two things first</p>
<p begin="00:17:23.370" end="00:17:29.520" style="s2">is exploring the place of consciousness</p>
<p begin="00:17:26.939" end="00:17:30.630" style="s2">and I really would wish I really wished</p>
<p begin="00:17:29.520" end="00:17:32.880" style="s2">and I think I&#39;ve said this to you before</p>
<p begin="00:17:30.630" end="00:17:34.650" style="s2">I really wish that that salmon and</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.880" end="00:17:37.950" style="s2">Jordan when they talk could have talked</p>
<p begin="00:17:34.650" end="00:17:42.390" style="s2">more about consciousness because the the</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.950" end="00:17:44.790" style="s2">this notion that the world kind of that</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.390" end="00:17:47.010" style="s2">consciousness participates in the way</p>
<p begin="00:17:44.790" end="00:17:48.300" style="s2">the world lays itself out and that&#39;s our</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.010" end="00:17:50.010" style="s2">primary in</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.300" end="00:17:52.590" style="s2">your face let&#39;s say with the world</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.010" end="00:17:54.300" style="s2">before science let&#39;s say that science</p>
<p begin="00:17:52.590" end="00:17:56.570" style="s2">comes second the first interface we have</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.300" end="00:17:59.970" style="s2">with the world is this phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.570" end="00:18:01.860" style="s2">reality of encountering the world and so</p>
<p begin="00:17:59.970" end="00:18:04.950" style="s2">plunging into that is what&#39;s going to</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.860" end="00:18:06.870" style="s2">help people understand what religion is</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.950" end="00:18:09.120" style="s2">talking about and it also helped people</p>
<p begin="00:18:06.870" end="00:18:12.390" style="s2">to demystify some of the language that</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.120" end="00:18:14.970" style="s2">religion uses because it&#39;s taking that</p>
<p begin="00:18:12.390" end="00:18:17.190" style="s2">point of view as being the first point</p>
<p begin="00:18:14.970" end="00:18:18.840" style="s2">of view and so you know like I always</p>
<p begin="00:18:17.190" end="00:18:21.600" style="s2">tell people it&#39;s like no matter what you</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.840" end="00:18:24.210" style="s2">say the Sun still rises in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:18:21.600" end="00:18:26.280" style="s2">and it still goes up into the into the</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.210" end="00:18:28.620" style="s2">sky and it sets at night and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.280" end="00:18:31.170" style="s2">actually the most important part that</p>
<p begin="00:18:28.620" end="00:18:33.330" style="s2">the Sun has for you because that&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.170" end="00:18:35.160" style="s2">you settle your day that&#39;s how you your</p>
<p begin="00:18:33.330" end="00:18:37.110" style="s2">whole life is structured around the fact</p>
<p begin="00:18:35.160" end="00:18:39.630" style="s2">that this Sun gets up in the morning and</p>
<p begin="00:18:37.110" end="00:18:43.020" style="s2">so that reality that phenomenological</p>
<p begin="00:18:39.630" end="00:18:45.240" style="s2">reality is primary science actually</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.020" end="00:18:46.530" style="s2">comes second and I think that that&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.240" end="00:18:48.480" style="s2">and if you plunge into that</p>
<p begin="00:18:46.530" end="00:18:50.070" style="s2">phenomenological reality and the way the</p>
<p begin="00:18:48.480" end="00:18:52.290" style="s2">world lays itself out then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.070" end="00:18:55.590" style="s2">sudden let&#39;s say rituals of centeredness</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.290" end="00:18:58.290" style="s2">rituals of of things like communion</p>
<p begin="00:18:55.590" end="00:19:00.420" style="s2">things like sacred spaces will start to</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.290" end="00:19:03.240" style="s2">make sense because you&#39;ll see that</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.420" end="00:19:04.980" style="s2">without those things start to fragment</p>
<p begin="00:19:03.240" end="00:19:07.260" style="s2">and and and fall apart and that&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:19:04.980" end="00:19:08.700" style="s2">we&#39;re seeing in society today and so I</p>
<p begin="00:19:07.260" end="00:19:12.030" style="s2">think that that&#39;s the consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.700" end="00:19:13.650" style="s2">the key and then also really going past</p>
<p begin="00:19:12.030" end="00:19:16.020" style="s2">this idea that religion is just a bunch</p>
<p begin="00:19:13.650" end="00:19:17.640" style="s2">of things that people need to do that it</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.020" end="00:19:20.370" style="s2">that although there it is part of</p>
<p begin="00:19:17.640" end="00:19:23.010" style="s2">religion but to understand how it is it</p>
<p begin="00:19:20.370" end="00:19:25.770" style="s2">is really a language and a way of being</p>
<p begin="00:19:23.010" end="00:19:28.860" style="s2">which which participates in the</p>
<p begin="00:19:25.770" end="00:19:31.290" style="s2">existence of reality that it&#39;s a very</p>
<p begin="00:19:28.860" end="00:19:33.270" style="s2">ancient understanding of how it is that</p>
<p begin="00:19:31.290" end="00:19:34.590" style="s2">things can be both multiple in one at</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.270" end="00:19:38.310" style="s2">the same time and how that actually</p>
<p begin="00:19:34.590" end="00:19:41.310" style="s2">happens I think I probably share with</p>
<p begin="00:19:38.310" end="00:19:44.970" style="s2">you a sense that what&#39;s needed is is</p>
<p begin="00:19:41.310" end="00:19:47.790" style="s2">certainly a renewal of a lot of values</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.970" end="00:19:50.580" style="s2">that we&#39;ve lost and a lot of the sacred</p>
<p begin="00:19:47.790" end="00:19:53.430" style="s2">I have a sense that you would like to</p>
<p begin="00:19:50.580" end="00:19:55.260" style="s2">see a renewal of Christianity would that</p>
<p begin="00:19:53.430" end="00:19:58.950" style="s2">be be right or do you think that we need</p>
<p begin="00:19:55.260" end="00:20:02.040" style="s2">a new some kind of new spiritual or</p>
<p begin="00:19:58.950" end="00:20:05.430" style="s2">religious tradition that that kind of</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.040" end="00:20:08.880" style="s2">I can&#39;t really see like a real renewal</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.430" end="00:20:11.430" style="s2">of Christianity happening well all I can</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.880" end="00:20:13.020" style="s2">say is I think that it&#39;s very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.430" end="00:20:16.770" style="s2">to change the story</p>
<p begin="00:20:13.020" end="00:20:18.180" style="s2">we&#39;re in um I think that the chore the</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.770" end="00:20:19.590" style="s2">story will change there are some things</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.180" end="00:20:21.150" style="s2">which are kind of you could say</p>
<p begin="00:20:19.590" end="00:20:23.670" style="s2">providential in the sense that there are</p>
<p begin="00:20:21.150" end="00:20:25.560" style="s2">these these historical patterns that you</p>
<p begin="00:20:23.670" end="00:20:27.900" style="s2">can&#39;t change you can&#39;t you can&#39;t just</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.560" end="00:20:29.790" style="s2">decide that you&#39;re going to now let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.900" end="00:20:31.890" style="s2">say start a new spirituality you can do</p>
<p begin="00:20:29.790" end="00:20:33.630" style="s2">that people have done that we&#39;ve seen it</p>
<p begin="00:20:31.890" end="00:20:36.030" style="s2">happen in the 20th century you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.630" end="00:20:38.040" style="s2">millions of time then it&#39;s participated</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.030" end="00:20:42.810" style="s2">in the fragmentation of Western society</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.040" end="00:20:45.480" style="s2">I think that to me until until the big</p>
<p begin="00:20:42.810" end="00:20:47.730" style="s2">change until the massive shift you know</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.480" end="00:20:49.380" style="s2">until what Christians gonna call the the</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.730" end="00:20:51.810" style="s2">return of Christ or this moment where</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.380" end="00:20:53.460" style="s2">everything&#39;s going to going to change</p>
<p begin="00:20:51.810" end="00:20:56.490" style="s2">and we don&#39;t know what that looks like</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.460" end="00:20:58.530" style="s2">it&#39;s a it&#39;s an imagistic story about you</p>
<p begin="00:20:56.490" end="00:20:59.580" style="s2">know the this thing that happens in the</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.530" end="00:21:02.550" style="s2">world which changes everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.580" end="00:21:05.130" style="s2">until that I think that to stay inside</p>
<p begin="00:21:02.550" end="00:21:06.210" style="s2">the story is the best is the best bet</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.130" end="00:21:07.710" style="s2">for us now</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.210" end="00:21:10.280" style="s2">and in all the efforts that have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.710" end="00:21:14.250" style="s2">put to to do something else have been</p>
<p begin="00:21:10.280" end="00:21:15.660" style="s2">subversive in my opinion mm-hmm and what</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.250" end="00:21:17.490" style="s2">does that mean studying inside the story</p>
<p begin="00:21:15.660" end="00:21:19.830" style="s2">well that means that means staying</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.490" end="00:21:22.800" style="s2">inside the Christian story you know for</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.830" end="00:21:25.530" style="s2">all its for all its messiness and for</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.800" end="00:21:28.860" style="s2">all its kind of dimming and it&#39;s kind of</p>
<p begin="00:21:25.530" end="00:21:30.390" style="s2">approaching a sunset I don&#39;t think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:28.860" end="00:21:33.360" style="s2">there&#39;s another story at least for</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.390" end="00:21:34.920" style="s2">Western culture right now I think that</p>
<p begin="00:21:33.360" end="00:21:37.080" style="s2">the two stories for Western culture have</p>
<p begin="00:21:34.920" end="00:21:39.630" style="s2">been Christianity and Judaism and I</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.080" end="00:21:42.060" style="s2">think that those those are there and and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.630" end="00:21:43.950" style="s2">they&#39;re not they&#39;re they&#39;re not they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:21:42.060" end="00:21:47.280" style="s2">not going away until something massive</p>
<p begin="00:21:43.950" end="00:21:48.750" style="s2">happens and so and I know a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:21:47.280" end="00:21:51.290" style="s2">people might think that&#39;s odd that I</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.750" end="00:21:53.760" style="s2">would say that but I think that that</p>
<p begin="00:21:51.290" end="00:21:56.070" style="s2">it&#39;s when you start to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.760" end="00:21:58.980" style="s2">things unfold in these patterns and in a</p>
<p begin="00:21:56.070" end="00:22:01.320" style="s2">way we we have very little individual</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.980" end="00:22:03.510" style="s2">control over how those things unfold and</p>
<p begin="00:22:01.320" end="00:22:05.190" style="s2">we&#39;re playing out let&#39;s say the</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.510" end="00:22:07.920" style="s2">Christian story right now in the</p>
<p begin="00:22:05.190" end="00:22:09.720" style="s2">Christian story there is a a breaking</p>
<p begin="00:22:07.920" end="00:22:11.670" style="s2">apart it&#39;s part of the story there is a</p>
<p begin="00:22:09.720" end="00:22:13.560" style="s2">death it&#39;s the death of Christianity is</p>
<p begin="00:22:11.670" end="00:22:15.420" style="s2">part of the Christian story and so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.560" end="00:22:15.750" style="s2">kind of going through that right now and</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.420" end="00:22:18.180" style="s2">I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:15.750" end="00:22:19.830" style="s2">it&#39;s inevitable and I respect people and</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.180" end="00:22:21.390" style="s2">I totally respect people who would say</p>
<p begin="00:22:19.830" end="00:22:24.030" style="s2">in the light of that that I would rather</p>
<p begin="00:22:21.390" end="00:22:25.590" style="s2">do my own thing let&#39;s say I understand</p>
<p begin="00:22:24.030" end="00:22:28.410" style="s2">that I respect that but I but I don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.590" end="00:22:29.550" style="s2">see another another true viable path</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.410" end="00:22:31.950" style="s2">let&#39;s say for the West</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.550" end="00:22:35.820" style="s2">besides that hmm I might be depressing</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.950" end="00:22:38.010" style="s2">for people to hear yeah I mean I think</p>
<p begin="00:22:35.820" end="00:22:39.600" style="s2">that&#39;s that&#39;s a very live conversation</p>
<p begin="00:22:38.010" end="00:22:42.720" style="s2">when a lot of people I speak to the need</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.600" end="00:22:45.210" style="s2">for a grand narrative what is the grand</p>
<p begin="00:22:42.720" end="00:22:48.360" style="s2">narrative is there the possibility of</p>
<p begin="00:22:45.210" end="00:22:50.340" style="s2">resurrecting a grand narrative I I have</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.360" end="00:22:52.950" style="s2">to say I&#39;m skeptical that that can be</p>
<p begin="00:22:50.340" end="00:22:55.380" style="s2">Christianity given the fact that we have</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.950" end="00:22:58.380" style="s2">sort of seemed to have decisively left</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.380" end="00:22:59.880" style="s2">it behind at least we&#39;re a lot less</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.380" end="00:23:01.920" style="s2">religious I think in the UK than you</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.880" end="00:23:05.310" style="s2">guys or you&#39;re not in the States but</p>
<p begin="00:23:01.920" end="00:23:07.440" style="s2">they make or at least yeah but I think</p>
<p begin="00:23:05.310" end="00:23:08.970" style="s2">that that is the key question it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.440" end="00:23:11.430" style="s2">what does the grand narrative look like</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.970" end="00:23:15.750" style="s2">how do we recover some of these timeless</p>
<p begin="00:23:11.430" end="00:23:20.100" style="s2">truths and can it be done within a</p>
<p begin="00:23:15.750" end="00:23:21.420" style="s2">context that looks different from how</p>
<p begin="00:23:20.100" end="00:23:22.980" style="s2">it&#39;s been done in the past but it will</p>
<p begin="00:23:21.420" end="00:23:24.240" style="s2">have a lot in common with it I mean it</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.980" end="00:23:27.060" style="s2">will have to have a lot in common with</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.240" end="00:23:29.610" style="s2">it but then again I also come back to</p>
<p begin="00:23:27.060" end="00:23:33.600" style="s2">the fact that Christianity has accreted</p>
<p begin="00:23:29.610" end="00:23:36.420" style="s2">this immense depth and wisdom over such</p>
<p begin="00:23:33.600" end="00:23:37.800" style="s2">a long period of time that the idea that</p>
<p begin="00:23:36.420" end="00:23:41.520" style="s2">we can sort of come up with something</p>
<p begin="00:23:37.800" end="00:23:43.950" style="s2">off the caf seems pretty unrealistic at</p>
<p begin="00:23:41.520" end="00:23:45.720" style="s2">the same time yeah I mean I think that</p>
<p begin="00:23:43.950" end="00:23:46.980" style="s2">that&#39;s why I talk about kind of</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.720" end="00:23:48.590" style="s2">Providence you won&#39;t understand what I</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.980" end="00:23:51.600" style="s2">mean by that but in the sense that</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.590" end="00:23:55.260" style="s2">something has to happen it&#39;s it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.600" end="00:23:57.870" style="s2">it&#39;s not just like it&#39;s really not just</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.260" end="00:24:00.390" style="s2">that we can decide to change the story</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.870" end="00:24:02.790" style="s2">there there is something there&#39;s a deep</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.390" end="00:24:04.170" style="s2">shift that needs to to occur for the</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.790" end="00:24:07.800" style="s2">story to change and it&#39;s something that</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.170" end="00:24:09.180" style="s2">we as individuals just as individual we</p>
<p begin="00:24:07.800" end="00:24:10.500" style="s2">can participate in that ship but as</p>
<p begin="00:24:09.180" end="00:24:12.960" style="s2">individuals we don&#39;t have that much</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.500" end="00:24:15.840" style="s2">power to actually affect you know this</p>
<p begin="00:24:12.960" end="00:24:17.610" style="s2">this story that&#39;s it&#39;s going on so</p>
<p begin="00:24:15.840" end="00:24:20.340" style="s2">that&#39;s kind of how I see it and I think</p>
<p begin="00:24:17.610" end="00:24:22.290" style="s2">what&#39;s going to happen I think that if I</p>
<p begin="00:24:20.340" end="00:24:27.240" style="s2">want to come back to the to the problem</p>
<p begin="00:24:22.290" end="00:24:29.220" style="s2">of a Brett and the problem of where the</p>
<p begin="00:24:27.240" end="00:24:29.400" style="s2">discussion needs to go one of the one of</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.220" end="00:24:31.440" style="s2">the</p>
<p begin="00:24:29.400" end="00:24:33.000" style="s2">difficulties that the reason why I also</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.440" end="00:24:36.240" style="s2">wanted to go back to consciousness is</p>
<p begin="00:24:33.000" end="00:24:38.130" style="s2">because there is I think in the way that</p>
<p begin="00:24:36.240" end="00:24:39.420" style="s2">Brett talks about it and this is what I</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.130" end="00:24:41.670" style="s2">brought up in our discussion the first</p>
<p begin="00:24:39.420" end="00:24:44.730" style="s2">time we talked is is that he takes for</p>
<p begin="00:24:41.670" end="00:24:47.790" style="s2">granted the position like he takes for</p>
<p begin="00:24:44.730" end="00:24:49.920" style="s2">granted his moral landscape he he thinks</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.790" end="00:24:53.550" style="s2">it&#39;s obvious that we should act in</p>

<p begin="00:24:53.550" end="00:24:57.720" style="s2">doesn&#39;t have a he just takes it for</p>
<p begin="00:24:55.500" end="00:25:00.480" style="s2">granted we don&#39;t know what the source of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.720" end="00:25:04.050" style="s2">that is we don&#39;t know what the source of</p>
<p begin="00:25:00.480" end="00:25:05.370" style="s2">his direction is he says he&#39;s a liberal</p>
<p begin="00:25:04.050" end="00:25:08.540" style="s2">he&#39;s obviously left-leaning and so it</p>
<p begin="00:25:05.370" end="00:25:10.920" style="s2">seems to come from that side let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.540" end="00:25:12.840" style="s2">but there&#39;s another side right there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.920" end="00:25:14.640" style="s2">another side which is the the the right</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.840" end="00:25:18.330" style="s2">wing and those right may people also</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.640" end="00:25:21.360" style="s2">have their there um let&#39;s say their</p>
<p begin="00:25:18.330" end="00:25:23.010" style="s2">priorities and so to think that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:25:21.360" end="00:25:24.360" style="s2">just obvious it&#39;s not if it was obvious</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.010" end="00:25:26.460" style="s2">there wouldn&#39;t be this clash and there</p>
<p begin="00:25:24.360" end="00:25:29.220" style="s2">wouldn&#39;t be this discussion it isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:25:26.460" end="00:25:31.920" style="s2">obvious and so unless we do find a</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.220" end="00:25:34.410" style="s2">common narrative then those two</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.920" end="00:25:36.600" style="s2">opposites like I&#39;ve been saying forever</p>
<p begin="00:25:34.410" end="00:25:38.130" style="s2">are just going to manifest themselves</p>
<p begin="00:25:36.600" end="00:25:40.320" style="s2">again and we&#39;re going to have the same</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.130" end="00:25:42.510" style="s2">clash we had you know at the beginning</p>
<p begin="00:25:40.320" end="00:25:45.270" style="s2">of the modern age you know right now</p>
<p begin="00:25:42.510" end="00:25:48.810" style="s2">we&#39;re just surfing we&#39;re just surfing</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.270" end="00:25:49.860" style="s2">let&#39;s say the it&#39;s horrible to say that</p>
<p begin="00:25:48.810" end="00:25:51.840" style="s2">we&#39;re cut we&#39;re kind of surfing the</p>
<p begin="00:25:49.860" end="00:25:55.470" style="s2">Holocaust like the Holocaust was such a</p>
<p begin="00:25:51.840" end="00:25:57.240" style="s2">shock you know that we&#39;re kind of we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:55.470" end="00:25:59.760" style="s2">still in awe from that and we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.240" end="00:26:01.380" style="s2">we&#39;re just kind of surfing the end of</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.760" end="00:26:03.750" style="s2">that wave and we&#39;re reaching the end of</p>
<p begin="00:26:01.380" end="00:26:05.880" style="s2">what that it&#39;s a shock could could</p>
<p begin="00:26:03.750" end="00:26:08.550" style="s2">afford us and now we&#39;re once again</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.880" end="00:26:12.350" style="s2">seeing the same same story happen again</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.550" end="00:26:14.940" style="s2">and and unless unless people find a</p>
<p begin="00:26:12.350" end="00:26:17.340" style="s2">grounding and the grounding isn&#39;t just a</p>
<p begin="00:26:14.940" end="00:26:19.500" style="s2">bunch of morality like I said but he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.340" end="00:26:22.500" style="s2">really is is rediscovering the notion of</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.500" end="00:26:25.320" style="s2">what makes a center what makes what</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.500" end="00:26:26.400" style="s2">makes something exist what is you know</p>
<p begin="00:26:25.320" end="00:26:27.990" style="s2">how does time work how does</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.400" end="00:26:30.270" style="s2">consciousness engage with the world I</p>
<p begin="00:26:27.990" end="00:26:32.280" style="s2">asked before where you think this</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.270" end="00:26:36.630" style="s2">conversation goes I was kind of thinking</p>
<p begin="00:26:32.280" end="00:26:38.400" style="s2">about the sense that Sam Harris and</p>
<p begin="00:26:36.630" end="00:26:42.000" style="s2">Jordan Peterson had these very public</p>
<p begin="00:26:38.400" end="00:26:42.500" style="s2">events that went some distance but</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.000" end="00:26:45.140" style="s2">didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:26:42.500" end="00:26:48.530" style="s2">as far as some people hoped in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.140" end="00:26:51.560" style="s2">coming to a bit of a conclusion or</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.530" end="00:26:53.440" style="s2">pushing the debate forward enough who do</p>
<p begin="00:26:51.560" end="00:26:55.850" style="s2">you think are the right people to be</p>
<p begin="00:26:53.440" end="00:26:59.390" style="s2">having those kind of debates to push it</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.850" end="00:27:00.980" style="s2">forward well I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:26:59.390" end="00:27:03.080" style="s2">the discussion that Jordan had with Ben</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.980" end="00:27:04.250" style="s2">I think that those are the discussions</p>
<p begin="00:27:03.080" end="00:27:07.820" style="s2">that are going to attract a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:04.250" end="00:27:10.310" style="s2">attention because they&#39;re diving into</p>
<p begin="00:27:07.820" end="00:27:14.360" style="s2">the the crux of the matter in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:27:10.310" end="00:27:17.720" style="s2">how do we find a coherent set of values</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.360" end="00:27:19.820" style="s2">and how do we establish you know how do</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.720" end="00:27:21.320" style="s2">we establish something which is coherent</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.820" end="00:27:23.240" style="s2">like how do we bring things together so</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.320" end="00:27:24.740" style="s2">I think that that&#39;s why that that</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.240" end="00:27:26.840" style="s2">conversation attracted a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.740" end="00:27:28.850" style="s2">attention and I think that that&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.840" end="00:27:30.680" style="s2">the future I think that the fact that</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.850" end="00:27:32.180" style="s2">you&#39;re talking you know on your channel</p>
<p begin="00:27:30.680" end="00:27:33.680" style="s2">that you&#39;re talking to like Zen masters</p>
<p begin="00:27:32.180" end="00:27:35.390" style="s2">and you&#39;re talking to people that are</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.680" end="00:27:38.840" style="s2">both in the let&#39;s say in the secular</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.390" end="00:27:40.640" style="s2">world but are also engaged in religious</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.840" end="00:27:43.280" style="s2">traditions I think that that&#39;s the best</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.640" end="00:27:44.660" style="s2">way to go about there&#39;s a there&#39;s a fear</p>
<p begin="00:27:43.280" end="00:27:47.630" style="s2">that I have in terms of this</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.660" end="00:27:50.120" style="s2">intellectual dark web phenomena is that</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.630" end="00:27:53.600" style="s2">it&#39;s kind of catalyzing itself where you</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.120" end="00:27:55.520" style="s2">basically have all kind of secular</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.600" end="00:27:56.990" style="s2">atheist types and then you have bench</p>
<p begin="00:27:55.520" end="00:27:58.850" style="s2">Pierrot who&#39;s kind of like the the</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.990" end="00:28:01.840" style="s2">exception so so I think that if we</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.850" end="00:28:04.790" style="s2">broaden the discussion to involve more</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.840" end="00:28:07.490" style="s2">more people like Dave Rubin is talking</p>
<p begin="00:28:04.790" end="00:28:09.080" style="s2">to Bishop Baron from California who&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.490" end="00:28:11.150" style="s2">who&#39;s an excellent person who really</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.080" end="00:28:12.770" style="s2">understands kind of Christian ontology</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.150" end="00:28:14.830" style="s2">and the metaphysics of Christianity</p>
<p begin="00:28:12.770" end="00:28:17.540" style="s2">those types of discussion I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:14.830" end="00:28:19.910" style="s2">widening it out so that so that there is</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.540" end="00:28:22.910" style="s2">more of this discussion between the more</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.910" end="00:28:24.650" style="s2">rationalists and the scientists and kind</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.910" end="00:28:26.480" style="s2">of spiritual tradition I think I think</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.650" end="00:28:28.730" style="s2">that that&#39;s the key to to coming to</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.480" end="00:28:30.620" style="s2">something that has more more depth let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.730" end="00:28:33.080" style="s2">say because I guess that&#39;s the point I</p>
<p begin="00:28:30.620" end="00:28:35.600" style="s2">was I was thinking about is that I mean</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.080" end="00:28:37.640" style="s2">even with with Ben Shapiro and Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.600" end="00:28:40.520" style="s2">Peterson they&#39;re both coming from</p>
<p begin="00:28:37.640" end="00:28:42.460" style="s2">religious tradition so it&#39;s not like I</p>
<p begin="00:28:40.520" end="00:28:45.980" style="s2">guess what I&#39;m saying is where&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.460" end="00:28:47.750" style="s2">open-minded religious person and the</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.980" end="00:28:49.940" style="s2">open-minded atheist that can come</p>
<p begin="00:28:47.750" end="00:28:52.550" style="s2">together and and one could potentially</p>
<p begin="00:28:49.940" end="00:28:54.320" style="s2">change the other&#39;s mind and come to some</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.550" end="00:28:55.260" style="s2">kind of synthesis that maybe Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.320" end="00:28:58.890" style="s2">peanuts and Sam</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.260" end="00:29:02.070" style="s2">is one table to come to I think you&#39;d be</p>
<p begin="00:28:58.890" end="00:29:04.140" style="s2">surprised I think that I think that</p>
<p begin="00:29:02.070" end="00:29:06.090" style="s2">they&#39;re quite people like Paul van der</p>
<p begin="00:29:04.140" end="00:29:07.530" style="s2">clay for example is someone who there</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.090" end="00:29:09.330" style="s2">are some things that he won&#39;t budge on</p>
<p begin="00:29:07.530" end="00:29:10.620" style="s2">let&#39;s say some some basic tenets that he</p>
<p begin="00:29:09.330" end="00:29:14.460" style="s2">won&#39;t I don&#39;t think he would budge on</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.620" end="00:29:16.230" style="s2">but you know like even myself I came</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.460" end="00:29:18.480" style="s2">into this discussion with Jordan you</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.230" end="00:29:23.370" style="s2">know several years ago thinking that</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.480" end="00:29:25.590" style="s2">science was not let&#39;s say not and not</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.370" end="00:29:27.870" style="s2">particularly appreciating the way that</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.590" end="00:29:30.450" style="s2">science was totalizing the discourse and</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.870" end="00:29:33.210" style="s2">and feeling like like they were missing</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.450" end="00:29:34.620" style="s2">out on on you know the highest thing and</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.210" end="00:29:36.690" style="s2">so then in my discussion through Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.620" end="00:29:38.430" style="s2">I&#39;ve discovered the science of</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.690" end="00:29:41.400" style="s2">consciousness I discovered you know how</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.430" end="00:29:42.630" style="s2">evolutionary psychology can talk about</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.400" end="00:29:44.640" style="s2">these things and different with</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.630" end="00:29:46.280" style="s2">different angles and so I felt like my</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.640" end="00:29:50.150" style="s2">position has changed quite a bit in</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.280" end="00:29:52.440" style="s2">appreciating let&#39;s say the role that</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.150" end="00:29:53.880" style="s2">scientific inquiry can play right now</p>
<p begin="00:29:52.440" end="00:29:55.580" style="s2">and so I think that there&#39;s quite a</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.880" end="00:29:58.350" style="s2">people quite a few people that actually</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.580" end="00:30:00.780" style="s2">would be able to have these discussions</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.350" end="00:30:02.460" style="s2">the the question is also one of the</p>
<p begin="00:30:00.780" end="00:30:03.870" style="s2">problems with it the intellectual dark</p>
<p begin="00:30:02.460" end="00:30:07.230" style="s2">web right now is that it&#39;s also a high</p>
<p begin="00:30:03.870" end="00:30:10.620" style="s2">profile game where it&#39;s only people who</p>
<p begin="00:30:07.230" end="00:30:12.330" style="s2">have a certain let&#39;s say visibility that</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.620" end="00:30:14.220" style="s2">are able to have the high level</p>
<p begin="00:30:12.330" end="00:30:15.120" style="s2">discussions and it&#39;s not always the case</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.220" end="00:30:16.950" style="s2">that those who have the highest</p>
<p begin="00:30:15.120" end="00:30:19.260" style="s2">visibility are the ones who are the most</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.950" end="00:30:20.880" style="s2">interesting and the most let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.260" end="00:30:23.940" style="s2">proficient in what they&#39;re supposed in</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.880" end="00:30:25.590" style="s2">what they&#39;re talking about so let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:30:23.940" end="00:30:27.870" style="s2">well should our audience for checking</p>
<p begin="00:30:25.590" end="00:30:30.060" style="s2">out well I think that people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.870" end="00:30:31.830" style="s2">at least understand Christianity I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.060" end="00:30:33.780" style="s2">that Bishop Baron is someone who is</p>
<p begin="00:30:31.830" end="00:30:35.940" style="s2">definitely interesting there&#39;s a writer</p>
<p begin="00:30:33.780" end="00:30:37.470" style="s2">his name is David Bentley Hart I think</p>
<p begin="00:30:35.940" end="00:30:39.090" style="s2">that a lot of he&#39;s a bit he&#39;s a bit</p>
<p begin="00:30:37.470" end="00:30:42.870" style="s2">abrasive because he doesn&#39;t like New</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.090" end="00:30:44.850" style="s2">Atheists but he does talk about he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:30:42.870" end="00:30:46.230" style="s2">a book recently called experiencing God</p>
<p begin="00:30:44.850" end="00:30:49.350" style="s2">which talks about the relationship</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.230" end="00:30:51.750" style="s2">between consciousness and our experience</p>
