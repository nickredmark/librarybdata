<p begin="00:00:03.140" end="00:00:05.020" style="s2">Thank you, Mr. Peterson for being with us.</p>
<p begin="00:00:05.200" end="00:00:07.200" style="s2">Thanks for the invitation.</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.560" end="00:00:13.860" style="s2">What I found most interesting in your book is the stuff you write about child development and child upbringing and</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.980" end="00:00:18.760" style="s2">for example you explain how overprotective parents can damage their children?</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.560" end="00:00:24.900" style="s2">You say it&#39;s far better to render beings in your care competent than to protect them.</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.900" end="00:00:28.020" style="s2">Do you think that the parents <br />today are</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.400" end="00:00:31.820" style="s2">more protective of their children than previous generations.</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.260" end="00:00:34.760" style="s2">I would say that it looks like that.</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.760" end="00:00:39.280" style="s2">Yes, I think there are complex reasons for that. I don&#39;t think that you can necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.980" end="00:00:44.560" style="s2">lay that at the feet of the parents people are having fewer children and</p>
<p begin="00:00:45.040" end="00:00:47.320" style="s2">and they&#39;re having them later in life and</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.600" end="00:00:51.120" style="s2">So I think both of those things those are major demographic shifts</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.120" end="00:00:52.780" style="s2">and I think that one of the</p>
<p begin="00:00:52.780" end="00:00:56.960" style="s2">Consequences of that is that children&#39;s lives are much more organized than they used to be</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.960" end="00:00:58.060" style="s2">which might have some advantages</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.060" end="00:01:03.100" style="s2">but that also parents are more likely to over protect their older and more cautious and</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.260" end="00:01:10.000" style="s2">the children also don&#39;t have as many siblings and of course siblings were part of the child raising process and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.759" end="00:01:15.189" style="s2">It&#39;s hard to be over protected in some ways when you&#39;re competing with a bunch of siblings</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.520" end="00:01:19.640" style="s2">So it&#39;s complicated but I think that over protection is a problem</p>
<p begin="00:01:20.440" end="00:01:26.140" style="s2">Rule 11 is do not bother children when they are skateboarding. This is a recurring theme in your book</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.260" end="00:01:30.280" style="s2">If we are overprotective with our children</p>
<p begin="00:01:30.500" end="00:01:32.760" style="s2">We will create weak individuals.</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.820" end="00:01:35.720" style="s2">Well you you demolish people&#39;s resilience that way.</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.800" end="00:01:39.900" style="s2">I mean life is difficult and you cannot protect your children?</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.610" end="00:01:45.519" style="s2">What you can do is prepare them and you can prepare them to be strong and courageous and</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.159" end="00:01:47.719" style="s2">truthful and</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.719" end="00:01:49.130" style="s2">resilient and</p>
<p begin="00:01:49.130" end="00:01:53.100" style="s2">reciprocal in their interactions with other people and that means you equip them for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.300" end="00:01:58.260" style="s2">what life will be which is at minimum a series of difficult challenges and and</p>
<p begin="00:01:58.360" end="00:02:02.880" style="s2">often more than that because of course people go through very difficult times in their lives and a</p>
<p begin="00:02:03.740" end="00:02:11.199" style="s2">resilient person is capable of standing up to things in the face of fear and moving forward voluntarily</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.680" end="00:02:14.450" style="s2">convinced of their own</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.450" end="00:02:16.479" style="s2">competence and ability to prevail and</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.180" end="00:02:20.830" style="s2">so the primary, your primary goal as a parent apart from</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.620" end="00:02:24.970" style="s2">facilitating your child&#39;s social desirability, which is a major</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.150" end="00:02:28.150" style="s2">obligation on your part is to</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.310" end="00:02:34.959" style="s2">encourage your children and to, and I mean that literally to instill in them a sense of courage in the face of the difficulties of</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.959" end="00:02:37.059" style="s2">life and not to protect them from that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.640" end="00:02:44.229" style="s2">We don&#39;t even want to be protected from those difficulties because a major part of life and its meaning is the</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.100" end="00:02:48.160" style="s2">The challenge that comes with confronting difficulties</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.680" end="00:02:50.090" style="s2">So...</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:51.760" style="s2">What do you want to say to those parents?</p>
<p begin="00:02:51.770" end="00:02:57.789" style="s2">That allow their eight or nine-year-old sons to sleep in their beds at night instead of sleeping in their own rooms</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.280" end="00:02:58.780" style="s2">well</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.780" end="00:03:04.929" style="s2">I the first thing I would say about that is you might want to ask why you don&#39;t want privacy with your spouse</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.930" end="00:03:05.980" style="s2">You know</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.980" end="00:03:12.550" style="s2">The last thing you want to do is use your child as an excuse to not interact properly with your wife or your husband</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.950" end="00:03:17.890" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of reasons that people allow their children to interfere with their relationship and</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.260" end="00:03:22.450" style="s2">so and by eight or nine a child is more than capable of</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.090" end="00:03:25.630" style="s2">Spending time on their own and they need to do that anyways</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.630" end="00:03:31.299" style="s2">Because you don&#39;t want your child to be either unable to spend time alone or terrified of it</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.610" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">you, you also destroy to some degree their, well, their ability to cope on their own but also their imagination by not requiring them to</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.320" end="00:03:42.009" style="s2">rely on themselves for their own like</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.950" end="00:03:47.019" style="s2">Call (?) for self calming and safe and also for self amusement</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.020" end="00:03:50.100" style="s2">There&#39;s a rule when you&#39;re dealing with people who might be</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.240" end="00:03:57.100" style="s2">dependent and this includes and includes the situation where you&#39;re dealing with sick people or or elderly people and the rule is</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.680" end="00:04:00.860" style="s2">Do not do anything for anyone that they can do for themselves</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.420" end="00:04:04.560" style="s2">Because you take away their competence by doing that I want to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.560" end="00:04:06.620" style="s2">I want to ask you about</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.620" end="00:04:13.140" style="s2">the use of physical force on children because you think it is important to allow kids to explore and harm themselves to gain experience</p>
<p begin="00:04:13.489" end="00:04:16.839" style="s2">still you believe strict parenting is important and you think this</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.359" end="00:04:21.399" style="s2">Justifiable to flick the index finger on to certain types of two-year-olds</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.740" end="00:04:24.580" style="s2">Why is the use of force justifiable</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.580" end="00:04:27.900" style="s2">Well it depends on the context and it also depends on what you mean by force</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.000" end="00:04:34.880" style="s2">There isn&#39;t a disciplinary strategy that you can utilize that doesn&#39;t involve something that&#39;s unpleasant while you can use reward</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.950" end="00:04:37.190" style="s2">But that that&#39;s a different there&#39;s different</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.320" end="00:04:43.120" style="s2">Circumstances underway and you should use reward every time you can because it&#39;s more effective but you often need something that&#39;s...</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.080" end="00:04:48.140" style="s2">Instantaneous and that gets the message across and a flick is a very good</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.660" end="00:04:54.379" style="s2">technique because it&#39;s instant. It&#39;s harmless it gets the message across you can use it publicly</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.680" end="00:04:57.500" style="s2">It can&#39;t be misused. You won&#39;t hurt the child</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.720" end="00:05:05.020" style="s2">You have to have an effective disciplinary strategy for you since in social situations, for example.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.020" end="00:05:06.700" style="s2">Yeah, you talk about the minimizing</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.700" end="00:05:09.320" style="s2">Minumum. Yeah, well the basic rules are quite straightforward</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.440" end="00:05:15.919" style="s2">minimum number of rules because otherwise the enforcement costs accrue and you end up</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.110" end="00:05:18.740" style="s2">constraining yourself and the child too much and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.840" end="00:05:24.260" style="s2">minimal necessary force and you might ask well what&#39;s minimal necessary force and the answer to that is</p>
<p begin="00:05:25.980" end="00:05:34.480" style="s2">Minimum intervention necessary to bring the behavior to a halt as rapidly and harmlessly as possible and that has to be negotiated with the child</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.640" end="00:05:37.540" style="s2">Because some children are much more difficult to stop than others.</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.540" end="00:05:39.780" style="s2">But isn&#39;t it possible that the parent-child relationship</p>
<p begin="00:05:39.780" end="00:05:45.380" style="s2">can be damaged if basic trust and safety is lost?</p>
<p begin="00:05:45.380" end="00:05:48.980" style="s2">It&#39;s absolutely the case that it&#39;s it will be damaged yes, but the application of</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.180" end="00:05:56.080" style="s2">judicious disciplinary force doesn&#39;t damage the relationship it actually strengthens it and everyone knows this. look if</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.360" end="00:06:04.140" style="s2">If you have a relationship with your wife, let&#39;s say the relationship is partly based on mutual respect</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.360" end="00:06:09.200" style="s2">Not merely on mutual love. It&#39;s also based on mutual respect and you</p>
<p begin="00:06:09.460" end="00:06:12.060" style="s2">everyone tests out their partner to</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.200" end="00:06:15.140" style="s2">Determine what their limits are and if you&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.300" end="00:06:20.860" style="s2">Subject to corrective action on the part of your partner. You will have no respect for them</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.860" end="00:06:23.340" style="s2">Your relationship will just deteriorate very rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.480" end="00:06:29.140" style="s2">so and it&#39;s very important to understand that the limits that you place on children are not something that</p>
<p begin="00:06:29.580" end="00:06:34.160" style="s2">Impede their child-parent relationship, but actually further it, substantially.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.660" end="00:06:36.640" style="s2">I want to talk about gender equality now</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.640" end="00:06:37.280" style="s2">Yeah.</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.280" end="00:06:43.000" style="s2">In chapter 11 you write about the so called oppression of the patriarchy and you write it looks</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.360" end="00:06:48.789" style="s2">to me like the so-called oppression of the patriarchy was instead an imperfect collective attempt by men and women</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.159" end="00:06:53.438" style="s2">stretching over millennia to free each other from privation disease and tragedy so</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.500" end="00:06:57.549" style="s2">The oppression of women happened because it was practical</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.189" end="00:07:05.289" style="s2">No, the, the oppression of men and women happened because life is difficult and treacherous and</p>
<p begin="00:07:05.810" end="00:07:11.530" style="s2">So we were subject and still are to all sorts of terrible burdens that are intrinsic to life itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.530" end="00:07:14.829" style="s2">I mean one of the things that&#39;s happened is because we&#39;re so</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.409" end="00:07:20.499" style="s2">Technically and materially wealthy right now. We don&#39;t understand what privations our</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.140" end="00:07:26.440" style="s2">Ancestors even a few generations ago faced. I mean it was very difficult for women to function</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.780" end="00:07:33.080" style="s2">Let&#39;s say as, as technical equals in the absence of reliable control of menstruation</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.340" end="00:07:38.199" style="s2">That&#39;s only been a reality for say seventy years and the birth control pill as well</p>
<p begin="00:07:38.200" end="00:07:40.660" style="s2">Is it a major technological revolution.</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.660" end="00:07:42.440" style="s2">You, you mentioned technological advancement?</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.440" end="00:07:43.080" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.080" end="00:07:49.000" style="s2">So the hurdles have been removed in part way but you talk about the so-called oppression of the patriarchy.</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.000" end="00:07:49.720" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.720" end="00:07:51.860" style="s2">Women were oppressed for centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.860" end="00:07:55.389" style="s2">I mean, well, that&#39;s one way of looking at it or the other way of looking at it</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.389" end="00:07:57.370" style="s2">Is that men and women were oppressed for centuries.</p>
<p begin="00:07:57.370" end="00:08:03.020" style="s2">I mean there are certain burdens that women bore that men didn&#39;t bear but the opposite is equally true</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.160" end="00:08:07.960" style="s2">Men suffered dreadfully for example in incredibly dangerous occupations,.</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.960" end="00:08:09.960" style="s2">but its a fact that women suffered more than the men.</p>
<p begin="00:08:10.120" end="00:08:16.180" style="s2">I don&#39;t believe that no. I don&#39;t think it is a fact I think that most people suffered by modern standards</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.270" end="00:08:20.740" style="s2">immeasurably and that I don&#39;t buy the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.229" end="00:08:26.438" style="s2">Historical narrative that the fundamental reality of our history was that men were oppressing women</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.439" end="00:08:31.959" style="s2">first of all women aren&#39;t that easy to oppress as you might have noticed if you&#39;ve ever had a relationship with them and</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.719" end="00:08:36.069" style="s2">You might say well it took women a long time to struggle forward</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.260" end="00:08:40.839" style="s2">Until they attained civil rights status that was equivalent to men and I would say that&#39;s true</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.840" end="00:08:47.200" style="s2">But it also was the case for men that it took very long time to struggle forward before there was anything approximating?</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.360" end="00:08:53.480" style="s2">individual rights and that they were granted to women quite rapidly in the aftermath of that and that a lot of that was a</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.020" end="00:08:55.520" style="s2">consequence of</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.520" end="00:08:58.640" style="s2">technological transformation made that sort of thing even possible.</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.640" end="00:09:01.600" style="s2">But we are both privileged white males</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.720" end="00:09:04.160" style="s2">Can we really understand the suffering of women?</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.000" end="00:09:12.940" style="s2">Well, it depends on how how useful your, your capacity for understanding the suffering of others is or how well-developed that</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.940" end="00:09:18.369" style="s2">Is I don&#39;t see that it&#39;s necessarily any more difficult to understand the suffering of women</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.369" end="00:09:24.300" style="s2">Well, I would never pose the question that way because I don&#39;t know how you understand the suffering of a group being an individual</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.300" end="00:09:31.220" style="s2">I don&#39;t think a woman can understand the suffering of women because that makes the that&#39;s predicated on the assumption that a</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.720" end="00:09:37.800" style="s2">Individual can take on the burden of a group and I don&#39;t buy that assumption to begin with. I think we, we vary in</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.000" end="00:09:40.000" style="s2">the ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:40.300" end="00:09:46.980" style="s2">Let&#39;s say empathize with others, but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any evidence whatsoever that you can&#39;t empathize across a gender barrier</p>
<p begin="00:09:47.060" end="00:09:49.240" style="s2">Otherwise no relationship would even be possible.</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.240" end="00:09:53.400" style="s2">A lot of people argue that cultural oppression is still a fact in modern society</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.720" end="00:09:57.280" style="s2">For example, something feminine is considered insulting</p>
<p begin="00:09:57.880" end="00:09:59.880" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t that sustain the oppression of women?</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.460" end="00:10:03.260" style="s2">Well, I think that there are negative</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.500" end="00:10:08.520" style="s2">stereotypes associated with both forms of gendered behavior and that if those are</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.770" end="00:10:16.299" style="s2">Utilized inappropriately, they can result in prejudicial attitudes. I think that most enterprises are</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.210" end="00:10:22.389" style="s2">Imperfect enough so that some residual prejudice remains. It might be sex</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.389" end="00:10:25.600" style="s2">It might be preference by gender or prejudice by gender</p>
<p begin="00:10:25.600" end="00:10:32.180" style="s2">It might be prejudice by race, might be prejudice by ethnicity or, or attractiveness or intelligence or character</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.380" end="00:10:36.840" style="s2">there&#39;s all sorts of things that warp the proper selectivity of</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.940" end="00:10:39.580" style="s2">hierarchies, but I think we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.320" end="00:10:45.000" style="s2">An unbelievably good job at getting rid of those as rapidly as is humanly possible and that we&#39;ve moved</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.280" end="00:10:48.900" style="s2">So fast in that direction so quickly that we deserve some credit for it</p>
<p begin="00:10:49.180" end="00:10:54.720" style="s2">There&#39;s one line in the book where you say you don&#39;t agree with the theory of the feminist revolution of the 20th century</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.720" end="00:10:59.380" style="s2">but isn&#39;t that a fact that the feminist movement of the 20th century had a</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.780" end="00:11:02.880" style="s2">significant impact for gender equality</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.060" end="00:11:04.680" style="s2">No, I don&#39;t really think so.</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.680" end="00:11:06.840" style="s2">What about (unintelligible)who are, what would equal pay?</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.840" end="00:11:09.940" style="s2">What about what happened 60s?</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.940" end="00:11:13.520" style="s2">I think that, I think that to, to, to lay, that to attribute that</p>
<p begin="00:11:13.680" end="00:11:15.800" style="s2">primarily to the feminist political</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.880" end="00:11:16.720" style="s2">movement is</p>
<p begin="00:11:16.720" end="00:11:23.429" style="s2">to give far more credit to the feminist political movement than it deserves and I think the people who are pushing that are primarily</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.500" end="00:11:24.000" style="s2">feminists</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.000" end="00:11:26.000" style="s2">I think that most of what freed</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.140" end="00:11:28.000" style="s2">women was the</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.000" end="00:11:30.580" style="s2">extension of the idea of individual rights</p>
<p begin="00:11:30.720" end="00:11:37.340" style="s2">To everyone including women and that, that was happening not only on the, on the front of women. Let&#39;s say but also</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.960" end="00:11:40.760" style="s2">with regards to people of different races and ethnicities</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.770" end="00:11:46.530" style="s2">I think it&#39;s part of a much broader cultural movement to extend the idea of individual rights universally</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.530" end="00:11:50.009" style="s2">I think that&#39;s deeply embedded in the judeo-christian tradition</p>
<p begin="00:11:50.010" end="00:11:53.040" style="s2">and I think that a very large number of</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.400" end="00:11:58.920" style="s2">Technological innovations played a far more important role in the emancipation of women than feminist political</p>
<p begin="00:11:59.320" end="00:12:00.790" style="s2">ideology even though</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.790" end="00:12:03.640" style="s2">You can point to certain movements like the suffragette movement</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.720" end="00:12:09.520" style="s2">for example that pushed hard to have the vote extended to women, but even that I would say was a</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.060" end="00:12:15.030" style="s2">manifestation of deeper transformations at a cultural and technological level</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.030" end="00:12:19.460" style="s2">I think the people who are pushing the idea that it was the feminists</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.460" end="00:12:26.900" style="s2">It was feminist political macinations that produced the equalization of the situation between men and women are mostly diehard ideological</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.220" end="00:12:31.420" style="s2">Feminists who like to think that way but it doesn&#39;t look to me like that&#39;s a valid historical</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.520" end="00:12:32.900" style="s2">Interpretation in the least.</p>
<p begin="00:12:32.900" end="00:12:34.080" style="s2">I would like to move on now.</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.080" end="00:12:40.740" style="s2">I would like to talk about truthfulness, in Chapter eight and rule eight you write about the lie, the life lie</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.000" end="00:12:41.980" style="s2">Mm-hmm.</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.180" end="00:12:46.780" style="s2">It&#39;s, you say someone living a life lie is attempting to manipulate reality with perception</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.440" end="00:12:49.800" style="s2">Based on what you write in the chapter</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.560" end="00:12:55.100" style="s2">Couldn&#39;t one say that a large part of the population in 21st century</p>
<p begin="00:12:56.100" end="00:13:03.720" style="s2">Live a life lie because they avoid conflict. They say what they think pleases their spouses or their bosses instead of telling the truth</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.720" end="00:13:04.880" style="s2">Oh, yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.880" end="00:13:08.860" style="s2">If they do what is convenient at every given moment instead of saying what they really want.</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.860" end="00:13:09.440" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.440" end="00:13:17.520" style="s2">Well, perhaps not at every given moment, but they certainly fall prey to that temptation. It&#39;s conflict avoidance. Yeah, well as a psychologist</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.580" end="00:13:23.580" style="s2">psychologists deal with a variety of problems, but I would say the two most common normal problem our</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.360" end="00:13:29.420" style="s2">anxiety and depression that would be one class and the other would be lack of assertiveness and</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.060" end="00:13:32.940" style="s2">and lack of assertiveness subsumes the, the</p>
<p begin="00:13:33.520" end="00:13:40.360" style="s2">Problems that you just described people won&#39;t stand up for themselves and say what they need and want and then they don&#39;t negotiate</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.520" end="00:13:43.380" style="s2">properly and you might and they&#39;re avoiding</p>
<p begin="00:13:43.510" end="00:13:50.010" style="s2">They&#39;re avoiding conflict in the short term, which is a form of lie by omission and what that means is that problems</p>
<p begin="00:13:50.530" end="00:13:54.420" style="s2">Aggregate around them that&#39;s often why people end up divorced, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:13:54.420" end="00:13:58.889" style="s2">People will stay married for a long time and one partner will say to the other eventually</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.440" end="00:14:01.680" style="s2">Well, I&#39;ve been unhappy for the last eight years</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.280" end="00:14:04.000" style="s2">it&#39;s like well that</p>
<p begin="00:14:04.000" end="00:14:07.000" style="s2">might have been something to announce in increments</p>
<p begin="00:14:08.160" end="00:14:10.160" style="s2">Say weekly or even daily</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.540" end="00:14:15.600" style="s2">Long before everything accrued to the point where the only possible solution is a catastrophic</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.860" end="00:14:20.360" style="s2">dissolution there&#39;s a lot of conflict involved in setting a relationship straight</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.520" end="00:14:24.740" style="s2">You have to let each other know who you are because you&#39;re different that&#39;s going to cause conflict</p>
<p begin="00:14:24.910" end="00:14:26.410" style="s2">You&#39;re going to conflict about</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.410" end="00:14:33.569" style="s2">Whose job takes priority and win you&#39;re gonna come conflict have conflict about how to spend your free time about how to raise your children</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.820" end="00:14:35.820" style="s2">about how to manage the domestic economy</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.100" end="00:14:43.720" style="s2">About what disciplinary strategies you should use about where to vacation about what to eat like all of those things have to be negotiated</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.920" end="00:14:48.540" style="s2">through and all of that requires truthfulness so that each of you know</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.540" end="00:14:54.059" style="s2">What the other is wants and will be satisfied with and conflict. It&#39;s very very</p>
<p begin="00:14:55.720" end="00:14:59.670" style="s2">What would you say the only thing more exhausting than telling the truth and</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.310" end="00:15:03.540" style="s2">Negotiating with your spouse is not doing it and waiting for the divorce</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.780" end="00:15:08.020" style="s2">Both of them are difficult, but I would recommend the former.</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.020" end="00:15:10.480" style="s2">Yeah, we if we talk about the workplace</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.740" end="00:15:14.460" style="s2">What do you want to say to those viewers that regularly, you know?</p>
<p begin="00:15:15.120" end="00:15:19.700" style="s2">Agree with their bosses and instead of telling the truth. What are they doing to themselves in the long run?</p>
<p begin="00:15:19.840" end="00:15:27.960" style="s2">Well, they&#39;re taking the soul out of their work. You know, let&#39;s say well just imagine for the sake of argument that you</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.060" end="00:15:33.300" style="s2">encounter one annoying thing a day at work a small annoying thing and then let&#39;s say</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.580" end="00:15:36.960" style="s2">for the sake of argument that you could have a little battle about that and</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.510" end="00:15:43.559" style="s2">Improve it somewhat or you could just say it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s like probably doesn&#39;t matter today</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.560" end="00:15:45.570" style="s2">Oh, it might not even matter tomorrow</p>
<p begin="00:15:45.570" end="00:15:48.029" style="s2">But if you make a thousand decisions like that</p>
<p begin="00:15:48.029" end="00:15:51.629" style="s2">Which you will do or three years then now you have a thousand things</p>
<p begin="00:15:51.850" end="00:15:55.980" style="s2">Bugging you at work, and if you wait for five years then it&#39;s well</p>
<p begin="00:15:55.980" end="00:16:01.640" style="s2">Then it&#39;s 2,000 things and the same thing happens with your kids and the same thing happens in your marriage those things</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.860" end="00:16:03.820" style="s2">Accrue and they turn into a monster.</p>
<p begin="00:16:04.080" end="00:16:09.000" style="s2">Yeah you but you would agree that conflict avoidance is practical sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:09.000" end="00:16:11.020" style="s2">People do it just go along with  their...</p>
<p begin="00:16:11.040" end="00:16:16.060" style="s2">No, I don&#39;t actually I think in a marriage for example, there&#39;s almost nothing so small you shouldn&#39;t fight about it</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.060" end="00:16:20.040" style="s2">But the question is what does fight mean? It doesn&#39;t mean win</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.949" end="00:16:24.659" style="s2">Like if if you and I have a relationship, let&#39;s say it&#39;s a business partnership</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.660" end="00:16:28.500" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t really matter if we have a relationship and we have a</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.350" end="00:16:32.070" style="s2">Difference of opinion we need to battle it through</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.199" end="00:16:38.939" style="s2">But the purpose of the battle isn&#39;t so that your viewpoint prevails or that my viewpoint prevails because either of us might be wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.130" end="00:16:45.390" style="s2">The purpose is to engage in the conflictual exchange of opinion so that we can see a joint path</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.670" end="00:16:47.260" style="s2">forward to peace and</p>
<p begin="00:16:47.260" end="00:16:52.859" style="s2">that&#39;s and that&#39;s the thing is like if you&#39;re fighting with your wife the first thing to remember if you&#39;re fighting with your wife is</p>
<p begin="00:16:52.860" end="00:16:54.860" style="s2">You have to live with her</p>
<p begin="00:16:55.240" end="00:17:02.159" style="s2">So maybe beating her in the argument is not the right outcome. What the right outcome is is saying what you have to say</p>
<p begin="00:17:02.800" end="00:17:06.540" style="s2">listening to what she has to say and see if you guys can come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:17:06.610" end="00:17:09.510" style="s2">Mutually agreed upon solution that will make the problem go away</p>
<p begin="00:17:10.179" end="00:17:12.629" style="s2">so if we explore conversation</p>
<p begin="00:17:13.299" end="00:17:19.109" style="s2">Between people in society a lot of these conversations are full of falsehoods and lies</p>
<p begin="00:17:19.620" end="00:17:21.620" style="s2">People are nice to people they dislike</p>
<p begin="00:17:22.340" end="00:17:27.420" style="s2">They&#39;re being fake. because we try to be friendly. Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:17:27.960" end="00:17:31.940" style="s2">Is it in fact morally wrong to live your life in that way?</p>
<p begin="00:17:31.940" end="00:17:34.760" style="s2">Yes. Yeah it is it is I mean</p>
<p begin="00:17:35.940" end="00:17:37.680" style="s2">you can&#39;t avoid the</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.410" end="00:17:45.299" style="s2">Necessary conflict of negotiation towards peace. If you avoid it all that it means is that it accrues and multiplies.</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.299" end="00:17:48.899" style="s2">It&#39;s the oldest one of the oldest stories we have the oldest stories</p>
<p begin="00:17:48.900" end="00:17:55.949" style="s2">We have point to that as part of the prime moral doctrine, you know, it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a form of impulsivity, you know</p>
<p begin="00:17:55.950" end="00:17:57.950" style="s2">If you only do what you want in the moment</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.860" end="00:18:03.680" style="s2">Impulsively that there would be consequences of that into the future which is why you shouldn&#39;t act impulsively</p>
<p begin="00:18:04.920" end="00:18:09.360" style="s2">Impulsively avoiding conflict is exactly the same and people, same problem</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.360" end="00:18:15.540" style="s2">people know this, you know, if if someone&#39;s casually rude to you in, in, a bus driver for example, and</p>
<p begin="00:18:16.660" end="00:18:22.709" style="s2">You&#39;ll, you, there&#39;s always the possibility that you&#39;ll stew for hours over what you should have said</p>
<p begin="00:18:23.530" end="00:18:25.530" style="s2">It&#39;s like when someone</p>
<p begin="00:18:26.740" end="00:18:32.819" style="s2">Transgresses against you let&#39;s say you have to say what you have to say. You don&#39;t have to say it as if you&#39;re the</p>

<p begin="00:18:39.970" end="00:18:43.940" style="s2">You know because there&#39;s always the possibility that you&#39;re wrong and you want to listen</p>
<p begin="00:18:44.040" end="00:18:50.120" style="s2">This is also why you want to listen to your partner your, your, your spouse even if what they&#39;re saying to you is</p>
<p begin="00:18:50.220" end="00:18:51.840" style="s2">You find very annoying</p>
<p begin="00:18:51.840" end="00:18:56.920" style="s2">It&#39;s always possible that they&#39;re right and you should listen because if they&#39;re right then they can stop you from</p>

<p begin="00:19:08.180" end="00:19:15.400" style="s2">You write in the book there is no faith and no courage and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.660" end="00:19:22.199" style="s2">What do you say to those viewers that don&#39;t pursue their dreams and are locked into their careers?</p>

<p begin="00:19:27.210" end="00:19:33.030" style="s2">well, the first thing I would say is well, you should be afraid of taking risks and pursuing something meaningful, but</p>
<p begin="00:19:33.790" end="00:19:37.259" style="s2">You should be more afraid of staying where you are if it&#39;s making you miserable</p>

<p begin="00:19:59.100" end="00:20:02.960" style="s2">and if you&#39;re miserable in your job now and you change nothing in five years</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.960" end="00:20:05.920" style="s2">You&#39;ll be much more miserable and you&#39;ll be a lot older.</p>
<p begin="00:20:05.920" end="00:20:08.260" style="s2">but isn&#39;t it a luxury to pursue what is meaningful?</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.360" end="00:20:15.780" style="s2">Our viewers have mortgages. They have children. they have payments and loans. It&#39;s a luxury to pursue because we lack the resources</p>
<p begin="00:20:15.780" end="00:20:19.600" style="s2">Well, I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t remember now. I&#39;m not talking about what makes you happy</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.470" end="00:20:22.649" style="s2">It&#39;s a luxury to pursue what makes you happy</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.780" end="00:20:28.080" style="s2">It&#39;s a moral obligation to pursue what you find meaningful. And that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s easy</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.080" end="00:20:32.860" style="s2">it might require sacrifice if you need to change your job to let&#39;s say you have</p>
<p begin="00:20:33.360" end="00:20:37.140" style="s2">a family and, and, and, and children and, and a mortgage you have responsibilities</p>
<p begin="00:20:37.980" end="00:20:43.840" style="s2">You&#39;ve already picked up those responsibilities. You don&#39;t just get to walk away scot-free and say well I don&#39;t like my job</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.860" end="00:20:49.709" style="s2">I quit that&#39;s no strategy. But what you might have to do is you think well this job is killing my soul</p>
<p begin="00:20:49.710" end="00:20:53.159" style="s2">All right. So what do I have to do about that? Well, I have to look for another job</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.440" end="00:20:58.679" style="s2">Well, no one wants to hire me. It&#39;s like okay. Maybe you need to educate yourself more</p>
<p begin="00:20:58.679" end="00:21:05.368" style="s2">Maybe you need to update your your curriculum vitae your resume. Maybe you need to overcome your fear of being interviewed</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.950" end="00:21:08.220" style="s2">Maybe you need to sharpen your social skills</p>
<p begin="00:21:08.220" end="00:21:12.509" style="s2">Like you you have to think about these things strategically if you&#39;re going to switch careers</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.509" end="00:21:17.540" style="s2">You have to do it like an intelligent responsible person that might take you a couple of years of</p>
<p begin="00:21:18.060" end="00:21:20.080" style="s2">Effort to do properly.</p>
<p begin="00:21:20.080" end="00:21:22.980" style="s2">When you say pursue something meaningful. Is it important to have a vocation?</p>
<p begin="00:21:23.880" end="00:21:28.880" style="s2">I think it&#39;s more important to, to have a, an ethos, an ethic</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.080" end="00:21:32.789" style="s2">So I have a program for example called the future authoring program</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.789" end="00:21:38.969" style="s2">which is a writing program that enables people to develop a vision for their life and then to develop a strategy and</p>
<p begin="00:21:39.249" end="00:21:41.249" style="s2">So it&#39;s based on the idea</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.259" end="00:21:46.139" style="s2">Imagine that and it&#39;s an extension of the ideas in the book or at least something along the same lines</p>
<p begin="00:21:46.749" end="00:21:52.259" style="s2">The first thing that you want to do is figure out imagine you were taking care of yourself like you were someone you cared for</p>
<p begin="00:21:52.259" end="00:21:53.970" style="s2">Which is rule number two, by the way</p>
<p begin="00:21:53.970" end="00:21:54.879" style="s2">essentially</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.879" end="00:22:00.359" style="s2">Then you should figure out well if you could have what you needed and wanted what would it be?</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.669" end="00:22:06.689" style="s2">What sort of friends would you have? What would your family relationships look like? How would you conduct yourself with your children?</p>
<p begin="00:22:06.720" end="00:22:12.749" style="s2">How would you educate yourself you need to think through how it is that your life could be properly</p>
<p begin="00:22:13.419" end="00:22:19.679" style="s2">Arranged if you had that ability and then you can aim at that. And the funny thing is is that if you do</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.200" end="00:22:23.640" style="s2">Pause it a goal of that sort and work towards it</p>
<p begin="00:22:23.920" end="00:22:29.099" style="s2">you will move towards it the goal will change because you&#39;ll learn things along the way but I mean I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.590" end="00:22:36.120" style="s2">dealt with hundreds of people in my clinical and consulting practice and we set a goal we develop a vision and</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.220" end="00:22:38.370" style="s2">Work towards it and it things</p>
<p begin="00:22:39.360" end="00:22:46.520" style="s2">Inevitably get better for people. So it&#39;s not a luxury. It&#39;s it&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s a moral responsibility and it isn&#39;t happiness</p>
<p begin="00:22:46.520" end="00:22:49.180" style="s2">It&#39;s it&#39;s not the pursuit isn&#39;t for happiness.</p>
<p begin="00:22:49.180" end="00:22:51.640" style="s2">It&#39;s a moral responsibility to pursue what is meaning.</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.640" end="00:22:52.640" style="s2">Absolutely.</p>
<p begin="00:22:52.640" end="00:22:55.240" style="s2">I would like to end the interview with a, with</p>
<p begin="00:22:55.600" end="00:22:57.780" style="s2">Citing criticism from your friend.</p>
<p begin="00:22:57.780" end="00:22:58.720" style="s2">Oh, yes.</p>
<p begin="00:22:58.720" end="00:23:00.040" style="s2">Bernard shift.</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.040" end="00:23:00.620" style="s2">Yes</p>
<p begin="00:23:00.620" end="00:23:03.380" style="s2">Your friend for many years and former colleague at the University of Toronto</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.380" end="00:23:04.160" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:23:04.160" end="00:23:07.480" style="s2">He wrote an article about you in the Toronto Star recently.</p>
<p begin="00:23:07.480" end="00:23:08.340" style="s2">Yes.</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.340" end="00:23:13.640" style="s2">It was quite hard criticism on what you&#39;ve been doing in the last few years and he wrote</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.740" end="00:23:18.020" style="s2">Jordan is fighting to maintain the status quo to keep chaos at bay or so. He believes</p>
<p begin="00:23:18.160" end="00:23:21.840" style="s2">He is not a free speech warrior. He is a social order Warrior</p>
<p begin="00:23:22.540" end="00:23:24.860" style="s2">Are you a social order warrior?</p>
<p begin="00:23:24.860" end="00:23:30.540" style="s2">I think that people can decide that for themselves. I mean one of the things that Bernie</p>
<p begin="00:23:30.680" end="00:23:32.679" style="s2">criticized was my</p>
<p begin="00:23:32.680" end="00:23:38.860" style="s2">lecturing style at the University. Now all those lectures are online all the</p>
<p begin="00:23:39.100" end="00:23:45.980" style="s2">Essentially like a representative sample of my lectures from the last 30 years are online and I mean hundreds of hours</p>
<p begin="00:23:45.990" end="00:23:47.890" style="s2">it&#39;s not a few fragments and</p>
<p begin="00:23:47.890" end="00:23:50.980" style="s2">hundreds of thousands of people have watched them and the</p>
<p begin="00:23:51.180" end="00:23:55.360" style="s2">Criticisms that Bernie leveled at me have not been leveled at me by the watchers</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.360" end="00:23:59.800" style="s2">And so people can go watch the lectures and make up their own mind about that.</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.800" end="00:24:01.800" style="s2">But he also questions your motives</p>
<p begin="00:24:01.860" end="00:24:05.880" style="s2">he, he wants to know what your end game is all about. I mean, what is your primary motive?</p>
<p begin="00:24:06.520" end="00:24:10.880" style="s2">My primary motive as a clinical psychologist and educator is to help individuals</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.500" end="00:24:18.520" style="s2">Live more meaningful and productive lives. In harmony with their families and their community. That&#39;s my motive and</p>
<p begin="00:24:19.120" end="00:24:23.840" style="s2">The evidence for that I think is well if people go online and first of all</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.840" end="00:24:28.900" style="s2">You can watch the lectures and decide for yourself, but you can also go. There&#39;s I suspect probably</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.280" end="00:24:31.380" style="s2">Maybe</p>
<p begin="00:24:31.380" end="00:24:36.600" style="s2">250,000 people have commented on the lectures and their effects on them. And so</p>
<p begin="00:24:37.420" end="00:24:41.999" style="s2">That&#39;s what people say. I&#39;m watching the lectures. Yeah, I&#39;m trying to develop a vision for my life</p>
<p begin="00:24:42.000" end="00:24:43.720" style="s2">I&#39;m trying to become more</p>
<p begin="00:24:43.720" end="00:24:48.660" style="s2">Responsible and its really helping and that&#39;s and that&#39;s what I hear all the time</p>
<p begin="00:24:48.660" end="00:24:51.479" style="s2">When I do these public lectures, which aren&#39;t political</p>
<p begin="00:24:51.480" end="00:24:58.080" style="s2">But when we gain success we raise the bar we set our ambitions higher. I mean, what is your end game?</p>
<p begin="00:24:58.080" end="00:24:59.080" style="s2">What do you want?</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.100" end="00:25:02.400" style="s2">That&#39;s all that&#39;s what I want. I want I want to help as many</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.880" end="00:25:06.740" style="s2">Individuals as possible become more courageous</p>
<p begin="00:25:07.390" end="00:25:11.369" style="s2">more truthful and more engaged in the pursuit of</p>
<p begin="00:25:12.600" end="00:25:16.600" style="s2">Individual familial and social harmony. That&#39;s what I want.</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.680" end="00:25:18.820" style="s2">You&#39;re pursuing what is meaningful.</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.680" end="00:25:27.000" style="s2">I&#39;m pursuing. I believe that to be the case. It&#39;s certainly meaningful to me. I mean there isn&#39;t everywhere I go now</p>
<p begin="00:25:28.080" end="00:25:31.740" style="s2">Doesn&#39;t matter where I land and what airport or if I walk down the street</p>
<p begin="00:25:32.760" end="00:25:38.840" style="s2">Three or four people will come up to me and they&#39;ll tell me I was in a dark place. I was anxious depressed</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.360" end="00:25:45.500" style="s2">nihilistic, drug-addicted, alcoholic, homeless, in jail. You name it bad relationship with my girlfriend.</p>
<p begin="00:25:46.120" end="00:25:50.420" style="s2">Bad relationship with my parents. I&#39;ve been watching your lectures or reading your book</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.440" end="00:25:54.809" style="s2">I&#39;ve been trying to tell the truth to get my life together and everything is way better</p>
<p begin="00:25:54.809" end="00:25:59.548" style="s2">And so then you think well if you could have what you wanted and what would be meaningful</p>
<p begin="00:25:59.740" end="00:26:04.780" style="s2">You imagine you could go anywhere in the world and people would come up to you that were strangers and tell you that</p>
<p begin="00:26:05.160" end="00:26:07.000" style="s2">That&#39;s as good as it gets.</p>
<p begin="00:26:07.000" end="00:26:09.260" style="s2">What about politics? Do you have political ambitions?</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.260" end="00:26:09.760" style="s2">No.</p>
<p begin="00:26:09.760" end="00:26:10.780" style="s2">No political ambitions</p>
<p begin="00:26:11.040" end="00:26:16.900" style="s2">No, I I have ambitions to speak with people who are politically motivated if they want to speak with me</p>
<p begin="00:26:17.140" end="00:26:19.469" style="s2">But personally I&#39;ve already decided that</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.740" end="00:26:22.600" style="s2">what I&#39;m doing at the moment is more and</p>
<p begin="00:26:22.780" end="00:26:29.280" style="s2">I thought this, I&#39;ve made this choice multiple times in my life that this approach is more suitable for me.</p>
<p begin="00:26:29.280" end="00:26:31.120" style="s2">Okay, Mr. Peterson Thank you for your time.</p>
<p begin="00:26:31.120" end="00:26:33.160" style="s2">Thank you very much for the interview</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.420" end="00:26:36.420" style="s2">[I spent much more time on this than I initially expected, when will people get paid for transcribing YT videos]</p>
