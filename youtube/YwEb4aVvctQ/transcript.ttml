<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:31.340" style="s2">they became nothing but flexible copper</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.419" end="00:07:33.979" style="s2">this was actually the world&#39;s first</p>

<p begin="00:07:46.969" end="00:07:51.560" style="s2">thing that amazes me is how history just</p>

<p begin="00:08:15.319" end="00:08:19.430" style="s2">interesting thing about the</p>
<p begin="00:08:16.250" end="00:08:20.840" style="s2">Peloponnesian War was how it started I</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.430" end="00:08:22.990" style="s2">would say one of the interesting</p>
<p begin="00:08:20.840" end="00:08:27.110" style="s2">parallels is that it started really with</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.990" end="00:08:29.990" style="s2">Athens at its height and with a level of</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.110" end="00:08:32.089" style="s2">hubris that set them down the road</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.990" end="00:08:32.910" style="s2">towards ruin perhaps they felt that they</p>

<p begin="00:08:32.910" end="00:08:39.180" style="s2">you know superior kanika mistakes a new</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.930" end="00:08:42.690" style="s2">better exactly and they ended up</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.180" end="00:08:44.220" style="s2">destroying the society as a result it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.690" end="00:08:46.770" style="s2">a road that we&#39;re going down today right</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.220" end="00:08:49.710" style="s2">I think absolutely yeah there was a play</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.770" end="00:08:52.140" style="s2">written certainly after the token Asian</p>
<p begin="00:08:49.710" end="00:08:54.540" style="s2">Wars about the worthlessness of the</p>

<p begin="00:08:54.540" end="00:09:01.500" style="s2">coinage at the time so we go from gold</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.320" end="00:09:04.980" style="s2">and silver very high-value money to a</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.500" end="00:09:06.870" style="s2">currency that has a face value and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.980" end="00:09:11.160" style="s2">the first example that I can find in</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.870" end="00:09:12.810" style="s2">history where a war was war and great</p>
<p begin="00:09:11.160" end="00:09:17.040" style="s2">public works were being funded through</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.810" end="00:09:18.990" style="s2">deficit spending what you&#39;ve just seen</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.040" end="00:09:21.000" style="s2">is the first recorded example of one of</p>
<p begin="00:09:18.990" end="00:09:24.840" style="s2">the most predictable hidden secrets of</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.000" end="00:09:26.520" style="s2">money the seven stages of Empire it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.840" end="00:09:29.100" style="s2">long-term cycle that echoes throughout</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.520" end="00:09:31.110" style="s2">history right to this very day and is</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.100" end="00:09:33.780" style="s2">basically a societal pendulum that</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.110" end="00:09:36.390" style="s2">swings from quality money to quantity</p>
<p begin="00:09:33.780" end="00:09:39.540" style="s2">currency and back again to quality money</p>
<p begin="00:09:36.390" end="00:09:41.550" style="s2">it always plays out in seven stages it</p>
<p begin="00:09:39.540" end="00:09:43.770" style="s2">always ends with gold delivering a</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.550" end="00:09:45.270" style="s2">knockout blow to debased currencies and</p>
<p begin="00:09:43.770" end="00:09:48.030" style="s2">it goes like this</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.270" end="00:09:49.920" style="s2">Stage one the country starts out with</p>
<p begin="00:09:48.030" end="00:09:52.940" style="s2">good money which is either gold or</p>
<p begin="00:09:49.920" end="00:09:55.830" style="s2">silver or it&#39;s backed by gold or silver</p>
<p begin="00:09:52.940" end="00:09:58.380" style="s2">stage two as it develops economically</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.830" end="00:10:00.780" style="s2">and socially it begins to take on more</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.380" end="00:10:03.900" style="s2">and more economic burdens adding layer</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.780" end="00:10:07.470" style="s2">upon layer of Public Works stage three</p>
<p begin="00:10:03.900" end="00:10:10.110" style="s2">as its economic affluence grows so does</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.470" end="00:10:12.770" style="s2">its political influence and it increases</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.110" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">expenditures to fund a massive military</p>
<p begin="00:10:12.770" end="00:10:19.290" style="s2">Stage four eventually it puts its</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:22.240" style="s2">military to use and expenditures explode</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.290" end="00:10:23.830" style="s2">stage-five to fund the war it steals the</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.240" end="00:10:26.560" style="s2">wealth of its people by debasing their</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.830" end="00:10:28.300" style="s2">coinage with base metals or by replacing</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.560" end="00:10:32.080" style="s2">their money with currency that can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.300" end="00:10:34.180" style="s2">created in unlimited quantities stage 6</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.080" end="00:10:36.550" style="s2">the loss in purchasing power of the</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.180" end="00:10:38.650" style="s2">expanded currency supply is sensed by</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.550" end="00:10:40.900" style="s2">the population in the financial markets</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.650" end="00:10:44.440" style="s2">triggering a loss of faith in the</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.900" end="00:10:46.720" style="s2">currency stage 7 a mass movement out of</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.440" end="00:10:49.390" style="s2">currency into precious metals and other</p>

<p begin="00:10:49.390" end="00:10:53.380" style="s2">collapses and gold and silver rise in</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.610" end="00:10:55.180" style="s2">price as they account for the huge</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.380" end="00:10:57.820" style="s2">quantity of currency that was created</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.180" end="00:10:59.740" style="s2">this process transfers massive wealth to</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.820" end="00:11:02.320" style="s2">those who had the foresight to position</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.740" end="00:11:03.900" style="s2">themselves beforehand in real money gold</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.320" end="00:11:07.540" style="s2">and silver</p>

<p begin="00:11:07.540" end="00:11:12.160" style="s2">steals from the poor and middle class</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.370" end="00:11:14.380" style="s2">and transfers the wealth to the banks we</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.160" end="00:11:15.790" style="s2">see this throughout history and it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.380" end="00:11:18.520" style="s2">just repeating over and over again</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.790" end="00:11:20.410" style="s2">what&#39;s happening in Greece right now is</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.520" end="00:11:23.950" style="s2">basically the same thing that was</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.410" end="00:11:26.770" style="s2">happening back in 407 BC the deficit</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.950" end="00:11:28.870" style="s2">spending to fund all of these public</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.770" end="00:11:31.840" style="s2">works and the debasement of their</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.870" end="00:11:34.180" style="s2">currency supply caused them to become</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.840" end="00:11:36.340" style="s2">nothing but a satellite of Rome today</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.180" end="00:11:39.000" style="s2">they&#39;re becoming nothing but a satellite</p>
<p begin="00:11:36.340" end="00:11:39.000" style="s2">of the banks</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.660" end="00:11:44.690" style="s2">well the idea of Gresham&#39;s laws simply</p>
<p begin="00:11:43.340" end="00:11:46.670" style="s2">that people are going to hold on to</p>
<p begin="00:11:44.690" end="00:11:49.820" style="s2">what&#39;s value and spend what is valuable</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.670" end="00:11:52.700" style="s2">way way back in my youth I was 11 years</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.820" end="00:11:56.990" style="s2">old when went from a silver based</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.700" end="00:12:01.070" style="s2">monetary system to a purely Fiat system</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.990" end="00:12:02.540" style="s2">people saw that silver was money we got</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.070" end="00:12:06.170" style="s2">used to it they didn&#39;t really think</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.540" end="00:12:08.450" style="s2">about it and in 1965 under President</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.170" end="00:12:10.640" style="s2">Johnson he basically said it was so much</p>
<p begin="00:12:08.450" end="00:12:12.980" style="s2">too valuable to money we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:12:10.640" end="00:12:14.630" style="s2">just start coming out these substitutes</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.980" end="00:12:18.770" style="s2">which were what we call cupro-nickel</p>
<p begin="00:12:14.630" end="00:12:21.890" style="s2">coins they were nickel or copper plated</p>
<p begin="00:12:18.770" end="00:12:24.950" style="s2">with nickel time and of course the metal</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.890" end="00:12:28.850" style="s2">value was far less and I understood as a</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.950" end="00:12:30.800" style="s2">kid and yet very few adults really seem</p>
<p begin="00:12:28.850" end="00:12:33.170" style="s2">to get the idea what was really going on</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.800" end="00:12:36.710" style="s2">or a few and all it takes a few and of</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.170" end="00:12:39.410" style="s2">course the bishop law took effect so the</p>
<p begin="00:12:36.710" end="00:12:41.390" style="s2">currency came out of circulation rapidly</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.410" end="00:12:44.330" style="s2">it&#39;s very interesting to me you know</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.390" end="00:12:47.390" style="s2">knowing monetary history fairly well is</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.330" end="00:12:50.180" style="s2">there always you know put out in silver</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.390" end="00:12:52.820" style="s2">looking or gold looking form and in a</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.180" end="00:12:55.160" style="s2">most cases you&#39;ll have a factory look</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.820" end="00:12:57.620" style="s2">rather interesting and some of them are</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.160" end="00:13:01.100" style="s2">like so we ran inside a school on the</p>
<p begin="00:12:57.620" end="00:13:03.320" style="s2">outside with the look they have no value</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.100" end="00:13:06.320" style="s2">at all really other than melt value of</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.320" end="00:13:08.720" style="s2">pot now to me it&#39;s sort of subconscious</p>
<p begin="00:13:06.320" end="00:13:10.520" style="s2">why are they making them gold colored</p>
<p begin="00:13:08.720" end="00:13:13.100" style="s2">why they making them silver colored I</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.520" end="00:13:15.050" style="s2">think there&#39;s an inherent knowledge in</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.100" end="00:13:17.300" style="s2">the human specie that knows that gold</p>
<p begin="00:13:15.050" end="00:13:19.190" style="s2">and silver have value so if they look in</p>
<p begin="00:13:17.300" end="00:13:21.260" style="s2">their pocket may see something gold</p>
<p begin="00:13:19.190" end="00:13:23.060" style="s2">colored or silver colored it makes it</p>
<p begin="00:13:21.260" end="00:13:25.250" style="s2">didn&#39;t kind of a warm fuzzy feeling</p>
<p begin="00:13:23.060" end="00:13:28.360" style="s2">that&#39;s like oh yeah you know but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:13:25.250" end="00:13:28.360" style="s2">no value in these coins</p>
<p begin="00:13:32.550" end="00:13:37.230" style="s2">the next question is how does this</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.560" end="00:13:38.340" style="s2">affect you my next stop was in London</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.230" end="00:13:40.130" style="s2">where I&#39;d been asked to give a</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.340" end="00:13:42.720" style="s2">presentation to a group of businessmen</p>
<p begin="00:13:40.130" end="00:13:44.790" style="s2">they wanted to understand the reason</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.720" end="00:13:46.650" style="s2">that gold had surged recently and I</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.790" end="00:13:49.470" style="s2">explained to them that to understand</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.650" end="00:13:51.930" style="s2">gold you have to understand the monetary</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.470" end="00:13:53.340" style="s2">history once you see where we&#39;ve come</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.930" end="00:13:55.230" style="s2">from you can get a much clearer</p>
<p begin="00:13:53.340" end="00:13:58.500" style="s2">understanding of how the seven stages of</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.230" end="00:14:00.420" style="s2">empire are playing out right now we</p>
<p begin="00:13:58.500" end="00:14:02.430" style="s2">weren&#39;t allowed to show their faces but</p>
<p begin="00:14:00.420" end="00:14:05.550" style="s2">we were allowed to film my presentation</p>
<p begin="00:14:02.430" end="00:14:07.410" style="s2">so here it is the last hundred and forty</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.550" end="00:14:08.550" style="s2">years of monetary history condensed in</p>

<p begin="00:26:54.790" end="00:26:58.510" style="s2">accounts gold was a line item in the</p>
<p begin="00:26:56.620" end="00:27:01.120" style="s2">capital account you had to understand</p>

<p begin="00:27:01.120" end="00:27:04.480" style="s2">you know could equilibrate in terms of</p>
