<p begin="00:00:20.520" end="00:00:28.740" style="s2">read on my thumb the climate change and</p>
<p begin="00:00:24.150" end="00:00:32.399" style="s2">the current weather and our governments</p>
<p begin="00:00:28.740" end="00:00:33.809" style="s2">are trying corporations are you been</p>
<p begin="00:00:32.399" end="00:00:36.300" style="s2">kind of doing it to the best of their</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.809" end="00:00:38.910" style="s2">ability but they suck at it I mean</p>
<p begin="00:00:36.300" end="00:00:40.680" style="s2">governments can&#39;t they&#39;re just not</p>
<p begin="00:00:38.910" end="00:00:43.110" style="s2">designed to create solutions they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:40.680" end="00:00:48.899" style="s2">only in office for 44 years they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.110" end="00:00:50.910" style="s2">currently owned by the 1% and work in</p>

<p begin="00:00:50.910" end="00:00:55.230" style="s2">interest so which is not going to be the</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.010" end="00:00:57.300" style="s2">rest now their best interest is also to</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.230" end="00:01:01.050" style="s2">have a surviving planet so they&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.300" end="00:01:03.629" style="s2">willing to maybe kinda sorta look into</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.050" end="00:01:05.640" style="s2">kin to it and make some deals and spend</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.629" end="00:01:06.600" style="s2">a lot of money making those deals but</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.640" end="00:01:08.189" style="s2">they&#39;re not really designed to take</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.600" end="00:01:11.040" style="s2">action whenever our governments take</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.189" end="00:01:12.720" style="s2">action they then like simultaneously</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.040" end="00:01:14.310" style="s2">they both don&#39;t have like don&#39;t kind of</p>
<p begin="00:01:12.720" end="00:01:16.290" style="s2">give a what the populace thinks</p>
<p begin="00:01:14.310" end="00:01:17.400" style="s2">they get in on a certain platform and</p>
<p begin="00:01:16.290" end="00:01:19.409" style="s2">then don&#39;t follow through on that</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.400" end="00:01:21.540" style="s2">platform aren&#39;t held accountable for</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.409" end="00:01:23.009" style="s2">that and also they don&#39;t really care</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.540" end="00:01:24.180" style="s2">because all they have to do is get it</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.009" end="00:01:25.439" style="s2">elected again they just have to be the</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.180" end="00:01:28.229" style="s2">best of the options that are available</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.439" end="00:01:34.320" style="s2">and what they care about is the donor</p>
<p begin="00:01:28.229" end="00:01:35.939" style="s2">money coming in to do that and so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.320" end="00:01:40.650" style="s2">just not they can&#39;t work in our in that</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.939" end="00:01:43.350" style="s2">best interest its corporations and our</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.650" end="00:01:46.110" style="s2">entire economic system is based on</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.350" end="00:01:49.049" style="s2">passing the risk of environmental</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.110" end="00:01:51.420" style="s2">catastrophes of health care of all of</p>

<p begin="00:01:59.100" end="00:02:04.610" style="s2">account for them and pay in any way for</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.310" end="00:02:08.420" style="s2">what for the devastation and</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.610" end="00:02:09.830" style="s2">issues that are causing sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.420" end="00:02:12.080" style="s2">knowingly and a lot of times just</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.830" end="00:02:13.460" style="s2">willfully ignorant like we don&#39;t even</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.080" end="00:02:15.260" style="s2">want to know that we&#39;re causing problems</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.460" end="00:02:16.700" style="s2">because having helped to possibly pay</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.260" end="00:02:18.560" style="s2">for them you don&#39;t want to pay for it</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.700" end="00:02:22.700" style="s2">that takes into our profit and all they</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.560" end="00:02:26.600" style="s2">do if we created this entity that is by</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.700" end="00:02:32.360" style="s2">law a sociopath I was gonna for all</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.600" end="00:02:34.130" style="s2">those definitions confused but someone</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.360" end="00:02:38.750" style="s2">who does not care at all with their</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.130" end="00:02:41.330" style="s2">actions create or do and only care about</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.750" end="00:02:42.890" style="s2">benefiting themselves and the</p>
<p begin="00:02:41.330" end="00:02:46.489" style="s2">corporation&#39;s aren&#39;t going to do it and</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.890" end="00:02:49.910" style="s2">governments aren&#39;t gonna do it and our</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.489" end="00:02:52.790" style="s2">species is reliant on the fact that it</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.910" end="00:02:54.739" style="s2">needs to get solved I don&#39;t have the</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.790" end="00:02:57.200" style="s2">solution for climate change like I know</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.739" end="00:03:00.170" style="s2">I&#39;m not sitting on the and here it&#39;s how</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.200" end="00:03:01.940" style="s2">we actually reverse it but understanding</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.170" end="00:03:03.860" style="s2">the science of how we know that it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.940" end="00:03:05.420" style="s2">human caused and what&#39;s causing it of</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.860" end="00:03:08.239" style="s2">all of the were pumping into the</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.420" end="00:03:10.850" style="s2">atmosphere and all of the in the actual</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.239" end="00:03:12.739" style="s2">numbers if that&#39;s available to us</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.850" end="00:03:15.440" style="s2">especially in a way that we can see it</p>
<p begin="00:03:12.739" end="00:03:18.590" style="s2">it&#39;s not credible numbers like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.440" end="00:03:19.970" style="s2">actual visually represented in a way</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.590" end="00:03:22.910" style="s2">that we can play with it and look at it</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.970" end="00:03:24.110" style="s2">and not just okay it&#39;s a meme great but</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.910" end="00:03:25.970" style="s2">how do I know it&#39;s true what&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.110" end="00:03:28.910" style="s2">reference how do I go deeper into it and</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.970" end="00:03:30.590" style="s2">see if I can believe that and what just</p>
<p begin="00:03:28.910" end="00:03:33.230" style="s2">the bigger picture of science say about</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.590" end="00:03:35.450" style="s2">it the more we have that and the more</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.230" end="00:03:37.070" style="s2">when people have an idea on how to help</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.450" end="00:03:38.600" style="s2">that I mean there are people cram videos</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.070" end="00:03:42.860" style="s2">on how to like clean the ocean and how</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.600" end="00:03:45.170" style="s2">to the truth is our world like our</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.860" end="00:03:46.640" style="s2">bodies are extremely resilient and</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.170" end="00:03:51.049" style="s2">amazing and healing themselves when we</p>
<p begin="00:03:46.640" end="00:03:52.880" style="s2">stop doing to them um I&#39;m body but</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.049" end="00:03:55.610" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing too so</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.880" end="00:03:57.739" style="s2">it&#39;s hard to not do it anymore but</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.610" end="00:04:01.130" style="s2">there&#39;s possibly something or it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:03:57.739" end="00:04:03.769" style="s2">all right how it goes at this planet</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.130" end="00:04:06.230" style="s2">this planets forests and oceans and</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.769" end="00:04:08.329" style="s2">systems are very resilient if we stop</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.230" end="00:04:10.760" style="s2">but they also have points that they</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.329" end="00:04:12.650" style="s2">can&#39;t come back from and they&#39;ll find a</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.760" end="00:04:14.810" style="s2">new equilibrium possibly without human</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.650" end="00:04:17.629" style="s2">life on them I would like that not to</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.810" end="00:04:24.270" style="s2">happen I would like</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.629" end="00:04:27.030" style="s2">us to survive this and not go extinct in</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.270" end="00:04:29.400" style="s2">order for that to happen not just our</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.030" end="00:04:31.620" style="s2">scientists have to come together we the</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.400" end="00:04:34.860" style="s2">people have to come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.620" end="00:04:38.550" style="s2">a way that we can understand what that</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.860" end="00:04:40.199" style="s2">information is so that we can have</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.550" end="00:04:42.870" style="s2">conversations around the dinner table</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.199" end="00:04:44.639" style="s2">and around like if you&#39;re interested in</p>
<p begin="00:04:42.870" end="00:04:47.159" style="s2">it you can easily find a group to have</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.639" end="00:04:48.870" style="s2">those conversations with not this if</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.159" end="00:04:50.879" style="s2">you&#39;re real someone on a chain like no</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.870" end="00:04:52.560" style="s2">how can we what can we do to take action</p>
<p begin="00:04:50.879" end="00:04:53.849" style="s2">and maybe just having the discussion of</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.560" end="00:04:55.740" style="s2">what it means and what we would like to</p>
<p begin="00:04:53.849" end="00:04:58.530" style="s2">know and is that information out there</p>
<p begin="00:04:55.740" end="00:05:00.030" style="s2">whatever people feel called to but</p>
<p begin="00:04:58.530" end="00:05:01.680" style="s2">having information available on</p>
<p begin="00:05:00.030" end="00:05:04.710" style="s2">everything that especially climate</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.680" end="00:05:07.289" style="s2">change in an organized and usable way</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.710" end="00:05:08.909" style="s2">that people can trust and what is</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.289" end="00:05:11.490" style="s2">something we can trust something that</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.909" end="00:05:14.699" style="s2">we&#39;ve just we&#39;ve collectively decided is</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.490" end="00:05:16.259" style="s2">trustworthy right like not this this</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.699" end="00:05:20.129" style="s2">thing&#39;s trustworthy it&#39;s like no what</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.259" end="00:05:23.909" style="s2">makes it trustworthy was is first person</p>
<p begin="00:05:20.129" end="00:05:26.759" style="s2">I witness account incredible when it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.909" end="00:05:28.169" style="s2">not recorded is a record incredible do</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.759" end="00:05:29.639" style="s2">you have to have a geotag like do you</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.169" end="00:05:32.880" style="s2">need to how much information do we need</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.639" end="00:05:34.740" style="s2">to know that this happens the way the</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.880" end="00:05:38.460" style="s2">person says it did at that time in place</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.740" end="00:05:40.680" style="s2">and if it&#39;s not that is it just</p>
<p begin="00:05:38.460" end="00:05:43.529" style="s2">discounted completely or is it just a</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.680" end="00:05:46.289" style="s2">lower-ranking I would vote for lower</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.529" end="00:05:51.960" style="s2">ranking that we have the best</p>
<p begin="00:05:46.289" end="00:05:53.610" style="s2">information available and then figure it</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.960" end="00:05:54.810" style="s2">out from there I obviously got</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:05:57.060" style="s2">sidetracked by thinking about people</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.810" end="00:06:02.400" style="s2">watching this it&#39;s like it flows better</p>
<p begin="00:05:57.060" end="00:06:02.940" style="s2">when it&#39;s right here like that would be</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.400" end="00:06:08.159" style="s2">on till 8:00</p>
<p begin="00:06:02.940" end="00:06:17.870" style="s2">then I get to go do bedtime hey no</p>

<p begin="00:06:37.769" end="00:06:53.969" style="s2">problem climate change is a very complex</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.199" end="00:06:57.989" style="s2">problem we kind of sucked understanding</p>
<p begin="00:06:53.969" end="00:06:59.609" style="s2">complex problems on a balls so it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.989" end="00:07:03.239" style="s2">gonna take something new it&#39;s gonna take</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.609" end="00:07:05.909" style="s2">collaboration and cooperative science to</p>
<p begin="00:07:03.239" end="00:07:07.199" style="s2">discover doesn&#39;t mean everyone has to</p>

<p begin="00:07:07.199" end="00:07:14.459" style="s2">can be a lab or a research team that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.189" end="00:07:17.099" style="s2">just telling us what you found telling</p>
<p begin="00:07:14.459" end="00:07:19.529" style="s2">us contributing to the conversation but</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.099" end="00:07:22.829" style="s2">having conversations and having ways to</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.529" end="00:07:24.509" style="s2">know ask questions and have them answer</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.829" end="00:07:27.569" style="s2">to the best of the science out there as</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.509" end="00:07:28.949" style="s2">well as having them like we can see</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.569" end="00:07:30.209" style="s2">where they haven&#39;t been answered and can</p>
<p begin="00:07:28.949" end="00:07:33.569" style="s2">me answer and what would that look like</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.209" end="00:07:35.429" style="s2">and crowdsourcing science like everyone</p>
<p begin="00:07:33.569" end="00:07:39.959" style="s2">gets to be a part of that where it makes</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.429" end="00:07:42.059" style="s2">sense to be not not social media made</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.959" end="00:07:43.829" style="s2">science like not in the same way of like</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.059" end="00:07:49.409" style="s2">well I thought that no gravity doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:07:43.829" end="00:07:54.209" style="s2">exist like that Democratic you know ray</p>
<p begin="00:07:49.409" end="00:07:56.339" style="s2">democratic in how do we trust it that</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.209" end="00:07:58.169" style="s2">isn&#39;t going to be different for every</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.339" end="00:07:59.999" style="s2">different study right well we like it so</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.169" end="00:08:02.459" style="s2">we&#39;re gonna trust it it&#39;s like no is it</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.999" end="00:08:03.989" style="s2">what is the grading of the site it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.459" end="00:08:05.339" style="s2">what was the and every different</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.989" end="00:08:05.909" style="s2">discipline you come thorough and if they</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.339" end="00:08:09.259" style="s2">want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:05.909" end="00:08:11.969" style="s2">I&#39;d like here&#39;s what makes a good</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.259" end="00:08:13.409" style="s2">peer-reviewed biological study and I</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.969" end="00:08:15.449" style="s2">can&#39;t think of the different types of</p>
<p begin="00:08:13.409" end="00:08:21.659" style="s2">studies up in a biology here&#39;s what</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.449" end="00:08:23.849" style="s2">makes a good drug trial and then we</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.659" end="00:08:26.449" style="s2">grade them against each other how</p>
<p begin="00:08:23.849" end="00:08:30.239" style="s2">confident are we that this drug is</p>
<p begin="00:08:26.449" end="00:08:32.219" style="s2">life-saving versus just the new product</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.239" end="00:08:33.839" style="s2">the company wants to put out there which</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.219" end="00:08:35.189" style="s2">is exactly what it probably is like is</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.839" end="00:08:37.409" style="s2">it actually better than what&#39;s out there</p>
<p begin="00:08:35.189" end="00:08:39.809" style="s2">before is there less side effects or is</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.409" end="00:08:41.910" style="s2">it just a different here like is it</p>
<p begin="00:08:39.809" end="00:08:45.000" style="s2">actually better and can we make decision</p>
<p begin="00:08:41.910" end="00:08:46.230" style="s2">based on on that stuff and it&#39;s all it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.000" end="00:08:51.630" style="s2">all the other hand joined from climate</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.230" end="00:08:53.010" style="s2">change to drugs here but personally i</p>
<p begin="00:08:51.630" end="00:08:55.860" style="s2">would like to have information on drugs</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.010" end="00:08:57.990" style="s2">and health but globally and for our</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.860" end="00:08:59.430" style="s2">species we need to have information like</p>
<p begin="00:08:57.990" end="00:09:01.590" style="s2">I get it it&#39;s out there if you want to</p>
<p begin="00:08:59.430" end="00:09:04.380" style="s2">go and look at it it&#39;s it it exists is</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.590" end="00:09:06.270" style="s2">Wikipedia pages on it but like we need</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.380" end="00:09:10.910" style="s2">to come together and own something and</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.270" end="00:09:13.280" style="s2">that we can trust to share knowledge and</p>
<p begin="00:09:10.910" end="00:09:15.510" style="s2">collaborate and so that involves</p>
<p begin="00:09:13.280" end="00:09:17.340" style="s2">compiling enough right not necessarily</p>
<p begin="00:09:15.510" end="00:09:20.420" style="s2">trusting Wikipedia creating our own</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.340" end="00:09:23.640" style="s2">version of the record Wikipedia of</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.420" end="00:09:26.160" style="s2">databases and the infographics that that</p>
<p begin="00:09:23.640" end="00:09:28.140" style="s2">come out of that to make it visual on</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.160" end="00:09:29.490" style="s2">every different topic and people get to</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.140" end="00:09:31.200" style="s2">keep out in their area of choosing and</p>
<p begin="00:09:29.490" end="00:09:34.560" style="s2">contribute to it or you have you know</p>

<p begin="00:09:51.630" end="00:09:59.550" style="s2">like reading about it and then we take</p>

<p begin="00:09:59.550" end="00:10:04.860" style="s2">we saw climate change like that because</p>

<p begin="00:10:04.860" end="00:10:08.730" style="s2">progress much much faster it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:06.780" end="00:10:10.860" style="s2">take it might still take ten years to a</p>
<p begin="00:10:08.730" end="00:10:13.320" style="s2">study some teams studies take ten years</p>
<p begin="00:10:10.860" end="00:10:14.640" style="s2">to do but during that process meet</p>
<p begin="00:10:13.320" end="00:10:16.170" style="s2">reporting back with the information is</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.640" end="00:10:17.430" style="s2">if that doesn&#39;t hurt the science some</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.170" end="00:10:21.450" style="s2">studies that will hurt it another ones</p>
<p begin="00:10:17.430" end="00:10:23.220" style="s2">it won&#39;t and when the all serious</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.450" end="00:10:24.990" style="s2">butthurt at I don&#39;t know nothing of</p>
<p begin="00:10:23.220" end="00:10:26.280" style="s2">wonder it would be really hurt to get</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.990" end="00:10:28.400" style="s2">the information have the people in this</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.280" end="00:10:31.170" style="s2">study any information about the study</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.400" end="00:10:34.590" style="s2">but the point is you don&#39;t have this leg</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.170" end="00:10:37.080" style="s2">between something being discovered it</p>
<p begin="00:10:34.590" end="00:10:38.580" style="s2">being written up and published it can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.080" end="00:10:40.650" style="s2">a really long process and then people</p>
<p begin="00:10:38.580" end="00:10:43.980" style="s2">reading it and implementing it in order</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.650" end="00:10:45.930" style="s2">to base the next discovery on it and</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.980" end="00:10:47.670" style="s2">it&#39;s all happening simultaneously and</p>
<p begin="00:10:45.930" end="00:10:51.390" style="s2">I&#39;m just like we make that more rad or</p>
<p begin="00:10:47.670" end="00:10:53.340" style="s2">there is the brainstorming and you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.390" end="00:10:54.900" style="s2">necessarily or make sense to repeat</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.340" end="00:10:55.560" style="s2">experiments or repeating experiments</p>
<p begin="00:10:54.900" end="00:10:59.190" style="s2">where it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:10:55.560" end="00:11:00.810" style="s2">it&#39;s not about necessarily you go and</p>
<p begin="00:10:59.190" end="00:11:02.040" style="s2">being the first to discover it it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:00.810" end="00:11:03.000" style="s2">yeah I want to know about this and I</p>
<p begin="00:11:02.040" end="00:11:04.290" style="s2">want to know about it maybe there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:03.000" end="00:11:06.350" style="s2">three different teams working on the</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.290" end="00:11:08.430" style="s2">same thing running the same experiment</p>
<p begin="00:11:06.350" end="00:11:10.260" style="s2">independently and maybe you&#39;re helping</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.430" end="00:11:12.180" style="s2">each other troubleshoot but it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:11:10.260" end="00:11:14.070" style="s2">you&#39;re collaborating on science right</p>
<p begin="00:11:12.180" end="00:11:17.550" style="s2">hey like no we want kids because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:14.070" end="00:11:19.410" style="s2">not about who gets published first and</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.550" end="00:11:22.320" style="s2">if it is about that we can figure that</p>
<p begin="00:11:19.410" end="00:11:24.360" style="s2">out we can say these people co-created</p>
<p begin="00:11:22.320" end="00:11:25.800" style="s2">this right they&#39;re all first authors and</p>
<p begin="00:11:24.360" end="00:11:28.050" style="s2">here&#39;s all the second authors or</p>
<p begin="00:11:25.800" end="00:11:29.700" style="s2">whatever it happens to be if you need to</p>
<p begin="00:11:28.050" end="00:11:31.290" style="s2">have ego involved you&#39;d allow you go to</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.700" end="00:11:33.600" style="s2">be involved but you can still say like</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.290" end="00:11:35.700" style="s2">no this is something like the equivalent</p>
<p begin="00:11:33.600" end="00:11:41.130" style="s2">of having your name on a paper you can</p>
<p begin="00:11:35.700" end="00:11:45.029" style="s2">still have just not be where you go part</p>
<p begin="00:11:41.130" end="00:11:46.560" style="s2">of it you&#39;re like I got here first a</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.029" end="00:11:47.910" style="s2">week before this person published it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.560" end="00:11:49.800" style="s2">like yeah you can magically the other</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.910" end="00:11:53.130" style="s2">person they put in just as much time</p>
<p begin="00:11:49.800" end="00:11:54.810" style="s2">they were a week shy of doing it you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.130" end="00:11:57.029" style="s2">just as likely to be that person like</p>
<p begin="00:11:54.810" end="00:11:58.980" style="s2">why not say hey this team collaborated</p>
<p begin="00:11:57.029" end="00:12:00.570" style="s2">and if you want to break it down as hey</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.980" end="00:12:03.540" style="s2">this is my ID this was my idea</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.570" end="00:12:05.430" style="s2">fine cool but what&#39;s gonna happen is</p>
<p begin="00:12:03.540" end="00:12:07.860" style="s2">it&#39;s like you&#39;re involved and you can</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.430" end="00:12:11.040" style="s2">see how involved people are based on how</p>
<p begin="00:12:07.860" end="00:12:12.570" style="s2">everyone says right like who did 60% of</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.040" end="00:12:13.950" style="s2">the work who did this who did this you</p>
<p begin="00:12:12.570" end="00:12:22.290" style="s2">can see who does more of the work on</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.950" end="00:12:23.940" style="s2">certain projects and accordingly like if</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.290" end="00:12:26.040" style="s2">someone&#39;s involved in in dozens and</p>
<p begin="00:12:23.940" end="00:12:27.720" style="s2">dozens of projects but barely that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:26.040" end="00:12:29.190" style="s2">that&#39;s important like maybe you don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.720" end="00:12:30.920" style="s2">even need to know so saying five minutes</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.190" end="00:12:33.500" style="s2">on a project and they can it improve</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.920" end="00:12:39.350" style="s2">versus spending of you know like</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.500" end="00:12:46.350" style="s2">hundreds of hours almost different it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.350" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">okay why time we should be like global</p>
<p begin="00:12:46.350" end="00:12:50.990" style="s2">warming you like bedtime not really okay</p>
