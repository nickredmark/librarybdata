<p begin="00:01:32.250" end="00:01:36.630" style="s2">we want in that we voted on the the ones</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.950" end="00:01:39.630" style="s2">with the most priority to start the beta</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.630" end="00:01:41.790" style="s2">with and then we create the beta we use</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.630" end="00:01:46.020" style="s2">it and we continually improve it until</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.790" end="00:01:52.500" style="s2">it meets 99% of our of our of 99% of our</p>

<p begin="00:01:55.079" end="00:01:59.070" style="s2">we need the tools so that we can come</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.000" end="00:02:00.659" style="s2">together and solve our problems I&#39;m not</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.070" end="00:02:02.159" style="s2">focusing on the food app because it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.659" end="00:02:07.170" style="s2">hard to get a hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.159" end="00:02:10.110" style="s2">together all at once if I could I would</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.170" end="00:02:12.970" style="s2">but what we&#39;re focusing on is creating</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.110" end="00:02:15.520" style="s2">the platform design for a conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:12.970" end="00:02:17.470" style="s2">social media platform it actually gives</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.520" end="00:02:19.600" style="s2">you people to talk to so that we have</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.470" end="00:02:21.340" style="s2">connection and community and from that</p>
<p begin="00:02:19.600" end="00:02:24.310" style="s2">space a hundred thousand people being on</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.340" end="00:02:25.720" style="s2">that talking about mmm I need food</p>
<p begin="00:02:24.310" end="00:02:27.910" style="s2">here&#39;s what stops me from eating food</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.720" end="00:02:31.090" style="s2">natural solutions are going to arise and</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.910" end="00:02:32.590" style="s2">as we were part of this conversation we</p>
<p begin="00:02:31.090" end="00:02:37.080" style="s2">have is how do we find those solutions</p>
<p begin="00:02:32.590" end="00:02:40.750" style="s2">and we together create a funding funding</p>
<p begin="00:02:37.080" end="00:02:43.060" style="s2">system that keeps us that empowers us</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.750" end="00:02:44.740" style="s2">and gives us the money to actually move</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.060" end="00:02:46.240" style="s2">forward with all of these projects we</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.740" end="00:02:48.190" style="s2">create the tools to actually move</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.240" end="00:02:50.800" style="s2">forward with all these projects how do</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.190" end="00:02:52.209" style="s2">we know what needs to get done how do we</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.800" end="00:02:54.459" style="s2">break it down how do we distribute that</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.209" end="00:02:58.620" style="s2">that works so that we can we can</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.459" end="00:03:01.080" style="s2">contribute to it our data our ideas our</p>
<p begin="00:02:58.620" end="00:03:03.790" style="s2">labor that is fun and easy and</p>
<p begin="00:03:01.080" end="00:03:07.620" style="s2">incremental right who wouldn&#39;t give ten</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.790" end="00:03:11.080" style="s2">minutes a week to help save humanity</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.620" end="00:03:13.390" style="s2">if you require people like we&#39;re already</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.080" end="00:03:15.850" style="s2">struggling we&#39;re all we&#39;re barely</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.390" end="00:03:17.500" style="s2">keeping our heads above water and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:15.850" end="00:03:19.150" style="s2">working so hard and getting nowhere that</p>
<p begin="00:03:17.500" end="00:03:20.350" style="s2">people hear what I&#39;m trying to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.150" end="00:03:22.810" style="s2">and they&#39;re like I don&#39;t have anything</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.350" end="00:03:25.600" style="s2">to give you do you just need to take a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.810" end="00:03:27.700" style="s2">fraction of that a tiny bit of that time</p>
<p begin="00:03:25.600" end="00:03:29.320" style="s2">energy money they are putting towards</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.700" end="00:03:33.190" style="s2">like how much is your food bill gone up</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.320" end="00:03:35.890" style="s2">a tiny fraction of that you put in $1</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.190" end="00:03:38.739" style="s2">towards a global app that helps you</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.890" end="00:03:42.310" style="s2">bring down your cost of food would help</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.739" end="00:03:44.019" style="s2">you astronomically but we need to create</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.310" end="00:03:45.549" style="s2">it in Reverse we need to have the people</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.019" end="00:03:47.080" style="s2">on board before we create it so they</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.549" end="00:03:48.790" style="s2">trust it when it&#39;s created so they can</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.080" end="00:03:51.459" style="s2">say what they need in that app so that</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.790" end="00:03:54.280" style="s2">they can we can come together and create</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.459" end="00:03:56.049" style="s2">the solutions that we need a hundred</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.280" end="00:03:58.000" style="s2">thousand of us which is not where we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.049" end="00:03:59.739" style="s2">going - starting with me one and then</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.000" end="00:04:01.690" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna get a few people and a few bar</p>
<p begin="00:03:59.739" end="00:04:04.030" style="s2">people we&#39;re using existing technology</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.690" end="00:04:05.440" style="s2">to host those conversations while we</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.030" end="00:04:07.720" style="s2">create the platform table to hold those</p>
<p begin="00:04:05.440" end="00:04:10.420" style="s2">conversations but once we have that</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.720" end="00:04:11.530" style="s2">platform we can move forward with</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.420" end="00:04:14.049" style="s2">solving all of the problems</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.530" end="00:04:15.940" style="s2">simultaneously once we have the platform</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.049" end="00:04:19.660" style="s2">and a few tools to actually be able to</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.940" end="00:04:22.180" style="s2">move forward with projects so that is</p>
<p begin="00:04:19.660" end="00:04:25.050" style="s2">today&#39;s video 100,000 of us can create</p>
