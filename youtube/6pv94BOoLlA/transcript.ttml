<p begin="00:00:01.280" end="00:00:07.140" style="s2">all right good morning and welcome to</p>
<p begin="00:00:04.200" end="00:00:10.170" style="s2">8:30 during the pandemic where I go live</p>
<p begin="00:00:07.140" end="00:00:13.500" style="s2">for an hour talking about what we can</p>
<p begin="00:00:10.170" end="00:00:17.100" style="s2">create together 1r able to come together</p>
<p begin="00:00:13.500" end="00:00:18.900" style="s2">I am part of a technology cooperative</p>
<p begin="00:00:17.100" end="00:00:20.250" style="s2">we&#39;re working to create it&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.900" end="00:00:23.970" style="s2">together tech we&#39;re working to create</p>
<p begin="00:00:20.250" end="00:00:26.220" style="s2">the infrastructure to be able to come</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.970" end="00:00:29.789" style="s2">together and create any project that a</p>
<p begin="00:00:26.220" end="00:00:31.619" style="s2">single individual can come up with but</p>
<p begin="00:00:29.789" end="00:00:33.630" style="s2">it&#39;s very much under the umbrella of</p>
<p begin="00:00:31.619" end="00:00:34.980" style="s2">bringing your own your own project that</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.630" end="00:00:35.160" style="s2">is what together tech looks like right</p>
<p begin="00:00:34.980" end="00:00:39.800" style="s2">now</p>
<p begin="00:00:35.160" end="00:00:47.780" style="s2">and my project is figuring out a process</p>
<p begin="00:00:39.800" end="00:00:50.070" style="s2">that actually works with and for the</p>
<p begin="00:00:47.780" end="00:00:50.940" style="s2">people who are creating the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.070" end="00:00:53.879" style="s2">the people who are affected by the</p>
<p begin="00:00:50.940" end="00:00:55.469" style="s2">problem so instead of having a small</p>
<p begin="00:00:53.879" end="00:00:56.879" style="s2">group of people coming up with a</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.469" end="00:00:58.320" style="s2">solution they have to sell to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:00:56.879" end="00:00:59.969" style="s2">else having a large group of people</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.320" end="00:01:02.160" style="s2">coming up with a solution that they</p>
<p begin="00:00:59.969" end="00:01:03.600" style="s2">actually want to be a part of so what</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.160" end="00:01:06.390" style="s2">that looks like right now in its best</p>
<p begin="00:01:03.600" end="00:01:08.010" style="s2">incarnation is solution raising so a</p>
<p begin="00:01:06.390" end="00:01:11.360" style="s2">solution raising is an hour-long</p>
<p begin="00:01:08.010" end="00:01:13.500" style="s2">conversation that generates actual</p>
<p begin="00:01:11.360" end="00:01:15.540" style="s2">possible solutions that we could</p>
<p begin="00:01:13.500" end="00:01:19.439" style="s2">implement right now if we had 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.540" end="00:01:21.150" style="s2">people and $100,000 after holding six of</p>
<p begin="00:01:19.439" end="00:01:24.119" style="s2">them I&#39;m gonna be looking to hold at</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.150" end="00:01:26.220" style="s2">least one per week live during this time</p>
<p begin="00:01:24.119" end="00:01:27.330" style="s2">slot and if it ends up that that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.220" end="00:01:29.790" style="s2">successful</p>
<p begin="00:01:27.330" end="00:01:32.939" style="s2">maybe we&#39;ll hold two or three a week to</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.790" end="00:01:35.009" style="s2">showcase that people coming together</p>
<p begin="00:01:32.939" end="00:01:36.750" style="s2">five people talking on camera actually</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.009" end="00:01:41.630" style="s2">can come up with real solutions to real</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.750" end="00:01:43.829" style="s2">problems that are tangible right now and</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.630" end="00:01:45.659" style="s2">part of that is of course working</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.829" end="00:01:47.159" style="s2">through a figuring out a process that</p>
<p begin="00:01:45.659" end="00:01:50.009" style="s2">10,000 people can actually participate</p>
<p begin="00:01:47.159" end="00:01:51.899" style="s2">in and so what I would love to do</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.009" end="00:01:52.409" style="s2">besides there&#39;s many options during this</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.899" end="00:01:53.939" style="s2">hour</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.409" end="00:01:57.390" style="s2">that is going to probably go on for</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.939" end="00:02:00.479" style="s2">weeks and months is to because the</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.390" end="00:02:02.460" style="s2">pandemic I&#39;m happy for this to go on for</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.479" end="00:02:04.649" style="s2">weeks and months it&#39;s the statement side</p>
<p begin="00:02:02.460" end="00:02:08.670" style="s2">for everyone that maybe is less less</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.649" end="00:02:11.760" style="s2">enticing so after our conversation</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.670" end="00:02:13.180" style="s2">yesterday for our mastermind projects I</p>
<p begin="00:02:11.760" end="00:02:16.569" style="s2">was give</p>
<p begin="00:02:13.180" end="00:02:18.400" style="s2">and I took on that during the first part</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.569" end="00:02:22.150" style="s2">of this I&#39;m gonna have a more succinct</p>
<p begin="00:02:18.400" end="00:02:25.109" style="s2">pitch this was clearly not it but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.150" end="00:02:27.879" style="s2">my first attempt so that people who are</p>
<p begin="00:02:25.109" end="00:02:29.620" style="s2">tuning in it takes a while for people to</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.879" end="00:02:33.790" style="s2">comment realize someone&#39;s live and and</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.620" end="00:02:34.989" style="s2">join them you can kind of miss the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.790" end="00:02:36.489" style="s2">couple minutes and then if somebody</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.989" end="00:02:38.260" style="s2">comes in part way through and it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:02:36.489" end="00:02:40.900" style="s2">hey what&#39;s this all about they can just</p>
<p begin="00:02:38.260" end="00:02:42.340" style="s2">go watch any of the previous broadcasts</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.900" end="00:02:44.200" style="s2">and watch the first two or three minutes</p>
<p begin="00:02:42.340" end="00:02:46.000" style="s2">to understand what is a solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:02:44.200" end="00:02:48.459" style="s2">and what is it that we are doing during</p>
<p begin="00:02:46.000" end="00:02:50.889" style="s2">this time period I am reaching out to</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.459" end="00:02:52.750" style="s2">one of the other game be people who is</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.889" end="00:02:54.370" style="s2">interested in doing a solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.750" end="00:02:57.489" style="s2">on mental health and emotional support</p>
<p begin="00:02:54.370" end="00:03:00.450" style="s2">especially during the pandemic then I</p>
<p begin="00:02:57.489" end="00:03:03.400" style="s2">went stuck inside with their loved ones</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.450" end="00:03:05.049" style="s2">and so I&#39;m gonna reach out to her and</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.400" end="00:03:07.450" style="s2">we&#39;ll figure out which if it worked any</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.049" end="00:03:10.780" style="s2">of the day&#39;s work for her what today we</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.450" end="00:03:11.919" style="s2">are doing that live online and what that</p>
<p begin="00:03:10.780" end="00:03:13.299" style="s2">will look like since most people</p>
<p begin="00:03:11.919" end="00:03:14.560" style="s2">probably have not watched the solution</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.299" end="00:03:18.609" style="s2">raise it so grow them together tech</p>
<p begin="00:03:14.560" end="00:03:20.650" style="s2">channel is for 15 minutes we talk about</p>
<p begin="00:03:18.609" end="00:03:22.930" style="s2">what is currently being done what works</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.650" end="00:03:24.760" style="s2">and what doesn&#39;t work about that what we</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.930" end="00:03:26.379" style="s2">would like it to look like and that was</p>
<p begin="00:03:24.760" end="00:03:27.370" style="s2">sorry 15 minutes of that then 15 minutes</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.379" end="00:03:30.400" style="s2">and what we would like it to look like</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.370" end="00:03:31.629" style="s2">in our ideal version of the future they</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.400" end="00:03:32.949" style="s2">don&#39;t need to match several many</p>
<p begin="00:03:31.629" end="00:03:34.840" style="s2">participants there are there can be that</p>
<p begin="00:03:32.949" end="00:03:37.449" style="s2">many different versions of the future</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.840" end="00:03:39.939" style="s2">and then we talk about what is something</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.449" end="00:03:41.620" style="s2">we could actually implement right now if</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.939" end="00:03:44.979" style="s2">we had 10,000 people in hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.620" end="00:03:47.889" style="s2">dollars so what is a solution that we</p>
<p begin="00:03:44.979" end="00:03:50.879" style="s2">would want to be a part of creating we</p>
<p begin="00:03:47.889" end="00:03:53.349" style="s2">would want to use if it was created and</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.879" end="00:03:56.199" style="s2">hopefully have it be a voluntary</p>
<p begin="00:03:53.349" end="00:04:01.389" style="s2">inviting solution so that we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.199" end="00:04:03.840" style="s2">focused on creating new power dynamics</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.389" end="00:04:06.009" style="s2">that were the new elite for right that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.840" end="00:04:07.780" style="s2">not what we&#39;re looking to do we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.009" end="00:04:10.599" style="s2">looking to create a new hierarchical</p>
<p begin="00:04:07.780" end="00:04:12.189" style="s2">paradigm that just replaces the people</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.599" end="00:04:14.859" style="s2">in power with new people in power it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.189" end="00:04:18.579" style="s2">how do we how can we solve solutions</p>
<p begin="00:04:14.859" end="00:04:21.039" style="s2">without there being people in power the</p>
<p begin="00:04:18.579" end="00:04:27.400" style="s2">governments are the best we have right</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.039" end="00:04:30.190" style="s2">now to deal with our collective needs</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.400" end="00:04:31.750" style="s2">and at the same time especially since</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.190" end="00:04:33.550" style="s2">we&#39;re leaving it up to them and we put</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.750" end="00:04:35.979" style="s2">for better for worse or like so my</p>
<p begin="00:04:33.550" end="00:04:37.630" style="s2">problems I think they&#39;re never gonna</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.979" end="00:04:40.509" style="s2">make us all happy they&#39;re never really</p>
<p begin="00:04:37.630" end="00:04:43.509" style="s2">gonna make anyone happy the only one who</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.509" end="00:04:47.289" style="s2">could make us me the individual happy is</p>
<p begin="00:04:43.509" end="00:04:48.669" style="s2">the individual is to say you need to</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.289" end="00:04:52.020" style="s2">come for the perfect solution for me</p>
<p begin="00:04:48.669" end="00:04:54.370" style="s2">that I can&#39;t find any fault in is a</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.020" end="00:04:56.949" style="s2">ridiculous childlike thing to do that we</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.370" end="00:04:59.650" style="s2">all fall into from time to time but</p>
<p begin="00:04:56.949" end="00:05:02.350" style="s2">having an actual process that we can</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.650" end="00:05:04.000" style="s2">follow when we have 10,000 people that</p>
<p begin="00:05:02.350" end="00:05:08.199" style="s2">care about an issue instead of just</p>
<p begin="00:05:04.000" end="00:05:10.050" style="s2">signing a petition that says hey can I</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.199" end="00:05:12.220" style="s2">can&#39;t even think of the most recent</p>
<p begin="00:05:10.050" end="00:05:17.620" style="s2">petitions that outside because I signed</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.220" end="00:05:19.660" style="s2">a lot of them but cancer even right like</p>
<p begin="00:05:17.620" end="00:05:21.910" style="s2">that we want give me money I&#39;m gonna go</p>
<p begin="00:05:19.660" end="00:05:22.840" style="s2">run run a marathon for cancer and then</p>
<p begin="00:05:21.910" end="00:05:24.370" style="s2">it&#39;s like well where is that money going</p>
<p begin="00:05:22.840" end="00:05:26.680" style="s2">in is that actually going to solve</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.370" end="00:05:28.599" style="s2">cancer what does that look like we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.680" end="00:05:30.099" style="s2">have 10,000 people sign up to say hey</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.599" end="00:05:32.530" style="s2">I&#39;ve lost someone to cancer it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.099" end="00:05:34.449" style="s2">shitty shitty disease are we going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.530" end="00:05:37.630" style="s2">solve it with 10,000 people 100,000</p>
<p begin="00:05:34.449" end="00:05:42.010" style="s2">dollars of course not but we could have</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.630" end="00:05:44.530" style="s2">a system that supports people going</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.010" end="00:05:47.979" style="s2">through cancer we can have a system that</p>
<p begin="00:05:44.530" end="00:05:49.330" style="s2">actually votes on what funding we want</p>
<p begin="00:05:47.979" end="00:05:51.070" style="s2">to do because the pharmaceutical</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.330" end="00:05:52.419" style="s2">companies the for-profit companies</p>
<p begin="00:05:51.070" end="00:05:54.220" style="s2">aren&#39;t going to study the same things</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.419" end="00:05:56.740" style="s2">that we want which is how do I prevent</p>
<p begin="00:05:54.220" end="00:05:58.960" style="s2">cancer how do i cure cancer so even</p>
<p begin="00:05:56.740" end="00:06:01.120" style="s2">something as big as cancer we could</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.960" end="00:06:04.650" style="s2">tackle with a solution raising we only</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.120" end="00:06:07.150" style="s2">have the first step of the solution and</p>
<p begin="00:06:04.650" end="00:06:10.300" style="s2">now what I&#39;m looking to do is do the</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.150" end="00:06:11.620" style="s2">process raising so what does it what</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.300" end="00:06:14.349" style="s2">could it look like because there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.620" end="00:06:15.970" style="s2">infinite combinations what could it look</p>
<p begin="00:06:14.349" end="00:06:21.639" style="s2">like to create a solution of 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.970" end="00:06:25.240" style="s2">people that could look like a show of 5</p>
<p begin="00:06:21.639" end="00:06:27.639" style="s2">people working through the process</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.240" end="00:06:31.750" style="s2">themselves and having the rest watch and</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.639" end="00:06:32.610" style="s2">vote on the features and the benefits so</p>
<p begin="00:06:31.750" end="00:06:36.300" style="s2">that is</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.610" end="00:06:37.650" style="s2">kind of how I envisioned it but when we</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.300" end="00:06:40.080" style="s2">even measured it together it might look</p>
<p begin="00:06:37.650" end="00:06:42.360" style="s2">very different is there are 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:06:40.080" end="00:06:44.719" style="s2">people funding it and who get a say on</p>
<p begin="00:06:42.360" end="00:06:46.740" style="s2">what the solution is going to entail</p>
<p begin="00:06:44.719" end="00:06:48.740" style="s2">there&#39;s going to be a smaller number of</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.740" end="00:06:52.080" style="s2">those 10,000 who actually want to</p>
<p begin="00:06:48.740" end="00:06:54.629" style="s2">participate more deeply on camera or</p>
<p begin="00:06:52.080" end="00:06:56.099" style="s2">voice in a conversation that generates</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.629" end="00:06:58.439" style="s2">solution it&#39;s for some people that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:06:56.099" end="00:06:59.909" style="s2">going to be fun and enticing and for</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.439" end="00:07:02.069" style="s2">other people they just want the solution</p>
<p begin="00:06:59.909" end="00:07:04.409" style="s2">so out of the 10,000 people that are</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.069" end="00:07:06.569" style="s2">funding it that are like yes this is a</p>
<p begin="00:07:04.409" end="00:07:08.849" style="s2">problem I want to put $10 to words and</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.569" end="00:07:11.099" style="s2">either I&#39;m gonna participate in that</p>
<p begin="00:07:08.849" end="00:07:12.449" style="s2">process as much as I want or I&#39;m gonna</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.099" end="00:07:13.770" style="s2">hand that off to the people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:12.449" end="00:07:15.569" style="s2">participate in it and I can take a back</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.770" end="00:07:17.819" style="s2">seat you just get a more of a spectator</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.569" end="00:07:19.020" style="s2">hopefully with voting involved once I</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.819" end="00:07:21.930" style="s2">mean there&#39;s tons of voting out souther</p>
<p begin="00:07:19.020" end="00:07:22.650" style="s2">so we can have that involved from nearly</p>
<p begin="00:07:21.930" end="00:07:24.419" style="s2">the beginning this won&#39;t be a</p>
<p begin="00:07:22.650" end="00:07:27.629" style="s2">streamlined it won&#39;t be as easy to it</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.419" end="00:07:29.400" style="s2">for it to all be in one location what I</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.629" end="00:07:31.560" style="s2">would love to do during this hour is</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.400" end="00:07:35.909" style="s2">like I said do one or two solution</p>
<p begin="00:07:31.560" end="00:07:40.050" style="s2">raises a week and then have one to two</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.909" end="00:07:42.210" style="s2">hours dedicated to like a board of</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.050" end="00:07:46.400" style="s2">directors meeting on the process itself</p>
<p begin="00:07:42.210" end="00:07:50.219" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for other people who want to</p>
<p begin="00:07:46.400" end="00:07:53.699" style="s2">co-create the process and doing it live</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.219" end="00:07:55.319" style="s2">on camera the solution raising so far</p>
<p begin="00:07:53.699" end="00:07:56.819" style="s2">have been on camera on YouTube they</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.319" end="00:07:58.229" style="s2">haven&#39;t been live we haven&#39;t had people</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.819" end="00:07:59.699" style="s2">participating what we&#39;re doing it&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.229" end="00:08:02.460" style="s2">point is to have the conversation not to</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.699" end="00:08:04.529" style="s2">have an audience and so during those</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.460" end="00:08:07.440" style="s2">solution receives I will see how it</p>
<p begin="00:08:04.529" end="00:08:09.750" style="s2">works with the audience watching but to</p>
<p begin="00:08:07.440" end="00:08:12.289" style="s2">bring in more and more people to</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.750" end="00:08:14.759" style="s2">showcase that this is this is possible</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.289" end="00:08:18.089" style="s2">like I said that the conversations</p>
<p begin="00:08:14.759" end="00:08:19.770" style="s2">themselves I don&#39;t know how enticing</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.089" end="00:08:22.500" style="s2">they are for an audience</p>
<p begin="00:08:19.770" end="00:08:25.169" style="s2">I enjoyed rewatching them but I was also</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.500" end="00:08:27.389" style="s2">participating in them but they are</p>
<p begin="00:08:25.169" end="00:08:29.580" style="s2">enjoyable to participate in so to</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.389" end="00:08:31.860" style="s2">generate enough of an audience who wants</p>
<p begin="00:08:29.580" end="00:08:33.750" style="s2">to participate in solution raising so we</p>
<p begin="00:08:31.860" end="00:08:36.990" style="s2">can go off of YouTube and on to zoom to</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.750" end="00:08:38.909" style="s2">focus on generating more than one</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.990" end="00:08:40.949" style="s2">solution and honestly with five of us we</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.909" end="00:08:43.440" style="s2">generate more than one solution but once</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.949" end="00:08:44.459" style="s2">were more focus like that we can so</p>
<p begin="00:08:43.440" end="00:08:46.390" style="s2">anyone&#39;s there&#39;s a broader base of</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.459" end="00:08:48.580" style="s2">people too who want</p>
<p begin="00:08:46.390" end="00:08:50.170" style="s2">despite the solution raising we can</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.580" end="00:08:54.430" style="s2">break off into groups and come up with</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.170" end="00:08:56.620" style="s2">like a feasible solution we then present</p>
<p begin="00:08:54.430" end="00:08:58.540" style="s2">back to the group in some way and then</p>
<p begin="00:08:56.620" end="00:09:00.640" style="s2">we can vote on which one we think is the</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.540" end="00:09:01.990" style="s2">best idea and then if we were going to</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.640" end="00:09:03.460" style="s2">move forward with that idea we&#39;d move</p>
<p begin="00:09:01.990" end="00:09:04.720" style="s2">forward with the best idea then we&#39;d</p>
<p begin="00:09:03.460" end="00:09:06.610" style="s2">probably have another round on how can</p>
<p begin="00:09:04.720" end="00:09:08.140" style="s2">we improve it whatever those various</p>
<p begin="00:09:06.610" end="00:09:09.760" style="s2">rounds are like we&#39;re having the</p>
<p begin="00:09:08.140" end="00:09:14.170" style="s2">solution raising is really to generate</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.760" end="00:09:17.520" style="s2">ideas for a solution I believe the next</p>
<p begin="00:09:14.170" end="00:09:20.020" style="s2">step is something along the lines of</p>
<p begin="00:09:17.520" end="00:09:22.420" style="s2">brainstorming and voting on like every</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.020" end="00:09:24.670" style="s2">feature that app could create and then</p>
<p begin="00:09:22.420" end="00:09:26.230" style="s2">as we know what&#39;s more and more</p>
<p begin="00:09:24.670" end="00:09:27.360" style="s2">important to people because we can&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:09:26.230" end="00:09:30.220" style="s2">everything to everyone</p>
<p begin="00:09:27.360" end="00:09:32.830" style="s2">so as we find out what the biggest</p>
<p begin="00:09:30.220" end="00:09:37.110" style="s2">impact we can have is if we&#39;re doing a</p>
<p begin="00:09:32.830" end="00:09:41.110" style="s2">food app and it&#39;s um a recipe card</p>
<p begin="00:09:37.110" end="00:09:44.050" style="s2">recipes for sharing recipes what was I</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.110" end="00:09:45.910" style="s2">saying what was I saying oh the joy the</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.050" end="00:09:51.060" style="s2">joy I have try to save the world but my</p>
<p begin="00:09:45.910" end="00:09:53.620" style="s2">brain is on its own on its own mission</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.060" end="00:09:58.420" style="s2">it&#39;s just a surrender surrender to the</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.620" end="00:10:00.340" style="s2">brain I have once we get enough people</p>
<p begin="00:09:58.420" end="00:10:02.410" style="s2">who are watching who want to participate</p>
<p begin="00:10:00.340" end="00:10:04.420" style="s2">in the solution reasons that we are</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.410" end="00:10:07.450" style="s2">going to be showcasing live on YouTube</p>
<p begin="00:10:04.420" end="00:10:09.400" style="s2">but once we have enough people who want</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.450" end="00:10:11.080" style="s2">to participate not live on YouTube we</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.400" end="00:10:14.850" style="s2">will move over to zoom when we will host</p>
<p begin="00:10:11.080" end="00:10:18.010" style="s2">one to two solution raisings a week as</p>
<p begin="00:10:14.850" end="00:10:19.540" style="s2">each solution raising timeslot becomes</p>
<p begin="00:10:18.010" end="00:10:22.930" style="s2">more and more popular we can open up</p>
<p begin="00:10:19.540" end="00:10:24.490" style="s2">more and more time slot but generating</p>
<p begin="00:10:22.930" end="00:10:27.240" style="s2">the solutions like we already generated</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.490" end="00:10:30.550" style="s2">six solutions to six different sectors</p>
<p begin="00:10:27.240" end="00:10:32.320" style="s2">there is definitely a way to improve the</p>
<p begin="00:10:30.550" end="00:10:36.600" style="s2">process of solution raising so that we</p>
<p begin="00:10:32.320" end="00:10:40.030" style="s2">note taking and with that there&#39;s a way</p>
<p begin="00:10:36.600" end="00:10:43.300" style="s2">to generate a solution and then put it</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.030" end="00:10:44.890" style="s2">up to the community to vote part of it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:10:43.300" end="00:10:46.570" style="s2">doing a solution raising on those kind</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.890" end="00:10:48.520" style="s2">of things but not everyone who wants to</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.570" end="00:10:51.280" style="s2">do a solution raising on education on</p>
<p begin="00:10:48.520" end="00:10:53.290" style="s2">healthcare a mental health wants to have</p>
<p begin="00:10:51.280" end="00:10:57.610" style="s2">a solution raising on the process itself</p>
<p begin="00:10:53.290" end="00:11:01.390" style="s2">so as my brother kind of called this pet</p>
<p begin="00:10:57.610" end="00:11:04.270" style="s2">project it&#39;s a process raising so having</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.390" end="00:11:07.510" style="s2">the conversations about what could it</p>
<p begin="00:11:04.270" end="00:11:09.880" style="s2">look like to create solutions with</p>
<p begin="00:11:07.510" end="00:11:11.170" style="s2">10,000 people we need a smaller group of</p>
<p begin="00:11:09.880" end="00:11:11.800" style="s2">people who are willing to work through</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.170" end="00:11:15.160" style="s2">that process</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.800" end="00:11:17.440" style="s2">preferably live on camera so that people</p>
<p begin="00:11:15.160" end="00:11:21.030" style="s2">can see the process trust in the process</p>
<p begin="00:11:17.440" end="00:11:23.590" style="s2">and get as involved as they want to be</p>
<p begin="00:11:21.030" end="00:11:26.250" style="s2">one of the ways that people can get</p>
<p begin="00:11:23.590" end="00:11:27.910" style="s2">involved besides just watching is for</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.250" end="00:11:29.380" style="s2">these meetings</p>
<p begin="00:11:27.910" end="00:11:31.150" style="s2">comedians it&#39;s a bit of a stretch when</p>
<p begin="00:11:29.380" end="00:11:34.960" style="s2">it&#39;s only me but once it&#39;s more of a</p>
<p begin="00:11:31.150" end="00:11:37.180" style="s2">meeting having somebody who can take</p>
<p begin="00:11:34.960" end="00:11:40.450" style="s2">notes as to what exactly was discussed</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.180" end="00:11:42.310" style="s2">during jury during the the hour what was</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.450" end="00:11:45.070" style="s2">raised if we&#39;re doing a project raising</p>
<p begin="00:11:42.310" end="00:11:46.870" style="s2">what just a note-taker basically is what</p>
<p begin="00:11:45.070" end="00:11:48.370" style="s2">I&#39;m looking for for someone who doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:11:46.870" end="00:11:52.030" style="s2">want to participate on camera what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:11:48.370" end="00:11:56.230" style="s2">also looking for is - - for other people</p>
<p begin="00:11:52.030" end="00:11:58.690" style="s2">who want to participate they don&#39;t need</p>
<p begin="00:11:56.230" end="00:12:01.240" style="s2">to be 8:30 to 9:30 every day we will</p>
<p begin="00:11:58.690" end="00:12:02.830" style="s2">find one to two different time slots</p>
<p begin="00:12:01.240" end="00:12:04.840" style="s2">whatever works for the first one or two</p>
<p begin="00:12:02.830" end="00:12:06.790" style="s2">people and we will stick with those time</p>
<p begin="00:12:04.840" end="00:12:09.280" style="s2">slots so let&#39;s say it&#39;s it&#39;s Tuesday and</p>
<p begin="00:12:06.790" end="00:12:11.260" style="s2">Friday we go live on Tuesdays and</p>
<p begin="00:12:09.280" end="00:12:13.660" style="s2">Fridays we&#39;re hosting the meeting here</p>
<p begin="00:12:11.260" end="00:12:15.880" style="s2">on maybe Wednesdays we hold a solution</p>
<p begin="00:12:13.660" end="00:12:17.320" style="s2">raising itself all the all the other</p>
<p begin="00:12:15.880" end="00:12:19.600" style="s2">days we can hold solution raising</p>
<p begin="00:12:17.320" end="00:12:21.040" style="s2">because once this becomes more popular</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.600" end="00:12:22.930" style="s2">people want to participate on camera and</p>
<p begin="00:12:21.040" end="00:12:25.120" style="s2">I&#39;m posting the links that you can it&#39;ll</p>
<p begin="00:12:22.930" end="00:12:27.850" style="s2">be whoever the first four to five people</p>
<p begin="00:12:25.120" end="00:12:29.320" style="s2">who show up and if there&#39;s only one to</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.850" end="00:12:31.390" style="s2">two of us that&#39;s fine too you can have</p>
<p begin="00:12:29.320" end="00:12:33.100" style="s2">the solution raising with as long as</p>
<p begin="00:12:31.390" end="00:12:34.900" style="s2">there&#39;s two people one person I could</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.100" end="00:12:37.450" style="s2">run a solution raising by myself it is</p>
<p begin="00:12:34.900" end="00:12:39.430" style="s2">basically what I do but that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:12:37.450" end="00:12:41.590" style="s2">something about the same it doesn&#39;t have</p>
<p begin="00:12:39.430" end="00:12:43.450" style="s2">the same impact as showcasing that</p>
<p begin="00:12:41.590" end="00:12:45.910" style="s2">basically anyone can come up with a</p>
<p begin="00:12:43.450" end="00:12:49.360" style="s2">solution any group of people who is</p>
<p begin="00:12:45.910" end="00:12:50.830" style="s2">focused on just the problem and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:49.360" end="00:12:52.990" style="s2">where we normally focus that&#39;s why we</p>
<p begin="00:12:50.830" end="00:12:55.690" style="s2">only devote to 15 minutes to discussing</p>
<p begin="00:12:52.990" end="00:12:58.030" style="s2">the problem if this was a new problem so</p>
<p begin="00:12:55.690" end="00:12:59.920" style="s2">I should ask the content go up at 19 we</p>
<p begin="00:12:58.030" end="00:13:01.300" style="s2">spend we would spend longer than 15</p>
<p begin="00:12:59.920" end="00:13:03.070" style="s2">minutes talking about what it&#39;s like now</p>
<p begin="00:13:01.300" end="00:13:04.300" style="s2">and the the ends the odds and that might</p>
<p begin="00:13:03.070" end="00:13:07.089" style="s2">be well we work through the process</p>
<p begin="00:13:04.300" end="00:13:09.550" style="s2">raising that we don&#39;t have enough</p>
<p begin="00:13:07.089" end="00:13:12.610" style="s2">information the solution raising so part</p>
<p begin="00:13:09.550" end="00:13:14.800" style="s2">of what&#39;s generated during a solution</p>
<p begin="00:13:12.610" end="00:13:16.750" style="s2">might be here are the here&#39;s the data</p>
<p begin="00:13:14.800" end="00:13:18.579" style="s2">and the information we need we actually</p>
<p begin="00:13:16.750" end="00:13:20.980" style="s2">need a research team to go deeper into</p>
<p begin="00:13:18.579" end="00:13:22.660" style="s2">this before we can do before we can hold</p>
<p begin="00:13:20.980" end="00:13:24.820" style="s2">a solution raising on it as effectively</p>
<p begin="00:13:22.660" end="00:13:26.680" style="s2">as we&#39;d like and so there might be steps</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.820" end="00:13:30.100" style="s2">before the solution is a like homework</p>
<p begin="00:13:26.680" end="00:13:31.839" style="s2">that we give to ourselves so that we can</p>
<p begin="00:13:30.100" end="00:13:35.769" style="s2">have more of an impact in the solution</p>
<p begin="00:13:31.839" end="00:13:37.450" style="s2">and then how do we actually create a</p>
<p begin="00:13:35.769" end="00:13:39.010" style="s2">solution with 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:13:37.450" end="00:13:42.510" style="s2">once you have 10,000 people everyone</p>
<p begin="00:13:39.010" end="00:13:45.579" style="s2">puts in $10 and you have $100,000 but</p>
<p begin="00:13:42.510" end="00:13:46.870" style="s2">getting the 10,000 people and so after</p>
<p begin="00:13:45.579" end="00:13:51.010" style="s2">my conversation with Jordan Hall this</p>
<p begin="00:13:46.870" end="00:13:52.570" style="s2">week what was I liked the idea the</p>
<p begin="00:13:51.010" end="00:13:55.420" style="s2">suggestion he gave which is to figure</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.570" end="00:13:56.890" style="s2">out a process although when we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:13:55.420" end="00:13:59.829" style="s2">talking about it we want to figure out a</p>
<p begin="00:13:56.890" end="00:14:03.550" style="s2">process for 10,000 people we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:13:59.829" end="00:14:05.950" style="s2">create the process in a very emits the</p>
<p begin="00:14:03.550" end="00:14:07.959" style="s2">word like hands on manual way for a</p>
<p begin="00:14:05.950" end="00:14:10.690" style="s2">thousand people let&#39;s say so using</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.959" end="00:14:12.160" style="s2">spreadsheets using which honestly might</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.690" end="00:14:14.529" style="s2">be overwhelming for even a thousand</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.160" end="00:14:16.959" style="s2">people even clearly it&#39;s overwhelming</p>
<p begin="00:14:14.529" end="00:14:20.170" style="s2">for a thousand people that&#39;s like 250</p>
<p begin="00:14:16.959" end="00:14:21.430" style="s2">groups of poor people each but again if</p>
<p begin="00:14:20.170" end="00:14:22.959" style="s2">it&#39;s under the same assumption but</p>
<p begin="00:14:21.430" end="00:14:26.949" style="s2">jordan&#39;s assumption was that those</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.959" end="00:14:29.350" style="s2">thousand were people that were we have</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.949" end="00:14:30.130" style="s2">different ways of tackling so he&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:29.350" end="00:14:32.199" style="s2">saving the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:30.130" end="00:14:33.850" style="s2">Jordan is all about kind of finding he</p>
<p begin="00:14:32.199" end="00:14:38.620" style="s2">would not use these words but the elite</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.850" end="00:14:40.870" style="s2">right the people who are Havoc&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.620" end="00:14:44.050" style="s2">really good personal sovereignty really</p>
<p begin="00:14:40.870" end="00:14:46.209" style="s2">good sense making skills and my approach</p>
<p begin="00:14:44.050" end="00:14:48.610" style="s2">is a little bit the opposite but it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:14:46.209" end="00:14:50.740" style="s2">like find a group of everyday people and</p>
<p begin="00:14:48.610" end="00:14:53.860" style="s2">find those people amongst them they will</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.740" end="00:14:56.019" style="s2">emerge whereas like finding the elites</p>
<p begin="00:14:53.860" end="00:14:58.570" style="s2">is not it&#39;s not the thing I want to do</p>
<p begin="00:14:56.019" end="00:15:00.519" style="s2">because I think everyone can participate</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.570" end="00:15:01.930" style="s2">in this process everyone can create a</p>
<p begin="00:15:00.519" end="00:15:04.029" style="s2">solution everyone can have a</p>
<p begin="00:15:01.930" end="00:15:06.459" style="s2">conversation if they want to that</p>
<p begin="00:15:04.029" end="00:15:08.470" style="s2">generates solutions and it&#39;s about it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:15:06.459" end="00:15:10.360" style="s2">not about creating a new a new elite</p>
<p begin="00:15:08.470" end="00:15:12.430" style="s2">who&#39;s gonna be the like positive</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.360" end="00:15:13.060" style="s2">Illuminati of the world again not Jordan</p>
<p begin="00:15:12.430" end="00:15:16.209" style="s2">in any way</p>
<p begin="00:15:13.060" end="00:15:17.620" style="s2">but it&#39;s my being not a type-a</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.209" end="00:15:18.820" style="s2">personality in the world and feeling</p>
<p begin="00:15:17.620" end="00:15:22.449" style="s2">like the world doesn&#39;t work for me my</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.820" end="00:15:23.400" style="s2">whole life was a little bit shadow wound</p>
<p begin="00:15:22.449" end="00:15:25.500" style="s2">and a little</p>
<p begin="00:15:23.400" end="00:15:27.510" style="s2">but no this is not that&#39;s not actually</p>
<p begin="00:15:25.500" end="00:15:31.740" style="s2">how we empower humanity to save humanity</p>
<p begin="00:15:27.510" end="00:15:35.190" style="s2">isn&#39;t by impaired by employing elites</p>
<p begin="00:15:31.740" end="00:15:37.380" style="s2">it&#39;s by employing the masses and so so</p>
<p begin="00:15:35.190" end="00:15:39.510" style="s2">with the ten thousand hundred thousand</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.380" end="00:15:41.400" style="s2">to ten thousand in his mind you find a</p>
<p begin="00:15:39.510" end="00:15:43.680" style="s2">thousand people who are committed were</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.400" end="00:15:47.460" style="s2">committed to this project and want to be</p>
<p begin="00:15:43.680" end="00:15:49.140" style="s2">more instrumentally involved and then we</p>
<p begin="00:15:47.460" end="00:15:50.550" style="s2">invite ten people each and although I</p>
<p begin="00:15:49.140" end="00:15:52.500" style="s2">love that idea if I see someone just</p>
<p begin="00:15:50.550" end="00:15:54.000" style="s2">gave me a hundred or a thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:15:52.500" end="00:15:56.460" style="s2">that were like yes I want to do a</p>
<p begin="00:15:54.000" end="00:15:59.210" style="s2">solution raise aid I work through it no</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.460" end="00:16:01.380" style="s2">problem but by I would rather kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.210" end="00:16:03.030" style="s2">find the people who are super committed</p>
<p begin="00:16:01.380" end="00:16:06.450" style="s2">who I guess is kind of like the elite</p>
<p begin="00:16:03.030" end="00:16:08.160" style="s2">the people the elite &#39;no siz their</p>
<p begin="00:16:06.450" end="00:16:10.140" style="s2">interest in creating solutions together</p>
<p begin="00:16:08.160" end="00:16:14.600" style="s2">and working for a process that could be</p>

<p begin="00:16:14.600" end="00:16:19.800" style="s2">finding whatever thousand people those</p>
<p begin="00:16:16.740" end="00:16:20.580" style="s2">are it&#39;s fine but not all thousand are</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.800" end="00:16:21.660" style="s2">going to want to participate in the</p>
<p begin="00:16:20.580" end="00:16:24.780" style="s2">conversation there&#39;s gonna be a</p>

<p begin="00:16:27.240" end="00:16:32.250" style="s2">because they could witness the process</p>
<p begin="00:16:29.250" end="00:16:34.530" style="s2">they could watch it live they won&#39;t but</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.250" end="00:16:35.790" style="s2">they could then they are going to be</p>

<p begin="00:16:35.790" end="00:16:39.960" style="s2">and the more we&#39;re able to but I I don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:19:53.760" end="00:19:57.990" style="s2">don&#39;t I guess I don&#39;t allow people after</p>

<p begin="00:20:05.490" end="00:20:12.870" style="s2">the conversation I&#39;m excited for what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.070" end="00:20:16.530" style="s2">procrastinate I mean this is kind of my</p>
<p begin="00:20:12.870" end="00:20:18.930" style="s2">um my process is although I my</p>
<p begin="00:20:16.530" end="00:20:22.230" style="s2">personality is I like to have everything</p>
<p begin="00:20:18.930" end="00:20:25.170" style="s2">planned out and I&#39;m a perfectionist the</p>
<p begin="00:20:22.230" end="00:20:28.440" style="s2">world that&#39;s not allowed me to retain</p>
<p begin="00:20:25.170" end="00:20:30.690" style="s2">that part of my personality I&#39;m also a</p>
<p begin="00:20:28.440" end="00:20:32.580" style="s2">very somewhat rigid person like I need</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.690" end="00:20:34.650" style="s2">things to go according to plan I need</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.580" end="00:20:36.750" style="s2">and so I get very agitated when they&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:34.650" end="00:20:39.390" style="s2">not like when people aren&#39;t acting how I</p>
<p begin="00:20:36.750" end="00:20:41.220" style="s2">want them to act we thought that being</p>
<p begin="00:20:39.390" end="00:20:43.050" style="s2">conscious like without it being like</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.220" end="00:20:46.020" style="s2">you&#39;re not acting as it&#39;s like a</p>
<p begin="00:20:43.050" end="00:20:47.520" style="s2">subconscious piece of like I can feel</p>
<p begin="00:20:46.020" end="00:20:48.840" style="s2">the agitation in my body and then I have</p>
<p begin="00:20:47.520" end="00:20:50.880" style="s2">to figure out right you don&#39;t get to</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.840" end="00:20:52.500" style="s2">rule over the world you don&#39;t get to how</p>
<p begin="00:20:50.880" end="00:20:53.880" style="s2">people do it you want once I knew that</p>
<p begin="00:20:52.500" end="00:20:55.920" style="s2">that was a part of my personality I</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.880" end="00:20:59.960" style="s2">could let go a bit more and same with</p>
<p begin="00:20:55.920" end="00:21:03.090" style="s2">this now that I know I can let go of</p>
<p begin="00:20:59.960" end="00:21:05.310" style="s2">needing a plan because whatever magic</p>
<p begin="00:21:03.090" end="00:21:06.870" style="s2">the universe is it&#39;s God it&#39;s magic it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:05.310" end="00:21:09.420" style="s2">I don&#39;t know what it is but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.870" end="00:21:11.550" style="s2">something absolutely amazing that</p>
<p begin="00:21:09.420" end="00:21:14.760" style="s2">happens when you like surrender to it</p>
<p begin="00:21:11.550" end="00:21:17.670" style="s2">and although my personality is not what</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.760" end="00:21:19.140" style="s2">its surrender my life lessons are and so</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.670" end="00:21:21.150" style="s2">now I&#39;m like okay I don&#39;t need to plan</p>
<p begin="00:21:19.140" end="00:21:22.650" style="s2">it all out I know how we can save the</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.150" end="00:21:24.420" style="s2">world and I don&#39;t know how to</p>
<p begin="00:21:22.650" end="00:21:26.100" style="s2">communicate it and how freaking perfect</p>
<p begin="00:21:24.420" end="00:21:27.720" style="s2">is that because otherwise I would I</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.100" end="00:21:30.420" style="s2">would have written out the right pages</p>
<p begin="00:21:27.720" end="00:21:37.710" style="s2">and it would change the second after I</p>
<p begin="00:21:30.420" end="00:21:41.420" style="s2">wrote them this path yeah what&#39;s funny</p>
<p begin="00:21:37.710" end="00:21:45.600" style="s2">there is responding to this comment the</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.420" end="00:21:47.520" style="s2">people need elites and in my body I like</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.600" end="00:21:49.500" style="s2">I said I know I&#39;m not an expert on</p>

<p begin="00:21:57.060" end="00:22:00.840" style="s2">more about medicine than I do</p>
<p begin="00:21:58.410" end="00:22:03.420" style="s2">however they also have one area of</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.840" end="00:22:04.170" style="s2">expertise and I have my body is my area</p>
<p begin="00:22:03.420" end="00:22:06.330" style="s2">of expertise</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.170" end="00:22:08.730" style="s2">and they don&#39;t know my body they don&#39;t</p>

<p begin="00:22:24.870" end="00:22:29.430" style="s2">them and that is what you get with</p>
<p begin="00:22:26.460" end="00:22:32.400" style="s2">elites and you also get people who</p>
<p begin="00:22:29.430" end="00:22:33.900" style="s2">society already works for and I love</p>

<p begin="00:27:13.850" end="00:27:19.380" style="s2">do I hire someone I can pay their what</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.640" end="00:27:21.600" style="s2">they&#39;re worth in the Philippines or do I</p>
<p begin="00:27:19.380" end="00:27:23.460" style="s2">hire someone in Vancouver who needs to</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.600" end="00:27:26.130" style="s2">pay Vancouver rent out of the goodness</p>
<p begin="00:27:23.460" end="00:27:27.420" style="s2">of my heart maybe I I start a tech firm</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.130" end="00:27:28.500" style="s2">and I wanted to be in Vancouver so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:27.420" end="00:27:29.940" style="s2">want the Vancouver people to come</p>
<p begin="00:27:28.500" end="00:27:33.150" style="s2">together well if you&#39;re not coming</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.940" end="00:27:35.070" style="s2">together again why am i hiring you</p>
<p begin="00:27:33.150" end="00:27:35.340" style="s2">locally maybe we&#39;ve come together once a</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.070" end="00:27:38.910" style="s2">month</p>
<p begin="00:27:35.340" end="00:27:40.530" style="s2">Mason maybe that is why but you can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:27:38.910" end="00:27:45.750" style="s2">compete with the other people who are</p>
<p begin="00:27:40.530" end="00:27:47.430" style="s2">outsourcing to other countries and that</p>
<p begin="00:27:45.750" end="00:27:48.720" style="s2">is our economy nutshell</p>
<p begin="00:27:47.430" end="00:27:50.520" style="s2">even if you want to do the right thing</p>
<p begin="00:27:48.720" end="00:27:52.470" style="s2">what is the right thing again there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.520" end="00:27:53.700" style="s2">both sides it&#39;s like why your Canadian</p>
<p begin="00:27:52.470" end="00:27:58.950" style="s2">jobs more important than looking</p>
<p begin="00:27:53.700" end="00:28:00.360" style="s2">Filipino jobs I wouldn&#39;t know but that</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.950" end="00:28:01.920" style="s2">if what you want is for things remain</p>
<p begin="00:28:00.360" end="00:28:03.810" style="s2">local and have more of a local</p>
<p begin="00:28:01.920" end="00:28:05.610" style="s2">foundation which we&#39;re also gonna see</p>
<p begin="00:28:03.810" end="00:28:07.620" style="s2">you might see we actually might see</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.610" end="00:28:10.140" style="s2">manufacturing jobs coming back also out</p>
<p begin="00:28:07.620" end="00:28:11.940" style="s2">of this but a lot of manufacturing jobs</p>
<p begin="00:28:10.140" end="00:28:13.740" style="s2">especially if what you need to pay</p>
<p begin="00:28:11.940" end="00:28:17.600" style="s2">people in Canada and America to work in</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.740" end="00:28:19.710" style="s2">a manufacturing job is even $20 an hour</p>
<p begin="00:28:17.600" end="00:28:21.420" style="s2">robots are cheaper than that they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:28:19.710" end="00:28:22.650" style="s2">take sick time and they don&#39;t ETI and</p>
<p begin="00:28:21.420" end="00:28:24.630" style="s2">they don&#39;t need workers comp and they</p>
<p begin="00:28:22.650" end="00:28:26.460" style="s2">don&#39;t need and so even if we&#39;re having</p>
<p begin="00:28:24.630" end="00:28:28.440" style="s2">more manufacturing jobs it&#39;s not gonna</p>
<p begin="00:28:26.460" end="00:28:29.900" style="s2">be like when we have manufacturing here</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.440" end="00:28:32.610" style="s2">in the fifties sixties and seventies</p>
<p begin="00:28:29.900" end="00:28:35.760" style="s2">where people were paid a really good</p>
<p begin="00:28:32.610" end="00:28:36.900" style="s2">wage and part of that there&#39;s gonna be a</p>
<p begin="00:28:35.760" end="00:28:39.150" style="s2">few people who are paid a decent</p>
<p begin="00:28:36.900" end="00:28:41.010" style="s2">probably living wage and the majority</p>
<p begin="00:28:39.150" end="00:28:42.840" style="s2">will be whole be robots and so it&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:28:41.010" end="00:28:44.250" style="s2">that sounds very doom and gloom because</p>
<p begin="00:28:42.840" end="00:28:46.620" style="s2">it&#39;s like if someone&#39;s like um</p>
<p begin="00:28:44.250" end="00:28:48.720" style="s2">looking for has paid employment and that</p>
<p begin="00:28:46.620" end="00:28:50.310" style="s2">is like on the focus of a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:28:48.720" end="00:28:51.570" style="s2">people&#39;s minds right now right you need</p>
<p begin="00:28:50.310" end="00:28:53.100" style="s2">to put food on the table you put a roof</p>
<p begin="00:28:51.570" end="00:28:54.630" style="s2">over your head and the world hasn&#39;t felt</p>
<p begin="00:28:53.100" end="00:28:57.090" style="s2">more fragile than it does right now</p>
<p begin="00:28:54.630" end="00:29:00.000" style="s2">because even in the financial crisis of</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.090" end="00:29:03.000" style="s2">2008 and it was hard to find a job and</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.000" end="00:29:05.070" style="s2">that that what&#39;s the word that cohort of</p>
<p begin="00:29:03.000" end="00:29:06.890" style="s2">people who graduated are still having</p>
<p begin="00:29:05.070" end="00:29:11.130" style="s2">problems could not they have like a</p>
<p begin="00:29:06.890" end="00:29:12.570" style="s2">everyone was was being graduated from</p>
<p begin="00:29:11.130" end="00:29:14.430" style="s2">their school and they usually like let&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:29:12.570" end="00:29:16.080" style="s2">say 40% of them go into a career and the</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.430" end="00:29:17.040" style="s2">other 60% to find something else because</p>
<p begin="00:29:16.080" end="00:29:19.710" style="s2">if you&#39;re not hired right away you</p>
<p begin="00:29:17.040" end="00:29:20.580" style="s2">basically just wasted your education yay</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.710" end="00:29:23.640" style="s2">capitalism</p>
<p begin="00:29:20.580" end="00:29:26.370" style="s2">yay survival of the fittest and supplied</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.640" end="00:29:28.140" style="s2">beds so they couldn&#39;t find jobs because</p>
<p begin="00:29:26.370" end="00:29:30.990" style="s2">everyone else was looking for them as</p>
<p begin="00:29:28.140" end="00:29:34.350" style="s2">well and so it was like a lost</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.990" end="00:29:36.510" style="s2">generation of people graduating but it</p>
<p begin="00:29:34.350" end="00:29:38.930" style="s2">was a tiny fraction so if you were in</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.510" end="00:29:41.160" style="s2">one of the industries that was very</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.930" end="00:29:43.500" style="s2">impacted like the financial industry or</p>
<p begin="00:29:41.160" end="00:29:45.570" style="s2">real estate then the chances are you</p>
<p begin="00:29:43.500" end="00:29:46.860" style="s2">didn&#39;t find a job in that but you could</p>
<p begin="00:29:45.570" end="00:29:48.750" style="s2">have found a job other places because</p>
<p begin="00:29:46.860" end="00:29:51.660" style="s2">other parts of the of the economy were</p>
<p begin="00:29:48.750" end="00:29:55.980" style="s2">thriving even if there weren&#39;t enough to</p>
<p begin="00:29:51.660" end="00:29:58.080" style="s2">go around this is literally most of our</p>
<p begin="00:29:55.980" end="00:29:59.970" style="s2">jobs aren&#39;t happening right now and</p>
<p begin="00:29:58.080" end="00:30:01.500" style="s2">people still need to eat so we have to</p>
<p begin="00:29:59.970" end="00:30:05.010" style="s2">pass things like universal basic income</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.500" end="00:30:05.910" style="s2">we have to figure out not just am i I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.010" end="00:30:08.970" style="s2">in it for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:05.910" end="00:30:10.860" style="s2">which is is not wrong it&#39;s what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:08.970" end="00:30:14.280" style="s2">raised as it&#39;s what our society kind of</p>
<p begin="00:30:10.860" end="00:30:16.080" style="s2">props up is the way to be but if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:30:14.280" end="00:30:17.370" style="s2">in it for yourself just to put food on</p>
<p begin="00:30:16.080" end="00:30:18.600" style="s2">your table and a roof over your head</p>
<p begin="00:30:17.370" end="00:30:20.340" style="s2">it&#39;s gonna be a lot harder because then</p>
<p begin="00:30:18.600" end="00:30:22.620" style="s2">it&#39;s competition right it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:30:20.340" end="00:30:24.210" style="s2">one of us can flip the burger clearly we</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.620" end="00:30:25.980" style="s2">cannot both work for this you know</p>
<p begin="00:30:24.210" end="00:30:27.750" style="s2">unless there&#39;s two positions one</p>

<p begin="00:30:27.750" end="00:30:32.340" style="s2">fighting for because it&#39;s the only jobs</p>
<p begin="00:30:29.400" end="00:30:34.710" style="s2">that are available whereas if we can</p>

<p begin="00:31:42.840" end="00:31:46.500" style="s2">a bit dicey because it&#39;s a lot harder to</p>

<p begin="00:31:46.500" end="00:31:51.080" style="s2">astronomically expensive but there are</p>
<p begin="00:31:48.420" end="00:31:53.460" style="s2">ways we could 3d print and and</p>
<p begin="00:31:51.080" end="00:31:54.750" style="s2">manufactured homes ourselves together at</p>
<p begin="00:31:53.460" end="00:31:55.380" style="s2">cost they could make it much more</p>

<p begin="00:32:05.490" end="00:32:09.870" style="s2">food is a much easier problem to tackle</p>
<p begin="00:32:07.429" end="00:32:13.940" style="s2">food is like can we grow enough food</p>
<p begin="00:32:09.870" end="00:32:19.350" style="s2">together can we do my gender identity I</p>

<p begin="00:32:34.380" end="00:32:39.720" style="s2">you the one thing we can&#39;t do is push</p>
<p begin="00:32:37.020" end="00:32:42.780" style="s2">our worldview onto everyone else so if</p>
<p begin="00:32:39.720" end="00:32:44.460" style="s2">I&#39;m a vegan which I&#39;m not I can talk</p>

<p begin="00:32:44.460" end="00:32:48.570" style="s2">world but I can&#39;t enforce that on people</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.740" end="00:32:49.890" style="s2">I could find 10,000 other vegans and</p>
<p begin="00:32:48.570" end="00:32:52.080" style="s2">figure out how to eat more healthy and</p>
<p begin="00:32:49.890" end="00:32:54.120" style="s2">then we can invite other people and say</p>
<p begin="00:32:52.080" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">hey if you want to eat vegan come be</p>
<p begin="00:32:54.120" end="00:32:57.740" style="s2">part come be part come be part of this</p>

<p begin="00:33:13.520" end="00:33:19.820" style="s2">and not have a sense of humor like the</p>
<p begin="00:33:18.080" end="00:33:21.020" style="s2">biggest irony being that my nervous</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.820" end="00:33:24.050" style="s2">system shuts down when I&#39;m under stress</p>
<p begin="00:33:21.020" end="00:33:25.880" style="s2">is somehow I have the whole weight of</p>

<p begin="00:33:25.880" end="00:33:30.490" style="s2">yeah yeah that stress that I checked out</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.980" end="00:33:34.190" style="s2">I can&#39;t move forward and I have to like</p>
<p begin="00:33:30.490" end="00:33:36.080" style="s2">this weird ballet of accepting my life</p>
<p begin="00:33:34.190" end="00:33:37.610" style="s2">exactly as it is accepting my brain and</p>
<p begin="00:33:36.080" end="00:33:39.680" style="s2">body exactly as they are so they can</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.610" end="00:33:41.930" style="s2">work at their highest peak which is less</p>
<p begin="00:33:39.680" end="00:33:46.580" style="s2">than other people but what comes out</p>
<p begin="00:33:41.930" end="00:33:48.890" style="s2">well doing that is magic it&#39;s better</p>
<p begin="00:33:46.580" end="00:33:50.570" style="s2">than anything I when I the world did</p>
<p begin="00:33:48.890" end="00:33:53.480" style="s2">work for me before I had brain tumors</p>
<p begin="00:33:50.570" end="00:33:58.100" style="s2">and brain damage I picked this one I</p>
<p begin="00:33:53.480" end="00:34:00.710" style="s2">picked this life this weird hilarious my</p>
<p begin="00:33:58.100" end="00:34:03.230" style="s2">guides are bitches and have really</p>
<p begin="00:34:00.710" end="00:34:06.020" style="s2">extreme sarcastic sense of humor all of</p>
<p begin="00:34:03.230" end="00:34:07.790" style="s2">it I picked this and what was my point</p>
<p begin="00:34:06.020" end="00:34:10.130" style="s2">of that was oh that we can&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.790" end="00:34:11.540" style="s2">so my personality is a little like I</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.130" end="00:34:14.510" style="s2">know how we can save the world and</p>
<p begin="00:34:11.540" end="00:34:16.490" style="s2">everyone just needs to be me I&#39;ve gotten</p>
<p begin="00:34:14.510" end="00:34:19.100" style="s2">over that vast majority because that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:16.490" end="00:34:20.929" style="s2">the one thing that never happens because</p>
<p begin="00:34:19.100" end="00:34:22.310" style="s2">it&#39;s that sounds ridiculous why would</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.929" end="00:34:23.630" style="s2">you want everyone to be you of course</p>
<p begin="00:34:22.310" end="00:34:25.220" style="s2">everyone&#39;s not going to be you but</p>
<p begin="00:34:23.630" end="00:34:27.530" style="s2">there&#39;s ways you don&#39;t know you&#39;re being</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.220" end="00:34:29.600" style="s2">you that you think are universal but</p>
<p begin="00:34:27.530" end="00:34:31.429" style="s2">then someone points out or not universal</p>
<p begin="00:34:29.600" end="00:34:34.820" style="s2">it&#39;s like okay well where you think that</p>
<p begin="00:34:31.429" end="00:34:39.919" style="s2">so having a small group of people create</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.820" end="00:34:41.480" style="s2">something doesn&#39;t quite work having a</p>
<p begin="00:34:39.919" end="00:34:43.370" style="s2">bunch of people part of that process</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.480" end="00:34:44.960" style="s2">means it&#39;s gonna work at least for those</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.370" end="00:34:47.990" style="s2">people you can extrapolate the rest the</p>
<p begin="00:34:44.960" end="00:34:49.730" style="s2">population can collectively focus on</p>
<p begin="00:34:47.990" end="00:34:52.100" style="s2">prioritizing food and shelter for all</p>
<p begin="00:34:49.730" end="00:34:53.750" style="s2">like figure out a role for everyone to</p>
<p begin="00:34:52.100" end="00:34:54.830" style="s2">play and restructuring our food system</p>
<p begin="00:34:53.750" end="00:34:56.810" style="s2">yeah</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.830" end="00:34:58.760" style="s2">and that is what we am so so again</p>
<p begin="00:34:56.810" end="00:35:00.440" style="s2">10,000 people on $100,000 wouldn&#39;t be</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.760" end="00:35:02.420" style="s2">able to do that for the world but we</p>
<p begin="00:35:00.440" end="00:35:05.480" style="s2">could do that for ourselves right 10,000</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.420" end="00:35:08.930" style="s2">people in Vancouver could absolutely</p>
<p begin="00:35:05.480" end="00:35:10.640" style="s2">feed that Cooper could come together and</p>
<p begin="00:35:08.930" end="00:35:12.320" style="s2">say okay well six months to a year down</p>
<p begin="00:35:10.640" end="00:35:15.200" style="s2">the road we don&#39;t know what our supply</p>
<p begin="00:35:12.320" end="00:35:17.300" style="s2">chain looks like so though there&#39;s money</p>
<p begin="00:35:15.200" end="00:35:19.310" style="s2">in the supermarket there is food in the</p>
<p begin="00:35:17.300" end="00:35:21.110" style="s2">supermarket right now we don&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.310" end="00:35:21.540" style="s2">that&#39;s happening and we need to know we</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.110" end="00:35:23.430" style="s2">have enough</p>
<p begin="00:35:21.540" end="00:35:26.100" style="s2">calories and enough nutrition for our</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.430" end="00:35:27.300" style="s2">population if you had just 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:35:26.100" end="00:35:32.040" style="s2">figured that out for 10,000 people</p>
<p begin="00:35:27.300" end="00:35:33.630" style="s2">that&#39;d be great but it doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:35:32.040" end="00:35:34.860" style="s2">because the other people aren&#39;t starving</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.630" end="00:35:36.720" style="s2">and when people are starving they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:35:34.860" end="00:35:37.830" style="s2">a better higher self oh oh there&#39;s the</p>
<p begin="00:35:36.720" end="00:35:40.250" style="s2">over here starving well you have a</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.830" end="00:35:43.140" style="s2">beautiful garden that I won&#39;t steal from</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.250" end="00:35:45.960" style="s2">but yes if we can figure out shelter and</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.140" end="00:35:47.130" style="s2">food we have it made and that is partly</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.960" end="00:35:49.920" style="s2">what we might have to do is during this</p>
<p begin="00:35:47.130" end="00:35:51.300" style="s2">time demmick no one&#39;s ready to do that</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.920" end="00:35:54.540" style="s2">yet because we&#39;re only in like week</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.300" end="00:35:57.270" style="s2">three or four but after three or four</p>
<p begin="00:35:54.540" end="00:35:58.800" style="s2">months of this how cooped up in the city</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.270" end="00:36:00.870" style="s2">do you want to be because the point of</p>
<p begin="00:35:58.800" end="00:36:02.610" style="s2">living in a city somewhat is for</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.870" end="00:36:05.070" style="s2">employment we already went three wide</p>
<p begin="00:36:02.610" end="00:36:08.480" style="s2">bloom it&#39;s not a thing anymore and then</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.070" end="00:36:10.800" style="s2">big cultural events right parades and</p>
<p begin="00:36:08.480" end="00:36:12.450" style="s2">sporting events and to go out to</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.800" end="00:36:14.160" style="s2">restaurants so the restaurants Wilson</p>
<p begin="00:36:12.450" end="00:36:18.540" style="s2">still absolutely in existence we can</p>
<p begin="00:36:14.160" end="00:36:20.640" style="s2">ramp up our congregation to 50 maybe</p>
<p begin="00:36:18.540" end="00:36:24.240" style="s2">even 250 people but a lot of what our</p>
<p begin="00:36:20.640" end="00:36:26.460" style="s2">society&#39;s based on is thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:36:24.240" end="00:36:32.250" style="s2">10,000 people hundred thousand people</p>
<p begin="00:36:26.460" end="00:36:34.650" style="s2">events and those unless we have a</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.250" end="00:36:39.260" style="s2">permanent vaccine we might be done with</p>
<p begin="00:36:34.650" end="00:36:42.180" style="s2">those completely so what that means is a</p>
<p begin="00:36:39.260" end="00:36:43.590" style="s2">exodus from the cities because why do I</p>

<p begin="00:38:20.980" end="00:38:26.350" style="s2">that they&#39;re more equipped to deal with</p>
<p begin="00:38:22.840" end="00:38:28.330" style="s2">the resource part of it but because of</p>
<p begin="00:38:26.350" end="00:38:30.370" style="s2">the space was designed to be in and out</p>
<p begin="00:38:28.330" end="00:38:32.830" style="s2">of each other&#39;s places the space isn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.370" end="00:38:34.150" style="s2">designed for this so the kids who were</p>

<p begin="00:38:35.950" end="00:38:39.490" style="s2">really do that well their social</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.150" end="00:38:42.910" style="s2">distancing if they were an insulated</p>
<p begin="00:38:39.490" end="00:38:44.440" style="s2">community they could if everyone was out</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.910" end="00:38:45.910" style="s2">of work and everyone just lived there</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.440" end="00:38:47.710" style="s2">and they had one person leaving to get</p>
<p begin="00:38:45.910" end="00:38:48.370" style="s2">groceries you know for everyone that</p>
<p begin="00:38:47.710" end="00:38:51.550" style="s2">seems ridiculous</p>
<p begin="00:38:48.370" end="00:38:52.690" style="s2">they had groceries delivered right then</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.550" end="00:38:53.710" style="s2">they could be in and out of each other&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:38:52.690" end="00:38:56.920" style="s2">houses and it wouldn&#39;t be a problem</p>
<p begin="00:38:53.710" end="00:38:58.810" style="s2">having that out and it&#39;s more rural or</p>
<p begin="00:38:56.920" end="00:39:00.550" style="s2">urban but you still have an insulated</p>
<p begin="00:38:58.810" end="00:39:01.660" style="s2">community because one of the reasons I</p>
<p begin="00:39:00.550" end="00:39:03.610" style="s2">stopped going there before they</p>
<p begin="00:39:01.660" end="00:39:05.890" style="s2">cancelled their dinners a week after I</p>
<p begin="00:39:03.610" end="00:39:08.200" style="s2">stopped going because I&#39;m trying to keep</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.890" end="00:39:11.290" style="s2">my my dad safe is that there&#39;s four</p>
<p begin="00:39:08.200" end="00:39:13.060" style="s2">nurses that work there live there they</p>
<p begin="00:39:11.290" end="00:39:16.570" style="s2">don&#39;t work there they live there and</p>
<p begin="00:39:13.060" end="00:39:21.630" style="s2">work in the community as nurses so</p>
<p begin="00:39:16.570" end="00:39:23.860" style="s2">although one of them&#39;s in like kids ER</p>
<p begin="00:39:21.630" end="00:39:25.630" style="s2">there&#39;s gonna be less cases but there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.860" end="00:39:28.420" style="s2">definitely gonna be cases in the kids er</p>
<p begin="00:39:25.630" end="00:39:31.090" style="s2">one of them&#39;s a nurse practitioner who</p>
<p begin="00:39:28.420" end="00:39:33.520" style="s2">sees is like a GP and she sees a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:39:31.090" end="00:39:35.830" style="s2">people in the more disenfranchised like</p>
<p begin="00:39:33.520" end="00:39:38.020" style="s2">Lower East End and again gonna be very</p>
<p begin="00:39:35.830" end="00:39:39.490" style="s2">highly susceptible to it the one who</p>
<p begin="00:39:38.020" end="00:39:42.660" style="s2">lurks the ER has like a husband who has</p>
<p begin="00:39:39.490" end="00:39:44.950" style="s2">cancer like this is just not a great</p>
<p begin="00:39:42.660" end="00:39:46.380" style="s2">nurses are our heroes and they&#39;re also</p>
<p begin="00:39:44.950" end="00:39:49.710" style="s2">our vectors of disease right</p>
<p begin="00:39:46.380" end="00:39:52.200" style="s2">and our communities aren&#39;t set up for a</p>
<p begin="00:39:49.710" end="00:39:55.490" style="s2">pandemic so the more were able to work</p>
<p begin="00:39:52.200" end="00:39:58.800" style="s2">together to create solutions of like I</p>
<p begin="00:39:55.490" end="00:40:01.200" style="s2">love that they&#39;re they&#39;re nurses they</p>
<p begin="00:39:58.800" end="00:40:02.400" style="s2">have an actually essential job during</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.200" end="00:40:03.900" style="s2">this time period which means they both</p>
<p begin="00:40:02.400" end="00:40:05.940" style="s2">are gonna get enough money to feed their</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.900" end="00:40:09.810" style="s2">families and even if their spouses</p>
<p begin="00:40:05.940" end="00:40:11.310" style="s2">aren&#39;t working and but also it puts the</p>
<p begin="00:40:09.810" end="00:40:12.540" style="s2">community at risk there&#39;s people who</p>
<p begin="00:40:11.310" end="00:40:15.870" style="s2">live there who are immune compromised</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.540" end="00:40:17.700" style="s2">there&#39;s people like it&#39;s it&#39;s um it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:40:15.870" end="00:40:21.150" style="s2">hard to figure out what&#39;s the right</p>
<p begin="00:40:17.700" end="00:40:23.870" style="s2">thing to do especially with the nurses</p>
<p begin="00:40:21.150" end="00:40:25.980" style="s2">and doctors in this scenario like what</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.870" end="00:40:28.110" style="s2">you want to be able to see your family</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.980" end="00:40:29.970" style="s2">go home to see your family and then you</p>
<p begin="00:40:28.110" end="00:40:31.530" style="s2">risk them getting it and if they&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:40:29.970" end="00:40:34.320" style="s2">susceptible if they&#39;re not in the</p>
<p begin="00:40:31.530" end="00:40:42.180" style="s2">high-risk category it doesn&#39;t matter so</p>

<p begin="00:46:42.980" end="00:46:48.620" style="s2">look through it after tens of thousands</p>
<p begin="00:46:45.440" end="00:46:50.890" style="s2">of people go to it and it&#39;s more to say</p>
<p begin="00:46:48.620" end="00:46:54.440" style="s2">just like I was part of it because</p>
<p begin="00:46:50.890" end="00:46:55.820" style="s2">protests don&#39;t get a lot done like I go</p>
<p begin="00:46:54.440" end="00:46:57.470" style="s2">to them and they&#39;re like fifty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:46:55.820" end="00:46:59.270" style="s2">people are more like change we want</p>
<p begin="00:46:57.470" end="00:47:00.910" style="s2">change listen to us and it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:46:59.270" end="00:47:04.010" style="s2">what change are we actually invoking</p>
<p begin="00:47:00.910" end="00:47:06.500" style="s2">anything is gonna piss off somebody else</p>
<p begin="00:47:04.010" end="00:47:08.960" style="s2">so like just create the change yourself</p>
<p begin="00:47:06.500" end="00:47:11.330" style="s2">if a fraction of those fifty thousand</p>
<p begin="00:47:08.960" end="00:47:14.120" style="s2">people I&#39;m gonna say one in five ten</p>
<p begin="00:47:11.330" end="00:47:15.980" style="s2">thousand of them got together we can</p>
<p begin="00:47:14.120" end="00:47:18.140" style="s2">create okay again I don&#39;t have to solve</p>
<p begin="00:47:15.980" end="00:47:19.790" style="s2">women&#39;s issues with ten thousand dollars</p>
<p begin="00:47:18.140" end="00:47:21.470" style="s2">or sorry hundred thousand dollars and</p>
<p begin="00:47:19.790" end="00:47:23.570" style="s2">ten thousand people but we could</p>
<p begin="00:47:21.470" end="00:47:26.270" style="s2">absolutely create an app that made us</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.570" end="00:47:29.780" style="s2">feel safe to date online we could create</p>
<p begin="00:47:26.270" end="00:47:31.520" style="s2">something that was somewhat like a debt</p>
<p begin="00:47:29.780" end="00:47:33.410" style="s2">you believe which doesn&#39;t it make sense</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.520" end="00:47:34.970" style="s2">something behind the scenes where it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:47:33.410" end="00:47:35.960" style="s2">like I&#39;m reporting my boss and reporting</p>
<p begin="00:47:34.970" end="00:47:38.360" style="s2">this happened when there was enough</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.960" end="00:47:39.830" style="s2">allegations on one person then we asked</p>
<p begin="00:47:38.360" end="00:47:41.990" style="s2">for your story and so people in</p>
<p begin="00:47:39.830" end="00:47:43.790" style="s2">positions of power whether in business</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.990" end="00:47:45.380" style="s2">or just celebrity we would be up early</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.790" end="00:47:47.750" style="s2">whatever those are just my ideas for the</p>
<p begin="00:47:45.380" end="00:47:50.770" style="s2">mewtwo movement but there&#39;s a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:47:47.750" end="00:47:54.620" style="s2">ideas that we could create together with</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.770" end="00:47:56.450" style="s2">with 10,000 people and $100,000 the</p>
<p begin="00:47:54.620" end="00:47:59.000" style="s2">climate change same thing it&#39;s like well</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.450" end="00:48:00.860" style="s2">we want industries to change we want</p>
<p begin="00:47:59.000" end="00:48:02.420" style="s2">governments to pass and I&#39;m not saying</p>
<p begin="00:48:00.860" end="00:48:05.990" style="s2">that&#39;s wrong because I also want those</p>
<p begin="00:48:02.420" end="00:48:08.120" style="s2">things to come to be but our system is</p>
<p begin="00:48:05.990" end="00:48:10.510" style="s2">designed against it our system is</p>
<p begin="00:48:08.120" end="00:48:12.800" style="s2">designed against like you look at our</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.510" end="00:48:14.170" style="s2">elected leaders right now they want to</p>
<p begin="00:48:12.800" end="00:48:16.630" style="s2">do what&#39;s right like</p>
<p begin="00:48:14.170" end="00:48:18.250" style="s2">I don&#39;t think any of them want to either</p>
<p begin="00:48:16.630" end="00:48:19.480" style="s2">tank the economy because that&#39;s their</p>
<p begin="00:48:18.250" end="00:48:22.240" style="s2">thing they&#39;re usually in charge of</p>
<p begin="00:48:19.480" end="00:48:24.220" style="s2">keeping together and how they&#39;re gonna</p>
<p begin="00:48:22.240" end="00:48:26.860" style="s2">get rebooted in nor do they want people</p>
<p begin="00:48:24.220" end="00:48:28.090" style="s2">to die under the the pandemic and so</p>
<p begin="00:48:26.860" end="00:48:30.520" style="s2">right now they have to have a very</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.090" end="00:48:32.350" style="s2">difficult choice of like which ones less</p>
<p begin="00:48:30.520" end="00:48:36.400" style="s2">chaotic which ones less deaths which</p>
<p begin="00:48:32.350" end="00:48:41.340" style="s2">ones less of a long-term impact for the</p>
<p begin="00:48:36.400" end="00:48:41.340" style="s2">most amount of people and they&#39;re in</p>
<p begin="00:48:42.540" end="00:48:45.520" style="s2">mercy</p>
<p begin="00:48:43.660" end="00:48:49.150" style="s2">Christie it&#39;s what&#39;s coming out of my</p>
<p begin="00:48:45.520" end="00:48:55.420" style="s2">head but it looks so my brain threw that</p>
<p begin="00:48:49.150" end="00:48:57.040" style="s2">out through your name out oh my I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:48:55.420" end="00:48:59.530" style="s2">doing this every every morning at this</p>
<p begin="00:48:57.040" end="00:49:01.870" style="s2">time though you&#39;re welcome there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.530" end="00:49:03.310" style="s2">link it&#39;s not on a periscope itself it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:49:01.870" end="00:49:04.990" style="s2">not on Twitter today either but there</p>
<p begin="00:49:03.310" end="00:49:08.590" style="s2">will be there usually is a link I just</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.990" end="00:49:10.750" style="s2">didn&#39;t do one today I&#39;m doing it on</p>
<p begin="00:49:08.590" end="00:49:12.940" style="s2">periscope partly so people can find me</p>
<p begin="00:49:10.750" end="00:49:15.460" style="s2">Chris periscope has random viewers and</p>
<p begin="00:49:12.940" end="00:49:17.050" style="s2">then YouTube has more focused viewership</p>
<p begin="00:49:15.460" end="00:49:19.540" style="s2">of people who subscribe and then they</p>
<p begin="00:49:17.050" end="00:49:21.310" style="s2">they can his periscope like there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.540" end="00:49:22.990" style="s2">way to comment when you&#39;re not in the</p>
<p begin="00:49:21.310" end="00:49:25.750" style="s2">scope there&#39;s no way to comment after it</p>
<p begin="00:49:22.990" end="00:49:26.740" style="s2">you can do it on Twitter or I guess but</p>
<p begin="00:49:25.750" end="00:49:29.410" style="s2">then you have to know they&#39;re on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.740" end="00:49:31.000" style="s2">another handle and go there so that is</p>
<p begin="00:49:29.410" end="00:49:32.260" style="s2">partly why I&#39;m on periscope doing it is</p>
<p begin="00:49:31.000" end="00:49:34.060" style="s2">it it&#39;s attached to my Twitter account</p>
<p begin="00:49:32.260" end="00:49:36.340" style="s2">and then people who follow me on Twitter</p>
<p begin="00:49:34.060" end="00:49:38.530" style="s2">can see what I&#39;m up to and be part of it</p>
<p begin="00:49:36.340" end="00:49:42.190" style="s2">we&#39;re doing solution raising which I</p>
<p begin="00:49:38.530" end="00:49:45.040" style="s2">know when Wes got you were part of the</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.190" end="00:49:48.400" style="s2">idea cafe or coming up with solutions</p>
<p begin="00:49:45.040" end="00:49:50.760" style="s2">for for that when I was talking about</p>
<p begin="00:49:48.400" end="00:49:53.020" style="s2">solutions for that my language skills um</p>
<p begin="00:49:50.760" end="00:49:54.850" style="s2">now we&#39;re doing solution raisings which</p>
<p begin="00:49:53.020" end="00:49:57.820" style="s2">is like an hour-long conversation that</p>
<p begin="00:49:54.850" end="00:49:59.740" style="s2">generates actual ideas on solutions for</p>
<p begin="00:49:57.820" end="00:50:01.800" style="s2">problems if we had 10,000 people on</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.740" end="00:50:03.940" style="s2">$100,000</p>
<p begin="00:50:01.800" end="00:50:10.000" style="s2">so it&#39;s aligned with looking the food</p>
<p begin="00:50:03.940" end="00:50:12.420" style="s2">chain cuckoo Cree and diversity within</p>
<p begin="00:50:10.000" end="00:50:14.770" style="s2">connection and honoureth and friendship</p>
<p begin="00:50:12.420" end="00:50:16.210" style="s2">we&#39;ll definitely check it out our food</p>
<p begin="00:50:14.770" end="00:50:19.210" style="s2">system something we absolutely to be</p>
<p begin="00:50:16.210" end="00:50:20.680" style="s2">doing the biggest benefit I&#39;ve seen in</p>
<p begin="00:50:19.210" end="00:50:23.020" style="s2">the game be space although there&#39;s terms</p>
<p begin="00:50:20.680" end="00:50:23.470" style="s2">like food is complex and everyone needs</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.020" end="00:50:25.150" style="s2">it</p>
<p begin="00:50:23.470" end="00:50:26.830" style="s2">everyone needs enough calories to</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.150" end="00:50:27.670" style="s2">survive we have different diets that we</p>
<p begin="00:50:26.830" end="00:50:29.049" style="s2">need</p>
<p begin="00:50:27.670" end="00:50:31.210" style="s2">there&#39;s a ton of people working on</p>
<p begin="00:50:29.049" end="00:50:32.740" style="s2">solutions but like anything if we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.210" end="00:50:35.349" style="s2">dissipated all over the place we&#39;re not</p>
<p begin="00:50:32.740" end="00:50:38.380" style="s2">necessarily focused on creating the most</p>
<p begin="00:50:35.349" end="00:50:40.150" style="s2">efficient solution and that word someone</p>
<p begin="00:50:38.380" end="00:50:42.160" style="s2">triggers people but right now efficiency</p>
<p begin="00:50:40.150" end="00:50:46.089" style="s2">because what we&#39;re seeing now is a world</p>
<p begin="00:50:42.160" end="00:50:48.339" style="s2">maximized for efficiency and how non</p>
<p begin="00:50:46.089" end="00:50:52.809" style="s2">resilience it is that it when something</p>
<p begin="00:50:48.339" end="00:50:55.569" style="s2">goes wrong and crumbles and we we need</p>
<p begin="00:50:52.809" end="00:50:57.700" style="s2">redundancy in the right ways we need</p>
<p begin="00:50:55.569" end="00:51:01.660" style="s2">there to be ideas constantly coming in</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.700" end="00:51:04.660" style="s2">to people working on new ideas but also</p>
<p begin="00:51:01.660" end="00:51:06.069" style="s2">not taking away the energy and power of</p>
<p begin="00:51:04.660" end="00:51:08.440" style="s2">what&#39;s what&#39;s currently happening right</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.069" end="00:51:10.510" style="s2">so if we did have 10,000 people working</p>
<p begin="00:51:08.440" end="00:51:12.309" style="s2">on a food app deciding what what that</p>
<p begin="00:51:10.510" end="00:51:15.390" style="s2">would look like what would Sam G look</p>
<p begin="00:51:12.309" end="00:51:30.010" style="s2">like with more people</p>
<p begin="00:51:15.390" end="00:51:32.140" style="s2">once my dad roommates talking to someone</p>
<p begin="00:51:30.010" end="00:51:34.270" style="s2">my kid was talking with someone that was</p>
<p begin="00:51:32.140" end="00:51:35.740" style="s2">the funny thing is just some degree</p>
<p begin="00:51:34.270" end="00:51:37.150" style="s2">although I I&#39;ve done a little bit of</p>
<p begin="00:51:35.740" end="00:51:38.740" style="s2">permitting over the last couple of weeks</p>
<p begin="00:51:37.150" end="00:51:40.390" style="s2">which I didn&#39;t think I would because I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:51:38.740" end="00:51:41.950" style="s2">basically always a hermit and now</p>
<p begin="00:51:40.390" end="00:51:43.599" style="s2">everyone&#39;s at home like I could talk to</p>
<p begin="00:51:41.950" end="00:51:45.940" style="s2">me about Skype all day every day if I</p>
<p begin="00:51:43.599" end="00:51:47.740" style="s2">wanted which I kind of was but everyone</p>
<p begin="00:51:45.940" end="00:51:50.440" style="s2">was working so I developed my own</p>
<p begin="00:51:47.740" end="00:51:52.859" style="s2">community or not my own but tapped into</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.440" end="00:51:55.450" style="s2">a community of people doing that and</p>

<p begin="00:57:02.170" end="00:57:07.180" style="s2">but it works for the world I like having</p>
<p begin="00:57:04.900" end="00:57:07.810" style="s2">a technology cooperative we all owned</p>

<p begin="00:57:21.160" end="00:57:25.690" style="s2">happen and so if we owned Google and it</p>
<p begin="00:57:24.580" end="00:57:27.310" style="s2">didn&#39;t need to go through our</p>
<p begin="00:57:25.690" end="00:57:29.830" style="s2">governments and we were like yes let&#39;s</p>

<p begin="01:02:42.519" end="01:02:46.179" style="s2">an hour coming up with a solution we</p>
<p begin="01:02:44.229" end="01:02:50.049" style="s2">could implement with 10,000 people and</p>
<p begin="01:02:46.179" end="01:02:52.089" style="s2">$100,000 and we have dozens of them how</p>
