<p begin="00:01:30.950" end="00:01:35.930" style="s2">a place to me in dialogue around what</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.130" end="00:01:39.950" style="s2">matters most at the knife edge of</p>
<p begin="00:01:35.930" end="00:01:42.140" style="s2">history and you are here on the knife</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.950" end="00:01:43.640" style="s2">edge okay so I started I was thinking</p>
<p begin="00:01:42.140" end="00:01:48.020" style="s2">through this morning about like what is</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.640" end="00:01:50.960" style="s2">the sake of Technology playground and so</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.020" end="00:01:53.150" style="s2">I wanted to try to dive a little deeper</p>
<p begin="00:01:50.960" end="00:01:55.610" style="s2">into that territory you know we got</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.150" end="00:01:57.979" style="s2">started by doing those source code</p>
<p begin="00:01:55.610" end="00:02:00.560" style="s2">protocols that was a little more like</p>
<p begin="00:01:57.979" end="00:02:04.130" style="s2">cognitive and conceptual but can we dive</p>
<p begin="00:02:00.560" end="00:02:07.280" style="s2">in from there going to kind of a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.130" end="00:02:10.269" style="s2">regions of mind this is always a</p>
<p begin="00:02:07.280" end="00:02:14.870" style="s2">challenge because I&#39;m kind of making</p>
<p begin="00:02:10.269" end="00:02:17.510" style="s2">kind of revising what I do in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.870" end="00:02:21.049" style="s2">research the insight Center here for</p>
<p begin="00:02:17.510" end="00:02:23.019" style="s2">kind of a short zoom application so</p>
<p begin="00:02:21.049" end="00:02:28.730" style="s2">there&#39;s always a very experimental</p>
<p begin="00:02:23.019" end="00:02:30.560" style="s2">aspect to it and I think that the other</p>
<p begin="00:02:28.730" end="00:02:33.109" style="s2">sessions have been lovely and your</p>
<p begin="00:02:30.560" end="00:02:34.680" style="s2">participation has been great so now I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.109" end="00:02:39.269" style="s2">going to try to take on a</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.680" end="00:02:43.950" style="s2">another challenge so we&#39;re gonna do a</p>
<p begin="00:02:39.269" end="00:02:49.140" style="s2">fuse a series about unpacking the nature</p>
<p begin="00:02:43.950" end="00:02:50.640" style="s2">of the experience and you know some of</p>
<p begin="00:02:49.140" end="00:02:52.980" style="s2">you have probably have done a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.640" end="00:02:56.750" style="s2">work in meditation you may belong to a</p>
<p begin="00:02:52.980" end="00:03:00.420" style="s2">tradition so I don&#39;t mean to undermine</p>
<p begin="00:02:56.750" end="00:03:03.239" style="s2">the more sophisticated work you&#39;re doing</p>
<p begin="00:03:00.420" end="00:03:06.540" style="s2">but what I&#39;m trying intending to do is</p>
<p begin="00:03:03.239" end="00:03:08.129" style="s2">to see if we can accelerate a shared</p>
<p begin="00:03:06.540" end="00:03:13.739" style="s2">understanding of some of these</p>
<p begin="00:03:08.129" end="00:03:19.099" style="s2">sophisticated wisdom skills so in many</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.739" end="00:03:22.519" style="s2">traditions I&#39;m thinking here of modern</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.099" end="00:03:26.010" style="s2">meditation trainers like shins and young</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.519" end="00:03:30.170" style="s2">Daniel Ingram Kenneth Falk somebody you</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.010" end="00:03:30.170" style="s2">might you might know some of these words</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.610" end="00:03:38.599" style="s2">they they create a labeling system</p>
<p begin="00:03:35.980" end="00:03:41.239" style="s2">that&#39;s gonna sound jus allistic the</p>
<p begin="00:03:38.599" end="00:03:45.019" style="s2">point is to start as if these are</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.239" end="00:03:49.610" style="s2">separate things just so we can parse the</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.019" end="00:03:52.879" style="s2">territory but eventually we reclaim them</p>
<p begin="00:03:49.610" end="00:03:55.120" style="s2">and we integrate them so Kenneth oak for</p>
<p begin="00:03:52.879" end="00:03:58.400" style="s2">example will say everything is either</p>
<p begin="00:03:55.120" end="00:04:00.890" style="s2">experience or thought ok so we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:03:58.400" end="00:04:03.410" style="s2">going to use this framework I know it</p>
<p begin="00:04:00.890" end="00:04:06.290" style="s2">sounds hopelessly dualistic but it does</p>
<p begin="00:04:03.410" end="00:04:09.170" style="s2">come from these traditions and what we</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.290" end="00:04:17.750" style="s2">want to do is see how accurately and</p>
<p begin="00:04:09.170" end="00:04:21.380" style="s2">precisely we can talk about them in a</p>
<p begin="00:04:17.750" end="00:04:23.539" style="s2">shared language that&#39;s not hopelessly</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.380" end="00:04:25.910" style="s2">confounded by all these spiritual terms</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.539" end="00:04:27.710" style="s2">and these split hairs in these nuances</p>
<p begin="00:04:25.910" end="00:04:30.740" style="s2">and Buddha scholastics and cognitive</p>
<p begin="00:04:27.710" end="00:04:34.130" style="s2">neuroscience ok so this is part of a</p>
<p begin="00:04:30.740" end="00:04:36.139" style="s2">modern minimalist approach to unpacking</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.130" end="00:04:36.950" style="s2">the nature of the experience so we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.139" end="00:04:38.810" style="s2">just going to have these two</p>
<p begin="00:04:36.950" end="00:04:40.729" style="s2">placeholders they should work as</p>
<p begin="00:04:38.810" end="00:04:44.360" style="s2">placeholders for now we have thought and</p>
<p begin="00:04:40.729" end="00:04:47.840" style="s2">we have experience and today we&#39;re just</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.360" end="00:04:51.550" style="s2">going to work with thought and we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.840" end="00:04:57.139" style="s2">going to work with the most ordinary and</p>
<p begin="00:04:51.550" end="00:04:59.240" style="s2">in some sense irritating or distracting</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.139" end="00:05:03.050" style="s2">mode of thought and that&#39;s called</p>
<p begin="00:04:59.240" end="00:05:06.020" style="s2">inner talk or inner speech right it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:05:03.050" end="00:05:07.070" style="s2">when we are going on an interview and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.020" end="00:05:08.780" style="s2">rehearse</p>
<p begin="00:05:07.070" end="00:05:11.120" style="s2">you know we rehearse what we&#39;re going to</p>
<p begin="00:05:08.780" end="00:05:12.620" style="s2">say we have the whole conversation</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.120" end="00:05:14.150" style="s2">oh no no then you rehearse it and you</p>
<p begin="00:05:12.620" end="00:05:18.500" style="s2">rehearse and rehearse it&#39;s the inner</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.150" end="00:05:23.419" style="s2">speech is any kind of thought that</p>
<p begin="00:05:18.500" end="00:05:26.449" style="s2">actually is like virtualized talk so</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.419" end="00:05:29.389" style="s2">before we go on just any everybody get</p>
<p begin="00:05:26.449" end="00:05:32.889" style="s2">it does everybody grok what we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:05:29.389" end="00:05:37.390" style="s2">talking about what kind of extraordinary</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.889" end="00:05:42.560" style="s2">human experience we&#39;re talking about ok</p>
<p begin="00:05:37.390" end="00:05:48.700" style="s2">now imagine you met</p>
<p begin="00:05:42.560" end="00:05:52.340" style="s2">you&#39;re space traveler and you met a</p>
<p begin="00:05:48.700" end="00:05:55.310" style="s2">intelligent species that could speak to</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.340" end="00:05:58.669" style="s2">you but maybe you have transponders so</p>
<p begin="00:05:55.310" end="00:06:01.970" style="s2">you can you can speak but they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.669" end="00:06:05.480" style="s2">have inner talk okay the the two</p>
<p begin="00:06:01.970" end="00:06:08.330" style="s2">placeholders are thought in experience</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.480" end="00:06:10.040" style="s2">and today we&#39;re looking only at stock</p>
<p begin="00:06:08.330" end="00:06:12.620" style="s2">that was a question from the chat and</p>
<p begin="00:06:10.040" end="00:06:15.139" style="s2">the part of thought we&#39;re looking at is</p>
<p begin="00:06:12.620" end="00:06:18.610" style="s2">just this thing called inner talk okay</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.139" end="00:06:23.030" style="s2">so we&#39;re gonna start examining than this</p>
<p begin="00:06:18.610" end="00:06:25.220" style="s2">okay so you meet an alien and they talk</p>
<p begin="00:06:23.030" end="00:06:28.700" style="s2">to each other like they make sounds in</p>
<p begin="00:06:25.220" end="00:06:32.720" style="s2">their air and but they never they have</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.700" end="00:06:36.229" style="s2">they don&#39;t have inner talk and the alien</p>
<p begin="00:06:32.720" end="00:06:38.540" style="s2">says what is that how would you explain</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.229" end="00:06:43.340" style="s2">what is happening when you have inner</p>
<p begin="00:06:38.540" end="00:06:46.190" style="s2">talk so the alien might say do you mean</p>
<p begin="00:06:43.340" end="00:06:49.490" style="s2">you hear something and you would have to</p>
<p begin="00:06:46.190" end="00:06:54.289" style="s2">hedge well I don&#39;t actually hear it like</p>
<p begin="00:06:49.490" end="00:06:58.970" style="s2">I&#39;m hearing you now so this is what I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.289" end="00:07:01.940" style="s2">asking you what is what is actually</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.970" end="00:07:06.680" style="s2">happening I mean this is so familiar to</p>
<p begin="00:07:01.940" end="00:07:09.380" style="s2">you right it&#39;s like the most ordinary</p>
<p begin="00:07:06.680" end="00:07:11.090" style="s2">thing and actually sometimes it&#39;s like</p>
<p begin="00:07:09.380" end="00:07:13.729" style="s2">when you have a song in your in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.090" end="00:07:15.410" style="s2">head it&#39;s very similar right you hear a</p>
<p begin="00:07:13.729" end="00:07:18.440" style="s2">song in your head and the aliens like</p>
<p begin="00:07:15.410" end="00:07:20.810" style="s2">what do you mean you hear a song in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.440" end="00:07:23.300" style="s2">head like - you hearin well if you</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.810" end="00:07:26.090" style="s2">actually heard it that would be either</p>
<p begin="00:07:23.300" end="00:07:27.770" style="s2">real perception or aural hallucination</p>
<p begin="00:07:26.090" end="00:07:30.530" style="s2">but we&#39;re talking about this other thing</p>
<p begin="00:07:27.770" end="00:07:35.360" style="s2">that seems to be enclosed in your</p>
<p begin="00:07:30.530" end="00:07:39.860" style="s2">thought so what kinds of things would</p>
<p begin="00:07:35.360" end="00:07:41.690" style="s2">you say yeah so someone said imagining</p>
<p begin="00:07:39.860" end="00:07:45.110" style="s2">it but then you have to describe what is</p>
<p begin="00:07:41.690" end="00:07:47.570" style="s2">imagination so what is this thing that</p>
<p begin="00:07:45.110" end="00:07:50.210" style="s2">is happening when you&#39;re doing this I</p>
<p begin="00:07:47.570" end="00:07:52.099" style="s2">mean you&#39;re thinking of recipes you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:07:50.210" end="00:07:54.270" style="s2">thinking you make lists in your head</p>
<p begin="00:07:52.099" end="00:07:56.520" style="s2">you&#39;ve got like schedules and then you</p>
<p begin="00:07:54.270" end="00:07:59.040" style="s2">no but if you god forbid you&#39;re planning</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.520" end="00:08:03.780" style="s2">a wedding a lot of that is going on in</p>
<p begin="00:07:59.040" end="00:08:07.850" style="s2">your head what is that it isn&#39;t it</p>
<p begin="00:08:03.780" end="00:08:07.850" style="s2">strange that we don&#39;t know what that is</p>
<p begin="00:08:09.560" end="00:08:15.390" style="s2">so yeah someone says okay this is good</p>
<p begin="00:08:12.920" end="00:08:17.580" style="s2">someone&#39;s are splitting into two persons</p>
<p begin="00:08:15.390" end="00:08:22.730" style="s2">one talking to another talking to</p>
<p begin="00:08:17.580" end="00:08:22.730" style="s2">oneself but how does the talking happen</p>
<p begin="00:08:22.820" end="00:08:33.630" style="s2">do you move your mouth do you make</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.780" end="00:08:36.150" style="s2">sounds so this is a good first move you</p>
<p begin="00:08:33.630" end="00:08:38.310" style="s2">understand there&#39;s a split perspective</p>
<p begin="00:08:36.150" end="00:08:40.050" style="s2">of a listener and a talker</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.310" end="00:08:44.700" style="s2">all right so you&#39;ve kind of created a</p>
<p begin="00:08:40.050" end="00:08:48.390" style="s2">spatial George Herbert Mead made this</p>
<p begin="00:08:44.700" end="00:08:53.370" style="s2">point that you&#39;re actually playing two</p>
<p begin="00:08:48.390" end="00:08:55.800" style="s2">roles okay so when you&#39;re listening to</p>
<p begin="00:08:53.370" end="00:08:58.530" style="s2">the talk in your head which which one</p>
<p begin="00:08:55.800" end="00:09:00.690" style="s2">are you the talker or the listener or</p>
<p begin="00:08:58.530" end="00:09:05.600" style="s2">can you do you toggle back and forth so</p>
<p begin="00:09:00.690" end="00:09:09.510" style="s2">that&#39;s one part of it this ability to</p>
<p begin="00:09:05.600" end="00:09:12.600" style="s2">this ability to hold both perspectives</p>
<p begin="00:09:09.510" end="00:09:20.520" style="s2">while this inner talk is happening but</p>
<p begin="00:09:12.600" end="00:09:21.960" style="s2">how does inner talk happen there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:09:20.520" end="00:09:26.120" style="s2">thought that comes from a lot</p>
<p begin="00:09:21.960" end="00:09:26.120" style="s2">neurological pathway okay</p>
<p begin="00:09:28.250" end="00:09:35.400" style="s2">yes that that is one way to start</p>
<p begin="00:09:31.320" end="00:09:38.850" style="s2">getting at it is that neurological</p>
<p begin="00:09:35.400" end="00:09:41.820" style="s2">pathway intentional then for example how</p>
<p begin="00:09:38.850" end="00:09:44.880" style="s2">do you own how do you how do you take</p>
<p begin="00:09:41.820" end="00:09:51.270" style="s2">over the intentionality of thinking out</p>
<p begin="00:09:44.880" end="00:09:53.430" style="s2">things previous burn previously burned</p>
<p begin="00:09:51.270" end="00:09:55.950" style="s2">by past experience Tonya&#39;s saying this</p>
<p begin="00:09:53.430" end="00:09:58.340" style="s2">yes what&#39;s this notion of previously</p>
<p begin="00:09:55.950" end="00:09:58.340" style="s2">burned</p>
<p begin="00:10:02.160" end="00:10:07.029" style="s2">don&#39;t feel split if I&#39;m aware of it in a</p>
<p begin="00:10:05.290" end="00:10:09.339" style="s2">way that feels separate there&#39;s also a</p>
<p begin="00:10:07.029" end="00:10:16.410" style="s2">way to be aware of it okay yes so</p>
<p begin="00:10:09.339" end="00:10:21.269" style="s2">there&#39;s so that there is you can be</p>
<p begin="00:10:16.410" end="00:10:24.459" style="s2">completely unaware of the neuro</p>
<p begin="00:10:21.269" end="00:10:26.410" style="s2">pathological processing of thought or we</p>
<p begin="00:10:24.459" end="00:10:28.589" style="s2">you can be constant you can have both</p>
<p begin="00:10:26.410" end="00:10:31.570" style="s2">perspectives and you could be like</p>
<p begin="00:10:28.589" end="00:10:33.579" style="s2">sometimes if I&#39;m writing something I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:10:31.570" end="00:10:35.320" style="s2">too lazy to get out of bed I actually</p>
<p begin="00:10:33.579" end="00:10:37.450" style="s2">start well maybe the title should be</p>
<p begin="00:10:35.320" end="00:10:40.000" style="s2">this you know I&#39;m actually very</p>
<p begin="00:10:37.450" end="00:10:44.230" style="s2">intentionally manipulating the symbol</p>
<p begin="00:10:40.000" end="00:10:46.660" style="s2">symbolic words in my head so this notion</p>
<p begin="00:10:44.230" end="00:11:01.540" style="s2">of how what identity you are how many</p>
<p begin="00:10:46.660" end="00:11:05.020" style="s2">identities is very important so how does</p>
<p begin="00:11:01.540" end="00:11:08.320" style="s2">it okay yes so this notion of burning</p>
<p begin="00:11:05.020" end="00:11:11.560" style="s2">like burning a CD right is very it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:11:08.320" end="00:11:18.370" style="s2">very good now how does where does the</p>
<p begin="00:11:11.560" end="00:11:20.680" style="s2">burning come from you&#39;re going to get</p>
<p begin="00:11:18.370" end="00:11:26.620" style="s2">into an infinite regress if you say it</p>
<p begin="00:11:20.680" end="00:11:32.910" style="s2">comes from earlier thoughts right what</p>
<p begin="00:11:26.620" end="00:11:37.770" style="s2">is that which burns attention emotion</p>
<p begin="00:11:32.910" end="00:11:40.810" style="s2">yes but how does that&#39;s true if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:11:37.770" end="00:11:47.620" style="s2">recreating emotion but I&#39;m we&#39;re talking</p>
<p begin="00:11:40.810" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">about inner talk the words the speaker</p>
<p begin="00:11:47.620" end="00:11:50.160" style="s2">in your head</p>
<p begin="00:11:53.900" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">ah okay who said that experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:12:00.250" end="00:12:05.560" style="s2">does some days Brandon do you want to</p>
<p begin="00:12:05.710" end="00:12:24.460" style="s2">unpack that a little sure so the weight</p>
<p begin="00:12:19.670" end="00:12:27.170" style="s2">of an experience I guess imprints</p>
<p begin="00:12:24.460" end="00:12:30.980" style="s2">imprints the the neural pathway that</p>
<p begin="00:12:27.170" end="00:12:33.080" style="s2">tanya was talking about and then so when</p>
<p begin="00:12:30.980" end="00:12:35.420" style="s2">you have a similar experience in the</p>
<p begin="00:12:33.080" end="00:12:38.150" style="s2">future there&#39;s like a resonance from</p>
<p begin="00:12:35.420" end="00:12:40.610" style="s2">that first experience that echoes I</p>
<p begin="00:12:38.150" end="00:12:42.110" style="s2">guess it&#39;s echo and that&#39;s and that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:12:40.610" end="00:12:44.839" style="s2">the voice is that echo of that first</p>
<p begin="00:12:42.110" end="00:12:47.000" style="s2">experience bouncing off the the rock</p>
<p begin="00:12:44.839" end="00:12:48.740" style="s2">that&#39;s now appearing before you that</p>
<p begin="00:12:47.000" end="00:12:53.390" style="s2">that&#39;s similar to the rock that it came</p>
<p begin="00:12:48.740" end="00:13:10.670" style="s2">from okay so the first experience of</p>
<p begin="00:12:53.390" end="00:13:13.670" style="s2">inner talk be like nothing&#39;s coming up</p>
<p begin="00:13:10.670" end="00:13:24.860" style="s2">for me immediately okay good you move</p>
<p begin="00:13:13.670" end="00:13:34.610" style="s2">the needle Tanya if you want to follow</p>
<p begin="00:13:24.860" end="00:13:38.170" style="s2">follow the rabbit hole yeah sure I I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:34.610" end="00:13:44.810" style="s2">feeling into an experience back in my</p>
<p begin="00:13:38.170" end="00:13:49.209" style="s2">childhood in elementary school where I</p>
<p begin="00:13:44.810" end="00:13:52.640" style="s2">feel like I was developing a sense of</p>
<p begin="00:13:49.209" end="00:13:57.290" style="s2">self or identity someone said identity</p>
<p begin="00:13:52.640" end="00:14:01.910" style="s2">and there was a context that I was</p>
<p begin="00:13:57.290" end="00:14:07.580" style="s2">existing in that had ideas about that</p>
<p begin="00:14:01.910" end="00:14:10.640" style="s2">and I also had an experience</p>
<p begin="00:14:07.580" end="00:14:12.500" style="s2">that was not necessarily that wasn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:14:10.640" end="00:14:15.710" style="s2">necessarily connected to that</p>
<p begin="00:14:12.500" end="00:14:19.010" style="s2">construction or not a product of that</p>
<p begin="00:14:15.710" end="00:14:22.550" style="s2">construction but it was interpreted</p>
<p begin="00:14:19.010" end="00:14:26.000" style="s2">through that construction and a story</p>
<p begin="00:14:22.550" end="00:14:33.460" style="s2">formed about who I was and how the world</p>
<p begin="00:14:26.000" end="00:14:36.500" style="s2">is and then that story replicated itself</p>
<p begin="00:14:33.460" end="00:14:38.810" style="s2">over and over and over over the years in</p>
<p begin="00:14:36.500" end="00:14:43.970" style="s2">different ways in different situations</p>
<p begin="00:14:38.810" end="00:14:47.720" style="s2">and burned in a neurological pathway or</p>
<p begin="00:14:43.970" end="00:14:50.780" style="s2">pathways yeah so that&#39;s a great</p>
<p begin="00:14:47.720" end="00:14:58.730" style="s2">explanation of the burning in and I like</p>
<p begin="00:14:50.780" end="00:15:02.840" style="s2">this this is a good metaphor for sussing</p>
<p begin="00:14:58.730" end="00:15:05.180" style="s2">this out but we&#39;re trying to not we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:15:02.840" end="00:15:10.040" style="s2">trying to be very simple which makes it</p>
<p begin="00:15:05.180" end="00:15:14.120" style="s2">more difficult okay how does the ability</p>
<p begin="00:15:10.040" end="00:15:16.190" style="s2">to talk to yourself get burned in well</p>
<p begin="00:15:14.120" end="00:15:18.080" style="s2">through experience but what kind of</p>
<p begin="00:15:16.190" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">experience just the ability to talk to</p>
<p begin="00:15:18.080" end="00:15:23.980" style="s2">yourself not the whole experience itself</p>
<p begin="00:15:28.030" end="00:15:37.850" style="s2">it&#39;s actually very very simple which is</p>
<p begin="00:15:33.200" end="00:15:41.360" style="s2">why you can&#39;t see it try to think the</p>
<p begin="00:15:37.850" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">source protocol try to think very very</p>
<p begin="00:15:41.360" end="00:15:44.140" style="s2">simply</p>
<p begin="00:15:53.690" end="00:15:59.040" style="s2">there&#39;s a way in which is happening</p>
<p begin="00:15:56.040" end="00:16:10.530" style="s2">right now I feel like in relation to you</p>
<p begin="00:15:59.040" end="00:16:14.400" style="s2">and the a there are ideas of looking for</p>
<p begin="00:16:10.530" end="00:16:19.200" style="s2">the right answer that are creating</p>
<p begin="00:16:14.400" end="00:16:21.630" style="s2">static hmm so I&#39;m going to ask you I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:16:19.200" end="00:16:24.300" style="s2">gonna give you a clue now sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:16:21.630" end="00:16:27.690" style="s2">these clothes put you off in the wrong</p>
<p begin="00:16:24.300" end="00:16:32.250" style="s2">direction it&#39;s not what I&#39;m offering it</p>
<p begin="00:16:27.690" end="00:16:36.750" style="s2">for but if it if it goes south I&#39;ll just</p>
<p begin="00:16:32.250" end="00:16:39.060" style="s2">say forget that clue okay ah okay so</p>
<p begin="00:16:36.750" end="00:16:41.100" style="s2">Brandon I think you&#39;re onto it but I</p>
<p begin="00:16:39.060" end="00:16:43.560" style="s2">want to give the clue for other people</p>
<p begin="00:16:41.100" end="00:16:45.480" style="s2">very good work see yeah I think you were</p>
<p begin="00:16:43.560" end="00:16:50.340" style="s2">onto it before but you needed your quiet</p>
<p begin="00:16:45.480" end="00:16:54.720" style="s2">time wait till I get to it so I want you</p>
<p begin="00:16:50.340" end="00:16:56.310" style="s2">to virtualize moving your right hands</p>
<p begin="00:16:54.720" end="00:17:01.020" style="s2">raising your right hand don&#39;t raise it</p>
<p begin="00:16:56.310" end="00:17:05.610" style="s2">just virtualize it in your mind right so</p>
<p begin="00:17:01.020" end="00:17:08.339" style="s2">that&#39;s a thought what is the fundamental</p>
<p begin="00:17:05.610" end="00:17:11.100" style="s2">first experience of raising your right</p>
<p begin="00:17:08.339" end="00:17:14.180" style="s2">hand that&#39;s not a thought that burns</p>
<p begin="00:17:11.100" end="00:17:14.180" style="s2">that into your mind</p>
<p begin="00:17:18.530" end="00:17:28.320" style="s2">this isn&#39;t easy to be an easy question</p>
<p begin="00:17:21.390" end="00:17:32.810" style="s2">but the first experience of raising your</p>
<p begin="00:17:28.320" end="00:17:37.320" style="s2">hand yes you raise your hand you burn in</p>
<p begin="00:17:32.810" end="00:17:38.910" style="s2">the ability to reimagine it so when you</p>
<p begin="00:17:37.320" end="00:17:42.180" style="s2">first learn to raise your hand your</p>
<p begin="00:17:38.910" end="00:17:45.080" style="s2">sensory motor practice process is coming</p>
<p begin="00:17:42.180" end="00:17:47.970" style="s2">from your core intentional space</p>
<p begin="00:17:45.080" end="00:17:50.580" style="s2">activate some motor neurons you burn you</p>
<p begin="00:17:47.970" end="00:17:54.020" style="s2">you do this with your hand that pathway</p>
<p begin="00:17:50.580" end="00:17:56.610" style="s2">is now accessible for downward causation</p>
<p begin="00:17:54.020" end="00:17:58.950" style="s2">which means you can think of raising</p>
<p begin="00:17:56.610" end="00:18:01.470" style="s2">your hand so this notion of burning is</p>
<p begin="00:17:58.950" end="00:18:05.520" style="s2">perfect now here is the thing about</p>
<p begin="00:18:01.470" end="00:18:09.420" style="s2">thought all thought is is the burning of</p>
<p begin="00:18:05.520" end="00:18:13.470" style="s2">your mouth moving of your mouth moving</p>
<p begin="00:18:09.420" end="00:18:15.270" style="s2">and your ears know when your mouth moves</p>
<p begin="00:18:13.470" end="00:18:18.350" style="s2">like this in your tongue that&#39;s what it</p>
<p begin="00:18:15.270" end="00:18:20.640" style="s2">sounds like it&#39;s that&#39;s a wavy</p>
<p begin="00:18:18.350" end="00:18:24.450" style="s2">fancy-schmancy consciousness thing it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:18:20.640" end="00:18:27.510" style="s2">the subtle recreation of the embodied</p>
<p begin="00:18:24.450" end="00:18:31.140" style="s2">experience of talking and hearing burned</p>
<p begin="00:18:27.510" end="00:18:34.260" style="s2">in and then down we caused it this is</p>
<p begin="00:18:31.140" end="00:18:36.570" style="s2">why Google is creating a sensors that</p>
<p begin="00:18:34.260" end="00:18:40.620" style="s2">can read your thoughts because it can</p>
<p begin="00:18:36.570" end="00:18:43.140" style="s2">subtly feel the little Tracking&#39;s very</p>
<p begin="00:18:40.620" end="00:18:45.720" style="s2">subtle movement action patterns that are</p>
<p begin="00:18:43.140" end="00:18:49.350" style="s2">sub-threshold when you think inter talk</p>
<p begin="00:18:45.720" end="00:18:51.380" style="s2">and that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:18:49.350" end="00:18:51.380" style="s2">is</p>
<p begin="00:18:52.679" end="00:18:58.720" style="s2">does it make sense people don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:56.590" end="00:19:00.610" style="s2">especially spiritual people they don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:18:58.720" end="00:19:05.429" style="s2">want to they don&#39;t want to know this</p>
<p begin="00:19:00.610" end="00:19:05.429" style="s2">because they have a mind-body duality</p>
<p begin="00:19:05.639" end="00:19:11.729" style="s2">I think thought is implanted from some</p>
<p begin="00:19:08.219" end="00:19:14.700" style="s2">kind of cosmic sphere it&#39;s inherently</p>
<p begin="00:19:11.729" end="00:19:16.919" style="s2">dialogic in nature it does more it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:19:14.700" end="00:19:18.959" style="s2">miracle that we can do it it&#39;s a miracle</p>
<p begin="00:19:16.919" end="00:19:24.059" style="s2">that we can recreate raising your right</p>
<p begin="00:19:18.959" end="00:19:26.549" style="s2">hand in your mind right the fact that we</p>
<p begin="00:19:24.059" end="00:19:29.369" style="s2">can do that is why you can control an</p>
<p begin="00:19:26.549" end="00:19:32.609" style="s2">artificial limb with your mind if you</p>
<p begin="00:19:29.369" end="00:19:35.190" style="s2">had never had arms you could not control</p>
<p begin="00:19:32.609" end="00:19:37.469" style="s2">artificial limbs because those pathways</p>
<p begin="00:19:35.190" end="00:19:40.559" style="s2">the downward causation has not been</p>
<p begin="00:19:37.469" end="00:19:42.539" style="s2">burned into your brain and it&#39;s not only</p>
<p begin="00:19:40.559" end="00:19:44.039" style="s2">your brain many many other things are</p>
<p begin="00:19:42.539" end="00:19:46.829" style="s2">involved I just use brain as a</p>
<p begin="00:19:44.039" end="00:19:49.919" style="s2">placeholder but inner talk is the same</p>
<p begin="00:19:46.829" end="00:19:52.859" style="s2">thing in our talk is the subtle</p>
<p begin="00:19:49.919" end="00:19:56.749" style="s2">recreation of sensory motor patterns in</p>
<p begin="00:19:52.859" end="00:19:56.749" style="s2">a downward causation</p>
<p begin="00:20:02.019" end="00:20:11.269" style="s2">okay yes so but then how can I have an</p>
<p begin="00:20:08.119" end="00:20:14.779" style="s2">original thought that we never had</p>
<p begin="00:20:11.269" end="00:20:20.629" style="s2">before so let me talk about downward</p>
<p begin="00:20:14.779" end="00:20:24.950" style="s2">causation first so downward cop</p>
<p begin="00:20:20.629" end="00:20:27.499" style="s2">it&#39;s a cybernetics term so in terms of</p>
<p begin="00:20:24.950" end="00:20:30.469" style="s2">our burning we mean like when we when we</p>
<p begin="00:20:27.499" end="00:20:32.299" style="s2">I&#39;m gonna use vinyl records because I</p>
<p begin="00:20:30.469" end="00:20:35.059" style="s2">actually don&#39;t know how you make CDs</p>
<p begin="00:20:32.299" end="00:20:38.059" style="s2">right so when you&#39;re when you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:20:35.059" end="00:20:41.839" style="s2">recording a record first you have the</p>
<p begin="00:20:38.059" end="00:20:45.079" style="s2">vinyl and you&#39;re burning in the grooves</p>
<p begin="00:20:41.839" end="00:20:48.919" style="s2">right that&#39;s what we would call upward</p>
<p begin="00:20:45.079" end="00:20:53.539" style="s2">causation real experience is setting</p>
<p begin="00:20:48.919" end="00:21:00.079" style="s2">pathways so the first time I if I say</p>
<p begin="00:20:53.539" end="00:21:04.190" style="s2">water water water water not only is what</p>
<p begin="00:21:00.079" end="00:21:06.979" style="s2">I&#39;m getting is I&#39;m getting a covariance</p>
<p begin="00:21:04.190" end="00:21:07.969" style="s2">between the what my mouth is doing and</p>
<p begin="00:21:06.979" end="00:21:12.109" style="s2">what it sounds like</p>
<p begin="00:21:07.969" end="00:21:14.450" style="s2">and so the perceptual sound the</p>
<p begin="00:21:12.109" end="00:21:17.269" style="s2">perceptual organs of the ears are</p>
<p begin="00:21:14.450" end="00:21:21.279" style="s2">starting to call very with this water</p>
<p begin="00:21:17.269" end="00:21:26.859" style="s2">water every time I do this water water</p>
<p begin="00:21:21.279" end="00:21:29.839" style="s2">my ears say that feeling of going water</p>
<p begin="00:21:26.859" end="00:21:32.779" style="s2">sounds like this and these two things</p>
<p begin="00:21:29.839" end="00:21:36.739" style="s2">become coupled that&#39;s why I can read</p>
<p begin="00:21:32.779" end="00:21:38.690" style="s2">people&#39;s lips because I can see what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:21:36.739" end="00:21:41.570" style="s2">happening with their lips feels like</p>
<p begin="00:21:38.690" end="00:21:45.409" style="s2">this and then my ears say that&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:21:41.570" end="00:21:48.649" style="s2">coupled with this sound so yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:21:45.409" end="00:21:50.929" style="s2">you&#39;re wiring together different aspects</p>
<p begin="00:21:48.649" end="00:21:54.320" style="s2">of perception this is why you can teach</p>
<p begin="00:21:50.929" end="00:22:00.560" style="s2">mute people to speak by touching when</p>
<p begin="00:21:54.320" end="00:22:04.700" style="s2">they touch your face okay so</p>
<p begin="00:22:00.560" end="00:22:10.370" style="s2">once were so those get wired together so</p>
<p begin="00:22:04.700" end="00:22:12.110" style="s2">this feeling is associated with a sound</p>
<p begin="00:22:10.370" end="00:22:14.270" style="s2">we haven&#39;t gotten to the meeting yet</p>
<p begin="00:22:12.110" end="00:22:18.530" style="s2">symbolic meaning we just talk talking</p>
<p begin="00:22:14.270" end="00:22:20.900" style="s2">about the sound and then what happens is</p>
<p begin="00:22:18.530" end="00:22:25.240" style="s2">so that&#39;s upward causation</p>
<p begin="00:22:20.900" end="00:22:28.160" style="s2">now the downward causation is when I am</p>
<p begin="00:22:25.240" end="00:22:31.550" style="s2">thinking to say water in my head you can</p>
<p begin="00:22:28.160" end="00:22:36.680" style="s2">do it now if you go slow water well and</p>
<p begin="00:22:31.550" end="00:22:40.360" style="s2">you&#39;re very very aware you can feel that</p>
<p begin="00:22:36.680" end="00:22:40.360" style="s2">you feel your mouth doing that</p>
<p begin="00:22:41.920" end="00:22:48.910" style="s2">if you exaggerate it and that slight</p>
<p begin="00:22:44.860" end="00:22:51.460" style="s2">motor subtle motor pattern your ears are</p>
<p begin="00:22:48.910" end="00:22:56.470" style="s2">so primed to say well that&#39;s what that</p>
<p begin="00:22:51.460" end="00:22:59.170" style="s2">sounds like they add into the</p>
<p begin="00:22:56.470" end="00:23:03.309" style="s2">sub-threshold motor movement a sub</p>
<p begin="00:22:59.170" end="00:23:07.170" style="s2">threshold sound and that&#39;s called sub</p>
<p begin="00:23:03.309" end="00:23:07.170" style="s2">vocalization that&#39;s called inner talk</p>
<p begin="00:23:08.120" end="00:23:13.860" style="s2">so that&#39;s what I mean like downward</p>
<p begin="00:23:10.290" end="00:23:17.850" style="s2">causation it&#39;s not the action the motor</p>
<p begin="00:23:13.860" end="00:23:23.160" style="s2">action in the perception you causing an</p>
<p begin="00:23:17.850" end="00:23:25.500" style="s2">experience it&#39;s activating the patterns</p>
<p begin="00:23:23.160" end="00:23:29.570" style="s2">that were burned in to cause the</p>
<p begin="00:23:25.500" end="00:23:29.570" style="s2">virtualization of an experience</p>
<p begin="00:23:46.010" end="00:23:55.160" style="s2">yes so we&#39;re just a thought arise from</p>
<p begin="00:23:48.780" end="00:23:57.750" style="s2">weird duck we didn&#39;t get there yet but</p>
<p begin="00:23:55.160" end="00:23:59.070" style="s2">what if you could and we&#39;re not going to</p>
<p begin="00:23:57.750" end="00:24:00.810" style="s2">do that today because we&#39;re going to we</p>
<p begin="00:23:59.070" end="00:24:02.550" style="s2">have to go to symbolic representation</p>
<p begin="00:24:00.810" end="00:24:04.530" style="s2">their mental models the structural</p>
<p begin="00:24:02.550" end="00:24:10.260" style="s2">architecture of mind and then the</p>
<p begin="00:24:04.530" end="00:24:11.610" style="s2">fundamental the fundamental organization</p>
<p begin="00:24:10.260" end="00:24:14.220" style="s2">of self other in world</p>
<p begin="00:24:11.610" end="00:24:18.600" style="s2">so we already so these are all aspects</p>
<p begin="00:24:14.220" end="00:24:21.300" style="s2">of thought we already mentioned some of</p>
<p begin="00:24:18.600" end="00:24:23.550" style="s2">the self other in world because we</p>
<p begin="00:24:21.300" end="00:24:26.070" style="s2">started by saying you can recreate like</p>
<p begin="00:24:23.550" end="00:24:30.300" style="s2">a conversation to people you recreate a</p>
<p begin="00:24:26.070" end="00:24:32.820" style="s2">dialogue as&#39; in your brain so so you</p>
<p begin="00:24:30.300" end="00:24:35.220" style="s2">that is an organization of self and</p>
<p begin="00:24:32.820" end="00:24:38.070" style="s2">other a certain type of organization</p>
<p begin="00:24:35.220" end="00:24:47.750" style="s2">itself in other you organize that in</p>
<p begin="00:24:38.070" end="00:24:47.750" style="s2">your head and so we have to build up</p>
<p begin="00:24:47.910" end="00:24:52.799" style="s2">mind from these different from these</p>
<p begin="00:24:50.610" end="00:24:57.780" style="s2">different aspects and inner talk is</p>
<p begin="00:24:52.799" end="00:24:59.250" style="s2">actually not a very interesting part of</p>
<p begin="00:24:57.780" end="00:25:02.520" style="s2">mine it doesn&#39;t give you a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:24:59.250" end="00:25:06.179" style="s2">insight it&#39;s it uses language which is</p>
<p begin="00:25:02.520" end="00:25:08.309" style="s2">coarse-grained right uses language which</p>
<p begin="00:25:06.179" end="00:25:10.559" style="s2">is coarse-grained everyone up one of my</p>
<p begin="00:25:08.309" end="00:25:14.250" style="s2">first experiences was when I was three</p>
<p begin="00:25:10.559" end="00:25:16.559" style="s2">years old and I know I was three years</p>
<p begin="00:25:14.250" end="00:25:19.200" style="s2">old because my mother was teaching me</p>
<p begin="00:25:16.559" end="00:25:20.760" style="s2">how to pray and I saw I asked her I like</p>
<p begin="00:25:19.200" end="00:25:22.200" style="s2">like when did you like teach me how to</p>
<p begin="00:25:20.760" end="00:25:23.850" style="s2">pray and she said oh that&#39;s when your</p>
<p begin="00:25:22.200" end="00:25:25.980" style="s2">sister went to the first grade and so</p>
<p begin="00:25:23.850" end="00:25:29.909" style="s2">you were probably three years old I used</p>
<p begin="00:25:25.980" end="00:25:31.559" style="s2">to stay home with you and and I know it</p>
<p begin="00:25:29.909" end="00:25:35.880" style="s2">was that&#39;s how I know it was when I was</p>
<p begin="00:25:31.559" end="00:25:38.309" style="s2">three years old and you know we&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:25:35.880" end="00:25:39.900" style="s2">Catholics right so you get on your knees</p>
<p begin="00:25:38.309" end="00:25:45.289" style="s2">by the side of the bed and you go like</p>
<p begin="00:25:39.900" end="00:25:50.039" style="s2">this and you&#39;d say words and I thought</p>
<p begin="00:25:45.289" end="00:25:52.020" style="s2">that is weird why would you use words to</p>
<p begin="00:25:50.039" end="00:25:52.970" style="s2">talk to God like his words are very</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.020" end="00:25:57.510" style="s2">coarse</p>
<p begin="00:25:52.970" end="00:26:02.070" style="s2">they seemed like such a crude instrument</p>
<p begin="00:25:57.510" end="00:26:04.770" style="s2">too you know anyways so and then then</p>
<p begin="00:26:02.070" end="00:26:08.100" style="s2">she said now no and so I said what she</p>
<p begin="00:26:04.770" end="00:26:10.380" style="s2">said and then she said and God I&#39;m sorry</p>
<p begin="00:26:08.100" end="00:26:15.299" style="s2">that I was mean to my sister and I went</p>
<p begin="00:26:10.380" end="00:26:19.669" style="s2">Wow why would you lie to God and I</p>
<p begin="00:26:15.299" end="00:26:23.190" style="s2">thought okay well I thought maybe I</p>
<p begin="00:26:19.669" end="00:26:26.340" style="s2">thought well you know my mom knows I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:26:23.190" end="00:26:28.380" style="s2">little and adults have this way of</p>
<p begin="00:26:26.340" end="00:26:30.480" style="s2">pretending with kids until they get</p>
<p begin="00:26:28.380" end="00:26:34.289" style="s2">older so I just thought well this is</p>
<p begin="00:26:30.480" end="00:26:37.309" style="s2">what what one day I would get older and</p>
<p begin="00:26:34.289" end="00:26:41.010" style="s2">just this kind of fake way of being</p>
<p begin="00:26:37.309" end="00:26:45.270" style="s2">would go away and I remember when I was</p>
<p begin="00:26:41.010" end="00:26:47.190" style="s2">about eight or ten or at some point in</p>
<p begin="00:26:45.270" end="00:26:48.720" style="s2">my life I realized that they didn&#39;t know</p>
<p begin="00:26:47.190" end="00:26:55.500" style="s2">even though they were pretending right</p>
<p begin="00:26:48.720" end="00:26:58.470" style="s2">so this is how I started my life but but</p>
<p begin="00:26:55.500" end="00:27:00.630" style="s2">what I used to do after she we would you</p>
<p begin="00:26:58.470" end="00:27:01.200" style="s2">know pretend our prayers I would lay</p>
<p begin="00:27:00.630" end="00:27:05.730" style="s2">down</p>
<p begin="00:27:01.200" end="00:27:08.970" style="s2">and I would have this practice that I</p>
<p begin="00:27:05.730" end="00:27:11.899" style="s2">would call swallowing the words right</p>
<p begin="00:27:08.970" end="00:27:14.789" style="s2">because I could see and I try to like</p>
<p begin="00:27:11.899" end="00:27:17.820" style="s2">talk to God but swallow the words</p>
<p begin="00:27:14.789" end="00:27:20.100" style="s2">because the world word seems like like</p>
<p begin="00:27:17.820" end="00:27:21.210" style="s2">always little fault they were always a</p>
<p begin="00:27:20.100" end="00:27:24.149" style="s2">little false</p>
<p begin="00:27:21.210" end="00:27:26.130" style="s2">they always rang a little false so I</p>
<p begin="00:27:24.149" end="00:27:29.519" style="s2">would swallow the words and I&#39;d get</p>
<p begin="00:27:26.130" end="00:27:31.110" style="s2">really familiar with how do words come</p>
<p begin="00:27:29.519" end="00:27:34.049" style="s2">in your head like where do they come</p>
<p begin="00:27:31.110" end="00:27:37.769" style="s2">from him you can find the energy of the</p>
<p begin="00:27:34.049" end="00:27:41.909" style="s2">proto world and the energy to articulate</p>
<p begin="00:27:37.769" end="00:27:44.929" style="s2">and stuff like that so so these are</p>
<p begin="00:27:41.909" end="00:27:50.130" style="s2">discoveries that I&#39;ve been making by</p>
<p begin="00:27:44.929" end="00:27:54.269" style="s2">paying attention for many many years now</p>
<p begin="00:27:50.130" end="00:27:56.789" style="s2">and so there&#39;s so there&#39;s a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:27:54.269" end="00:27:58.830" style="s2">neuroscience around this and and really</p>
<p begin="00:27:56.789" end="00:28:02.340" style="s2">this is why Google can make this and</p>
<p begin="00:27:58.830" end="00:28:05.929" style="s2">face masks with sensors that can read</p>
<p begin="00:28:02.340" end="00:28:09.029" style="s2">read your mind because it it</p>
<p begin="00:28:05.929" end="00:28:13.559" style="s2">transponders it maje backwards there&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:28:09.029" end="00:28:20.399" style="s2">very subtle sub-threshold motor neurons</p>
<p begin="00:28:13.559" end="00:28:25.320" style="s2">in your your speaking area and your</p>
<p begin="00:28:20.399" end="00:28:28.850" style="s2">tongue to do exactly what your brain is</p>
<p begin="00:28:25.320" end="00:28:33.360" style="s2">doing it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s translating these</p>
<p begin="00:28:28.850" end="00:28:38.149" style="s2">submarines or impulses into the expected</p>
<p begin="00:28:33.360" end="00:28:45.470" style="s2">perception of sound swallowing words</p>
<p begin="00:28:38.149" end="00:28:52.649" style="s2">it&#39;s it&#39;s so years later I learned that</p>
<p begin="00:28:45.470" end="00:28:55.250" style="s2">if you meditate and you want to slow</p>
<p begin="00:28:52.649" end="00:28:57.630" style="s2">down monkey mind thoughts in your head</p>
<p begin="00:28:55.250" end="00:29:00.330" style="s2">there&#39;s a way you know that you can</p>
<p begin="00:28:57.630" end="00:29:08.429" style="s2">there&#39;s a controlled breathing exercise</p>
<p begin="00:29:00.330" end="00:29:10.889" style="s2">and so basically this was what I was</p>
<p begin="00:29:08.429" end="00:29:14.129" style="s2">doing was very similar to these tantric</p>
<p begin="00:29:10.889" end="00:29:14.929" style="s2">practices so when the words start start</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.129" end="00:29:18.000" style="s2">to form</p>
<p begin="00:29:14.929" end="00:29:19.559" style="s2">you take a really deep breath and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:18.000" end="00:29:23.340" style="s2">pay attention to the really deep breath</p>
<p begin="00:29:19.559" end="00:29:25.080" style="s2">and then the the energy that the what</p>
<p begin="00:29:23.340" end="00:29:27.240" style="s2">was going to become a word goes away so</p>
<p begin="00:29:25.080" end="00:29:30.809" style="s2">I called them swallowing your words</p>
<p begin="00:29:27.240" end="00:29:33.510" style="s2">because it had to do with these and you</p>
<p begin="00:29:30.809" end="00:29:36.870" style="s2">could get hypertrophic breathing and in</p>
<p begin="00:29:33.510" end="00:29:38.580" style="s2">anyways it was just what I would play</p>
<p begin="00:29:36.870" end="00:29:40.650" style="s2">around with and I called it swallowing</p>
<p begin="00:29:38.580" end="00:29:42.390" style="s2">your words it wasn&#39;t sophisticated but</p>
<p begin="00:29:40.650" end="00:29:44.250" style="s2">there it&#39;s very similar to some</p>
<p begin="00:29:42.390" end="00:29:46.730" style="s2">sophisticated techniques you see in</p>
<p begin="00:29:44.250" end="00:29:46.730" style="s2">meditation</p>
<p begin="00:29:50.510" end="00:30:01.110" style="s2">so let&#39;s unmute ourselves and try to</p>
<p begin="00:29:53.280" end="00:30:19.049" style="s2">have some some conversation this was you</p>
<p begin="00:30:01.110" end="00:30:22.200" style="s2">know around inner talk a question for me</p>
<p begin="00:30:19.049" end="00:30:27.120" style="s2">he is where does you know like if</p>
<p begin="00:30:22.200" end="00:30:30.570" style="s2">Google&#39;s trying to figure out where you</p>
<p begin="00:30:27.120" end="00:30:32.760" style="s2">know what&#39;s it measuring is it measuring</p>
<p begin="00:30:30.570" end="00:30:36.840" style="s2">the thought is measuring the muscles</p>
<p begin="00:30:32.760" end="00:30:39.510" style="s2">first you know which comes first but not</p>
<p begin="00:30:36.840" end="00:30:43.230" style="s2">because that&#39;s so important but where&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:30:39.510" end="00:30:46.160" style="s2">this origination of the thought such</p>
<p begin="00:30:43.230" end="00:30:48.510" style="s2">that all this stuff can happen yes so</p>
<p begin="00:30:46.160" end="00:30:50.549" style="s2">I&#39;ll try to get your question but first</p>
<p begin="00:30:48.510" end="00:30:53.070" style="s2">I&#39;ll make a distinction we&#39;re only</p>
<p begin="00:30:50.549" end="00:30:57.929" style="s2">talking about inner speech right now</p>
<p begin="00:30:53.070" end="00:31:01.919" style="s2">right there&#39;s lots of more okay so what</p>
<p begin="00:30:57.929" end="00:31:07.440" style="s2">it&#39;s a I so if you put sensors on a</p>
<p begin="00:31:01.919" end="00:31:09.450" style="s2">person mouth and then you have the the</p>
<p begin="00:31:07.440" end="00:31:11.309" style="s2">computer or listening to the words it</p>
<p begin="00:31:09.450" end="00:31:14.040" style="s2">makes the AI is doing the same thing</p>
<p begin="00:31:11.309" end="00:31:18.440" style="s2">your brain does it&#39;s it&#39;s recognizing</p>
<p begin="00:31:14.040" end="00:31:23.330" style="s2">patterns associated with predictable</p>
<p begin="00:31:18.440" end="00:31:25.740" style="s2">sounds right so you just keep running AI</p>
<p begin="00:31:23.330" end="00:31:27.850" style="s2">over and over and over again until it</p>
<p begin="00:31:25.740" end="00:31:33.660" style="s2">realizes that these patterns may</p>
<p begin="00:31:27.850" end="00:31:37.510" style="s2">those sounds so then when you put yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:33.660" end="00:31:41.650" style="s2">right so then if I put this on in it and</p>
<p begin="00:31:37.510" end="00:31:44.280" style="s2">I&#39;m thinking words in my mind there&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:31:41.650" end="00:31:47.679" style="s2">subtle motor neuron patterns happening</p>
<p begin="00:31:44.280" end="00:31:50.440" style="s2">that the AI picks up and then it&#39;s and</p>
<p begin="00:31:47.679" end="00:31:54.910" style="s2">then it&#39;ll you know the the system will</p>
<p begin="00:31:50.440" end="00:31:57.940" style="s2">make those sounds for you right yeah</p>
<p begin="00:31:54.910" end="00:32:01.120" style="s2">what I&#39;m trying to get to invisible the</p>
<p begin="00:31:57.940" end="00:32:04.000" style="s2">where what comes first I mean what where</p>
<p begin="00:32:01.120" end="00:32:05.470" style="s2">does this originate from when you have a</p>
<p begin="00:32:04.000" end="00:32:08.350" style="s2">sudden thought and some people are</p>
<p begin="00:32:05.470" end="00:32:13.240" style="s2">talking about you know imagination</p>
<p begin="00:32:08.350" end="00:32:17.260" style="s2">original ideas the impulse for this to</p>
<p begin="00:32:13.240" end="00:32:21.159" style="s2">just appear or I mean it feels like it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:32:17.260" end="00:32:22.510" style="s2">really patterned history what I&#39;ve known</p>
<p begin="00:32:21.159" end="00:32:24.789" style="s2">before</p>
<p begin="00:32:22.510" end="00:32:27.700" style="s2">okay you know only maybe slight bit of</p>
<p begin="00:32:24.789" end="00:32:30.640" style="s2">something new but where where does that</p>
<p begin="00:32:27.700" end="00:32:33.370" style="s2">come from that isn&#39;t about just the</p>
<p begin="00:32:30.640" end="00:32:35.080" style="s2">history and I already recognize and my</p>
<p begin="00:32:33.370" end="00:32:38.470" style="s2">previous thoughts and my understanding</p>
<p begin="00:32:35.080" end="00:32:40.960" style="s2">of how my thoughts work yeah so some of</p>
<p begin="00:32:38.470" end="00:32:46.659" style="s2">it is habit right some of it is the</p>
<p begin="00:32:40.960" end="00:32:55.750" style="s2">energy comes up and so it&#39;ll come up</p>
<p begin="00:32:46.659" end="00:32:57.429" style="s2">into so yeah there&#39;s we have to make</p>
<p begin="00:32:55.750" end="00:33:01.299" style="s2">distinctions so there&#39;s many different</p>
<p begin="00:32:57.429" end="00:33:05.710" style="s2">places that can come so for example if</p>
<p begin="00:33:01.299" end="00:33:08.140" style="s2">there&#39;s an external trigger that is</p>
<p begin="00:33:05.710" end="00:33:10.750" style="s2">associated with some kind of emotions</p>
<p begin="00:33:08.140" end="00:33:17.440" style="s2">people said this right that you&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:33:10.750" end="00:33:19.630" style="s2">wrapped inside a story then you when you</p>
<p begin="00:33:17.440" end="00:33:23.230" style="s2">see somebody you might say oh my god</p>
<p begin="00:33:19.630" end="00:33:27.400" style="s2">that in your mind it might result in to</p>
<p begin="00:33:23.230" end="00:33:29.080" style="s2">mental talk where does it come from when</p>
<p begin="00:33:27.400" end="00:33:31.240" style="s2">you bump into a friend on the street</p>
<p begin="00:33:29.080" end="00:33:33.880" style="s2">where does all that come from</p>
<p begin="00:33:31.240" end="00:33:37.150" style="s2">oh nice days where does that come from</p>
<p begin="00:33:33.880" end="00:33:40.000" style="s2">right when we have a certain type of a</p>
<p begin="00:33:37.150" end="00:33:40.610" style="s2">certain type of culture we&#39;re nervous</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.000" end="00:33:45.049" style="s2">and</p>
<p begin="00:33:40.610" end="00:33:47.840" style="s2">G is discharged as speech this is our</p>
<p begin="00:33:45.049" end="00:33:55.010" style="s2">culture indigenous people they sit for</p>
<p begin="00:33:47.840" end="00:33:59.809" style="s2">hours and they&#39;ll say second cloud you</p>
<p begin="00:33:55.010" end="00:34:02.540" style="s2">know but for us social energy where our</p>
<p begin="00:33:59.809" end="00:34:05.030" style="s2">energy energy has to go somewhere it has</p>
<p begin="00:34:02.540" end="00:34:07.760" style="s2">to be discharged and for us is just</p>
<p begin="00:34:05.030" end="00:34:08.419" style="s2">charged as speech and when there&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:34:07.760" end="00:34:10.970" style="s2">one around</p>
<p begin="00:34:08.419" end="00:34:15.369" style="s2">we discharge it as will be speech in</p>
<p begin="00:34:10.970" end="00:34:20.510" style="s2">their own head this is what we do</p>
<p begin="00:34:15.369" end="00:34:21.889" style="s2">because we have we don&#39;t know what else</p>
<p begin="00:34:20.510" end="00:34:25.510" style="s2">to do with our energy we have a lot of</p>
<p begin="00:34:21.889" end="00:34:28.100" style="s2">nervous energy and this is where it goes</p>
<p begin="00:34:25.510" end="00:34:30.350" style="s2">so that&#39;s where the impulse one of the</p>
<p begin="00:34:28.100" end="00:34:34.460" style="s2">first impulses of inner speech comes</p>
<p begin="00:34:30.350" end="00:34:36.669" style="s2">comes to if we&#39;re preparing a</p>
<p begin="00:34:34.460" end="00:34:41.210" style="s2">presentation of going to an interview</p>
<p begin="00:34:36.669" end="00:34:43.010" style="s2">we&#39;re not able to be confident that when</p>
<p begin="00:34:41.210" end="00:34:46.010" style="s2">the interviewer asked me a question I</p>
<p begin="00:34:43.010" end="00:34:48.109" style="s2">just answer the anxiety creates inner</p>
<p begin="00:34:46.010" end="00:34:51.080" style="s2">speech and then we prepare or we plant</p>
<p begin="00:34:48.109" end="00:34:54.320" style="s2">this and we go through words so that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:34:51.080" end="00:34:58.640" style="s2">one level the energy discharges as in</p>
<p begin="00:34:54.320" end="00:35:01.310" style="s2">her speech if you if you have dementia</p>
<p begin="00:34:58.640" end="00:35:02.750" style="s2">you actually start talking you know you</p>
<p begin="00:35:01.310" end="00:35:04.609" style="s2">walk around and you actually start</p>
<p begin="00:35:02.750" end="00:35:07.490" style="s2">talking it doesn&#39;t stay sub-threshold</p>
<p begin="00:35:04.609" end="00:35:09.580" style="s2">you murmur and talk to yourself if you</p>
<p begin="00:35:07.490" end="00:35:14.990" style="s2">have certain types of Tourette syndrome</p>
<p begin="00:35:09.580" end="00:35:19.030" style="s2">it doesn&#39;t stay sub-threshold okay so</p>
<p begin="00:35:14.990" end="00:35:23.300" style="s2">that&#39;s one way it&#39;s energy discharging</p>
<p begin="00:35:19.030" end="00:35:25.190" style="s2">when that&#39;s that&#39;s who we are as a</p>
<p begin="00:35:23.300" end="00:35:28.609" style="s2">culture most Western cultures are like</p>
<p begin="00:35:25.190" end="00:35:31.600" style="s2">that it&#39;s why we&#39;re on zoom&#39; night you</p>
<p begin="00:35:28.609" end="00:35:33.830" style="s2">know 24/7 when we&#39;re home because we</p>
<p begin="00:35:31.600" end="00:35:37.640" style="s2">have all this energy and we just</p>
<p begin="00:35:33.830" end="00:35:40.550" style="s2">discharged it on speech this is how we</p>
<p begin="00:35:37.640" end="00:35:43.369" style="s2">are as humans and so when we&#39;re alone we</p>
<p begin="00:35:40.550" end="00:35:45.230" style="s2">discharge it as speech in our head in</p>
<p begin="00:35:43.369" end="00:35:46.840" style="s2">many cases it&#39;s if you start paying</p>
<p begin="00:35:45.230" end="00:35:49.430" style="s2">attention when you start to meditate</p>
<p begin="00:35:46.840" end="00:35:51.590" style="s2">your human condition drives you crazy</p>
<p begin="00:35:49.430" end="00:35:53.900" style="s2">cuz that&#39;s the same thing over</p>
<p begin="00:35:51.590" end="00:35:55.880" style="s2">and over and over again your mother your</p>
<p begin="00:35:53.900" end="00:35:57.260" style="s2">partner your mother your partner your</p>
<p begin="00:35:55.880" end="00:36:00.590" style="s2">mother your kids your partner your</p>
<p begin="00:35:57.260" end="00:36:03.140" style="s2">mother your kids right so it doesn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:36:00.590" end="00:36:05.540" style="s2">have it&#39;s just it just uses those</p>
<p begin="00:36:03.140" end="00:36:06.080" style="s2">patterns that it knows to discharge all</p>
<p begin="00:36:05.540" end="00:36:07.940" style="s2">the time</p>
<p begin="00:36:06.080" end="00:36:10.220" style="s2">doesn&#39;t go anywhere so that&#39;s that&#39;s one</p>
<p begin="00:36:07.940" end="00:36:13.840" style="s2">thing that&#39;s and we&#39;re talking about</p>
<p begin="00:36:10.220" end="00:36:16.700" style="s2">inner talk okay so that&#39;s one thing</p>
<p begin="00:36:13.840" end="00:36:19.220" style="s2">inter talk can be helpful if you&#39;re a</p>
<p begin="00:36:16.700" end="00:36:22.160" style="s2">speechwriter and instead of you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:19.220" end="00:36:27.190" style="s2">writing down and editing you could lay</p>
<p begin="00:36:22.160" end="00:36:29.330" style="s2">down and you could actually go over the</p>
<p begin="00:36:27.190" end="00:36:32.060" style="s2">inflection or something in it you know</p>
<p begin="00:36:29.330" end="00:36:37.100" style="s2">so you can use it simulating experience</p>
<p begin="00:36:32.060" end="00:36:40.850" style="s2">is helpful because you can run a lot</p>
<p begin="00:36:37.100" end="00:36:43.940" style="s2">more experiments without using up so</p>
<p begin="00:36:40.850" end="00:36:47.600" style="s2">much energy so Nikola Tesla for example</p>
<p begin="00:36:43.940" end="00:36:50.480" style="s2">said that he would test his instruments</p>
<p begin="00:36:47.600" end="00:36:53.720" style="s2">if he was he would test his inventions</p>
<p begin="00:36:50.480" end="00:36:57.320" style="s2">in his head before he actually built</p>
<p begin="00:36:53.720" end="00:37:00.110" style="s2">them right so the ability to simulate</p>
<p begin="00:36:57.320" end="00:37:05.930" style="s2">experience can be really helpful to ship</p>
<p begin="00:37:00.110" end="00:37:11.660" style="s2">his shorthand so that&#39;s one thing then</p>
<p begin="00:37:05.930" end="00:37:15.380" style="s2">there is we so for example beneath inner</p>
<p begin="00:37:11.660" end="00:37:17.320" style="s2">talk is symbolic representation so</p>
<p begin="00:37:15.380" end="00:37:20.800" style="s2">that&#39;s the meaning of the words and</p>
<p begin="00:37:17.320" end="00:37:24.620" style="s2">beneath that are mental models or</p>
<p begin="00:37:20.800" end="00:37:29.650" style="s2">stories so we&#39;re always trying to</p>
<p begin="00:37:24.620" end="00:37:32.780" style="s2">organize their experience in many cases</p>
<p begin="00:37:29.650" end="00:37:36.140" style="s2">people get beyond this but in general we</p>
<p begin="00:37:32.780" end="00:37:40.730" style="s2">organize our stories our experience in</p>
<p begin="00:37:36.140" end="00:37:44.540" style="s2">terms of stories and so even if you&#39;re</p>
<p begin="00:37:40.730" end="00:37:46.370" style="s2">not hearing your mental talk you have</p>
<p begin="00:37:44.540" end="00:37:49.460" style="s2">certain stories like you&#39;re the victim</p>
<p begin="00:37:46.370" end="00:37:52.160" style="s2">or you&#39;re you know the victim of</p>
<p begin="00:37:49.460" end="00:37:55.190" style="s2">patriarchy or you&#39;re the oppressor or</p>
<p begin="00:37:52.160" end="00:37:57.770" style="s2">you&#39;re privileged or you&#39;re oppressed or</p>
<p begin="00:37:55.190" end="00:38:02.120" style="s2">you&#39;re so-and-so who&#39;s on a career path</p>
<p begin="00:37:57.770" end="00:38:05.350" style="s2">or you know we constantly are organizing</p>
<p begin="00:38:02.120" end="00:38:07.460" style="s2">experience in these mental models of</p>
<p begin="00:38:05.350" end="00:38:09.710" style="s2">self other than world</p>
<p begin="00:38:07.460" end="00:38:13.090" style="s2">and where we&#39;re at in our history this</p>
<p begin="00:38:09.710" end="00:38:17.360" style="s2">is called autobiographical coherence</p>
<p begin="00:38:13.090" end="00:38:21.080" style="s2">people most people want autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:38:17.360" end="00:38:23.330" style="s2">coherence once you start to actually be</p>
<p begin="00:38:21.080" end="00:38:25.460" style="s2">honest with yourself you see it&#39;s just</p>
<p begin="00:38:23.330" end="00:38:27.440" style="s2">you&#39;re connecting the dots backwards to</p>
<p begin="00:38:25.460" end="00:38:30.200" style="s2">make sense of your world and in fact a</p>
<p begin="00:38:27.440" end="00:38:32.600" style="s2">person&#39;s life doesn&#39;t make any sense</p>
<p begin="00:38:30.200" end="00:38:35.480" style="s2">you&#39;re here for all kinds of reasons</p>
<p begin="00:38:32.600" end="00:38:37.430" style="s2">there&#39;s no no linear reason but in</p>
<p begin="00:38:35.480" end="00:38:38.840" style="s2">general what&#39;s very important to people</p>
<p begin="00:38:37.430" end="00:38:42.620" style="s2">from a psychic structure is</p>
<p begin="00:38:38.840" end="00:38:44.990" style="s2">autobiographical coherence so when</p>
<p begin="00:38:42.620" end="00:38:46.850" style="s2">you&#39;re when you&#39;re this is why it&#39;s hard</p>
<p begin="00:38:44.990" end="00:38:50.180" style="s2">for us to live in the time of Kovac</p>
<p begin="00:38:46.850" end="00:38:51.920" style="s2">because we want to know how does this</p>
<p begin="00:38:50.180" end="00:38:57.700" style="s2">fit in this nice little linear</p>
<p begin="00:38:51.920" end="00:38:59.830" style="s2">exfoliation right so when we are</p>
<p begin="00:38:57.700" end="00:39:02.660" style="s2">disrupted when our autobiographical</p>
<p begin="00:38:59.830" end="00:39:05.870" style="s2">coherence is disruptive we retro</p>
<p begin="00:39:02.660" end="00:39:06.950" style="s2">actively recreate the story and we often</p>
<p begin="00:39:05.870" end="00:39:09.700" style="s2">do that in our head</p>
<p begin="00:39:06.950" end="00:39:15.170" style="s2">so we&#39;ll say well catch yourself</p>
<p begin="00:39:09.700" end="00:39:18.620" style="s2">thinking that so-and-so would never</p>
<p begin="00:39:15.170" end="00:39:19.820" style="s2">betray me okay she&#39;s my best friend she</p>
<p begin="00:39:18.620" end="00:39:23.450" style="s2">would never betray you</p>
<p begin="00:39:19.820" end="00:39:26.660" style="s2">and then then something happens and then</p>
<p begin="00:39:23.450" end="00:39:30.320" style="s2">you say Shh she wouldn&#39;t have betrayed</p>
<p begin="00:39:26.660" end="00:39:32.540" style="s2">me if it if her life wasn&#39;t so sad now</p>
<p begin="00:39:30.320" end="00:39:34.310" style="s2">that you&#39;ve extended this story so it</p>
<p begin="00:39:32.540" end="00:39:37.550" style="s2">still makes sense of the story you have</p>
<p begin="00:39:34.310" end="00:39:41.450" style="s2">and sometimes that process you do it by</p>
<p begin="00:39:37.550" end="00:39:43.940" style="s2">talking to yourself as your own that</p>
<p begin="00:39:41.450" end="00:39:47.810" style="s2">best friend you said why did you do that</p>
<p begin="00:39:43.940" end="00:39:50.300" style="s2">what did she tell you settle on another</p>
<p begin="00:39:47.810" end="00:39:53.210" style="s2">version of the story and then you live</p>
<p begin="00:39:50.300" end="00:39:56.060" style="s2">in that story so that&#39;s another way we</p>
<p begin="00:39:53.210" end="00:40:01.460" style="s2">could we another time we use internal</p>
<p begin="00:39:56.060" end="00:40:03.710" style="s2">talk yeah how do you have agency in</p>
<p begin="00:40:01.460" end="00:40:07.280" style="s2">relationship to this mechanism is a</p>
<p begin="00:40:03.710" end="00:40:12.710" style="s2">really good question</p>
<p begin="00:40:07.280" end="00:40:17.170" style="s2">and one of the things about all of these</p>
<p begin="00:40:12.710" end="00:40:17.170" style="s2">about down word causation is</p>
<p begin="00:40:20.530" end="00:40:25.210" style="s2">you want to have choice you don&#39;t want</p>
<p begin="00:40:23.110" end="00:40:27.160" style="s2">it you don&#39;t want these scripts to be</p>
<p begin="00:40:25.210" end="00:40:30.550" style="s2">running every time the energy comes up</p>
<p begin="00:40:27.160" end="00:40:32.950" style="s2">an old script to be running because the</p>
<p begin="00:40:30.550" end="00:40:35.590" style="s2">world has changed right</p>
<p begin="00:40:32.950" end="00:40:40.090" style="s2">the problem with thought is that it it</p>
<p begin="00:40:35.590" end="00:40:43.120" style="s2">relies on downward causation it relies</p>
<p begin="00:40:40.090" end="00:40:47.140" style="s2">on something being burned in and then</p>
<p begin="00:40:43.120" end="00:40:49.390" style="s2">replayed so it&#39;s always behind the</p>
<p begin="00:40:47.140" end="00:40:52.360" style="s2">impermanence of the world it&#39;s always in</p>
<p begin="00:40:49.390" end="00:40:54.610" style="s2">the past right</p>
<p begin="00:40:52.360" end="00:40:56.470" style="s2">only the upward causation is an</p>
<p begin="00:40:54.610" end="00:41:05.110" style="s2">authentic response to the immediate</p>
<p begin="00:40:56.470" end="00:41:10.030" style="s2">present it&#39;s always in the past now we</p>
<p begin="00:41:05.110" end="00:41:12.640" style="s2">don&#39;t you know it&#39;s also fun to preserve</p>
<p begin="00:41:10.030" end="00:41:16.480" style="s2">memories and to create stories and to</p>
<p begin="00:41:12.640" end="00:41:20.020" style="s2">have shared use these imaginatively</p>
<p begin="00:41:16.480" end="00:41:21.730" style="s2">in social space you know if you if you</p>
<p begin="00:41:20.020" end="00:41:24.100" style="s2">lived with someone for a long time like</p>
<p begin="00:41:21.730" end="00:41:27.460" style="s2">me I&#39;ve been with my partner for like 32</p>
<p begin="00:41:24.100" end="00:41:29.650" style="s2">years people come over this Oh tell us</p>
<p begin="00:41:27.460" end="00:41:32.380" style="s2">how do you first met and there&#39;s always</p>
<p begin="00:41:29.650" end="00:41:34.870" style="s2">like there&#39;s like a common thread but</p>
<p begin="00:41:32.380" end="00:41:37.240" style="s2">always gets embellished with it&#39;s no</p>
<p begin="00:41:34.870" end="00:41:39.490" style="s2">longer really when we even laugh about</p>
<p begin="00:41:37.240" end="00:41:41.590" style="s2">it afterwards it&#39;s like yeah that&#39;s not</p>
<p begin="00:41:39.490" end="00:41:44.530" style="s2">really true anymore to the facts all</p>
<p begin="00:41:41.590" end="00:41:47.830" style="s2">these like things about your other life</p>
<p begin="00:41:44.530" end="00:41:49.900" style="s2">in what you grown to know about each</p>
<p begin="00:41:47.830" end="00:41:51.430" style="s2">other start getting embellished into the</p>
<p begin="00:41:49.900" end="00:41:54.190" style="s2">story of how we first met</p>
<p begin="00:41:51.430" end="00:41:55.680" style="s2">and now we can&#39;t even remember it</p>
<p begin="00:41:54.190" end="00:42:00.610" style="s2">anymore</p>
<p begin="00:41:55.680" end="00:42:02.830" style="s2">and and so this is downward causation</p>
<p begin="00:42:00.610" end="00:42:05.020" style="s2">but this is a fun thing it&#39;s it&#39;s not a</p>
<p begin="00:42:02.830" end="00:42:07.060" style="s2">bad thing but you have agency and</p>
<p begin="00:42:05.020" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2">imaginative and it&#39;s a work kind of a</p>
<p begin="00:42:07.060" end="00:42:10.530" style="s2">work of art in a moment</p>
<p begin="00:42:19.410" end="00:42:24.190" style="s2">so one of the things you might be</p>
<p begin="00:42:22.390" end="00:42:28.960" style="s2">working with one of the things to work</p>
<p begin="00:42:24.190" end="00:42:31.450" style="s2">toward and maybe Kim this is helpful to</p>
<p begin="00:42:28.960" end="00:42:33.430" style="s2">you I know I know you&#39;re you&#39;re you got</p>
<p begin="00:42:31.450" end="00:42:35.740" style="s2">some your stuff ins that you want to</p>
<p begin="00:42:33.430" end="00:42:38.170" style="s2">figure out is that as you&#39;re listening</p>
<p begin="00:42:35.740" end="00:42:38.799" style="s2">here and you&#39;re trying to figure this</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.170" end="00:42:41.470" style="s2">out</p>
<p begin="00:42:38.799" end="00:42:46.299" style="s2">which is a good thing you want to go</p>
<p begin="00:42:41.470" end="00:42:50.859" style="s2">further we will we&#39;ll go further it&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:42:46.299" end="00:42:56.260" style="s2">not necessary to turn the energy of</p>
<p begin="00:42:50.859" end="00:42:59.220" style="s2">curiosity into inner thought the</p>
<p begin="00:42:56.260" end="00:43:02.500" style="s2">thinking process the curiosity itself</p>
<p begin="00:42:59.220" end="00:43:04.990" style="s2">can process itself without turning that</p>
<p begin="00:43:02.500" end="00:43:08.579" style="s2">into inner thought that&#39;s the first step</p>
<p begin="00:43:04.990" end="00:43:13.289" style="s2">because inner talk is to coerce an</p>
<p begin="00:43:08.579" end="00:43:16.799" style="s2">instrument to work out these very subtle</p>
<p begin="00:43:13.289" end="00:43:22.390" style="s2">questions of experience and you get so</p>
<p begin="00:43:16.799" end="00:43:26.650" style="s2">you actually live where when you&#39;re like</p>
<p begin="00:43:22.390" end="00:43:29.170" style="s2">wow that&#39;s really interesting you just</p>
<p begin="00:43:26.650" end="00:43:30.450" style="s2">still hunt the question I know you took</p>
<p begin="00:43:29.170" end="00:43:35.619" style="s2">that course</p>
<p begin="00:43:30.450" end="00:43:38.609" style="s2">you don&#39;t let the inner top try to work</p>
<p begin="00:43:35.619" end="00:43:40.869" style="s2">on it because it&#39;s way too coarse an</p>
<p begin="00:43:38.609" end="00:43:43.150" style="s2">instrument it&#39;s not only to course an</p>
<p begin="00:43:40.869" end="00:43:46.829" style="s2">instrument it&#39;s like when I was three</p>
<p begin="00:43:43.150" end="00:43:46.829" style="s2">years old like why do you use words but</p>
<p begin="00:43:47.400" end="00:43:53.140" style="s2">it only has phrases for what&#39;s happened</p>
<p begin="00:43:51.309" end="00:43:56.319" style="s2">to you in the past because it&#39;s a</p>
<p begin="00:43:53.140" end="00:43:58.690" style="s2">downward causation so this is why you</p>
<p begin="00:43:56.319" end="00:44:01.000" style="s2">don&#39;t want to use the words in the</p>
<p begin="00:43:58.690" end="00:44:03.910" style="s2">phrase and the thinking process for</p>
<p begin="00:44:01.000" end="00:44:06.970" style="s2">discovering something new you want to</p>
<p begin="00:44:03.910" end="00:44:08.410" style="s2">feel the energy that curiosity and I&#39;m</p>
<p begin="00:44:06.970" end="00:44:12.549" style="s2">gonna use this term for Kim because she</p>
<p begin="00:44:08.410" end="00:44:15.940" style="s2">took the course to still hunt it you can</p>
<p begin="00:44:12.549" end="00:44:18.220" style="s2">feel it processing there and try and</p>
<p begin="00:44:15.940" end="00:44:20.319" style="s2">then you know you might take a look and</p>
<p begin="00:44:18.220" end="00:44:22.089" style="s2">use some words and then you&#39;ll feel like</p>
<p begin="00:44:20.319" end="00:44:23.579" style="s2">you said it just goes around and around</p>
<p begin="00:44:22.089" end="00:44:26.459" style="s2">and around I can&#39;t get</p>
<p begin="00:44:23.579" end="00:44:29.249" style="s2">and then you stop because you haven&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:44:26.459" end="00:44:32.160" style="s2">worked it out yeah now this is also very</p>
<p begin="00:44:29.249" end="00:44:36.150" style="s2">scientifically valid so I discovered</p>
<p begin="00:44:32.160" end="00:44:36.959" style="s2">this in college when I was taking</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.150" end="00:44:40.799" style="s2">physics</p>
<p begin="00:44:36.959" end="00:44:42.450" style="s2">I had skipped some math courses that I</p>
<p begin="00:44:40.799" end="00:44:45.239" style="s2">really should have taken had Advanced</p>
<p begin="00:44:42.450" end="00:44:47.400" style="s2">Placement but I really should have taken</p>
<p begin="00:44:45.239" end="00:44:49.619" style="s2">them because when it came to do physics</p>
<p begin="00:44:47.400" end="00:44:51.569" style="s2">I didn&#39;t have enough really</p>
<p begin="00:44:49.619" end="00:44:54.329" style="s2">understanding of the math like I</p>
<p begin="00:44:51.569" end="00:44:57.599" style="s2">couldn&#39;t answer the questions and get</p>
<p begin="00:44:54.329" end="00:44:59.969" style="s2">Advanced Placement but it was I was</p>
<p begin="00:44:57.599" end="00:45:01.369" style="s2">handicapped because I didn&#39;t really have</p>
<p begin="00:44:59.969" end="00:45:05.009" style="s2">a good enough understanding of the math</p>
<p begin="00:45:01.369" end="00:45:07.259" style="s2">and I would I would be in college just</p>
<p begin="00:45:05.009" end="00:45:09.630" style="s2">as before computers you know a long time</p>
<p begin="00:45:07.259" end="00:45:12.269" style="s2">ago and I&#39;d be like working on this</p>
<p begin="00:45:09.630" end="00:45:15.779" style="s2">problem and this book and I would fall</p>
<p begin="00:45:12.269" end="00:45:20.819" style="s2">asleep in the in the we call them</p>
<p begin="00:45:15.779" end="00:45:22.079" style="s2">cubicles these little stations and you</p>
<p begin="00:45:20.819" end="00:45:28.049" style="s2">know it&#39;d be like 2 o&#39;clock and when I</p>
<p begin="00:45:22.079" end="00:45:31.559" style="s2">wake up and then I&#39;d be like oh I know</p>
<p begin="00:45:28.049" end="00:45:35.069" style="s2">the answer to that in my sleep</p>
<p begin="00:45:31.559" end="00:45:36.839" style="s2">the problem was still working so I</p>
<p begin="00:45:35.069" end="00:45:39.359" style="s2">started thinking this was really</p>
<p begin="00:45:36.839" end="00:45:41.609" style="s2">interesting so then I started going like</p>
<p begin="00:45:39.359" end="00:45:43.680" style="s2">well how long do I work what about any</p>
<p begin="00:45:41.609" end="00:45:47.190" style="s2">work for 45 days are the problem we go</p>
<p begin="00:45:43.680" end="00:45:51.150" style="s2">back to my room take a nap I started</p>
<p begin="00:45:47.190" end="00:45:55.349" style="s2">calling these my elves okay and took me</p>
<p begin="00:45:51.150" end="00:45:57.749" style="s2">years or two to find neuroscience or for</p>
<p begin="00:45:55.349" end="00:46:00.809" style="s2">neuroscience to discover exactly what&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:45:57.749" end="00:46:04.799" style="s2">happening here and so you start to then</p>
<p begin="00:46:00.809" end="00:46:07.650" style="s2">go from inner talk to the felt sense you</p>
<p begin="00:46:04.799" end="00:46:10.469" style="s2">can really feel the sense that you where</p>
<p begin="00:46:07.650" end="00:46:13.140" style="s2">and how your body is working on a</p>
<p begin="00:46:10.469" end="00:46:20.069" style="s2">problem and you don&#39;t have to pay</p>
<p begin="00:46:13.140" end="00:46:23.069" style="s2">attention you get it&#39;s like it&#39;s gifted</p>
<p begin="00:46:20.069" end="00:46:26.910" style="s2">for free and this is actually the way</p>
<p begin="00:46:23.069" end="00:46:30.359" style="s2">the child grows the child doesn&#39;t work</p>
<p begin="00:46:26.910" end="00:46:34.559" style="s2">out how to speak its gifted this for</p>
<p begin="00:46:30.359" end="00:46:36.720" style="s2">free the child doesn&#39;t you know and this</p>
<p begin="00:46:34.559" end="00:46:39.780" style="s2">is how upward causation work</p>
<p begin="00:46:36.720" end="00:46:44.460" style="s2">it comes from the inheritance of being a</p>
<p begin="00:46:39.780" end="00:46:49.310" style="s2">human and you gifted it for free this is</p>
<p begin="00:46:44.460" end="00:47:03.410" style="s2">the abundance of the awakened mind and</p>
<p begin="00:46:49.310" end="00:47:17.490" style="s2">the paucity of the monkey mind yeah so</p>
<p begin="00:47:03.410" end="00:47:20.820" style="s2">um boy we went through this one fast but</p>
<p begin="00:47:17.490" end="00:47:23.490" style="s2">I hope you can see how this is a this</p>
<p begin="00:47:20.820" end="00:47:31.710" style="s2">you know and I hope you can play with it</p>
<p begin="00:47:23.490" end="00:47:35.160" style="s2">is there any any other questions but and</p>
<p begin="00:47:31.710" end="00:47:37.200" style="s2">we&#39;re just really here today if he</p>
<p begin="00:47:35.160" end="00:47:41.700" style="s2">between today next week if you can</p>
<p begin="00:47:37.200" end="00:47:43.710" style="s2">really just pay attention to words in</p>
<p begin="00:47:41.700" end="00:47:48.960" style="s2">your head sentences in your head and</p>
<p begin="00:47:43.710" end="00:47:50.550" style="s2">maybe if you really pay attention to</p>
<p begin="00:47:48.960" end="00:47:56.910" style="s2">them again we&#39;re creating a</p>
<p begin="00:47:50.550" end="00:48:01.680" style="s2">metacognitive ability to watch the words</p>
<p begin="00:47:56.910" end="00:48:04.410" style="s2">in your head then you can start to pay</p>
<p begin="00:48:01.680" end="00:48:07.410" style="s2">attention to just before their words in</p>
<p begin="00:48:04.410" end="00:48:10.380" style="s2">your head you might get some tension</p>
<p begin="00:48:07.410" end="00:48:13.260" style="s2">here sometimes sometimes you might feel</p>
<p begin="00:48:10.380" end="00:48:15.750" style="s2">it here you&#39;ll start to feel what it</p>
<p begin="00:48:13.260" end="00:48:20.390" style="s2">feels like in your body just before the</p>
<p begin="00:48:15.750" end="00:48:23.100" style="s2">energy turns into words in your head</p>
<p begin="00:48:20.390" end="00:48:25.380" style="s2">when you do that you can work at them</p>
<p begin="00:48:23.100" end="00:48:28.190" style="s2">they&#39;re at that Junction where people</p>
<p begin="00:48:25.380" end="00:48:31.170" style="s2">have done this experiment here and</p>
<p begin="00:48:28.190" end="00:48:35.010" style="s2">sometimes people call oh I get them at</p>
<p begin="00:48:31.170" end="00:48:37.200" style="s2">the proto thought level now okay then</p>
<p begin="00:48:35.010" end="00:48:40.620" style="s2">you&#39;re working with just before the</p>
<p begin="00:48:37.200" end="00:48:44.190" style="s2">energy turns into two words it&#39;s proto</p>
<p begin="00:48:40.620" end="00:48:48.240" style="s2">words and then that&#39;s a deeper</p>
<p begin="00:48:44.190" end="00:48:50.460" style="s2">processing and then you can start to be</p>
<p begin="00:48:48.240" end="00:48:53.280" style="s2">actually physically</p>
<p begin="00:48:50.460" end="00:48:56.880" style="s2">we&#39;re of the sensation of this subtle</p>
<p begin="00:48:53.280" end="00:48:59.869" style="s2">processing in which if you try to pay</p>
<p begin="00:48:56.880" end="00:49:02.460" style="s2">attention you&#39;re just in the way and</p>
<p begin="00:48:59.869" end="00:49:04.349" style="s2">then what happens is you start to do</p>
<p begin="00:49:02.460" end="00:49:07.260" style="s2">improv insight practice the subtle</p>
<p begin="00:49:04.349" end="00:49:09.300" style="s2">processing you don&#39;t you go for a walk</p>
<p begin="00:49:07.260" end="00:49:11.849" style="s2">you do things they go down to the barn</p>
<p begin="00:49:09.300" end="00:49:13.349" style="s2">and I clean up poop and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:49:11.849" end="00:49:18.030" style="s2">sudden when it&#39;s ready it&#39;s like boom</p>
<p begin="00:49:13.349" end="00:49:19.680" style="s2">Wow that&#39;s what Whitehead was saying oh</p>
<p begin="00:49:18.030" end="00:49:23.490" style="s2">my god Wow</p>
<p begin="00:49:19.680" end="00:49:26.040" style="s2">that&#39;s what Whitehead was saying and you</p>
<p begin="00:49:23.490" end="00:49:28.170" style="s2">start to live from muck up to the</p>
<p begin="00:49:26.040" end="00:49:31.280" style="s2">transition from monkey mind to insight</p>

<p begin="00:49:33.869" end="00:49:42.180" style="s2">collective insight practice is there a</p>
<p begin="00:49:40.109" end="00:49:46.560" style="s2">causal link between upward causation and</p>
<p begin="00:49:42.180" end="00:49:52.200" style="s2">Boulware yes Dow is not doing is the</p>
<p begin="00:49:46.560" end="00:49:55.890" style="s2">sense of the point at which the habits</p>
<p begin="00:49:52.200" end="00:49:59.330" style="s2">are not habitual but they&#39;re generative</p>
<p begin="00:49:55.890" end="00:50:01.830" style="s2">you feel like you&#39;re doing nothing</p>
<p begin="00:49:59.330" end="00:50:06.200" style="s2">because you&#39;re receiving you&#39;re</p>

<p begin="00:50:07.190" end="00:50:11.520" style="s2">now you&#39;re not gonna have an insight</p>
<p begin="00:50:09.660" end="00:50:13.410" style="s2">you&#39;re not going to have an insight Wow</p>
<p begin="00:50:11.520" end="00:50:15.240" style="s2">that&#39;s what Whitehead was saying if you</p>
<p begin="00:50:13.410" end="00:50:18.690" style="s2">didn&#39;t do your homework and read</p>
<p begin="00:50:15.240" end="00:50:25.410" style="s2">Whitehead and and and give yourself a</p>
<p begin="00:50:18.690" end="00:50:28.560" style="s2">lot of tools to process with but once</p>
<p begin="00:50:25.410" end="00:50:31.770" style="s2">you&#39;ve done that you can really you know</p>
<p begin="00:50:28.560" end="00:50:34.320" style="s2">you can like I&#39;m doing now I can think</p>
<p begin="00:50:31.770" end="00:50:39.690" style="s2">and think I can feel it processing here</p>
<p begin="00:50:34.320" end="00:50:44.040" style="s2">and you are free to you need to relax</p>
<p begin="00:50:39.690" end="00:50:47.490" style="s2">and you&#39;re free to go on walks or enjoy</p>
<p begin="00:50:44.040" end="00:50:54.210" style="s2">nature or do chores and then all of a</p>
<p begin="00:50:47.490" end="00:50:57.750" style="s2">sudden you&#39;ll see something or your</p>
<p begin="00:50:54.210" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">attention will go somewhere and then the</p>
<p begin="00:50:57.750" end="00:51:00.800" style="s2">whole insight comes</p>
<p begin="00:51:03.099" end="00:51:11.680" style="s2">yes so Ron I don&#39;t know if you know me</p>
<p begin="00:51:06.740" end="00:51:14.510" style="s2">I&#39;m a big critic of hierarchical</p>

<p begin="00:51:32.900" end="00:51:40.310" style="s2">is more complex and you know more</p>

<p begin="00:51:40.310" end="00:51:55.670" style="s2">the note went in the modern mind so and</p>
<p begin="00:51:50.750" end="00:51:58.520" style="s2">part of this is a bias in our culture</p>
<p begin="00:51:55.670" end="00:52:01.910" style="s2">toward what is what is later is always</p>
<p begin="00:51:58.520" end="00:52:04.430" style="s2">advanced or progressive it&#39;s very hard</p>

<p begin="00:52:06.550" end="00:52:17.030" style="s2">regressive I&#39;ve been Illiad for example</p>

<p begin="00:52:39.550" end="00:52:43.609" style="s2">after a certain point and he was writing</p>
<p begin="00:52:41.990" end="00:52:46.310" style="s2">in the 70s I think and he said that</p>
<p begin="00:52:43.609" end="00:52:51.280" style="s2">point is now all the advances would harm</p>
<p begin="00:52:46.310" end="00:52:54.440" style="s2">you maybe all iatrogenic advances and</p>
<p begin="00:52:51.280" end="00:52:57.589" style="s2">this has become very obvious in today&#39;s</p>

<p begin="00:52:57.589" end="00:53:04.520" style="s2">have have Peaks and then you have to do</p>
<p begin="00:53:01.700" end="00:53:05.510" style="s2">something else right and but because we</p>
<p begin="00:53:04.520" end="00:53:07.760" style="s2">keep pushing</p>

<p begin="00:54:19.230" end="00:54:25.540" style="s2">it&#39;s not a very beneficial mind in many</p>
<p begin="00:54:24.040" end="00:54:31.119" style="s2">case it&#39;s very reactive and responsive</p>
<p begin="00:54:25.540" end="00:54:34.060" style="s2">and deconstructive so some so that</p>
<p begin="00:54:31.119" end="00:54:38.319" style="s2">that&#39;s part of the sense in which wha</p>
<p begin="00:54:34.060" end="00:54:42.040" style="s2">and why I critique those models yeah</p>
<p begin="00:54:38.319" end="00:54:43.630" style="s2">that was a good noticing there and of</p>

<p begin="00:54:43.630" end="00:54:51.990" style="s2">psychologists so I have to I&#39;m the thorn</p>
<p begin="00:54:48.819" end="00:54:51.990" style="s2">in their sides I</p>
<p begin="00:55:01.770" end="00:55:09.910" style="s2">benita I&#39;m reflecting on how this shows</p>
<p begin="00:55:05.049" end="00:55:11.829" style="s2">up in my everyday and I&#39;ve been doing</p>
<p begin="00:55:09.910" end="00:55:14.410" style="s2">this liminal space practice at night</p>
<p begin="00:55:11.829" end="00:55:17.470" style="s2">where I get rid of all my devices from</p>
<p begin="00:55:14.410" end="00:55:19.150" style="s2">my room and I go to sleep and then I</p>
<p begin="00:55:17.470" end="00:55:22.990" style="s2">have all this insight in the morning</p>
<p begin="00:55:19.150" end="00:55:25.059" style="s2">when I&#39;m waking up and now I&#39;m like how</p>
<p begin="00:55:22.990" end="00:55:29.140" style="s2">oh there&#39;s all these ways in which I&#39;ve</p>
<p begin="00:55:25.059" end="00:55:31.960" style="s2">been like trying to like this fervent</p>
<p begin="00:55:29.140" end="00:55:33.819" style="s2">energy trying to pile on experience</p>
<p begin="00:55:31.960" end="00:55:35.710" style="s2">during the day like how many of these</p>
<p begin="00:55:33.819" end="00:55:39.190" style="s2">stoah sessions can I do right how many</p>
<p begin="00:55:35.710" end="00:55:41.740" style="s2">conversations and so I can like keep you</p>
<p begin="00:55:39.190" end="00:55:45.339" style="s2">know and oh like how can I actually do</p>
<p begin="00:55:41.740" end="00:55:48.279" style="s2">this allow space to just let my mind do</p>
<p begin="00:55:45.339" end="00:55:50.559" style="s2">what it&#39;s designed to do over the course</p>
<p begin="00:55:48.279" end="00:55:53.770" style="s2">of the day as well and have that little</p>
<p begin="00:55:50.559" end="00:55:56.559" style="s2">space practice then yeah you know</p>
<p begin="00:55:53.770" end="00:55:59.799" style="s2">sometimes there&#39;s rhythms to this and as</p>
<p begin="00:55:56.559" end="00:56:05.619" style="s2">a Taoist we say and I think it&#39;s really</p>
<p begin="00:55:59.799" end="00:56:07.569" style="s2">true Taoism is not sometimes people</p>
<p begin="00:56:05.619" end="00:56:09.940" style="s2">think of Taoism this balance in the</p>
<p begin="00:56:07.569" end="00:56:16.329" style="s2">sense that you know every day I need</p>
<p begin="00:56:09.940" end="00:56:18.760" style="s2">space and rest but it&#39;s more like the</p>
<p begin="00:56:16.329" end="00:56:20.950" style="s2">you expand your horizon and you see</p>
<p begin="00:56:18.760" end="00:56:23.349" style="s2">balance is achieved because sometimes</p>
<p begin="00:56:20.950" end="00:56:25.779" style="s2">for like three months you&#39;re crazy crazy</p>
<p begin="00:56:23.349" end="00:56:28.270" style="s2">doing one thing and then you have three</p>
<p begin="00:56:25.779" end="00:56:30.339" style="s2">months of something else right so the</p>
<p begin="00:56:28.270" end="00:56:33.880" style="s2">rhythm of this that they&#39;re not always</p>
<p begin="00:56:30.339" end="00:56:36.400" style="s2">diurnal or you know and you start to</p>
<p begin="00:56:33.880" end="00:56:40.450" style="s2">this is something I had to do when I</p>
<p begin="00:56:36.400" end="00:56:42.819" style="s2">first left my job in my career in 2012</p>
<p begin="00:56:40.450" end="00:56:47.140" style="s2">because I&#39;m we had a small office in a</p>
<p begin="00:56:42.819" end="00:56:49.210" style="s2">very big business and you know the work</p>
<p begin="00:56:47.140" end="00:56:53.559" style="s2">would just come and come and I really</p>
<p begin="00:56:49.210" end="00:56:54.940" style="s2">was very very much enjoyed like just</p>
<p begin="00:56:53.559" end="00:56:57.369" style="s2">when I thought I couldn&#39;t take anymore</p>
<p begin="00:56:54.940" end="00:56:59.319" style="s2">and someone come in a new contract and</p>
<p begin="00:56:57.369" end="00:57:01.059" style="s2">and you know get on the phone and get</p>
<p begin="00:56:59.319" end="00:57:03.730" style="s2">the trucks and you know it was really</p>
<p begin="00:57:01.059" end="00:57:05.920" style="s2">logistical planning and stuff it was fun</p>
<p begin="00:57:03.730" end="00:57:08.980" style="s2">you know we built beautiful gardens and</p>
<p begin="00:57:05.920" end="00:57:14.940" style="s2">stuff but then all of a sudden I&#39;m home</p>
<p begin="00:57:08.980" end="00:57:20.569" style="s2">and I don&#39;t have anything coming at me</p>
<p begin="00:57:14.940" end="00:57:23.579" style="s2">and the the structure the organism was</p>
<p begin="00:57:20.569" end="00:57:27.589" style="s2">completely like lost</p>
<p begin="00:57:23.579" end="00:57:32.369" style="s2">really I would I would binge watch Mad</p>
<p begin="00:57:27.589" end="00:57:36.240" style="s2">Mad Men yeah Mad Men at night Oh like</p>
<p begin="00:57:32.369" end="00:57:38.190" style="s2">for hours because I needed I needed then</p>
<p begin="00:57:36.240" end="00:57:41.309" style="s2">I was like an addict to a certain type</p>
<p begin="00:57:38.190" end="00:57:46.049" style="s2">of pacing and I knew that&#39;s why I was</p>
<p begin="00:57:41.309" end="00:57:51.299" style="s2">binge watching it right so and some of</p>
<p begin="00:57:46.049" end="00:57:56.099" style="s2">you know rear back she was she said to</p>
<p begin="00:57:51.299" end="00:57:59.160" style="s2">me you know a word of wisdom at the</p>
<p begin="00:57:56.099" end="00:58:01.710" style="s2">right timing she said it you&#39;ve spent</p>
<p begin="00:57:59.160" end="00:58:09.829" style="s2">your whole career cramming more into</p>
<p begin="00:58:01.710" end="00:58:14.369" style="s2">time why don&#39;t you why don&#39;t you try to</p>
<p begin="00:58:09.829" end="00:58:17.039" style="s2">follow the rhythm of time know why don&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:14.369" end="00:58:19.349" style="s2">you let time lead and figure out what</p>
<p begin="00:58:17.039" end="00:58:20.609" style="s2">fits it or something like that you know</p>
<p begin="00:58:19.349" end="00:58:22.319" style="s2">it was one of those things she said</p>
<p begin="00:58:20.609" end="00:58:24.359" style="s2">beautifully at the time and it didn&#39;t</p>
<p begin="00:58:22.319" end="00:58:27.180" style="s2">change and then I noticed that I have</p>
<p begin="00:58:24.359" end="00:58:29.069" style="s2">rhythms like that and you can trust them</p>
<p begin="00:58:27.180" end="00:58:31.200" style="s2">because sometimes you&#39;d be like I&#39;m like</p>
<p begin="00:58:29.069" end="00:58:33.299" style="s2">a crazy person in the spring I&#39;m like a</p>
<p begin="00:58:31.200" end="00:58:36.779" style="s2">crazy person but the gardens and stuff</p>
<p begin="00:58:33.299" end="00:58:38.520" style="s2">but I also have been doing this long</p>
<p begin="00:58:36.779" end="00:58:41.069" style="s2">enough to know that I&#39;ll be a lazy</p>
<p begin="00:58:38.520" end="00:58:44.010" style="s2">person I get in August and then you</p>
<p begin="00:58:41.069" end="00:58:47.760" style="s2">start to then let the time shape you</p>
<p begin="00:58:44.010" end="00:58:50.430" style="s2">rather you kind of instrumentalizing</p>
<p begin="00:58:47.760" end="00:58:52.950" style="s2">time all the time so I wouldn&#39;t worry</p>
<p begin="00:58:50.430" end="00:58:56.130" style="s2">about it</p>
<p begin="00:58:52.950" end="00:58:58.770" style="s2">and then neither worry about a time when</p>
<p begin="00:58:56.130" end="00:59:01.410" style="s2">you spend two weeks and you&#39;re lazy like</p>
<p begin="00:58:58.770" end="00:59:03.630" style="s2">and you&#39;d be like who is this person my</p>
<p begin="00:59:01.410" end="00:59:09.270" style="s2">god you know and that&#39;s okay too</p>
<p begin="00:59:03.630" end="00:59:12.480" style="s2">and then you start to understand that&#39;s</p>
<p begin="00:59:09.270" end="00:59:15.450" style="s2">a really cool way of understanding this</p>
<p begin="00:59:12.480" end="00:59:20.010" style="s2">aspect of experience so you turn time</p>
<p begin="00:59:15.450" end="00:59:22.220" style="s2">from a cognitive organizational</p>
<p begin="00:59:20.010" end="00:59:25.770" style="s2">principle we&#39;ll talk about that too</p>
<p begin="00:59:22.220" end="00:59:27.960" style="s2">you&#39;re experiencing time for the first</p>
<p begin="00:59:25.770" end="00:59:28.800" style="s2">time and it&#39;ll be different for everyone</p>
<p begin="00:59:27.960" end="00:59:32.150" style="s2">in different</p>
<p begin="00:59:28.800" end="00:59:35.700" style="s2">for you at different times in your life</p>
<p begin="00:59:32.150" end="00:59:40.860" style="s2">yeah so I don&#39;t know if that was helpful</p>

<p begin="01:00:11.460" end="01:00:20.270" style="s2">exercise and talk I always think I talk</p>
<p begin="01:00:15.540" end="01:00:25.710" style="s2">a little too much but you know hopefully</p>
<p begin="01:00:20.270" end="01:00:28.710" style="s2">you can practice really exploring what</p>
<p begin="01:00:25.710" end="01:00:32.400" style="s2">inner talk is and try to find the root</p>
<p begin="01:00:28.710" end="01:00:35.940" style="s2">root out of it yeah so breakout groups</p>
<p begin="01:00:32.400" end="01:00:37.920" style="s2">would be nice maybe we could do that</p>
<p begin="01:00:35.940" end="01:00:42.230" style="s2">next time Peter so that there&#39;s more</p>
<p begin="01:00:37.920" end="01:00:45.210" style="s2">conversation and more meaning-making</p>
<p begin="01:00:42.230" end="01:00:48.090" style="s2">because we will be getting into even it</p>
<p begin="01:00:45.210" end="01:00:49.830" style="s2">gets more and more subtle as we explore</p>
<p begin="01:00:48.090" end="01:00:53.090" style="s2">the nature of thought and then well if</p>
<p begin="01:00:49.830" end="01:00:56.360" style="s2">I&#39;m still around we&#39;ll explore the</p>
<p begin="01:00:53.090" end="01:01:00.570" style="s2">nature of experience which is even more</p>
<p begin="01:00:56.360" end="01:01:03.180" style="s2">subtle and a certain point they blend a</p>
<p begin="01:01:00.570" end="01:01:08.070" style="s2">certain point you&#39;ll see that a certain</p>
<p begin="01:01:03.180" end="01:01:10.020" style="s2">point thought oh is that thought is that</p>
<p begin="01:01:08.070" end="01:01:13.200" style="s2">experience and you notice that then</p>
<p begin="01:01:10.020" end="01:01:15.900" style="s2">there&#39;s a false dichotomy as I started</p>
<p begin="01:01:13.200" end="01:01:19.080" style="s2">out with and I just thought if you need</p>
<p begin="01:01:15.900" end="01:01:21.060" style="s2">more time maybe 75 minutes or 90 minutes</p>
<p begin="01:01:19.080" end="01:01:22.860" style="s2">we can we can do that if if it works</p>
<p begin="01:01:21.060" end="01:01:24.630" style="s2">better for them how many sessions if</p>
<p begin="01:01:22.860" end="01:01:28.470" style="s2">people have a stomach for word and they</p>
<p begin="01:01:24.630" end="01:01:30.960" style="s2">have availability for it I mean I think</p>
<p begin="01:01:28.470" end="01:01:33.210" style="s2">this is good but just don&#39;t maybe</p>
<p begin="01:01:30.960" end="01:01:35.310" style="s2">schedule exactly at the hour because</p>
<p begin="01:01:33.210" end="01:01:40.770" style="s2">then I don&#39;t want to run into other</p>
<p begin="01:01:35.310" end="01:01:42.240" style="s2">people&#39;s time okay so there you go this</p>
<p begin="01:01:40.770" end="01:01:46.590" style="s2">was hard work</p>
<p begin="01:01:42.240" end="01:01:48.690" style="s2">and and I hope you enjoyed it and that</p>
<p begin="01:01:46.590" end="01:01:50.910" style="s2">that is actually meaningful and relevant</p>
<p begin="01:01:48.690" end="01:01:55.400" style="s2">and I&#39;ll see you next week thank you all</p>
